Coronavirus guidance is being updated.
Read the Prime Minister’s statement for the latest information.

This page gives you guidance on how to stay safely in Italy as a visitor.
Everyone should comply with the measures put in place in Italy to limit the spread of coronavirus (COVID-19).
Moving around in Italy
On 3 June, the Italian government relaxed some coronavirus measures restricting travel within Italy. Currently, the following measures are in place:
social distancing of 1 metre must be observed
using masks remains mandatory in enclosed public spaces (and in all public spaces in Lombardy and Piedmont)
parks have reopened and outdoor exercise is permitted, subject to social distancing
funerals have recommenced, with limited attendance. Churches can celebrate mass, weddings and baptisms
restaurants, pubs, bars, shops, hairdressers, salons and beaches have been given permission to open, as have libraries. All must have measures in place to enforce social distancing
museums and archeological sites have been given permission to open. Entry must be prebooked online
travel between Italian regions is permitted
schools are expected to remain closed until September
Regional authorities in Italy are empowered adjust these measures in keeping with local requirements; regional differences may therefore apply to the restrictions listed above.
Note that many restaurants, beach facilities and other venues are asking patrons to provide their name and contact details before using their services.
If you are a British national resident in Italy, we advise carrying proof of your residence in Italy when transiting through airports or other transport hubs.
You can find more information on measures on the Ministry of Health website (in Italian) and Frequently Asked Questions on the Ministry of Foreign Affairs website (in English).

Health
If you need medical advice or believe you have symptoms of coronavirus you should contact your local GP, your local ASL (Azienda Sanitaria Locale) or one of the regional numbers listed on the Italian Ministry of Health website before visiting a health centre.
In the case of an emergency you should call Italy’s 112 emergency number. English speaking operators are available.
For contact details for English speaking doctors, visit our list of healthcare providers.
Your emotional and mental wellbeing is important. Read guidance on how to look after your mental wellbeing and mental health.

Finance
There is a range of financial support from the government that you can access while you are unable to return due to coronavirus restrictions.
If you’re in Italy, and have exhausted all other options to cover essential living costs while you wait to return home, you could apply for an emergency loan for your living costs from the UK government. You can only apply if you normally live in the UK and you cannot return home. This last-resort option is for those most in need, and you would need to repay the loan when you are back in the UK. Apply for an emergency loan.

Help and support
If you need urgent consular assistance, contact your nearest British embassy, high commission or consulate. All telephone numbers are available 24/7.
