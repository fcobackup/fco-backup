This page reflects the UK government’s understanding of current rules for people travelling on a full ‘British Citizen’ passport, for the most common types of travel.
The authorities in Belize set and enforce entry rules. For further information, contact the embassy, high commission or consulate of the country or territory you’re travelling to. You should also consider checking with your transport provider or travel company to make sure your passport and other travel documents meet their requirements.
Entry rules in response to coronavirus (COVID-19)
Entry to Belize
All travellers aged 5 years or over (vaccinated and unvaccinated) entering Belize through the Philip Goldson International airport must present a negative COVID-19 test result from a PCR test taken within 96 hours prior to travel or from an approved rapid antigen test (home testing kits are not accepted) taken within 48 hours. If no test is presented, you must take a test on arrival at the airport for a fee of BZ$100.
Travellers entering Belize by land or sea must undertake a COVID-19 rapid antigen test administered by the Ministry of Health and Wellness at the traveller’s expense. Land and sea ports of entry are now open daily. Land ports are open from 6am to 10pm and Sea ports are open from 6am to 4pm.
If you receive a positive result on arrival, you will be required to undertake a mandatory quarantine at an approved quarantine hotel at your own expense. The Ministry of Health will monitor each case. A negative test is required as proof of recovery.
Anyone travelling from Botswana, Eswatini, Lesotho, Malawi, Mozambique, Namibia, South Africa or Zimbabwe must be vaccinated and quarantine for 10 days at a government-designated facility.
From 15 February, all foreign tourists will be required to pay BZ$36 (US$18) for Belize Travel Health Insurance – this is mandatory even if you already have personal travel insurance and helps protect against incurred medical and non-medical expenses should you test positive for COVID during your stay in Belize. It covers up to a 21 day stay; an extended coverage can be purchased if you are staying longer. It can be bought in advance via Belize Travel Insurance or upon arrival at the Philip Goldson International Airport, Santa Elena Border (Northern border) or the Belize Western border. Cruise ship passengers and crew and travellers staying in Belize for 1 day or less are exempt from this requirement.
There are no direct flights between the UK and Belize. The regulations of countries that you may pass through and / or UK requirements on travel from transit countries may affect your travel. For more information see FCDO Travel Advice on the countries through which you may travel or transit.
Protocols and procedures are subject to change at short notice. Further information is available from the Belize Tourism Board, Travel Belize or Belize Port Authority.
Demonstrating your COVID-19 status
Belize has not yet confirmed that it will accept the UK’s proof of COVID-19 recovery and vaccination record. You should follow the entry rules for unvaccinated people. Your NHS appointment card from vaccination centres is not designed to be used as proof of vaccination.
Regular entry requirements
Visas
British nationals do not need a visa to enter Belize. On arrival, you’ll be allowed to enter for one month. Any extension to remain in the country will incur a fee of BZD$200 for each month’s extension.
Passport validity
Your passport should be valid for a minimum period of 6 months from the date of entry into Belize.
Yellow fever certificate requirements
Check whether you need a yellow fever certificate by visiting the National Travel Health Network and Centre’s TravelHealthPro website.
UK Emergency Travel Documents
UK Emergency Travel Documents are accepted for entry, airside transit and exit from Belize.
Travelling with children
Single parents or adults travelling with children under the age of 18 are required to provide notarised documentary evidence of parental responsibility, or consent to travel from those with parental responsibility. Such documentation is often required before being allowed to enter Belize and, in some cases, before permitting children to leave the country.
Departure tax
When leaving by air the departure tax is BZD$111 or US$50, though it’s often included in the air fare. Make sure you have enough cash with you, as it isn’t always possible to pay by card.
When leaving by land the departure tax is BZD$40 or US$20, which must be paid in cash.
