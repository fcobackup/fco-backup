Hurricane Beryl
A major hurricane made landfall on the islands of Carriacou and Petite Martinique on 1 July 2024, significantly impacting services and causing widespread destruction. If you plan to travel to either island, please check with your agent and/or accommodation provider as ongoing disruptions to services exist due to broader relief and reconstruction efforts. On the main island of Grenada, all services are back to normal.
You should follow and monitor local and international weather updates from the US National Hurricane Center and follow the advice of local authorities, including any evacuation orders. See Extreme weather and natural disasters
