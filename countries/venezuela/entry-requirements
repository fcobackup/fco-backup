This page has information on travelling to Venezuela.
This page reflects the UK government’s understanding of current rules for people travelling on a full ‘British Citizen’ passport from the UK, for the most common types of travel.
The authorities in Venezuela set and enforce entry rules. If you’re unsure how Venezuela’s entry requirements apply to you, contact its UK embassy, high commission or consulate.
All travellers
From 4 May 2023, all COVID-19 specific entry requirements are suspended. Venezuela no longer requires any proof of vaccination, a negative test result nor a COVID-19 recovery certificate to enter the country, regardless of your vaccination status.
All travellers are still required to complete a Passenger Locator Form (Formulario de Localización de Pasajero) upon arrival at port of entry.
Transiting through Venezuela on your way to another country is permitted. See Check your passport and travel documents before you travel below.
For further information about transiting through Venezuela please contact your airline or tour operator.
Check your passport and travel documents before you travel
If you’re visiting Venezuela, your passport should be valid for at least 6 months beyond the day you plan to leave Venezuela.
If you’re a resident in Venezuela, your passport must be valid at the time of your arrival. Your residence visa/permit must also be valid.
Check with your travel provider to make sure your passport and other travel documents meet their requirements.
Visas
If you’re arriving by air, you can enter for up to 90 days on a tourist card issued on arrival. You must have a valid return ticket. If you’re arriving overland or by sea, you may need to get a visa in advance depending on your specific travel circumstances. Please contact your nearest Venezuelan Embassy or Consulate for advice.
If you are overstay the 90 days you may be arrested and fined when departing. Extensions of up to 90 days can be arranged at any SAIME (immigration service) for a fee but you must apply before your tourist card and stamp expire. If you are living in Venezuela, the only place where you can apply for or extend your residency permit is the main regional SAIME office of the state where you are living in. Avoid companies offering residency permits as they may not be genuine.
Dual nationality
Any dual national Venezuelan citizens must use their Venezuelan identity documents to enter and leave the country. The authorities may not allow you to depart Venezuela otherwise.
Travelling with children
Children travelling unaccompanied, with a guardian, or with one parent must provide a travel permit from the non-travelling parent(s) confirming that they consent for the child to travel without them. This permit must include all the relevant travel details and must be obtained through the nearest local SAREN office, or the respective Court for Children and Adolescents.
If the child is resident overseas, the travel permit must be obtained through the nearest Venezuelan Embassy or Consulate.
The child should carry this travel permit while travelling within the country and also at time of departure from Venezuela. Children may be denied exit from the country otherwise.
