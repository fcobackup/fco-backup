Coronavirus travel health
Check the latest information on risk from COVID-19 for Norway on the TravelHealthPro website
See the TravelHealthPro website for further advice on travel abroad and reducing spread of respiratory viruses during the COVID-19 pandemic.
Entry and borders
See Entry requirements to find out what you will need to do when you arrive in Norway.
Returning to the UK
When you return, you must follow the rules for entering the UK.
You are responsible for organising your own COVID-19 test, in line with UK government testing requirements. You should contact local authorities for information on testing facilities.
Be prepared for your plans to change
No travel is risk-free during COVID. Countries may further restrict travel or bring in new rules at short notice, for example due to a new COVID-19 variant. Check with your travel company or airline for any transport changes which may delay your journey home.
If you test positive for COVID-19, you may need to stay where you are until you test negative. You may also need to seek treatment there.
Plan ahead and make sure you:
can access money
understand what your insurance will cover
can make arrangements to extend your stay and be away for longer than planned
Travel in Norway
The Norwegian Government regularly monitors the risk of coronavirus, and adjusts measures in line with the levels of infection to contain the spread of the virus.
Please see guidance available online from Helsenorge for the latest information on domestic restrictions. If you do travel, check the website of the municipality (kommune) you are visiting as restrictions and recommendations between regions can vary.
See also the Norwegian Government’s coronavirus website for more detail.
Norway will accept the UK’s proof of COVID-19 recovery and vaccination record that contains a verifiable QR code at the border. Scottish travellers must have the latest version of the Scottish certification, which includes the verifiable QR code. If you are travelling with a printed PDF proof of vaccination status, it must date from 1 November to ensure that the certificate can be scanned successfully, if domestic certification is required. Your NHS appointment card from vaccination centres is not designed to be used as proof of vaccination and should not be used to demonstrate your vaccine status.
Healthcare in Norway
The Norwegian Institute of Public Health (Folkehelseinstituttet) website has a dedicated English language page on the coronavirus providing updates and guidance. There are also two coronavirus hotlines (open Monday-Friday, 08.30-15.30) on +47 815 55 015 for general enquiries and +47 116 117 if you believe you have been infected.

COVID-19 vaccines if you live in Norway
Wherever possible British nationals should aim to be vaccinated in the country where they live. We will update this page when the Government of Norway announces new information on the national vaccination programme. You can sign up to get email notifications when this page is updated.
The Norway national vaccination programme started in December 2020 and is currently using the Pfizer-BioNTech, Janssen and Moderna vaccines. British nationals over the age of 12 resident in Norway, are eligible for vaccination as per a set priority order. The Norwegian authorities have issued guidance on vaccine rollout in Norway. You should log into the national health portal to find out how you will get the vaccine. The council linked to your residence should have sent out an SMS as part of the vaccine programme. If you have not received an SMS, please check with your ‘kommune’.
Find out more, including about vaccines that are authorised in the UK or approved by the World Health Organisation, on the COVID-19 vaccines if you live abroad.
If you’re a British national living in Norway, you should seek medical advice from your local healthcare provider. Information about COVID-19 vaccines used in the national programme where you live, including regulatory status, should be available from local authorities.
If you receive your COVID-19 vaccination in Norway, you can get an EU Digital COVID Certificate from the national authorities. The Certificate proves that you have been vaccinated against COVID-19, received a negative test result, or recovered from COVID-19. It will help facilitate your travel within the EU and, in some countries, you can use it to demonstrate your COVID-19 status to businesses and other organisations. For further information visit the European Commission’s EU Digital COVID Certificate page.
