This page reflects the UK government’s understanding of current rules for people travelling on a full ‘British Citizen’ passport, for the most common types of travel.
The authorities in Ireland set and enforce entry rules. For further information contact the embassy, high commission or consulate of the country or territory you’re travelling to. You should also consider checking with your transport provider or travel company to make sure your passport and other travel documents meet requirements.
Entry rules in response to coronavirus (COVID-19) for passengers travelling to Ireland from Great Britain prior to 19 July
Passenger Locator Form
Travellers to Ireland must fill out a Passenger Locator Form. Failure to complete this form is an offence. See Irish Government guidance on completing the form online, who is exempt, and penalties for failure to submit an online form. Passenger Locator Form will be checked by their air or sea carrier before departure. Passengers may also be asked for proof of vaccination or negative PCR test. Individuals travelling from Great Britain to Ireland via Northern Ireland should also complete a Passenger Locator Form.
Pre-departure Covid-19 RT-PCR test
All passengers are required to have a negative pre-departure Reverse Transcription Polymerase Chain Reaction (RT-PCR) Covid-19 test taken within 72 hours prior to arrival in Ireland. Antigen or other test types do not meet the requirement. Arriving in Ireland without evidence of a negative/‘not-detected’ test result is an offence. Travellers may be subject to prosecution and will be required to enter and pay for mandatory hotel quarantine.
You will be asked to show evidence of this test result before boarding the aircraft or ferry from your point of origin, and will be denied boarding if you cannot produce this evidence. On arrival, you will have to provide this evidence to Irish immigration officers. Written confirmation of your test result should be retained for at least 14 days.
See the list of private providers of COVID-19 testing in the UK for the purposes of international travel. A list of exemptions for people who do not need a pre-departure RT-PCR test is listed on the Irish Government website.
Children between the ages of 7 and 17 travelling to Ireland must have a negative RT-PCR test, even when accompanied by fully vaccinated or recovered adults. Children aged 6 and under do not need to take a RT-PCR test prior to travelling to Ireland.
Post-arrival quarantine requirements
All passengers arriving in Ireland from Great Britain must quarantine at home for 14 days, with limited exceptions. This is a legal requirement. The period of home quarantine can be shortened following a negative PCR test after 5 days – see Irish Government guidance on how to book and take your free PCR test. You should retain the written confirmation of your negative test results for at least 14 days.
Travellers whose journey originates in Northern Ireland are outside the scope of quarantine schemes unless they have been overseas during the 14 days prior to arrival in Ireland.
Entry rules in response to coronavirus (COVID-19) for passengers travelling to Ireland from Great Britain after 19 July
From 19 July, travellers arriving in Ireland from Great Britain, should follow the Irish Government guidance for travellers arriving from non-EU/EEA countries.
Passenger Locator Form
Travellers to Ireland must fill out a Passenger Locator Form. Failure to complete this form is an offence. See Irish Government guidance on completing the form online, who is exempt, and penalties for failure to submit an online form. Passenger Locator Form will be checked by their air or sea carrier before departure. Passengers may also be asked for proof of vaccination or negative PCR test. Individuals travelling from Great Britain to Ireland via Northern Ireland should also complete a Passenger Locator Form.
Travelling when fully vaccinated
No travel-related testing or quarantine will be necessary for travellers from the UK with valid proof of full vaccination. On arrival in Ireland, fully vaccinated passengers travelling from Great Britain will need to have proof of their full vaccination, for example showing their NHS App Covid Pass, a vaccination status letter or their NHS vaccine paper card.
Children under the age of 12 will not need to take a PCR test prior to travelling to Ireland.
For more information on the Irish Government’s definition of fully vaccinated, see the Irish Government website.
Travelling when not fully vaccinated
Passengers without proof of full vaccination will still require evidence of a pre-departure negative RT-PCR test result within 72 hours prior to arrival in Ireland and will have to quarantine at home for 14 days. This can be reduced to a minimum of 5 days with a negative PCR test which will be provided by the Health Service Executive in Ireland from day 5 after arrival. This is also the case for children aged 12 and over.
Designated High-Risk Countries: Mandatory Hotel Quarantine
Travel to Ireland from specific countries designated as ‘high risk’ is now subject to mandatory hotel quarantine. Travellers arriving from the UK are not currently subject to these requirements, unless they have been in a designated high-risk country in the preceding 14 days, even if they only transited through one of these countries and even if they remained airside.
The list of designated states may change at short notice and passengers are required to check the list before travelling to Ireland.
See further information about mandatory hotel quarantine, including information on how to pre-book, costs, a list of exempted categories, and further Q&A material.
Emergency brake
Irish authorities may also implement an ‘emergency brake’ mechanism to certain countries, coordinated at EU level, which will require additional checks. Travellers should check Irish Government advice before they travel
EU Digital Covid Certificates
From the 19 July, Ireland will implement the EU Digital Covid Certificate. If you are travelling to Ireland from the EU/EEA please see the Irish Government website for further details.
Regular entry requirements
ID
Ireland, along with the UK, is a member of the Common Travel Area. British nationals travelling from the UK don’t need a passport to visit Ireland. However, Irish immigration officers will check the ID of all passengers arriving by air from the UK and may ask for proof of nationality, particularly if you were born outside the UK. You are therefore advised to take your British passport with you.
For more information about the types of ID you might be asked to present, see the website of the Ireland Citizens Information Board.
Before travelling, check with your carrier about their ID requirements, as most airlines and other transport providers won’t carry passengers to and from Ireland unless they’ve seen satisfactory photographic ID.
Passport validity
If you’re using a passport to enter Ireland, it should be valid for the proposed duration of your stay; you don’t need any additional period of validity on your passport beyond this.
UK Emergency Travel Documents
UK Emergency Travel Documents (ETDs) are accepted for entry into, transit through, and exit from Ireland.
