The information on this page covers the most common types of travel and reflects the UK government’s understanding of the rules currently in place. Unless otherwise stated, this information is for travellers using a full ‘British Citizen’ passport.
The authorities in the country or territory you’re travelling to are responsible for setting and enforcing the rules for entry. If you’re unclear about any aspect of the entry requirements, or you need further reassurance, you’ll need to contact the embassy, high commission or consulate of the country or territory you’re travelling to.
You should also consider checking with your transport provider or travel company to make sure your passport and other travel documents meet their requirements.
Entry rules in response to coronavirus (COVID-19)
Entry to Mozambique
Entry to Mozambique is prohibited except for Mozambican nationals and foreign nationals with a valid residency visa for Mozambique. All other visas issued prior to 1 April 2020 have been cancelled. It is not possible to obtain a visa on arrival in Mozambique.
From 20 August, if you are holder of a valid visa, a temporary stay visa, or a ‘DIRE’ identification and residency documents for foreigners, you will not need to obtain prior permission from authorities to enter or leave Mozambique.
Screening on arrival
All travellers must present proof of a negative COVID-19 PCR (polymerase chain reaction) test issued in their departure country in the 72 hours prior to travel.
Testing on arrival
You may be tested for COVID-19 on your arrival in Mozambique.
Quarantine requirements
You’ll need to quarantine in your own accommodation for 10 days after arrival in Mozambique. If you’ve been in contact with someone who has COVID-19, your self-isolation period increases to 14 days. If you do not have the means to pay for a COVID-19 test, you’ll need to self-isolate for 14 days.
Data collection
All arriving passengers are required to provide their contact details to the Mozambican authorities.
Extension to visas
The state of emergency, which was previously in force, extended visas until 30 September 2020. You’ll now need to apply for an extension of stay if your permission runs out on or after that date. All applicants must make an appointment in order to apply for the extension. You can make an appointment on the government website, or alternatively you can contact SENAMI on 90243 from 7:30am to 3:30pm, or make an appointment in person at your provincial immigration office. Further information is available on the Mozambican government website.
Regular entry requirements
Visas
You will need a visa to enter Mozambique. If you’re a tourist or travelling for work purposes from a country where there is a Mozambican diplomatic mission, you must get the appropriate visa before travelling.
In summer 2017, Mozambique introduced the possibility for tourists to buy visas at border posts. However, border visas should be considered an exception, not standard practice; they’re intended for visitors originating in countries where there is no Mozambican diplomatic mission to issue visas. If you’re travelling from a country where there is Mozambican diplomatic or consular representation (such as the UK), you should continue to apply for a visa before travelling. If you intend to ask for a border visa on arrival, you should be ready to explain clearly why you didn’t get a visa before travelling.
You must present on entry a return air ticket (for air travellers) and either an invitation from family / friends or a confirmed hotel reservation.
You can apply for a visa at the High Commission of the Republic of Mozambique, 21 Fitzroy Square, London W1T 6EL, telephone: + 44 (0)20 7383 3800.
Passport validity
Your passport should be valid for a minimum period of 6 months from the date your visa for Mozambique was issued, and have at least two blank pages.
UK Emergency Travel Documents
UK Emergency Travel Documents (ETDs) are accepted for entry into, transit through and exit from Mozambique as long as they have a minimum of 6 months’ validity and a valid entry visa.
Yellow fever certificate requirements
Check whether you need a yellow fever certificate by visiting the National Travel Health Network and Centre’s TravelHealthPro website.
Border formalities
It can take a long time to clear border formalities at the Lebombo/Ressano Garcia land crossing with South Africa, especially during holiday periods and if you are travelling on public transport. Allow adequate time to arrive at your destination before nightfall. This and other land borders are currently closed except to essential freight traffic.
Travelling with children via a South African airport
If you’re transiting through a South African airport with children, check travel advice for South Africa for information and advice about the documents you’ll need to carry.
