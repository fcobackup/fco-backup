Medical facilities in Venezuela vary widely in quality. In large cities, private clinics provide acceptable quality care for routine treatments but are vulnerable to acute shortages of medical supplies and medicines. More complex treatments may require evacuation. Make sure you have adequate travel health insurance and accessible funds to cover the cost of any medical treatment abroad and repatriation. Public health facilities are poor, with frequent shortages of medicines and funding. Ambulance services in remote areas are unreliable and hospitals often lack adequate medical supplies and equipment.
The Venezuelan Pharmaceutical Federation has reported that there is a shortage of 80% of medical supplies due to the economic crisis. Make sure you bring enough medication for your stay including extra medication in case your return is unexpectedly delayed. If you need emergency medical assistance during your trip dial 911 from a landline or a mobile phone; calls to this number are free of charge.
Nationwide ambulance services like Primera Respuesta and AeroAm can help you get back to Caracas or other major cities in the event of an accident.
Contact your insurance/medical assistance company promptly if you are referred to a medical facility for treatment.
