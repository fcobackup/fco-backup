Credit cards are not generally accepted in Liberia, except for a few of the main hotels, and very few outlets will accept travellers’ cheques. Several cash machines/ATMs accepting only Visa cards now operate in Monrovia, including in the two main hotels frequented by international visitors, but foreign exchange and banking facilities remain limited. Western Union and Moneygram have a number of agents in Liberia who are able to transfer money from the UK, although there are very few outside Monrovia. Bring sufficient funds, in US Dollars cash, to cover all expenses.
