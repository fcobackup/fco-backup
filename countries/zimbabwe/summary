You’re advised to exercise caution and avoid any political gatherings or demonstrations. These can be unpredictable and may turn violent. Taking photographs of members of police and armed forces personnel and of demonstrations and protests is not permitted.

Zimbabwe’s economic situation remains unpredictable. There is a shortage of physical cash and it’s currently not possible to make cash withdrawals using an international bank card. Almost all transactions are conducted in US dollars. Make sure you have enough money in US dollar notes for your visit, or check with your tour operator that card payments will be accepted. In November 2016, Zimbabwe introduced “bond notes” as legal tender. Officially these are at 1:1 parity with the US dollar and are only legal tender within Zimbabwe. Stock levels in supermarkets, including some basic commodities, are inconsistent. An increasing number of businesses, including some medical providers, will only accept US dollars in cash, rather than credit or debit cards. See Money
