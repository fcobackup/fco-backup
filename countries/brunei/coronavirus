Coronavirus lockdown
Brunei has been in lockdown since 7 August 2021 with a daily curfew between 8pm and 4am. This will be shortened to 10pm and 4am from Friday 19 November. You will need to apply for a special authorisation letter from the Prime Minister’s Office to leave home during this time.
The Ministry of Health announced a de-escalation plan as part of its National COVID-19 Recovery Framework. Effective from Friday, 19 November 2021, places of worship and commercial premises (including restaurants, cafes and sports facilities) will be partially reopened. Higher education institutions are allowed to open to fully vaccinated students and school staff. School for Primary and Secondary levels will be conducted online during this de-escalation period. Mass gathering of up to 200 people or 50 percent capacity (whichever is lower) is allowed with strict COVID-19 regulations in place. Families of up to 30 people can hold gatherings at home.
Only fully vaccinated members of the public will be allowed to gather as a family, and enter public premises and government offices. Brunei will accept the UK’s proof of COVID-19 recovery and vaccination record. Your NHS appointment card from vaccination centres is not designed to be used as proof of vaccination and should not be used to demonstrate your vaccine status.
You should expect to have your temperature taken, electronically, and must check-in to business premises and government offices using the BruHealth app.
Masks are mandatory for everyone over 2 years old when in public places, but may be removed when you are drinking or eating, or if you are alone. There are financial penalties for not adhering to masks guidelines.
British people travelling should check the Brunei Ministry of Health and the Prime Ministers Office websites for up to date guidance, policy on travel to/from Brunei and details on how to download and use the BruHealth app.

Be prepared for your plans to change
No travel is risk-free during COVID. Countries may further restrict travel or bring in new rules at short notice, for example due to a new COVID-19 variant. Check with your travel company or airline for any transport changes which may delay your journey home.
If you test positive for COVID-19, you may need to stay where you are until you test negative. You may also need to seek treatment there.
Plan ahead and make sure you:
can access money
understand what your insurance will cover
can make arrangements to extend your stay and be away for longer than planned
