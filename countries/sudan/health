Other health risks
Malaria cases have increased in Khartoum. Due to the increased risk from malaria, and the impact of the current civil unrest on health services, the UK Health Security Agency now recommends that all travellers in Sudan, including Khartoum, take antimalarial chemoprophylaxis.
If you have recently left Khartoum, and develop fever or flu-like symptoms, you should seek urgent medical attention and tell them that you have recently left a malarial risk area.
See the Travel Health Pro website for more information about malaria. Sudan’s Ministry of Health has announced an outbreak of vaccine-derived poliovirus (cVDPV). Cases have been reported in the following States: Blue Nile, Gezira, Red Sea, West Darfur and East Darfur. Further information on this outbreak is available on the TravelHealthPro website as well as vaccination recommendations.
Sudan is prone to seasonal disease outbreaks, including Malaria, Chikungunya and dengue haemorrhagic fever spread by both insect vectors and contaminated water. Further information can be found on the TravelHealthPro website.
Medical treatment
