There is a military conflict ongoing in Ethiopia. Military clashes are now occurring in Tigray, Amhara and Afar regional states. The conflict may escalate and spread quickly and with little warning.
The deterioration in the political and security situation means that the consular support the British Embassy can provide is likely to be very limited. Given the rapidly changing situation in Ethiopia, some staff and dependents in the British Embassy Addis Ababa have been temporarily withdrawn. If you need urgent help, call +251 (0)11 617 0100. If you experience technical difficulties or if you are in the UK call +44 (0)20 7008 5000.
You should leave Ethiopia now via commercial routes. Currently, there are commercial flights to most destinations from Addis Ababa Bole International Airport, with most domestic flights operating normally (except Semera, Dessie, Weldiya and Tigray). There are no plans for a UK run charter flights. Do not rely on the FCDO being able to evacuate you in an emergency.
Ethiopian residents should ensure that their IDs/proof of residency are in order and carried on their person at all times, including when departing from Addis Ababa Bole International Airport. If your ID/residency has expired or will expire within the next 3 months, you should visit the main Immigration Office in Arat Kilo, Addis Ababa to renew it before you leave the country, or hand in your ID/residency and seek an exit visa from the main Immigration Office.
If you choose not to leave, you should be prepared to shelter in a place of safety, with essential provisions, essential phone numbers, including the British Embassy +251 (0)11 617 0100 and subscribe to FCDO travel advice email alerts. Ensure that your family or friends are aware of your location and your plans.
If you are in the vicinity of military activity and you cannot leave safely, you should stay indoors, away from windows and remain alert to developments that would enable you to leave safely.
Addis Ababa Bole International Airport is a transit hub for flights across Africa and these flights continue to operate safely at this time. All travellers from red-listed countries must book their managed quarantine package for arrival in the UK before their first point of departure travel. British nationals flying from red-listed countries without the correct quarantine booking have been denied onward travel to the UK while transiting Bole International airport. Our ability to provide Consular assistance at Bole airport may be limited.
On 2 November, a nationwide State of Emergency was declared, with further directives being added since that date. Public meetings and demonstrations are banned. Movement without ID is restricted. Curfews and roadblocks may be introduced with little or no warning. There is an enhanced security presence. Publication of any military activity or views on the conflict that dissent from the Federal Government’s view, including by social media, is banned. Travellers are advised to monitor local news and social media closely and comply with instructions from the authorities. You should carry copies of your identification at all times. You should avoid large gatherings and demonstrations.
The nationwide State of Emergency provides the police with greater powers to arrest and to search property. You should be aware that the police are using these powers where there are security threats or where there is a concern about an individual’s support to banned groups. Those of Tigrayan or Oromo ethnicity may face increased scrutiny, although this power could affect all people, including at the airport and through direct police operations. You should comply with the law, including on carrying ID cards, possession of foreign currency and possession of weapons. You should avoid confrontation and follow the instructions of the authorities. See Addis Ababa

There are frequent incidences of civil unrest in Ethiopia, including protests and strikes. Some of these can cause temporary closure of roads, internet and mobile networks or disruption to local businesses and transport. In the past some protests have escalated into serious violence.

Terrorists are likely to try to carry out attacks in Ethiopia. Attacks could be indiscriminate, including in places visited by foreigners. You should be vigilant at all times, especially in crowded areas and public places like transport hubs, hotels, restaurants, bars and places of worship and during major gatherings like religious or sporting events. There is a threat of kidnapping in Ethiopia’s Somali region, and on the southern border with Kenya, particularly in the eastern areas to which the FCDO advise against all travel. See Terrorism
