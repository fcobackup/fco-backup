This page has information on travelling to Liberia.
This page reflects the UK government’s understanding of current rules for people travelling on a full ‘British Citizen’ passport from the UK, for the most common types of travel.
The authorities in Liberia set and enforce entry rules. If you’re unsure how Liberia’s entry requirements apply to you, contact its UK embassy, high commission or consulate.
All travellers
With effect from 17 May 2023, travellers to Liberia do not require a COVID-19 vaccination certificate or a negative COVID-19 test result.
Check your passport and travel documents before you travel
Passport validity
Your passport should be valid for the proposed duration of your stay. No additional period of validity beyond this is required.
If you’re intending to live in Liberia, you will need to register with the Liberian Immigration Service (LIS), Airfield New Road, Sinkor Monrovia. Visitors do not need to register with the LIS.
Contact your travel provider or embassy of the country you are visiting if you think that your passport does not meet both these requirements. Renew your passport if you need to.
Visas
British nationals need a visa to enter Liberia. You can get a visa from the Embassy of the Republic of Liberia in London.
If you are unable to leave Liberia and your visa is due to expire, you must apply for an extension. The maximum extension period is 60 days. It is only possible to extend your visa once. To apply for an extension in Monrovia, you should visit the Immigration Office at Gbarngaye’s Town, 24th Street, Sinkor. The office is open 9am to 3pm, Monday to Friday. You should ask for the Registration Section.
You must bring your passport and pay a fee of US$25. If you are staying outside Montserrado County, you should contact your local Immigration Office to seek a visa extension authorised by the Immigration County Commander. If you have already extended your visa once and it is due to expire, you must apply for a residence permit. In this case, please contact the British Embassy for advice by emailing Monrovia.GeneralEnquiries@fcdo.gov.uk.
