The Foreign and Commonwealth Office (FCO) advise against all travel to:
Palestinian refugee camps
within 5km of the border with Syria
the Hermel Area, including the towns of Arsal, Ras Baalbek, Qaa, Laboué and Nahlé
The FCO advise against all but essential travel to the rest of Lebanon.
Cases of coronavirus (COVID-19) have been confirmed in Lebanon. The following restrictions are in place:
On 15 March, the Lebanese authorities announced that as of 19 March Lebanon’s borders will close, including Beirut Rafic Hariri airport. There will therefore be no routes in or out of Lebanon for British nationals from this date. The decision will be reviewed on 29 March. Those with Lebanese nationality, Lebanese residency or who are a member of a family of a Lebanese national should contact their nearest Lebanese Embassy.
Previous to this, following a circular from the Directorate General for Civil Aviation on 12 March, entry into Lebanon by travellers who have recently visited the UK (and several other countries) was suspended. As a result direct flights to and from the UK are also suspended. Those who have recently been in affected countries may, on arrival in Lebanon, be required to spend 14 days in self-isolation or turned around at the border, or be denied boarding a plane if transiting to Lebanon via a third country.
British nationals may be able to travel from Lebanon back to the UK (and other destinations) via third countries up to 18 March, before Beirut Rafic Hariri airport closes on 19 March. However, restrictions on flights from Lebanon, and travel restrictions in other countries, may prevent this. Changes to restrictions to entry and exit requirements in third countries, and flight options, are likely to change at short notice.
The Lebanese authorities have in addition announced a lock-down in Lebanon. This will be reviewed on 29 March. As a result:
Individuals must remain at home. Public and private gatherings are banned;
Public departments, municipalities, unions, universities, public and private schools, and nurseries are closed, with the exception of core institutions, including security agencies, hospitals, pharmacies and banks (though ATMs and electronic transfers are functioning);
All private companies and stores are closed, with the exception of bakeries, supermarkets, and haulage companies.

Protests which began on 17 October 2019 are ongoing. The protests have centred on Beirut and Tripoli, but have occurred at various locations nationwide, often with little notice. Violent confrontations between protesters, security forces and supporters of political groups have occurred. As a result of the protests, major roads (including to and from Beirut airport) have become blocked, there have been short notice closures of banks and petrol stations, and medical supplies may become increasingly scarce. See Political situation
Following the attack on the coalition base at Taji in Iraq on 11 March, and subsequent US airstrikes, tensions may be raised across the region. There is a possibility of an increased threat against Western interests, including against UK citizens. You should remain vigilant and keep up to date with the latest developments, including via the media and this travel advice.
The security situation in parts of Lebanon can deteriorate quickly. A conflict with Israel could spark with little warning with a rapid escalation in violence. This included an exchange of fire between the militant group Hizballah and the Israeli Defence Force across the Blue Line in the South of Lebanon on 1 September 2019. See Security situation
Terrorists are very likely to try to carry out attacks in Lebanon. You should be vigilant at all times, avoid crowds and crowded places and follow the advice of the Lebanese authorities.On 3 June 2019, a suspected terrorist killed two Lebanese army soldiers and one Lebanese policeman in Tripoli. The attacker died in the subsequent operation by the Lebanese security agencies. Be particularly vigilant at this time. See Terrorism
There’s a heightened risk of terrorism against aviation. Additional security measures have been in place on flights departing from Lebanon to the UK since March 2017. You should co-operate fully with security officials.
Groups within Lebanon, including Hizballah, are proscribed under the Terrorism Act 2000 and the Terrorist Asset-Freezing Act 2010. Offences committed under the act – including funding and supporting proscribed organisations – may be liable to prosecution in the UK.
There are unexploded ordnance and land mines in many places. You should avoid travelling away from established paths, especially when hiking. This is particularly a concern in southern Lebanon. See Local travel
You can contact the emergency services by calling 112.
If you’re abroad and you need emergency help from the UK government, contact the nearest British embassy, consulate or high commission. Consular support is severely limited in parts of Lebanon where we advise against all travel and limited where we advise against all but essential travel.
The Overseas Business Risk service offers information and advice for British companies operating overseas on how to manage political, economic, and business security-related risks.
Take out comprehensive travel and medical insurance before you travel.
