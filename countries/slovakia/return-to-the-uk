British travellers in Slovakia are allowed to leave, but international airports at Bratislava, Kosice and Poprad are closed. However, we have been notified by a commercial charter company that they are arranging a flight on Tuesday 24 March from Bratislava to London. Passengers who wish to buy a ticket for this flight may do so via this link: https://www.charteradvisory.cz/flyhome/03-24-bratislava-londyn. This company is cooperating with the Slovak Ministry of Foreign Affairs enabling Slovak nationals in the UK to return to Slovakia. Please note this is NOT a UK government organised flight, and all arrangements are between passengers and the company concerned. Please note the conditions of carriage carefully. It is the operator which decides who boards and who is eligible. Anyone travelling must have appropriate and valid identity documents for the UK. We understand that seats on the flight are offered on a “first come, first served” basis.
International rail and bus services have also ceased. Taxis are no longer permitted to carry passengers.
Exit via road to Austria is currently permitted but this may change at short notice. There are restrictions on entry for most British nationals at the borders with Poland, Hungary, Czech Republic and Ukraine.
The situation may change rapidly, including in neighbouring countries. Keep up to date with travel advice for all countries you plan to travel through.
