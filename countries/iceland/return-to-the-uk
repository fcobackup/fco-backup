British nationals visiting Iceland should be aware that travel options to and from the country are now very limited due to coronavirus related disruptions. British Airways and Icelandair currently continue to fly to London Heathrow on a significantly reduced service.
This situation may change at very short notice. The Foreign and Commonwealth Office (FCO) therefore recommends that British nationals who wish to leave Iceland contact their travel operator or one of the above airlines to make arrangements to do so as soon as possible.
Easyjet, Wizzair and Jet2 have suspended all flights to Iceland until further notice. If you arrived with them, you will need to make alternative arrangements to fly back with BA or Icelandair. You should contact your original airline or your insurance provider regarding refunds.
The ferry to Denmark is also currently not accepting passengers.
