This page gives you guidance on how to stay safely in Trinidad and Tobago as a visitor, if you are unable to return to the UK.
Everyone should comply with the measures put in place in Trinidad and Tobago to limit the spread of coronavirus (COVID-19).
Moving around in Trinidad and Tobago
For information on entering Trinidad and Tobago, see Entry Requirements.
The Government has announced a phased approach to the easing of COVID-19 restrictions. On 01 June the country will move into phase three, whereby retail outlets and some businesses offering professional services will reopen. Restrictions on air travel between Trinidad and Tobago will also be lifted and hotels with outdoor facilities will be allowed to provide some degree of in-house service. Other food establishments and restaurants are providing take away and delivery services only. Beaches remain closed.
Members of the public are permitted to engage in restricted outdoors activities in groups of no more than 5. Other restrictions, including the ‘stay at home’ order for the non-essential labour force continue to apply to some categories of businesses such as hair salons and spas until 8 June.
You must wear a mask, to cover your nose and mouth, in public spaces. You should adhere to all precautionary measures put in place by the local authorities. Schools and universities are also closed until September 2020.
Travel restrictions
If you are on a yacht, do not sail or transit out of the marinas or Chaguaramas Bay. You will be intercepted by the Coast Guard and handed over to the Trinidad and Tobago Police Service. The charges are TT$50,000 fine or 6 months in jail.
Entry stamps
If you are a British national and you received an entry stamp in your passport which will expire within the period 1 March 2020 to 30 April 2020 you will be granted an extension until 22 June 2020.
You should send an email to extensions.international@gov.tt with a scanned copy of the biodata page of your passport, a copy of your last entry stamp, your address in T&T and a contact number.

The Trinidad and Tobago government has set up a COVID-19 hotline staffed by doctors. If you suspect you have any symptoms please contact the hotline on +1 868 877-WELL (9355) from Trinidad or +1 868 800-HEAL (4325) toll-free from Tobago.

Finance
There is a range of financial support from the government that you can access while you are unable to return due to coronavirus restrictions.
If you’re in Trinidad and Tobago and have exhausted all other options to cover essential living costs while you wait to return home, you could apply for an emergency loan for your living costs from the UK government. You can only apply if you normally live in the UK and you cannot return home. This last-resort option is for those most in need, and you would need to repay the loan when you are back in the UK. Apply for an emergency loan.

If you need urgent consular assistance, contact your nearest British embassy, high commission or consulate. All telephone numbers are available 24/7.
