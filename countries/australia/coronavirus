Be prepared for your plans to change
No travel is risk-free during COVID. Countries may further restrict travel or bring in new rules at short notice, for example due to a new COVID-19 variant. Check with your travel company or airline for any transport changes which may delay your journey home.
If you test positive for COVID-19, you may need to stay where you are until you test negative. You may also need to seek treatment there.
Plan ahead and make sure you:
can access money
understand what your insurance will cover
can make arrangements to extend your stay and be away for longer than planned
Travel in Australia
There are currently relatively few flights between States and Territories. If you need to travel, book in advance.
Travel between and within some States and Territories within Australia may be restricted. Restrictions can change at short notice and could disrupt travel plans. You should check individual States and Territory websites for the latest information, including on whether you need to apply for an exemption to cross borders or are needed to self-isolate on arrival.
Travelling to your international airport
Regardless of border restrictions, you may travel by air from one to another Australian State or Territory to another to transit to an international flight as long as you hold a confirmed booking for that flight. Where state borders are closed, you may need to apply for an exemption to cross borders. You will be need to stay within the airport for the duration of your transit, or if transiting overnight, you may be taken to mandatory quarantine for the duration of your transit or may need to self-isolate in a hotel.
