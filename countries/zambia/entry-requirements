The information on this page covers the most common types of travel and reflects the UK government’s understanding of the rules currently in place. Unless otherwise stated, this information is for travellers using a full ‘British Citizen’ passport.
The authorities in the country or territory you’re travelling to are responsible for setting and enforcing the rules for entry. If you’re unclear about any aspect of the entry requirements, or you need further reassurance, you’ll need to contact the embassy, high commission or consulate of the country or territory you’re travelling to.
You should also consider checking with your transport provider or travel company to make sure your passport and other travel documents meet their requirements.

Visas
British passport holders need a visa to enter Zambia. You can get a visa from the Zambian High Commission in London before you travel. Single and double entry visit visas are available on arrival at all ports of entry, but multi-entry visas are not. If you plan to get a visa on arrival, make sure you have the correct amount of cash (US dollars) with you as change may not be available. If you enter through Kenneth Kaunda International Airport you can now make payment for single and double entry visas via credit or debit card at the Zambian Immigration desks.
You should check your visa endorsement for the period of your stay in Zambia. Although you are allowed 90 days per calendar year the immigration officer will not normally endorse the full length of time upon entry and you will be required to extend the stay at the nearest immigration office.
For further information about entry requirements contact the Zambian High Commission in London at info@zambiahc.org.uk or visit Zambia Department of Immigration.
On leaving Zambia, all air passengers must pay a departure tax of US$25. Although this is normally included in the cost of an air ticket you will be asked to pay separately in Zambian Kwacha if it is not. With effect from 1 January 2011 the National Airports Corporation has added a Security Charge to all departing passengers payable at all NACL airports. The cost is US$3 per person per sector for domestic flights and US$5 per person for international flights. Fees must be paid in Kwacha but is also included in the ticket price.
Volunteer workers should get a business visa from the Zambian High Commission in London before departure. Anyone violating the immigration rules risks arrest, imprisonment and deportation. Agents claiming to be able to arrange residence and work permits from the Immigration Department may be bogus and the documents they provide may be forged.
The KAZA visa is valid for travel between Zambia and Zimbabwe and day trips into Botswana. It’s available at the international airports in Lusaka and Livingstone and at the land borders at Livingstone (Zimbabwe border) and Kazungula (Botswana border). It costs US$50 and it is valid for 30 days.
Passport validity
Your passport should be valid for a minimum period of 6 months from the date of entry into Zambia and have 2 blank pages.
UK Emergency Travel Documents
UK Emergency Travel Documents (ETDs) are accepted for entry, airside transit, and exit from Zambia. ETDs must be valid for 6 months for entry into Zambia if the holder is not a returning resident.
Dual nationals
In January 2016 a Constitution Amendment Bill was signed into Zambian law. This recognizes dual nationality. However if you enter Zambia on one passport you should depart using the same passport to avoid possible delays.
