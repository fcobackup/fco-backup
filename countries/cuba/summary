The Cuban government has taken measures to counter the spread of coronavirus in Cuba. There have been significant implications for tourists and foreign residents including restrictions of movement. Commercial and charter flights are suspended until 31 July.
The government has set out three recovery phases for the country, that will determine when and how restrictions will gradually be lifted across the Provinces. On 16 June, the government announced that all Provinces EXCEPT for Havana and Matanzas will be in phase 1 of recovery from 18 June. See Staying during coronavirus for more information. Foreign visitors will be able to take holidays in a number of Cayos (Entry Requirements) from 1 July. No date has been set for when visitors will be able to visit the rest of Cuba again. If you have a booking or want to make plans, you should be in touch with the travel agency, tour operator, airline as applicable.
The British Embassy in Havana is closed to the public. If you need emergency consular assistance you should telephone the Embassy +53 7 214 2200 and press option 2 (note there is a short time delay to connect to the officer). We are receiving an unprecedented number of calls so it may take some time to be connected. We are also receiving a high volume of email enquiries and may not be able to deal with your individual enquiry straight away.
