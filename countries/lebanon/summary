Protests which began on 17 October 2019 are ongoing. The protests have centered on Beirut and Tripoli, but have occurred at various locations nationwide and often with little notice. There has been sporadic violence including clashes between protesters, security forces and supporters of political groups. There have been some casualties including the fatal shooting of a protester in Khalde on 12 November, and dozens injured in Downtown Beirut in the evening of 14 and 15 December. You should remain vigilant, avoid protests, demonstrations and large gatherings, and keep up to date with developments via local media and this travel advice.
As a result of the protests major roads in and out of Beirut and across the country have become blocked at short notice, including the roads to and from Beirut Rafic Hariri International Airport. If you’re travelling to or from the airport, check your flight status before leaving, allow extra time for your journey and ensure that you have adequate medical supplies if required. If on your arrival roads from the airport are blocked wait there until the authorities confirm access roads are open.
Fuel stations continue to supply petrol, but there have been occasions of closures at short notice. Plan any journeys carefully, seek local advice before departing and be prepared to change plans at short notice.
Banks have been closed for long periods during the protests. While ATMs have been reliably stocked with Lebanese Pounds, and credit/debit cards continue to be accepted in most circumstances, access to US Dollars is extremely limited. You should bring US Dollars with you to Lebanon if you do not intend to use the local currency.
The security situation in parts of Lebanon can deteriorate quickly. A conflict with Israel could spark with little warning with a rapid escalation in violence. This included an exchange of fire between the militant group Hizballah and the Israeli Defence Force across the Blue Line in the South of Lebanon on 1 September 2019. See Political situation
Terrorists are very likely to try to carry out attacks in Lebanon. You should be vigilant at all times, avoid crowds and crowded places and follow the advice of the Lebanese authorities.On 3 June 2019, a suspected terrorist killed two Lebanese army soldiers and one Lebanese policeman in Tripoli. The attacker died in the subsequent operation by the Lebanese security agencies. Be particularly vigilant at this time. See Terrorism
There’s a heightened risk of terrorism against aviation. Additional security measures have been in place on flights departing from Lebanon to the UK since March 2017. You should co-operate fully with security officials.
Groups within Lebanon, including Hizballah, are proscribed under the Terrorism Act 2000. Offences committed under the act – including funding and supporting proscribed organisations – may be liable to prosecution in the UK.
There are unexploded ordnance and land mines in many places. You should avoid travelling away from established paths, especially when hiking. This is particularly a concern in southern Lebanon. See Local travel
You can contact the emergency services by calling 112.
If you’re abroad and you need emergency help from the UK government, contact the nearest British embassy, consulate or high commission. Consular support is severely limited in parts of Lebanon where we advise against all travel and limited where we advise against all but essential travel.
The Overseas Business Risk service offers information and advice for British companies operating overseas on how to manage political, economic, and business security-related risks.
Take out comprehensive travel and medical insurance before you travel.
