Coronavirus travel health
If you test positive for COVID-19 whilst in Mauritius, you will need to self-isolate for 7 days. Free tests are available at hospitals across the island. Upon completion of your isolation period, you will be allowed to resume normal activities. If you are still symptomatic after 7 days, you should inform the Domiciliary Monitoring Unit before resuming your activities.
If you come into direct contact with a person who has tested positive for COVID-19, you will not be required to self-isolate but you should follow recommended sanitary measures including wearing a mask and social distancing. Check the latest information on risk from COVID-19 for Mauritius on the TravelHealthPro website.

Be prepared for your plans to change
No travel is risk-free during COVID-19. Countries may further restrict travel or bring in new rules at short notice, for example due to a new COVID-19 variant. Check with your travel company or airline for any transport changes which may delay your journey home.
If you test positive for COVID-19, you may need to stay where you are until you test negative. You may also need to seek treatment there.
Plan ahead and make sure you:
can access money
understand what your insurance will cover
can make arrangements to extend your stay and be away for longer than planned
