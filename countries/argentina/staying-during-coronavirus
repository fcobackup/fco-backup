This page gives you guidance on how to stay safely in Argentina as a visitor, if you are unable to return to the UK.
Everyone should comply with the measures put in place in Argentina to limit the spread of coronavirus (COVID-19).
Moving around in Argentina
Argentina remains under a nationwide quarantine until midnight on 28 June. The restrictions imposed vary significantly between provinces. In the metropolitan area of Buenos Aires (including La Plata), Resistencia in the province of Chaco, the metropolitan area of Córdoba, Rawson in the province of Chubut and in Bariloche and General Roca in the province of Río Negro, you must stay in your accommodation. Anyone outside their accommodation without justification may be charged with committing a public health crime. You are, however, allowed to travel to an airport if you have a flight booked and you can make single person journeys to buy necessities, such as medicines or foodstuffs, in your local area.
In the rest of the country, free movement is now permitted within each jurisdiction, provided that social distancing rules are adhered to. Social gatherings of up to 10 people are also allowed. In most parts of Argentina, you are still required to cover your nose and mouth with a facemask or other garment whenever you go out in public.
There are various exceptions at a local level. In the city of Buenos Aires, some local businesses (such as bookshops, flower and clothes shops) have started reopening, allowing people to go out to make non-essential purchases based on the last digit of their ID card or passport. Those ending in even numbers are allowed to go out on even numbered dates and those ending in odd numbers are allowed to go out on odd numbered dates, Monday to Friday. From 8 June, you are also allowed to go out for exercise (running, walking, cycling), accompanied by just one other person, between 8pm and 8am. You do not need to cover your nose and mouth while you are exercising.
There may be additional local restrictions. For example, the government of the City of Buenos Aires has urged those over the age of 70 not to leave their homes at all during the quarantine. You should check what measures have been introduced in your location. You could be subject to a financial penalty if you do not abide by local regulations.
Visas
The 90-day permission for tourists to stay in Argentina is being extended each month by 30 days, if your original 90 days expired after 17 March. The latest extension was announced on 17 June.

Finance
There is a range of financial support from the government that you can access while you are unable to return due to coronavirus restrictions.
If you’re in Argentina, and have exhausted all other options to cover essential living costs while you wait to return home, you could apply for an emergency loan for your living costs from the UK government. You can only apply if you normally live in the UK and you cannot return home. This last-resort option is for those most in need, and you would need to repay the loan when you are back in the UK. Apply for an emergency loan.
