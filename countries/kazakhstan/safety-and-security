Terrorism
There is a high threat of terrorist attack globally affecting UK interests and British nationals, including from groups and individuals who view the UK and British nationals as targets. Stay aware of your surroundings at all times.
UK Counter Terrorism Policing has information and advice on staying safe abroad and what to do in the event of a terrorist attack. Find out how to reduce your risk from terrorism while abroad.
Terrorism in Kazakhstan
Terrorist attacks in Kazakhstan cannot be ruled out.
Attacks could be indiscriminate, including in places visited by foreigners. Be alert for any security related announcements by the Kazakh authorities.
Political situation
Public demonstrations are only permitted when authorised by the Kazakh authorities in advance. Occasional unauthorised small-scale public protests take place. This may put participants at risk of arrest. Avoid any demonstrations or political gatherings. If you become aware of any nearby violence or disturbance, leave the area immediately.
Crime
Robbery and violent crime
There have been violent thefts in expatriate communities in Atyrau and Aktau in western Kazakhstan and in Astana and Almaty. This happens mainly at night in and around local nightclubs and bars or when arriving home late at night. Robberies are uncommon in cities and rural areas but do happen.
Avoid walking alone and pre-arrange your transport. Do not use unofficial taxis or a taxi already occupied by a passenger. You should agree the price of your journey, or book the taxi via an app where you can see the price.
Protecting your belongings
Pickpocketing is very common in crowded places such as markets and on public transport. Criminals may target foreigners as they are assumed to be carrying valuable items. Keep valuables in a safe place and out of public view.
Thieves may target luggage on trains. Always lock your railway compartment on an overnight train.
Scams  
Beware of internet scams. Scammers may target you on dating apps or on visa-related websites.
Make sure you know the arrangements for you being met at the airport, and make sure the person is who they say they are.     
Drink and food spiking and sexual assault    
Drink spiking can happen in nightclubs and bars. Alcohol and drugs can reduce your vigilance, making you less in control.
Attacks, including sexual assaults, do occur. Avoid splitting up from your friends, do not leave drinks unattended and do not go off with people you do not know. Save the location of your accommodation on your maps app, so it’s easy to find. See TravelAware ‘Stick with your mates’ for tips and advice.
Laws and cultural differences
Kazakhstan has a secular constitution, but you should respect local traditions, customs, laws and religions at all times.
Be careful how you use social media. Take care of the context in which you use images so that they do not offend. Take particular care with any images that show the Kazakh flag. 
Personal ID
Carry original ID such as your driving licence or passport at all times. Police patrolling the streets may ask for your ID, and copies are not acceptable. You will be need to show your original ID to enter state buildings.
Ramadan    
Ramadan is a holy month for Muslims. The dates vary by year and country. In 2024, Ramadan will start 10 March and end 8 April. Cafés and restaurants may amend their menus, and be busy around fast-breaking (‘Iftar’). Areas around mosques are also likely to be busy around prayer times. Take particular care not to offend religious sensitivities at this time.
Alcohol laws and bans    
Shops are not allowed to sell alcohol between 11pm and 8am. Alcoholic drinks which have an alcohol content level of more than 30% cannot be sold between 9pm and 12 noon. Bars, restaurants and cafés are not affected by this.
If you are found drunk on the street by the police, they can take you to the police station, check your ID, issue you with a fine or detain you in a police cell overnight.
Smoking and e-cigarette bans 
Smoking including e-cigarettes is illegal in and near to:
schools and playgrounds
healthcare facilities
public places - museums, libraries, cinemas, sport centres, public transport, nightclubs, airports, rail stations, underpasses
cars with children travelling
The fine for smoking in an unauthorised place is around £90, and can be more if it’s a repeat offence. 
Illegal drugs and prison sentences
If you possess or use illegal drugs, you could face a lengthy prison sentence, including:
possession, manufacturing of drugs with distribution purposes – 5 to 10 years
possession, manufacturing of drug with distribution purposes in large amounts – 6 to 12 years
advertising drugs – fine or up to 3 years imprisonment
Prison conditions are basic.
Using cameras and sharing images
It is illegal to take photographs of or near military sites, border areas, airports and some official buildings. There may not be any signs warning about these restrictions. Some large shops and supermarkets do not allow photography.
Do not share or publish images that could be disrespectful to religion or culture, or national symbols. If you share or publish such images, you could get a fine or short detention depending on the situation.
LGBT+ travellers
Although same-sex relationships are not illegal, they are often not tolerated, especially outside of the major cities across the country.
Read more advice for LGBT+ travellers.
Wildlife, animal products and souvenirs 
You are not allowed to export:
art or antiques that have historical, cultural or scientific value
gold, precious stones, rare minerals
rare specimens of flora or animals
Take local expert advice.
Bringing drones into Kazakhstan
You can bring a drone to Kazakhstan without a licence. However, you must have a licence to use one. You risk a fine, detention and the confiscation of your drone if you do not have a licence. Apply for a drone licence from the Civil Aviation Committee. You should include technical characteristics of the drone and details of planned use (when, where and how long). See local regulations on drone licensing requirements (in Russian).
Transport risks
Road travel
If you are planning to drive in Kazakhstan, see information on driving abroad and Kazakhstan’s rules of the road (in Russian).
You need a 1968 international driving permit (IDP) to drive in Kazakhstan. You cannot buy an IDP outside the UK, so get one before you travel. You can buy an IDP in person from some UK post offices – find your nearest post office branch that offers this service.
The minimum legal age for driving is 16 for motorbikes and 18 for cars.
Hire car companies often have stricter requirements for their customers, such as a year of driving experience, a higher minimum age and holding an IDP.
Driving standards
Driving standards can be erratic. Many cars are not safely maintained and do not have rear seatbelts.
Many roads are poorly maintained. Roadworks and damaged roads are often not signposted. In remote rural areas, there are often stray animals on the roads. In winter, roads can be hazardous due to snow or ice.
Service stations are limited outside the main cities. Take all that you need for your journey, including water. Make sure your vehicle is properly maintained and in a good condition for long journeys.
Traffic police officers should provide you with official papers related to any alleged offence. 
Closed areas
The following areas are closed to visitors unless you have received prior permission from the Foreign Ministry, the Interior Ministry and the Kazakh National Security Committee:
Gvardeyskiy village in the Almaty region of south eastern Kazakhstan
the town of Baikonur
the districts of Karmakchi and Kazalinsk in the southern Kyzylorda region
Border crossings

Extreme weather and natural disasters
See further information about how to be prepared for extreme weather and natural hazards.
Forest fires    
Forest fires affected east Kazakhstan in 2023. Regions in the Kazakh steppe can also be affected by grass fires. Take local advice.
Flooding and mudslides
Mudslides and landslides can occur in the mountain areas of south-east Kazakhstan.
Earthquakes 
Kazakhstan has several areas which are at high risk of earthquakes. Almaty is in an active seismic zone. The last major earthquake involving loss of life was in 1927. The US Federal Emergency Management Agency has advice about what to do before, during and after an earthquake.
