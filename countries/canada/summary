Around 724,000 British nationals visit Canada each year. Most visits are trouble free.
Visitors travelling to Canada by air are now expected to get an electronic travel authorisation (eTA) to enter Canada. For more information about the eTA system, and to apply online, visit the official Canadian government website. See Entry requirements
If you’re visiting Canada you’ll need an eTA to board your flight unless you’re otherwise exempted (for example, if you have a valid Canadian visa or a permanent resident card). If you have British-Canadian dual nationality you won’t be able to apply for an eTA and you’ll need to present a valid Canadian passport to board your flight to Canada.
Terrorists are likely to try to carry out attacks in Canada. See Terrorism
Severe snow storms are a regular occurrence during winter. Monitor local news and weather reports and visit Environment Canada. See Local Travel and Natural Disasters
Hurricane Dorian is affecting parts of Atlantic Canada with strong winds and some flooding in coastal areas. Dangerous storm surge impacts are likely in portions of the gulf of St Lawrence, south western Newfoundland, and eastern Nova Scotia. Hurricane force winds are still occurring in portions of eastern Nova Scotia and are spreading into western Newfoundland. You should monitor local weather forecasts and the Canada government website and follow the advice of local authorities.
If you’re abroad and you need emergency help from the UK government, contact the nearest British embassy, consulate or high commission.
Take out comprehensive travel and medical insurance before you travel.
