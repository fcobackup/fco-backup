Terrorism  
There is a high threat of terrorist attack globally affecting UK interests and British nationals, including from groups and individuals who view the UK and British nationals as targets. Stay aware of your surroundings at all times.    
UK Counter Terrorism Policing has information and advice on staying safe abroad and what to do in the event of a terrorist attack. Find out how to reduce your risk from terrorism while abroad.
Terrorism in Madagascar 
Terrorist attacks in Madagascar cannot be ruled out. 
Terrorist attacks could be indiscriminate, including in places frequented by foreign nationals.
Political situation  
Politically linked rallies are possible. Protests, particularly in cities, can sometimes turn violent. Security forces in central Antananarivo may close roads and use tear gas in response to demonstrations. Avoid large gatherings and political demonstrations.
Crime 
Robberies and thefts are commonplace throughout Madagascar. Foreigners are targets for pickpockets and muggers.  
Beaches and islands 
There have been violent robberies and assaults even in the daytime, be aware of this risk if you visit isolated and remote beaches, especially alone. Get local advice or use an experienced travel operator when visiting any beach. This could happen in many popular coastal locations including:
Nosy Be island  
Ankify Port  
Ambanja  
beaches to the south and north of Toliara (Tuléar) 
Protecting yourself and your belongings 
To reduce the risk of street crime: 
do not walk alone in city centres or poorly lit urban areas after dark  
use pre-booked taxis or hotel transport  
be alert even in nature reserves, national parks and beaches 
be wary of people approaching you in an over-friendly manner 
be on the alert for criminals acting in pairs 
do not use your mobile or show cash while on the street 
Vehicle crime 
There are frequent armed robberies on main roads, particularly at night and outside major towns. Where possible, drive in a convoy . Either use a recognised tour operator or ask your hotel to arrange transport. Always keep car doors locked and windows closed, particularly in Antananarivo.
See regional risks to find out which roads are particularly dangerous. 
Due to the risk of robbery, avoid using multi-passenger taxi vans (‘taxi-brousses’ or ‘bush taxis’). If you’re attacked in any vehicle, do not resist or argue as the criminal could be armed. Stay calm and agree to their demands.  
If you are stopped by security personnel or police, ask for ID as there have been reports of criminals falsely claiming to be police. 
Report any incident to the police if possible. Take a copy of the police report if you need it for an insurance claim. 
Criminal kidnaps 
There have been occasional instances of criminal kidnapping for ransom in Madagascar, targeting individuals (normally Malagasy nationals) perceived to be wealthy.
When arranging business meetings use a secure location. Be aware of your surroundings and always let someone you trust know your whereabouts, especially after dark. If you are a victim of kidnapping, follow the kidnapper’s instructions.
Laws and cultural differences  
Local taboos (‘fady’)  
In many parts of Madagascar, aspects of daily life are regulated by taboos, known as ‘fady’. These vary from one region to another. Fady can range from forbidden foods to restrictions on clothing.  
If you plan to visit remote rural areas, get advice from your tour operator or a local guide. They can advise you about how to behave in certain locations.  
If you plan a longer stay in a village, first check if you should inform the head of the local authority (‘Fokontany’) and the village head or wise man (‘Ray aman-dreny’). 
Personal ID 
Always carry your passport with you, as police randomly make ID checks and do not always accept copies. Keep a copy of your passport’s photo page, visa and insurance details somewhere safe, and leave further copies with family or friends in the UK. 
Public offences 
Paying for sex is illegal. The penalty is a fine of 1,500 to 7,000 euros and possibly a prison sentence of up to 10 years.  
The law against sexual abuse of underage children (aged 17 and under) is strictly enforced, especially for incidents that involve foreign tourists. Underage sex workers may carry fake identity cards. You could be prosecuted or bribed in this situation. 
Illegal drugs and prison sentences 
Drug smuggling is a serious offence. Punishments can be severe and prison conditions are harsh and life-threatening. 
Security personnel and police 
Be alert to the possibility of over-reaction by security personnel. Avoid actions that might provoke them, such as taking photographs of them. If you’re stopped by the police, show respect and stay calm.  
LGBT+ travellers 
Same-sex sexual activity is legal among persons of at least 21 years old. However public attitudes are less tolerant than in the UK and showing affection in public may receive negative attention. 
Read more advice for LGBT+ travellers. 
Wildlife, animal products and souvenirs 
It’s illegal to collect, buy or export protected animals, plants or products made from them. This includes certain woods such as items made of rosewood. If you buy anything made of wild animal skin or shell, check with the vendor exactly what information you can give to customs if they ask for details. 
Stadiums and venues 
Security and safety standards at stadiums and venues in Madagascar may be lower than in the UK. If you go to a large-scale event, make sure you know the location of fire exits and check exit routes.
Transport risks  
Road travel  
If you are planning to drive in Madagascar, see information on driving abroad. You need to have both the correct version of the international driving permit (IDP) and your UK driving licence with you in the car.
You cannot buy an IDP outside the UK, so get one before you travel.
Road conditions vary greatly and are often poor. Many roads outside Antananarivo have steep gradients and sharp bends. Heavy freight trucks use the roads. Drive with extreme care as drivers often fail to signal and pull out sharply. Avoid driving at night as vehicles often have no lights and few roads are lit. 
In the rainy season, from December to April, many secondary roads are impassable except by 4-wheel-drive vehicles and bridges are often washed away.  
Do not stop if you’re involved in, or see, an accident. Call the police on 117 or drive to the next town and report to the police directly. 
Taxis 
There are frequent road deaths involving multi-passenger taxi vans (‘taxi-brousses’ or ‘bush taxis’).  
Use pre-booked taxis or hotel transport. If you have concerns about the safety of a vehicle or the ability of a driver, ask for a different driver.  
River and sea travel 
Armed criminals have boarded boats on the Tsiribihina River in western Madagascar and robbed the passengers. Seek alternative routes. 
Get local advice on ferries from Tamatave-Sonierana to Sainte Marie Island and the west coast (Toliara/Tuléar, Morondava, Mahajanga and Nosy Be). There have been accidents caused by overcrowding, poor maintenance, poor crew training and unexpected squalls. Check weather conditions locally before travelling. 
There is a significant risk of piracy in the Gulf of Aden and Indian Ocean. Pirates can attack up to 1,000 nautical miles from the Somali coast or more. If you’re travelling by sea, read about the regional risks at sea.
Extreme weather and natural disasters  
Cyclones 
The cyclone season in Madagascar normally runs from November to April. Coastal areas are particularly at risk. Storms can cut access to remote parts of the country and contaminate water supplies.  
Monitor local news and check World Meteorological Organization weather warnings for Madagascar, Meteo Madagascar (French) or Cyclone Océan Indien (French, Malagasy). 
Find out what you can do to prepare for and respond to cyclone warnings.
