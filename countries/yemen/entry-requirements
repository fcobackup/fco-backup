The information on this page covers the most common types of travel and reflects the UK government’s understanding of the rules currently in place. Unless otherwise stated, this information is for travellers using a full ‘British Citizen’ passport.
The authorities in the country or territory you’re travelling to are responsible for setting and enforcing the rules for entry. If you’re unclear about any aspect of the entry requirements, or you need further reassurance, you’ll need to contact the embassy, high commission or consulate of the country or territory you’re travelling to.
You should also consider checking with your transport provider or travel company to make sure your passport and other travel documents meet their requirements.
Visas
You will need a visa to enter Yemen. You must get a visa from the Yemeni Embassy in London. If you’re staying for more than 14 days you’ll need to register your passport after arrival in country with the Yemen immigration authorities.
Passport validity
Your passport should be valid for the proposed duration of your stay. No additional period of validity beyond this is required.
UK Emergency Travel Documents
The operations of the British Embassy in Sana’a have been temporarily suspended and diplomatic staff have been withdrawn. No consular assistance is therefore available in Yemen. You can contact the Foreign and Commonwealth Office at any time by calling +44 (0) 20 7008 1500.
