The Turks and Caicos Islands were severely impacted by Hurricane Irma on 7 September 2017 and the island of Grand Turk was further affected by the passing of Hurricane Maria on 22 September 2017. Commercial flights have resumed in and out of Providenciales. Shops are open and supplies are returning to normal. You should continue to follow the advice of the local authorities.
Some hotels were affected by Hurricane Irma and a number have had to close temporarily for repairs (though seasonal closures at this time of year are anyway not unusual). If you are considering travelling to the Turks and Caicos Islands, you should ensure you have made arrangements for accommodation and checked they are still available.
On Grand Turk, there was significant damage to infrastructure and communications, with many homes and buildings damaged. Power is now being restored gradually across the island. Telephony currently remains erratic and internet services are still down, but the situation is improving as utility companies work to provide services. Most hotels remain shut for repairs. You should therefore check and reconfirm your accommodation before you arrive.
