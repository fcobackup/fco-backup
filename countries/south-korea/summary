The level of tension on the Korean peninsula remains high due to a series of North Korean nuclear and missile tests, including two intercontinental ballistic missile tests in July 2017 and one in November 2017, two nuclear tests in 2016 and a nuclear test in September 2017.
Since the start of 2018, there has been a renewal of direct contact between the North and South Korean governments. But there remains a threat of further missile or nuclear tests, which could lead to further instability in the region. The level of tension and the security situation can change with little notice. Tensions usually rise around the time of the regular South Korean-US military exercises, notably those held in spring and autumn. In the past, heightened tensions haven’t affected daily life.
