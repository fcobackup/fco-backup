The Foreign, Commonwealth & Development Office (FCDO) advises against all travel to within 5km of the border with Burkina Faso.
Before you travel, check the ‘Entry requirements’ section for Togo’s current entry restrictions and requirements. These may change with little warning. Monitor this advice for the latest updates and stay in contact with your travel provider.
If you plan to pass through another country to return to the UK, check the travel advice for the country you’re transiting.
It is more important than ever to get travel insurance and check it provides sufficient cover. See the FCDO’s guidance on foreign travel insurance.
There have been sporadic marches and protests in Lomé and around the country since August 2017, over demands to restore the 1992 constitution. You should remain vigilant, avoid crowds and demonstrations, monitor local media and follow advice of local authorities. See Political situation
Terrorists are very likely to try to carry out attacks in Togo. Attacks could be indiscriminate. You should be vigilant, especially in places visited by foreigners. See Terrorism.
Consular support is limited in Togo. The Honorary Consul in Togo can offer limited consular assistance. British nationals should contact the British High Commission in Accra, Ghana who can provide consular support. See Consular Assistance.
