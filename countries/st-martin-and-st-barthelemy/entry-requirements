Coronavirus guidance is being updated.
Read the Prime Minister’s statement for the latest information.

The information on this page covers the most common types of travel and reflects the UK Government’s understanding of the rules currently in place. Unless otherwise stated, this information is for travellers using a full ‘British Citizen’ passport. The authorities in the country or territory you are travelling to are responsible for setting and enforcing the rules for entry.
If you’re unclear about any aspect of the entry requirements, or you need further reassurance, you will need to contact the embassy, high commission or consulate of the country or territory you’re travelling to. You should also consider checking with your transport provider or travel company to make sure your passport and other travel documents meet their requirements.
There’s no physical border between the French and Dutch territories on the island of St Martin and people and goods may travel freely between the two sides of the island.
Visas
If your passport describes you as a British Citizen, you will not need a visa to enter St Martin or St Barthélemy. Other British passport holders should check the current entry requirements on the website of the French Ministry of Foreign Affairs, and if necessary confirm with the nearest French diplomatic mission.
The current visa exemptions in place for British Citizen and British Overseas Territories Citizen passport holders travelling to St Martin from Anguilla will be unaffected by the UK leaving the European Union with or without a deal as these rules are not dependent upon the UK’s membership of the EU. However, if the UK leaves the EU without a deal, the current visa policy for British Citizen passport holders travelling to St Martin and/or St Barthélemy from other destinations may change. We are working with the relevant authorities to clarify entry requirements and this page will be updated as soon as further information is available. If you would like more details in the meantime, or want to discuss a specific issue, you should consult the French Embassy in London.
Passport validity
Your passport should be valid for the proposed duration of your stay. No additional period of validity beyond this is required.
Yellow fever certificate requirements
Check whether you need a yellow fever certificate by visiting the National Travel Health Network and Centre website.
UK Emergency Travel Documents
UK Emergency Travel Documents (ETDs) are accepted for entry, airside transit and exit from St Martin and St Barthélemy.
