All passengers and airline crew need to complete an Immigration Arrival Card when arriving in the Maldives.
Temperature checks and screening procedures will be in place on arrival. Quarantine facilities have been set up to isolate any suspected cases of COVID-19. Travellers presenting symptoms of COVID-19 upon arrival will be subjected to a PCR test at the traveller’s cost or at the cost of the tourist facility where the traveller is booked to stay in the Maldives. Additionally, local health authorities may conduct random testing, at no cost to travellers.
Travellers recently recovered from Covid-19
Travellers who recently recovered from COVID-19 (previous infection within 60 days prior to date of departure) and got a positive PCR result from the sample tested for travel, must also present the documentation of recovery from COVID-19.

Quarantine requirements
All non-tourist passengers travelling from the UK (includes 12-hour transit) to the Maldives (such as residents, work visa holders and returning students) that have completed two doses of vaccination will need to provide a negative PCR test taken no more than 96 hours before departure, and are not required to quarantine on arrival. Those who have not completed vaccinations will need to self-isolate for 14 days and register on the Haalubelun portal. After completing the quarantine, you must take an exit test.
Children under the age of one do not have to provide a negative PCR test.
These requirements do not apply to tourists and the government has said it has no plans to quarantine tourists on arrival.
Demonstrating your COVID-19 status
Maldives will accept the UK’s proof of COVID-19 vaccination record. The recovery certificate is not generally accepted at the border. Those seeking to travel with the recovery certificate or COVID-19 recovery passes must seek prior approval from the Maldives Health Protection Authority. Even with an approved recovery certificate, you still need to take a PCR test no more than 96 hours before your departure. Your NHS appointment card from vaccination centres is not designed to be used as proof of vaccination and should not be used to demonstrate your vaccine status.
