Don’t get involved with drugs of any kind. Although Denmark is generally a liberal society, drug use is illegal and laws are enforced. You will not be treated more leniently than residents. Drug dealers can receive heavy sentences. Anyone found in possession of illegal drugs deemed to be for personal consumption will often receive a police fine or a short prison sentence.
Homosexuality is legal and Danish law allows same sex marriages.
Whale meat is available in The Faroe Islands but importing it into the UK/EU is illegal under the Convention on International Trade in Endangered Species. Any importation of whale meat to the UK/EU will result in seizure of the goods, possibly a fine of up to £5,000 and a custodial sentence.
