There are currently extremely limited commercial options available to return to the UK from Romania. Direct flights between Romania and the UK have been suspended as of 2300 on Sunday 5 April. Transiting via other European countries may still be an option, but flight schedules are changing rapidly. Check with airlines for up to date information.
Limited passenger transit across or through Romania by land may be possible. If you are considering this option please contact the Embassy.
If you live in the UK and are currently visiting Romania, you’re strongly advised to return now by commercial means. Don’t run the risk of getting stranded.
UK special charter flights will only operate for priority countries where commercial flights are not possible. You should not assume that these flights will become available in countries where commercial routes are operating. Please do not contact the contracted travel management company if no flight is advertised here.
We know the suspension of flights is concerning for British people trying to leave Romania. The UK government is working closely with airlines, the Romanian authorities and other governments to make sure options are available for you to return to the UK as soon as possible.
What to do
If you cannot leave Romania at this time, you should:
follow the advice of local authorities, including local measures to help minimise your risk of exposure to coronavirus
find accommodation that’s suitable for your needs.
keep in regular contact with family and friends at home, so they know you are safe and well
