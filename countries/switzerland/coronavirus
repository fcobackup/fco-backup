Coronavirus travel health
Check the latest information on risk from COVID-19 for Switzerland on the TravelHealthPro website.
See the TravelHealthPro website for further advice on travel abroad and reducing spread of respiratory viruses during the COVID-19 pandemic.
It is compulsory to wear a facemask on all flights to and from Switzerland. Some travel operators such as airlines may specify types of masks to be worn on board e.g. surgical masks, and may encourage you to take spares for long journeys. Please check with your travel operator before travelling.
Entry and borders
See Entry requirements to find out what you will need to do when you arrive in Switzerland.
Returning to the UK
When you return, you must follow the rules for entering the UK.
You are responsible for organising your own COVID-19 test, in line with UK government testing requirements. You should contact local authorities for information on testing facilities.
Neighbouring countries may introduce restrictions at borders and conduct health checks. Check the travel advice for any country you need to travel to or through. See our Travel Advice for France and Germany for the latest rules for transiting those countries from/to Switzerland.
Be prepared for your plans to change
No travel is risk-free during COVID. Countries may further restrict travel or bring in new rules at short notice, for example due to a new COVID-19 variant. Check with your travel company or airline for any transport changes which may delay your journey home.
If you test positive for COVID-19, you may need to stay where you are until you test negative. You may also need to seek treatment there.
Plan ahead and make sure you:
can access money
understand what your insurance will cover
can make arrangements to extend your stay and be away for longer than planned
Travel in Switzerland
Switzerland has put measures in place to limit the spread of COVID-19.
You should follow the rules on hygiene and social distancing. These include:
Washing your hands regularly and thoroughly
Keeping a distance of at least 1.5 metres from other people
If it is not possible to maintain that distance, wear a face mask.
Wearing a face mask is compulsory when travelling on public transport, on platforms and in waiting areas, as well as at airports. Failure to do so is punishable by a fine. Children under the age of 12 are exempt from this requirement, as are individuals who are unable to wear a mask for medical reasons.
Cantons have imposed further restrictions, and you should check cantonal websites for further details.

COVID-19 vaccines if you live in Switzerland
Wherever possible British nationals should aim to be vaccinated in the country where they live. We will update this page when the Government of Switzerland announces new information on the national vaccination programme. You can sign up to get email notifications when this page is updated.
The Swiss national vaccination programme started in December 2020 and is using the Pfizer-BioNTech and Moderna vaccines. British nationals resident in Switzerland are eligible for vaccination. The Swiss authorities have issued their vaccination strategy on how vaccinations are organised in your canton. You can register for vaccination on the website of your canton of residence.
Find out more, including about vaccines that are authorised in the UK or approved by the World Health Organisation, on the COVID-19 vaccines if you live abroad.
If you’re a British national living in Switzerland, you should seek medical advice from your local healthcare provider. Information about COVID-19 vaccines used in the national programme where you live, including regulatory status, should be available from local authorities.
If you receive your COVID-19 vaccination in Switzerland, you can get an EU Digital COVID Certificate from the national authorities. The Certificate proves that you have been vaccinated against COVID-19, received a negative test result, or recovered from COVID-19. It will help facilitate your travel within the EU and, in some countries, you can use it to demonstrate your COVID-19 status to businesses and other organisations. For further information visit the European Commission’s EU Digital COVID Certificate page.
