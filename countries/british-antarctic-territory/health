At least 8 weeks before your trip, check the latest country-specific health advice from the National Travel Health Network and Centre (NaTHNaC) on the TravelHealthPro website. Each country-specific page has information on vaccine recommendations, any current health risks or outbreaks, and factsheets with information on staying healthy abroad. Guidance is also available from NHS (Scotland) on the FitForTravel website.
General information on travel vaccinations and a travel health checklist is available on the NHS website. You may then wish to contact your health adviser or pharmacy for advice on other preventive measures and managing any pre-existing medical conditions while youâ€™re abroad.
There are very limited medical or search and rescue facilities within the Territory. You should be aware of the harsh climatic conditions in Antarctica.
Make sure you have adequate travel health insurance that specifies Antarctica, in addition to accessible funds to cover the cost of any medical treatment abroad and repatriation.
