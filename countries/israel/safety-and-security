Warning
FCDO advises against all travel to Israel.

This travel advice covers Israel and the Occupied Palestinian Territories (OPTs).
This guide also has safety advice for regions of Israel and the OPTs.
Terrorism
There is a high threat of terrorist attack globally affecting UK interests and British nationals, including from groups and individuals who view the UK and British nationals as targets. Stay aware of your surroundings at all times.    
UK Counter Terrorism Policing has information and advice on staying safe abroad and what to do in the event of a terrorist attack. Find out how to reduce your risk from terrorism while abroad.
Terrorism in Israel and the OPTs
Terrorists are very likely to try to carry out attacks in Israel and the OPTs.
There was a large-scale terrorist attack by Hamas into southern Israel on 7 October 2023 where over 1,200 people were killed. Hamas continue to launch rockets into Israel and the Israeli Defence Forces are conducting significant military activity in Gaza.
Terrorist attacks in Israel and the OPTs are very likely to continue with an increased threat of attacks, including by individuals acting alone.
Any attacks could be indiscriminate, including places visited by foreign nationals such as:
the Old City in Jerusalem
government, military and police installations
security personnel including military and police
transport networks
businesses with western interests
crowded places
Areas where foreign nationals and tourists are known to gather may be at higher risk of attack. Stay aware of your surroundings, keep up to date with local media reports and follow the advice of local authorities.
Examples of recent significant attacks include:
In 2025:
In March, one person was killed and one person injured in a shooting attack in northern Israel
In March, one person was killed and 3 injured in a stabbing attack in Haifa
In February, one person was killed and 12 people were injured in a ramming and stabbing attack at Karkur Junction near Pardes Hana-Karkur, south of Haifa
In February, 3 bombs exploded on 3 separate busses in the Tel Aviv area. Two other buses were found with bombs which failed to explode. There were no casualties. See our Regional Risks section for further information on using public transport in Tel Aviv
In 2024:
7 people were killed in a shooting and stabbing attack in Jaffa
3 people were killed in a shooting attack at the Allenby Bridge Crossing
one person was killed and 17 injured during a ramming attack in Ra’anana
In 2023:
3 people were killed during a shooting attack in the Jordan Valley
one person was killed and 6 people injured during a car-ramming incident in Tel Aviv
one person was killed and 3 people injured in a shooting attack in Tel Aviv
7 people were killed and 3 injured during a shooting attack in Neve Yaakov, East Jerusalem
Terrorist kidnap
Terrorist kidnap is a risk in Gaza and along the border with Egypt. There is a large-scale conflict happening in areas of southern Israel close to the border with Gaza and Hamas has taken hundreds of hostages, including British nationals, across the border and into Gaza.
British nationals are seen as legitimate targets, including tourists, humanitarian aid workers, journalists and business travellers. If you are kidnapped, the reason for your presence is unlikely to protect you or secure your safe release. 
The long-standing policy of the British government is to not make substantive concessions to hostage takers. The British government considers that paying ransoms and releasing prisoners builds the capability of terrorist groups and finances their activities. This can, in turn, increase the risk of further hostage-taking. The Terrorism Act (2000) makes payments to terrorists illegal. 
Political situation
There is currently a large-scale conflict happening in areas of southern Israel close to the border with Gaza. See Warnings and insurance for more information, including information for British nationals who are in Israel and the OPTs.
Keep up to date with local travel advice on local news outlets and international outlets like the Access Coordination Unit.
Rocket fire can affect most areas of Israel and the interception of missiles over the OPTs may result in falling fragments or debris. Israeli air strikes also continue into Gaza. Be cautious and make sure you know the safety actions that you should take if an Israeli warning siren sounds. Follow advice from local authorities and stay informed of the security situation through the media and this travel advice. No warning sirens will sound inside Gaza, or in the West Bank outside of Israeli settlements. See Regional risks.
Violent incidents
In Israel and the West Bank, there is a risk of violent incidents, including:
stabbings
shootings
arson
vehicle rammings
stone throwing attacks on people and vehicles
explosions
Incidents have occurred:
in Tel Aviv
in Be’er Sheva
in Hadera
in Jerusalem and the Old City, particularly at and around:
Damascus Gate
Herod’s gate
Lion’s Gate
Chain Gate
in Nablus
in Jenin
in Hebron
in Jordan Valley
along Route 60 (especially junctions near Nablus), Route 443 and other West Bank arterial roads used by both Palestinians and Israelis
at Israeli checkpoints
Incidents have involved protestors (Israelis and Palestinians), Israeli security forces and civilians (including Israeli settlers). Tourists or bystanders could be caught up in incidents.
Demonstrations and armed clashes
Large political demonstrations can:
happen across Israel and the OPTs
happen at short notice and often turn violent
affect entry and exit to Ben Gurion Airport in Tel Aviv – check before you travel
You should:
check local news before travelling for information on recent clashes
avoid large gatherings and demonstrations
check locally before travelling to areas where there has been recent violence and follow the instructions of the local authorities
If Israeli security operations or armed clashes are happening near you, stay inside and wait for the local authorities to confirm that the situation is calm before moving to a different location.
There is increased risk of political tension, which can cause demonstrations and clashes, during events such as:
Thursday and Saturday evenings
after Friday prayers
Jewish high holidays (Passover, Rosh Hashana, Yom Kippur and Succoth)
Ramadan, in particular Laylat Al Qadr
other religious holidays
anniversaries including 7 October, Independence Day (14 May, Hebrew calendar dates vary), Jerusalem Day (date varies), Land Day (30 March), Nakba Day (15 May)
Risks increase when religious or national holidays overlap.
Some of these protests have led to violent clashes.
Refugee camps
Be extremely cautious if visiting refugee camps. Hebron and Palestinian refugee camps have previously been the site of violent clashes.
Settlements
There have been recent violent incidents in settlements and settlement outposts, including near Beit El, Homesh, Shilo and Evyatar.   
Crime
Protecting your belongings
Keep your personal belongings in a safe place. Theft of passports, credit cards, and valuables from public beaches is common.
Laws and cultural differences
Personal ID
Always carry ID, for example, a copy of the personal details and entry stamp pages of your passport).
Dress code
In Jerusalem, the West Bank and Gaza, clothing should cover your shoulders, upper arms, and legs above the knee.
Locals in ultra-Orthodox Jewish neighbourhoods such as Bnei Brak, Modi’in Illit, Beitar Illit, Beit Shemesh and Safed can react strongly to anyone, particularly women, dressed less conservatively. Check locations of ultra-Orthodox neighbourhoods and towns in travel guides.
Ramadan
Ramadan is a holy month for Muslims. The dates vary by year and country. If you are in the OPTs during this time, do not:
eat, drink, smoke or chew gum in public in the daytime, including in your car
play loud music or dance
swear in public
Children aged 7 and under do not fast during Ramadan.
Access and prayers at Al-Aqsa Mosque during Ramadan have seen restrictions and heightened security measures by Israeli authorities. This includes age and gender-based entry restrictions, and routine physical searches. There will be a heightened security environment and tense atmosphere during Ramadan in the Old City.
Get more advice when you arrive from your tour guide, hotel or business contacts.
You should also: 
check opening hours of shops and restaurants
be aware that if hotels and restaurants are providing food or drink in fasting hours, they may separate you from Islamic guests, for example with screens
follow local dress codes – clothing that does not meet local dress codes may cause more offence at this time
be aware that driving may be erratic, particularly when people are trying to get home at dusk or be aware that fasting can cause tiredness, particularly during the later afternoon and early evening
be patient and show tolerance
Buying property
There are risks in buying property in Israeli settlements on land considered to be occupied under international law in East Jerusalem, the rest of the West Bank and the Golan. A future peace deal between Israel and the Palestinians, or between Israel and Syria, could have consequences for property you buy in these settlements.
FCDO does not offer legal advice on or become involved in private property disputes.
Illegal drugs and prison sentences
If you’re caught with drugs, you can expect a prison sentence.
Using cameras
Be sensitive about taking pictures of people in Muslim and Orthodox Jewish areas. Do not take photographs of military or police officers or installations.
LGBT+ travellers
Israeli law does not criminalise same-sex sexual relations between consenting adults. In the OPTs, same-sex sexual activity is legal in the West Bank but illegal in Gaza, where it carries a 10-year prison sentence.
Attitudes towards LGBT+ issues in some parts of Palestinian and Israeli society can be hostile.
In more conservative Israeli areas in the West Bank, including in ultra-Orthodox communities, if you show affection in public, regardless of your gender or sexuality, you may receive negative attention.
In Palestinian society, same-sex relationships are largely taboo. Some Palestinian groups may violently oppose cultural events and demonstrations, which they see as inconsistent with their values. This includes those seen as linked to the LGBT+ community, even if the event is not intended to promote LGBT+ rights. In these cases, the Palestinian security forces and police may not always act effectively to protect participants. Be aware of these risks. Liaise with local authorities before planning or organising any event.
Tel Aviv has a large, active LGBT+ community and a big annual Pride parade. Jerusalem also has an annual Pride parade, but there has been a heavy security presence at the event since a fatal stabbing in 2015. Be aware of your personal security if attending.
See more advice for LGBT+ travellers.
Wildlife, animal products and souvenirs
If you’re caught breaking local laws on import and export of wild animals, expect to receive a substantial fine and up to 2 years in prison. For more information on the regulations and laws in Israel see the Israeli Nature and Park Authority website.
Transport risks
Road travel
If you are planning to drive in Israel and the OPTs, see information on driving abroad.
You’ll need to have both the 1968 version of the international driving permit (IDP) and your UK driving licence with you in the car. You cannot buy an IDP outside the UK, so get one before you travel.
You must carry a green card to prove you have the minimum insurance cover.
There are frequent road accidents due to:
erratic driving
unreliable vehicle maintenance
Police operate radar speed traps on some roads and issue heavy fines for speeding.
Avoid driving into ultra-Orthodox Jewish areas of Jerusalem on Shabbat. Shabbat is from sunset on Friday to nightfall on Saturday. If you attempt to drive into these areas, local residents may throw stones at your car.
Hiring a car
If you want to drive across into the West Bank, check your insurance will cover you there. Some hire companies do not insure vehicles taken there. It may be easier to hire a fully insured car from a company in East Jerusalem.
Hitchhiking
It is not safe to hitchhike in Israel and the OPTs.
Driving in the desert
If you’re travelling to the desert, you should:
go with others
take a supply of water
take a mobile phone
let someone know your itinerary and expected return time
Extreme weather and natural disasters
Find out what you can do to prepare for and respond to extreme weather and natural hazards.
Flooding
Roads can flood during extreme weather conditions. Flash flooding is a risk, particularly in the arid southern region of the Negev. Check risk areas locally.
Earthquakes
Earthquakes are a risk in Israel and the OPTs. The US Federal Emergency Management Agency website has advice about what to do before, during and after an earthquake.
