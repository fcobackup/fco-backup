FCDO advises against travel to parts of Turkey.
This advice reflects the UK government’s understanding of current rules for people travelling on a full ‘British citizen’ passport from the UK, for the most common types of travel.
The authorities in Turkey set and enforce entry rules. If you’re not sure how these requirements apply to you, contact Turkey’s UK embassy or consulate.
COVID-19 rules
Countries may restrict travel or bring in rules at short notice. Check with your travel company or airline for changes.
If you test positive for COVID-19, you may need to stay where you are until you test negative. You may also need to seek treatment there.
You should also read TravelHealthPro’s general COVID-19 advice for travellers.
Passport validity requirements
If you are visiting Turkey, your passport must:
be valid for at least 150 days from the date you arrive
have a full blank page for entry and exit stamps
If you are a resident in Turkey, your passport must be valid for 6 months from the date you arrive.
If entering Turkey through a land border, make sure your passport has a dated entry stamp before you leave the border crossing.
Visa requirements
If you’re visiting Turkey for tourism or business for up to 90 days in any 180-day period, you do not need a visa.
If you plan to remain in Turkey for more than 90 days, apply for a longer stay visa or get a residence permit before the end of your 90-day stay. If you plan to work in Turkey, make sure you have the right permits.
If you hold a different type of British nationality, such as British National (Overseas), check visa requirements with the Turkish Embassy or Consulate General before you travel.
Applying for a visa
The Turkish Ministry of Foreign Affairs has information on applying for a visa.
Vaccination requirements (other than COVID-19)
At least 8 weeks before your trip, check the vaccinations and certificates you need on TravelHealthPro.
Travelling with children
If leaving Turkey with a dual British-Turkish national child who is 18 or younger, you may need to show the Turkish immigration authorities evidence that the Turkish parent has given permission.
