This advice reflects the UK government’s understanding of current rules for people travelling on a full ‘British citizen’ passport from the UK, for the most common types of travel.
The authorities in Guatemala set and enforce entry rules. If you’re not sure how these requirements apply to you, contact the Guatemalan Embassy in the UK. 
COVID-19 rules
There are no COVID-19 testing or vaccination requirements for travellers entering Guatemala.
Travel in Guatemala  
You may be asked to wear a mask in:
medical settings (hospitals, clinics, vaccination centres and laboratories)
nursing homes
prisons
 Passport validity requirements
Your passport must have an ‘expiry date’ at least 6 months after the day you arrive in Guatemala and at least 2 blank pages.
Check with your travel provider that your passport and other travel documents meet requirements. Renew your passport if you need to.
You will be denied entry if you do not have a valid travel document or try to use a passport that has been reported lost or stolen.
Visa requirements
You can visit Guatemala for up to 90 days without a visa.
If you overstay the 90 days, you’ll have to pay a fine before leaving the country. You can pay this fine at the main Institute of Migration (in Spanish) office in Guatemala City. You can also pay fines at the airport or land borders, but administrative processes can cause serious delays.
Make sure you get your passport stamped. 
If you do not get your passport stamped when you arrive, you will get a fine and be delayed on your departure. If you notice your passport has not been stamped, return to the immigration desk, or go to the Institute of Migration (in Spanish) offices in Guatemala City as soon as possible.
Applying for or extending a visa
To stay longer than 90 days (to work or study, for business travel or for other reasons), you must meet the Guatemalan government’s entry requirements. Check which type of visa or work permit you need with the Guatemalan Embassy in the UK.
If you want to extend your visa or permit to stay, you must apply to the Institute of Migration (in Spanish).
Immigration declaration form
Before you enter or exit Guatemala, you must complete the online immigration declaration form. Print the confirmation email you receive and carry it with you. Alternatively take a screenshot of the email QR code. If you need more information, contact your travel agent or the Institute of Migration (in Spanish).   
Travelling with children 
To enter or exit Guatemala, children aged 17 and under travelling alone or with only one parent or legal guardian must have a notarised letter in Spanish from the parents or guardians not travelling with them. Contact the Guatemalan Embassy, or if you’re in Guatemala the nearest Institute of Migration (in Spanish), for information about what documents you need. Single parents will need additional documents.
Travelling to El Salvador, Honduras and Nicaragua 
Under the Central America Border Control Agreement (also known as CA-4), you can travel between El Salvador, Guatemala, Honduras and Nicaragua for up to 90 days without a visa. The 90-day period starts when you enter any of these countries and does not restart when you cross borders. You can extend your stay by up to 30 days by paying a fee before the 90 days expires. If you overstay, you may get a fine. 
You’ll have to go through immigration checks at borders. If you’re expelled from one of these countries, you’re also excluded from the other 3. 
If you’re planning to travel to Nicaragua, check entry requirements with your travel company, the Nicaraguan immigration authorities or the nearest Nicaraguan Embassy. See travel advice for Nicaragua.
Airport tax
You must pay airport departure tax of 30 US dollars (or the same amount in Guatemalan quetzal). This is normally included in the price of your ticket.
Illegal entry fees at land borders
Guatemalan customs or immigration officials sometimes ask travellers crossing land borders to pay an ‘entry fee’. This is illegal. If you are asked to pay a fee, ask for an official receipt, and you may find the officials drop the request.
When crossing into Guatemala by the land border at El Carmen, be wary of people offering to help process your entry into the country. They may be trying to overcharge you for unnecessary services.
Vaccination requirements
At least 8 weeks before your trip, check the vaccinations and certificates you need in TravelHealthPro’s Guatemala guide.   
Depending on your circumstances, this may include a yellow fever certificate.
Customs rules
There are strict rules about goods you can take into or out of Guatemala. You must declare anything that may be prohibited or subject to tax or duty.
Taking money into Guatemala
It is often not possible to exchange British pounds in Guatemala. It is much easier to exchange US dollars.
