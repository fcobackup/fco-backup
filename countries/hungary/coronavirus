The Hungarian authorities have declared a state of emergency and introduced a number of measures in response to the coronavirus (COVID-19) pandemic. The restrictions will remain in effect indefinitely, until revoked. You should comply with any additional screening measures put in place by the authorities.
The Hungarian Prime Minister announced on 16 March that Hungary would close all borders to foreigners at midnight on Monday 16 March. Only Hungarian citizens and EEA citizens (including UK nationals) holding a Permanent Residence Card or a Registration Certificate and Address Card will be allowed to enter the country. British travelers who wish to leave Hungary should make arrangements to do so as soon as possible, due to the rapidly changing circumstances and airport closures in neighbouring countries. Please note that Budapest Airport remains open until further notice.
Further restrictions to daily life may be announced over the coming days and we are monitoring the situation. The situation may change rapidly, including in neighbouring countries, where some airports have closed or ceased direct flights to the UK. Countries neighbouring Hungary (Austria, Croatia, Romania, Serbia, Slovakia, Slovenia and Ukraine) have also introduced restrictions. Please check country-specific FCO Travel Advice for details. Keep up to date with information from your tour operator, transport or accommodation provider on the impact on any existing travel plans. You should also check with your airline or travel company for the latest information.
