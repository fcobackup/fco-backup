Road travel
You can hire a car using a full, clean UK driving licence. Residents should obtain a Kiribati driving licence.
Road conditions are poor on Tarawa, but driving standards are reasonable. Minibuses can be dangerously overloaded at times.
Inter-island travel
All domestic flights, with a few exceptions, coming in and out of the capital Tarawa have been halted. Heavily reduced services for essential travel and medical supplies to the outer islands are continuing, both by air and sea.
Even before the current COVID-19 restrictions were imposed, it was not always possible to travel directly from one part of Kiribati to another. If you need to get to Kiritimati (Line Islands) from Tarawa (Gilbert Islands) you have to fly via Nadi, Fiji.
Swimming
Don’t swim in the lagoon in south Tarawa as it is highly polluted.
Take great care when swimming in the sea around Kiribati, as there are very strong rip tides along coast and reef areas.
You should wear safety equipment at all times during boating trips. Squalls can occur at very short notice. Some people have drowned in recent years.
Political situation
The Republic of Kiribati (pronounced Kiribas) is an independent republic within the Commonwealth. It is a full member of the United Nations and Pacific Islands Forum. Politics are stable.
Telecommunications
Internet and mobile phone services are available in some parts of Kiribati. Not all of the outer islands are connected however. Telecoms services can be unreliable and expensive due to the country’s remote location.
