Given the rapidly changing situation in Somalia, we have temporarily withdrawn a limited number of UK staff from our Embassy.
Entry and Borders
The Somali authorities have banned all passenger flights until further notice.
Local authorities in Somaliland have announced a number of measures to prevent the spread of the virus including restrictions on international travel:
Individuals starting their journey in Europe or North America will not be allowed to enter Somaliland and may be denied boarding by the airline.
All passengers arriving into Somaliland by air will be required to undergo a 14 day quarantine in government assigned accommodation at their own expense. You may need to demonstrate that you can afford the cost of your hotel quarantine before boarding your flight. Please contact your airline for more details.
All arrivals to Somaliland will be subject to entry screening which may include temperature measurements and checks on recent travel to affected areas. Those people displaying symptoms linked to coronavirus may be transferred to a nearby isolation facility while further tests are carried out.
All land borders and sea ports are officially closed until the situation improves. You should check with local authorities before travelling to the border.
The authorities have encouraged members of the diaspora not to travel to Somaliland at this time.
Land borders with countries neighbouring Somalia may close at short notice. You should check with local authorities before travelling to the border. You should also monitor Travel Advice for Ethiopia, Kenya or Djibouti. You should not cross the border without the correct documents.
Local Measures
The authorities in Somaliland have announced additional measures including closing schools and banning large gatherings. They advise that you should pray at home rather than attending mosque. Restrictions have also been introduced on the use of public transport within and between cities. The authorities have stated that failure to comply with these measures may result in penalties including fines or arrest. You should monitor local media for further updates and follow the advice of the local authorities.
