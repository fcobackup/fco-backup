This page reflects the UK government’s understanding of current rules for people travelling on a full ‘British Citizen’ passport, for the most common types of travel.
The authorities in Belgium set and enforce entry rules. For further information contact their embassy. You may also check with your transport provider or travel company to make sure your passport and travel documents meet their requirements.
If you are travelling to Belgium for work, read the guidance on visas and permits as the rules have changed since 1 January 2021.
Entry rules in response to coronavirus (COVID-19)
Belgium operates a travel colour code traffic light system identifying very high, high, medium, and low risk regions. Entry requirements vary depending on the colour code assigned to the country or region a person is travelling from; whether an individual is resident in Belgium or another country; and status of vaccination. Please note that Belgium does not currently recognise UK NHS Vaccine certificates.
Travelling to Belgium from the UK
The UK is currently classified as red zone (high risk) on the Belgian Government’s travel colour code system. If you are not a citizen or resident of Belgium or another EU/Schengen country you will only be able to travel to Belgium for a very limited set of reasons, set out on the Belgian Government’s website (under the Transport and International section question: ‘I am not a national of the EU nor of a country that is part of the Schengen Area, and my primary residence is in a third country marked as ‘red’ on this list, however it is not a very high-risk country. May I travel to Belgium?’). If you are eligible to travel, you must carry an Essential Travel Certificate. Applications for an Essential Travel Certificate need to be submitted to the Embassy of Belgium in the UK. Please note that the Embassy request applications are submitted five days before departure.
British nationals who are resident in Belgium are permitted to enter but should be prepared to show valid proof of residence.
All travellers arriving from the UK will be required to complete a Passenger Locator Form (PLF), unless they fall under a very limited list of exemptions listed on the Belgian Government website (under the Transport and International section question: ‘When and how should I fill in a Passenger Locator Form (PLF)?’)
All travellers arriving from the UK will be required to comply with a mandatory 10 day quarantine. Those not resident in Belgium will have to provide evidence of a negative PCR Test taken within 72 hours before arriving in Belgium and are required to take a further test on Day 7. Those resident in Belgium will need to take a test on Day 1 and Day 7 after arrival in Belgium. Children under 12 do not need to be tested but must respect the quarantine requirements. A list of exemptions from quarantine and testing requirements is included on the Belgian Government website.
Further details are listed on the Belgian Government website.
Travelling to Belgium from other countries
Please consult the list of countries that fall under the red, orange and green categories and those identified as high risk on the Belgian Government website.
Once you know the colour of the country you are travelling from, you can read the full details of the rules that may apply including certification, testing and quarantine requirements on this page.
Travellers arriving in Belgium by airplane or boat, or by train or bus from outside the EU or Schengen area and those that are coming from within the EU and staying in Belgium for more than 48 hours must complete the Belgian Passenger Locator Form (PLF) before travel and carry proof of the completed PLF throughout their journey and for the following 48 hours. Travellers who have not completed the form before travelling may be refused entry and/or face a fine. Further details are on the Belgian Government’s website.
Demonstrating your COVID-19 vaccination status
Demonstrating your vaccination status from the UK is not formalised for entry into Belgium, so you should follow alternative advice for entry. Your NHS appointment card from vaccination centres is not designed to be used as proof of vaccination and should not be used to demonstrate your vaccine status.
Further information
Further information on how to quarantine is available on the Belgian Government’s website, together with further details on how and when to get tested.
If you are travelling through France, you should also check the France Travel Advice.
Please note that transport services are subject to change, so please check with your transport operator before travel, including whether they will require evidence of a negative COVID-19 test before boarding. Further information on travel to Belgium can be found on the Belgian Government Coronavirus website.
Regular entry requirements
Visas
The rules for travelling or working in European countries changed on 1 January 2021:
you can travel to countries in the Schengen area for up to 90 days in any 180-day period without a visa. This applies if you travel as a tourist, to visit family or friends, to attend business meetings, cultural or sports events, or for short-term studies or training
if you are travelling to Belgium and other Schengen countries without a visa, make sure your whole visit is within the 90-day limit. Visits to Schengen countries within the previous 180 days before you travel count towards your 90 days
to stay longer, to work or study, for business or for other reasons, you will need to meet the Belgian government’s entry requirements. Check with the Belgian Embassy what type of visa and/or work permit, you may need
if you stay in Belgium with a residence permit or long-stay visa, this does not count towards your 90-day visa-free limit
Any time you spent in Belgium or other Schengen countries before 1 January 2021 does not count towards your 90-day visa-free limit.
At Belgian border control, you may need to use separate lanes from EU, EEA and Swiss citizens when queueing. Your passport may be stamped on entry and exit. You may also need to:
show a return or onward ticket
show you have enough money for your stay
There are separate requirements for those who are resident in Belgium. If you are resident in Belgium, you should carry proof of residence as well as your valid passport when you travel. For further information on these requirements, see our Living in Belgium guide.
Passport validity
Check your passport is valid for travel before you book your trip, and renew your passport if you do not have enough time left on it.
You must have at least 6 months left on an adult or child passport to travel to most countries in Europe (not including Ireland).
If you renewed your current passport before the previous one expired, extra months may have been added to its expiry date. Any extra months on your passport over 10 years may not count towards the 6 months needed.
UK Emergency Travel Documents
UK Emergency Travel Documents (ETDs) are accepted for entry, airside transit and exit from Belgium.
