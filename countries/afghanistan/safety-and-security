If you choose to travel to or stay in Afghanistan against FCDO advice, you should not rely on previous experience of travelling in Afghanistan or previous understanding of rules, laws and society. British nationals with previous experience of operating in Afghanistan have been detained after travelling to the country since August 2021.
There is a heightened risk of British nationals being detained in Afghanistan. If you’re a British national and you are detained in Afghanistan, the FCDO’s ability to provide consular support is extremely limited. The FCDO’s ability to secure information from the authorities could also be severely limited and communications with next of kin may not be guaranteed.
There are no formal rule of law structures or processes in place in Afghanistan, and foreign nationals have been detained without due process. Detention can be lengthy, damaging to health and welfare, and of uncertain outcome. You should avoid any activity which could be interpreted as seeking to achieve political change through violence, or any activity inciting violence. Photographing Taliban buildings or military installations is not allowed and may lead to detention. Pay close attention to local information and ways of doing things.
Human trafficking is illegal. Under the UK Bribery Act 2010 it is an offence to offer, promise or give bribes anywhere in the world.
You should monitor media reporting and make sure you have robust contingency plans in place. Be vigilant at all times, keep others informed including family and friends of your travel plans and consider your necessary routes in advance.
Political situation
Afghanistan is now under Taliban control.
People have been detained for involvement in demonstrations and for activities perceived as dissent. Foreigners’ activities are often viewed with suspicion. You should not do anything which could be interpreted as seeking to achieve political change through violence, or any activity inciting violence.
The political situation remains uncertain and could change rapidly. Keep up to date with developments in the security situation, including through monitoring local media.
Road travel
Road travel is highly dangerous.
The situation at Afghanistan’s border crossings remains volatile. A number of borders remain closed and if opened, can be subject to unannounced closures at short notice. There have been clashes between Afghan and neighbouring forces at various border crossings.
We advise against all travel to and around Afghanistan.
Air travel
Commercial flight operations have restarted at a small number of airports in Afghanistan. We advise UK nationals travelling overseas to take account of any safety notices published by the UK Civil Aviation Authority (CAA) when considering whether to use an air carrier.
