Caribbean Hurricane season normally runs from June to November. If you are in the Cayman Islands then guidance for how to stay safe and how to contact local authorities is available on the Cayman Islands Emergency website.
Before you travel, check the ‘Entry requirements’ section for The Cayman Islands’ current entry restrictions and requirements. These may change with little warning. Monitor this advice for the latest updates and stay in contact with your travel provider.
If you plan to pass through another country to return to the UK, check the travel advice for the country you’re transiting.
It is more important than ever to get travel insurance and check it provides sufficient cover. See the FCDO’s guidance on foreign travel insurance.
You should monitor the progress of approaching storms and follow the advice of the local authorities. See Natural Disasters.
As the Cayman Islands is a British Overseas Territory, there’s no formal British diplomatic or consular representation. The local authorities deal with all requests for emergency assistance. See Emergency assistance
Although there’s no recent history of terrorism in the Cayman Islands, attacks can’t be ruled out. See Terrorism.
