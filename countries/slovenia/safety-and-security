Crime
There is a low rate of crime, but petty crime does occur and you should take the usual precautions to avoid becoming a victim. Don’t leave valuables unattended. Be vigilant in busy tourist areas and safeguard your valuables against pick-pockets.
Road travel

Licences and documents
You can drive in Slovenia on your UK driving licence. Driving licence rules will stay the same until 31 December 2020.
If you’re living in Slovenia, check the Living in Guide for information on requirements for residents.
Tolls
If you drive on Slovenian motorways, you must buy and display a “vignette” by sticking it to the windscreen to indicate that road tolls have been paid. Vignettes are available for weekly, monthly or yearly periods, and can be purchased at petrol stations and DARS (the Slovenian Motorway Company) offices in Slovenia as well as outlets in neighbouring countries near the Slovene border. The vignette is compulsory for all vehicles under 3.5 tonnes in weight. Police monitor the motorways, and stop motorists who don’t have a vignette. Failure to have or display a vignette in the correct way will lead to an on-the-spot fine of up to €800. The vignette is valid only when correctly applied to the vehicle before using the motorway. More information on buying and correctly displaying vignettes is available at the DARS website.
Slovenia has a free-flow electronic tolling system on motorways and expressways for vehicles over 3.5 tonnes, meaning drivers of such vehicles no longer have to stop at toll stations. You’ll need to register your vehicle under the DarsGo system and acquire the DarsGo unit at a DarsGo service point upon entering Slovenia for the first time. You can find more information and registration details on the DarsGo website.
Driving in winter
Winter equipment is mandatory from 15 November until 15 March and whenever there are winter weather conditions (for example, at times of snowfall, blizzards or black ice).
Private cars and vehicles up to 3.5 tonnes must be equipped with winter tyres on all 4 wheels, or summer tyres on all 4 wheels plus snow chains in the car boot. The minimum tyre tread depth must be 3mm. Vehicles over 3.5 tonnes must have winter tyres on the driving wheels or summer tyres on all 4 wheels plus snow chains in the car boot.
You can be fined 125 Euros for not having this equipment, or 417 Euros if you cause a delay on the road for the same reason. The regulations apply to all vehicles. For more information, please see the website of the Automobile Association of Slovenia, under touring information, special regulations.
Driving regulations
By law, you must have your headlights on at all times, while driving in Slovenia. You are also required to carry a reflective jacket, a warning triangle and a first aid kit in the vehicle. If you intend to hire a car and drive it into Slovenia you must declare this to the car hire company first, as you must have adequate car insurance cover.
The police are empowered to impose on-the-spot fines for offences including speeding, driving under the influence of alcohol and for using mobile phones without properly installed wireless headsets (Bluetooth).
See the European Commission,AA and RAC guides on driving in Slovenia.
Road safety
In 2018 there were 91 road deaths in Slovenia (source: Department for Transport). This equates to 4.4 road deaths per 100,000 of population and compares to the UK average of 2.8 road deaths per 100,000 of population in 2018.
Skiing/mountaineering
If you are planning a skiing or mountaineering holiday, contact the Slovenian Tourist Board in the UK (telephone: (+44) (0)207 227 9713) for advice on weather and safety conditions before travelling. Off-piste skiing is highly dangerous. Follow all safety instructions meticulously. There is a danger of avalanches in some areas.
Accommodation
Ljubljana is a small capital city and an increasingly popular destination. You should arrange accommodation before travelling.
