The information on this page covers the most common types of travel and reflects the UK government’s understanding of the rules currently in place. Unless otherwise stated, this information is for travellers using a full ‘British Citizen’ passport.
The authorities in the country or territory you’re travelling to are responsible for setting and enforcing the rules for entry. If you’re unclear about any aspect of the entry requirements, or you need further reassurance, you’ll need to contact the embassy, high commission or consulate of the country or territory you’re travelling to.
You should also consider checking with your transport provider or travel company to make sure your passport and other travel documents meet their requirements.
Entry rules in response to coronavirus (COVID-19)
Entry to Spain
Spain’s borders are open to European Union and Schengen-area countries, however specific entry restrictions and testing requirements may be in place depending on the country you are travelling from.
Some restrictions on travellers from outside the European Union and the Schengen free-travel area remain in place. You should refer to the Spanish Embassy in the country you are in for further advice.
On 22 December 2020, Spain introduced travel restrictions on passenger travel from the UK by air and sea, with the exception of Spanish or Andorran nationals and those legally resident in Spain or Andorra. The Spanish government has confirmed that these measures will be in place until 6pm (GMT+1) on 30 March 2021 (5pm / GMT in the Canary Islands).
After 6pm (GMT+1) on 30 March 2021 (5pm / GMT in the Canary Islands), while passenger travel from the UK to Spain will resume, entry to Spain will only be granted to those passengers who can demonstrate that their journey is essential. For further information on the permitted reasons to enter Spain and necessary documentation see Permitted reasons to enter Spain after 30 March 2021.
Some travel restrictions and testing requirements are in place for international transit through Spanish airports by passengers on flights departing from the UK. See Transiting Spain.
From the 23 November 2020, pre-travel COVID-19 testing requirements are in place for those travelling by air and sea from ‘risk’ countries (as determined by the European Centre for Disease Prevention & Control). Arrivals from the UK are currently subject to this requirement. See Testing requirements for details.
If you are resident in Spain, you should carry your residence document (the green paper EU residence certificate or the new TIE), as well as your valid passport when you travel. If you are not in possession of a residence document, see Additional Requirements for UK Nationals resident in Spain for further information.
Travellers should follow the advice of the local authorities on how best to protect themselves and others, including any measures that they bring in to control the virus. See the Coronavirus section for further information.
Mandatory pre-travel declaration form for all passengers
Before travel to Spain, all passengers travelling by air or sea must complete and sign an online Health Control Form no more than 48 hours prior to travel declaring any known history of exposure to COVID-19 and giving contact details.
You can do this on the Spain Travel Health website or downloadable app. On completion of the form, you will be issued a QR code which you must show (electronically or hardcopy) at airport health controls on arrival. See Spain Travel Health video for further details.
Anyone who has not completed this form electronically via the Spain Travel Health website or app, may submit it in paper format prior to boarding.
Testing requirements
All passengers (excluding children under the age of 6 years old) travelling to Spanish airports and ports from ‘risk’ countries (as determined by the European Centre for Disease Prevention & Control) are required to present a negative PCR, TMA (Transcription-Mediated Amplification) or a LAMP (Loop-Mediated Isothermal Amplification) swab test taken within no more than 72 hours prior to arrival. Passengers arriving from the UK are currently subject to this requirement.
This requirement applies to all passengers arriving in Spain by air or sea, regardless of your residence status in Spain and the length of time you intend on staying. Property owners in Spain are subject to this requirement.
A minimum fine of €3000 may be issued to anyone who arrives in Spanish airports or ports from ‘risk’ countries without adequate evidence of a negative PCR, TMA or LAMP test.
While TMA and LAMP tests are not currently widely available in the UK, you should refer to testing facilities directly for specific information on the types of tests available to you, prior to booking an appointment.
You should not use the NHS testing service to get a test in order to facilitate your travel to another country. You should arrange to take a private test and should confirm with the testing facility the type of tests available prior to booking an appointment.
From 30 March, all overland travellers (excluding children under the age of 6 years old) who wish to enter Spain by road or rail from France, are required to present a negative PCR, TMA or LAMP test taken within 72 hours prior to entry. The following groups are exempt from this requirement:
Haulage workers
Frontier workers
Residents of border regions within a radius of 30 km
While these testing requirements don’t apply to overland travellers from Portugal, Andorra and Gibraltar, travel into Spain from all locations is limited. See Permitted reasons to enter Spain after 30 March 2021.
Preparing for arrival
On arrival into Spanish ports and airports, you may be subject to the following requirements at the point of entry:
Present the QR code (hardcopy or digital) issued on completion of the online Health Control Form prior to travel. See Mandatory pre-travel declaration form for all passengers
Undergo a temperature check
Undergo a visual health assessment
If travelling from a ‘risk country’, be prepared to show evidence certifying you have undertaken a PCR, TMA or LAMP test within no more than 72 hours prior to arrival, and have tested negative for COVID-19. See Testing requirements
If travelling from a country where Spain has issued a travel ban, be prepared to show evidence of your residency. Due to current travel restrictions, be aware that you may be questioned on arrival by Spanish border authorities to ensure you meet the legal entry requirements. Spanish border authorities will only grant entry if they are satisfied that you are returning to Spain to your habitual place of residence or can demonstrate an essential reason to enter (see ‘Permitted reasons to enter Spain after 30 March 2021’), and reserve the right to deny passage.
Anyone who presents symptoms or fails to meet one of the above requirements will be required to undergo a test on arrival and will be obliged to observe the COVID-19 protocols in place as determined by the local authorities of your destination in Spain.
Passengers may also be contacted and required to undertake a PCR, TMA or LAMP test at any point up to 48 hours after their arrival in Spain.
Additional requirements for UK nationals resident in Spain
The Spanish government has formally confirmed to the UK government that UK nationals who were legally residing in Spain before 1 January 2021, and as such are beneficiaries of the Withdrawal Agreement, can use any of the following documents to prove their residence status when entering Spain:
Residence card issued under Article 18.4 of the Withdrawal Agreement (the TIE – Tarjeta de Identidad de Extranjero)
Temporary or permanent EU residence certificate (Certificado de Registro de Ciudadanos de la Unión)
Receipt of application for the TIE (Resguardo de presentación de la solicitud de la tarjeta de residencia)
Confirmation of the positive outcome of your residence application (Resolución favorable por la que se concede la tarjeta de residencia)
In the absence of any of the above, other documents that credibly evidence your legal residence in Spain before 1 January 2021, such as a padrón certificate (issued by your town hall), a work contract, a rental contract, or proof of property purchase may be presented. However, due to current travel restrictions, be aware that you may be questioned on arrival by Spanish border authorities to ensure you meet the legal entry requirements. Spanish border authorities will only grant entry if they are satisfied that you are returning to Spain to your habitual place of residence or can demonstrate an essential reason to enter (see ‘Permitted reasons to enter Spain after 30 March 2021’), and reserve the right to deny passage.
The above list of documentation has also been communicated to airlines and other operators.

Regular entry requirements
Visas
The rules for travelling or working in European countries changed on 1 January 2021:
you can travel to countries in the Schengen area for up to 90 days in any 180-day period without a visa. This applies if you travel as a tourist, to visit family or friends, to attend business meetings, cultural or sports events, or for short-term studies or training
if you are travelling to Spain and other Schengen countries without a visa, make sure your whole visit is within the 90-day limit. Visits to Schengen countries within the previous 180 days before you travel count towards your 90 days
to stay longer, to work or study, for business travel or for other reasons, you will need to meet the Spanish government’s entry requirements. You should check with the Spanish consulate in the UK prior to travel regarding what type of visa and/or work permit you may need. If you are unable to return to the UK before the expiry of your visa/permit or visa-free limit due to C-19 restrictions, you should contact your local immigration office (Extranjería) for advice. You can also call 060 from a Spanish phone line. If you are visiting Spain and need to extend your visa-free stay for exceptional reasons, such as a medical emergency, you must apply to the immigration authorities (Extranjería) to do so.
if you stay in Spain with a visa or permit, this does not count towards the 90-day visa-free limit
Any time you spent in Spain or other Schengen countries before 1 January 2021 does not count towards your 90-day visa-free limit.
At Spanish border control, you may need to use separate lanes from EU, EEA and Swiss citizens when queueing. Your passport may be stamped on entry and exit. You may also need to:
show a return or onward ticket
show you have enough money for your stay
There are separate requirements for those who are resident in Spain. If you are resident in Spain, you should carry proof of residence as well as your valid passport when you travel. For further information on these requirements, see our Living in Spain guide.
Passport validity
Check your passport is valid for travel before you book your trip, and renew your passport if you do not have enough time left on it.
You must have at least 6 months left on an adult or child passport to travel to most countries in Europe (not including Ireland). This applies to the whole of Spain, including the Canary Islands and the Balearic Islands (Majorca, Menorca, Ibiza and Formentera).
If you renewed your current passport before the previous one expired, extra months may have been added to its expiry date. Any extra months on your passport over 10 years may not count towards the 6 months needed.
UK Emergency Travel Documents (ETDs)
UK ETDs are accepted for entry, airside transit and exit from Spain.
