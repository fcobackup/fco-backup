Cape Town floods
South African Weather Service (SAWS) has issued several ‘disruptive rain’ warnings for the City of Cape Town, and surrounding areas. There is ongoing risk of localised flooding and disruption.
If you are in Cape Town and affected by adverse weather conditions, reconsider whether your journey is necessary, and always check local media before your journey. Stay away from rivers where possible and do not drive through or cross over flooded areas.
