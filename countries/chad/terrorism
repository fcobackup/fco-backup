Terrorists are very likely to try to carry out attacks in Chad.
Attacks could be indiscriminate and occur without warning. Places frequented by foreigners, including diplomatic premises, hotels, restaurants, bars, nightclubs, stadiums, concert halls, shopping areas, markets, national infrastructure, airports and other transport hubs, places of worship (especially churches), national parks, businesses with western interests and foreign, national and local government facilities may also be targets of attack.
You should be vigilant, be alert to announcements, monitor local media and follow the advice of the local authorities. Avoid all large gatherings, including music festivals, shows, concerts, sporting events and any public marches or demonstrations. You should exercise extra caution during election periods, festivities, and religious and public holiday periods.

There have been numerous attacks by armed groups in the Lake Chad region since 2016. The terrorist group Boko Haram remains active in this region. In an attack in November 2022, Boko Haram reportedly killed at least 30 Chadian soldiers near Baga Sola, Lac province. Military operations are ongoing and a state of emergency remains in place.
There is a high threat of terrorist attack globally affecting UK interests and British nationals, including from groups and individuals who view the UK and British nationals as targets. You should remain vigilant at all times.
Kidnap
Lake Chad Basin and the border areas with the Far North Region of Cameroon, Sudan and the Central African Republic. British nationals are viewed as legitimate targets, including those engaged in tourism, humanitarian aid work, journalism or business sectors. If you’re kidnapped, the reason for your presence is unlikely to serve as a protection or secure your safe release.Boko Haram and Islamic State West Africa (ISWA) maintain an intent and capability to conduct kidnaps in Chad, and have also taken hostages from neighbouring Cameroon, northern Nigeria and the Diffa region of Niger. If you’re working or travelling in areas where there is a Boko Haram or ISWA presence, especially around the Lake Chad Basin, you should be aware of the risk of terrorist kidnapping.
You should maintain a high level of vigilance at all times, especially when travelling and in crowded public places, including camps for displaced people, religious gatherings and insecure spaces such as places of worship, markets, shopping areas, hotels, bars, nightclubs, restaurants and transport hubs. You should make sure you have carefully considered the threat and have reasonable, proportionate mitigation measures in place.
The long-standing policy of the British Government is not to make substantive concessions to hostage takers. The British Government considers that paying ransoms and releasing prisoners builds the capability of terrorist groups and finances their activities. This can, in turn, increase the risk of further hostage-taking. The Terrorism Act (2000) makes payments to terrorists illegal.
The terrorist threat in the Sahel and Lake Chad Basin
There is a high threat of kidnapping by terrorist groups operating in the Sahel region. A number of western nationals including tourists, NGO workers and diplomats have been kidnapped in the Sahel over the last ten years, and several are still being held. Some, including several British nationals, have been killed by their captors. Those engaged in humanitarian aid work, journalism or business sectors are viewed as legitimate targets. If you’re kidnapped, the reason for your presence is unlikely to serve as a protection or secure your safe release.
There are a number of terrorist groups active in the region. These include Jamaat Nusrat al-Islam wal Muslimeen (JNIM), Islamic State West Africa (ISWA), Islamic State Greater Sahara (ISGS), Al Qaeda in the Islamic Maghreb (AQIM), Al Murabitoun, Ansar Dine and Boko Haram. These groups are capable of carrying out attacks and kidnaps over long distances. Kidnapping for ransom is the primary source of finance for Jamaat Nusrat al-Islam wal Muslimeen (JNIM). Criminal gangs also carry out kidnapping for terrorist groups in return for financial rewards.
