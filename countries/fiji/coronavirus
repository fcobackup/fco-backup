Travel in Fiji
A nationwide curfew is in effect from 11pm to 4am each night. Social distancing restrictions now allow gatherings of up to 100 individuals and will apply to weddings, funerals, conferences, community gatherings, cafes and restaurants. Domestic travel is returning to normal following the end of the suspension of travel to Fiji’s outer islands. Fiji’s authorities are urging users of public transport to observe social distancing.
If you’re looking to leave Fiji and are visiting the outer islands, you’re advised to return to the main island of Viti Levu immediately. Further cases of Covid-19 in Fiji could see the reintroduction of restrictions on internal travel and/or a lockdown of affected areas. More information on the latest restrictions are available on the Fiji Government website.
Accommodation
Some hotels and rental accommodation are open, and social distancing measures are in place.
Public places and services
Public places are open including shops, restaurants, places of worship, cinemas and swimming pools. Nightclubs remain closed and you must abide by the nationwide curfew which requires you to remain in your home or accommodation between 11pm and 4am. Gatherings are restricted to no more than 100 people.
Healthcare in Fiji
If you begin to feel unwell self-isolate by staying at home, even with mild symptoms such as headache, low grade fever (37.3 C or above) and slight runny nose, until you recover. If it is essential for you to have someone bring you supplies or to go out, e.g. to buy food, then wear a mask to avoid infecting other people.
If you develop symptoms of Covid-19 including fever, cough and difficulty breathing, seek medical advice promptly as this may be due to a respiratory infection or other serious condition. The Ministry of Health and Medical Services have a hotline (telephone number 158) to provide help. They will be able to direct you to the right health facility.
