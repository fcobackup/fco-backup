Health risks
There is an ongoing outbreak of coronavirus in China. The virus originated in Wuhan City, Hubei Province but cases have been confirmed in other parts of China and elsewhere in the region. There is a risk that the virus will spread to Mongolia and so the government of Mongolia has announced a number of precautionary measures. These include:
Passenger vehicle and pedestrian border crossings between China and Mongolia were prohibited from 27 January
Foreign nationals with tourism visas may only enter Mongolia by air or rail
The closure of all schools, kindergartens, universities, higher education institutions and vocational training centres until 2 March
The prohibition of all public gatherings, events and meetings, such as conferences, sporting events, and concerts
There are currently no restrictions on flights or train travel between China and Mongolia, although passengers may be subject to additional screening. You should comply with any additional screening measures put in place by the authorities. Further advice is available from Public Health England, and the TravelHealthPro website.
The high levels of air pollution in Ulaanbaatar, especially in winter, may aggravate bronchial, sinus or asthma conditions. Children, the elderly and those with pre-existing medical conditions may be especially affected. You can check the pollution index levels for many cities on the aqicn.info website.
There have been isolated incidents of Bubonic Plague in some rural areas of Mongolia, plague is caught by consuming Marmont meat. The meat is a delicacy in some rural areas although it is illegal to hunt for Marmot in Mongolia. In travelling through rural areas, you should avoid marmot meat and take precautionary actions on bubonic plague.
If you think you are exposed to bubonic plague whilst travelling in Mongolia, you should immediately report to the nearest hospital and call National Infectious Disease Centre at +976 100. You should contact the British Embassy if you or your group is quarantined due to an incident involving Bubonic Plague.
Preparing for travel
At least 8 weeks before your trip, check the latest country-specific health advice from the National Travel Health Network and Centre (NaTHNaC) on the TravelHealthPro website. Each country-specific page has information on vaccine recommendations, any current health risks or outbreaks, and factsheets with information on staying healthy abroad. Guidance is also available from NHS (Scotland) on the FitForTravel website.
General information on travel vaccinations and a travel health checklist is available on the NHS website. You may then wish to contact your health adviser or pharmacy for advice on other preventive measures and managing any pre-existing medical conditions while you’re abroad.
The legal status and regulation of some medicines prescribed or purchased in the UK can be different in other countries. You’re only allowed to bring medicines for personal use into Mongolia. These include medicines for urgent aid for up to 7 days or for the treatment of diabetes, cancer, mental illness or HIV/AIDS for which you have a doctor’s prescription. If you’re arriving by plane, you should carry all medicines in your checked baggage. Guidance is available from NaTHNaC on best practice when travelling with medicines. For further information on the legal status of a specific medicine, you’ll need to contact the embassy, high commission or consulate of the country or territory you’re travelling to.
While travel can be enjoyable, it can sometimes be challenging. There are clear links between mental and physical health, so looking after yourself during travel and when abroad is important. Information on travelling with mental health conditions is available in our guidance page. Further information is also available from the National Travel Health Network and Centre (NaTHNaC).
Local medical care
If you need emergency medical assistance during your trip, dial 103 and ask for an ambulance. You should contact your insurance/medical assistance company as soon as possible to inform them of what has happened.
The standard of healthcare is variable, especially outside Ulaanbaatar. In Ulaanbaatar the quality and access can also vary. Doctors and hospitals may ask for cash payment in advance of treatment. The quality of local medical supplies is low and some medicines are counterfeit. Take basic supplies of over-the-counter medicines and any regular prescription drugs you may need with you.
Medical bills, especially when medical evacuation is required, can be very substantial. Make sure you have adequate travel health insurance and accessible funds to cover the cost of any medical treatment abroad and repatriation.
