HES codes for intercity travel and lodging
Turkish citizens and residents must request a HES (Hayat Eve Sigar) Code for domestic and international flights, train and ferry travel. As of 30 September the HES code will also be required when checking into accommodation including hotels, motels, boarding houses, pensions, camps etc. Some provinces also require submission of a HES code upon entry to public buildings and banks. This does not apply to foreign tourists. This can be done through the e-Devlet system, the ‘Hayat Eve Sığar’ smartphone application and by SMS.
IF YOU HAVE A TURKISH RESIDENT ID: Send a text message to phone number 2023 that includes (a) the letters “HES”, (b) your Turkish kimlik number (c) your year of birth, and (d) the number of days you will be traveling, plus 7 days. Put a single space between each item.
IF YOU HAVE TURKISH CITIZENSHIP: Send a text message to phone number 2023 that includes (a) the letters “HES”, (b) your Turkish kimlik number (c) the last four digits of the series number of your ID, and (d) surname, the number of days you will be traveling, plus 7 days should be used. Put a single space between each item.
Airlines also have information on their websites in English about the HES code, including:
