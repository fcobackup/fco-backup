Travelling from and returning to the UK
Check what you must do to travel abroad and return to England, Scotland, Wales or Northern Ireland.
If you plan to pass through another country to return to the UK, check the travel advice for the country you’re transiting.
Be prepared for your plans to change
No travel is risk-free during COVID. Countries may further restrict travel or bring in new rules at short notice, for example due to a new COVID-19 variant. Check with your travel company or airline for any transport changes which may delay your journey home.
If you test positive for COVID-19, you may need to stay where you are until you test negative. You may also need to seek treatment there.
Plan ahead and make sure you:
can access money
understand what your insurance will cover
can make arrangements to extend your stay and be away for longer than planned
Travel in Singapore
See the Singapore Government website for the latest on the COVID-19 situation and measures in place to curb its spread.
If you do not comply with these measures you could be fined, imprisoned, or both, then deported. Repeat offenders will face further fines and/or prosecution. Be aware that restrictions and penalties are subject to change at short notice.
Public spaces and services
Face masks
You must wear a face mask indoors and on public transport (wearing a mask outdoors is optional). Partly open-air hawker centres and ‘coffee shops’ are regarded as indoor venues that require mask wearing. Some exceptions are: children under 6 years old; anyone eating, drinking or taking medication; or anyone engaged in strenuous exercise. You could be fined, imprisoned, or both if you are found not wearing a face mask indoors or on public transport without a valid reason.
The Health Sciences Authority’s guide on face masks recommends that masks have at least 2 to 3 layers of fabric.
Trace Together and Health Alerts via SMS
You’ll need to be fully vaccinated to dine out and will need to show proof of vaccination status on the TraceTogether phone app or token to attend an event or activity with more than 500 people and to enter some nightlife venues.
Short term foreign visitors are asked to download the TraceTogether app on their phones and activate it while in Singapore. Mobile phones and/or local tourist SIM cards can be rented/purchased at Changi Airport to enable visitors to do so.
TraceTogether tokens can be rented for children aged 7-12 or those with disabilities. See the TraceTogether for Travellers page.
Vaccination status
To dine out, attend an event with more than 500 people and enter some nightlife venues anyone over 12 years old must be recognised as fully vaccinated by the Singapore government’s definition. You’re considered fully vaccinated 14 days after you’ve completed the required doses of any of these vaccines:
Pfizer
Moderna
AstraZeneca (also known as CoviShield)
Janssen (Johnson and Johnson)
Sinovac
Sinopharm
Covaxin
Novavax
Singapore’s Vaccine Booster Programme includes those 12 years old and above. If you are resident in Singapore, or have stayed in Singapore for over 30 days, and fail to get your first booster shot within 270 days after your final dose of the primary series you will lose your fully-vaccinated status. See section on booster shots.
Quarantine and home recovery
If you test positive for COVID-19, you will initially be required to isolate at your hotel or residential accommodation. Instructions on what to do next depend on whether you are well or unwell. Details are on Singapore’s Living with COVID-19 page.
Work
All staff are now permitted to return to offices. Masks are mandatory indoors except when staff are not interacting physically with others and not in customer facing roles.
If you are unvaccinated, you are not allowed to go into work at all.
Vaccination is required to obtain or renew a long-term pass, work pass or Permanent Residency.
Details on workplace matters are under Advisories on COVID-19 on the Ministry of Manpower website.
Healthcare in Singapore
For contact details for English speaking doctors, see our list of healthcare providers. English is almost universally spoken in Singapore, so all hospitals – whether private or public – will have English-speaking medical staff.

Anyone requiring a COVID-19 polymerase chain reaction (PCR) test can get it from one of the clinics approved by the Ministry of Health. These clinics issue digital test result certificates. You can have these digital certificates notarised before you travel.
If you’d like to do a self-test at home, you can buy Antigen Rapid Tests from retailers and chemists. There’s a list of self-test kits authorised for use in Singapore on the Health Sciences Authority website.

COVID-19 vaccines if you live in Singapore
Wherever possible British nationals should aim to be vaccinated in the country where they live. We will update this page when the Government of Singapore announces new information on the national vaccination programme. You can sign up to get email notifications when this page is updated.
Vaccination programme eligibility
The Singapore national vaccination programme has approved vaccination for those aged 5 years and older, with children eligible for children’s doses of the Pfizer vaccine. The following foreigners are part of the government’s vaccination programme:
permanent residents (PR)
employment pass (EP) holders
S Pass holders
work permit holders
foreign domestic workers
dependant’s pass holders
long-term visit pass (LTVP) holders
student pass holders
Certain categories of short-term pass holders can also be vaccinated. You should check the guidelines to see if you qualify and to find out how you can register. Vaccination using Pfizer-BioNTech (also known as Comirnaty), Moderna, Sinovac and Novavax is free of charge, although the vaccine brand offered may depend on an individual’s medical circumstances. Vaccination with other vaccine brands may be possible at private clinics for a fee.
Booster shots
Residents aged 12 and above are considered fully vaccinated if the final dose of the primary vaccination series was received in the last 270 days.
Residents aged 12 and above, and those who have been staying in Singapore for a month, must receive a first booster shot within 270 days after the final dose of their primary vaccination series to still be considered fully vaccinated. Those who have recovered from COVID-19 should still have a booster shot, at least 28 days after their infection. Visit the Vaccine Booster Programme section of the Ministry of Health website for more information.
A second booster dose is encouraged for those over 80 years of age, those who live in care homes or those who are otherwise considered to be at risk of a severe infection due to underlying medical conditions. Those aged between 50 and 79 can also choose to have a second booster dose.
A Vaccine Injury Financial Assistance Programme exists to cover any vaccine related impacts on health. This is available for residents and long-term pass holders who were vaccinated in Singapore with an approved vaccine.
Updating your vaccination status in Singapore
If you were vaccinated abroad, you can update your records in Singapore if:
you’re a resident or long-term pass holder
you were vaccinated outside of Singapore with one of the WHO listed vaccines including: Pfizer (Comirnaty), Moderna, AstraZeneca (Covishield), Janssen (Johnson & Johnson), Sinovac, Sinopham, Covaxin or Novavax
Once confirmed, you’ll be recognised as vaccinated on Singapore’s TraceTogether app/token. See the Ministry of Health’s FAQs page for more information.
