Terrorists are very likely to try to carry out attacks in Côte d’Ivoire.
UK Counter Terrorism Policing has information and advice on staying safe abroad and what to do in the event of a terrorist attack. Find out how to reduce your risk from terrorism while abroad.
The main threat in Côte d’Ivoire comes from Al-Qaida in the Islamic Maghreb (AQ-M) and its associated groups. These groups remain intent on demonstrating capability and increasing influence across the region. AQ-M mainly operates in the Sahel. The Sahel region includes Burkina Faso, Chad, Mali, Mauritania and Niger, but the threat may extend to other neighbouring countries in the region, including Côte d’Ivoire, due to the porous nature of the borders.
There is an increased risk in the northern border areas of Côte d’Ivoire, including the Comoé national park area in the north-east. There has been an uptick in attacks throughout 2020-21, with growing use of improvised explosive devices. Attacks have so far mainly targeted government security forces, but the situation may evolve and travellers should remain vigilant.
There is a risk of a terrorist attacks elsewhere in Côte d’Ivoire, including in Abidjan. A terrorist attack took place at Grand Bassam near Abidjan on 13 March 2016, in which 18 people were killed including a number of foreigners. The attack was claimed by Al-Qaida in the Islamic Maghreb (AQ-M). Further attacks on beach resorts, hotels, cafés and restaurants visited by foreigners are possible and could occur without warning. Be especially vigilant in these places.
There is a high threat of terrorist attack globally affecting UK interests and British nationals, including from groups and individuals who view the UK and British nationals as targets. You should remain vigilant at all times, including in and around Abidjan.
