Drug laws are similar to those in the UK. Possession or trafficking of drugs will attract strict penalties and often a lengthy prison sentence.
Taking photographs of military and police installations, personnel or vehicles may lead to difficulties.
There are no laws against same-sex sexual activity and thereâ€™s a general tolerance towards same-sex couples in Montenegro. However, due to the conservative nature of society, overt public displays of affection may attract unwanted attention. Pride events have been held since 2013 and generally take place without incident, although some counter-protests do still occur. You can find more local information on LGBT issues on the website of Queer Montenegro. See our information and advice page for the LGBT community before you travel.
