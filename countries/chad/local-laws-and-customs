Read what you can and cannot do

Local laws reflect the fact that Chad is a predominantly Muslim country. You should respect local traditions, customs, laws and religions at all times and be aware of your actions to ensure that they do not offend other cultures or religious beliefs, especially during the holy month of Ramadan or if you intend to visit religious areas. See Travelling during Ramadan
Penalties for the use and possession of drugs are severe and usually include a prison sentence. Conditions in local prisons are harsh.
 
Homosexuality is not widely accepted in central African society. In August 2017 a new law came into force criminalising same-sex sexual activity in Chad, with penalties of imprisonment ranging from 3 months to 2 years and a fine of between 50,000 and 500,000 CFA francs. See our information and advice page for the LGBT community before you travel.
Photographing of military sites, government buildings and airports is prohibited. Other photography requires a government permit.
 
You should carry identification at all times (either a residence permit or a certified copy of your passport). Failure to produce ID can lead to detention by the police, or delays should you have to leave the country.
