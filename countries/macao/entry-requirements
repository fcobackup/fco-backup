This advice reflects the UK government’s understanding of current rules for people travelling on a full ‘British citizen’ passport from the UK, for the most common types of travel.
The authorities in Macao set and enforce entry rules. If you’re not sure how these requirements apply to you, contact the Chinese Embassy in the UK.   
COVID-19 rules
There are no COVID-19 testing or vaccination requirements for travellers entering Macao. 
Passport validity requirements
Your passport must have an ‘expiry date’ at least 90 days after the date you leave Macao.
Check with your travel provider that your passport and other travel documents meet requirements. Renew your passport if you need to.
You will be denied entry if you do not have a valid travel document or try to use a passport that has been reported lost or stolen.
Visa requirements
Macao is part of the People’s Republic of China, but it remains a Special Administrative Region (SAR) with its own immigration controls.
You can stay in Macao for up to 6 months without a visa.
To stay longer (to work or study, for business travel or for other reasons), you must get a visa before arrival. Check which type of visa you need with the Macao Immigration Department.
Travelling through Macao to China
If you plan to travel through Macao to mainland China on a British passport, you must get a Chinese visa before you arrive at the border. If not, you could be fined or detained by the mainland Chinese authorities.
If you enter and leave Macao through mainland China, you must get a double or multiple entry visa to re-enter mainland China.  
The mainland Chinese authorities may carry out thorough checks at border crossings, including your electronic devices.
Vaccination requirements
To enter Macao, you must have a certificate to prove you’ve had a yellow fever vaccination if you’re coming from a country listed as a transmission risk.
