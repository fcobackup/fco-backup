Unexploded ordnance
There is still a significant amount of unexploded ordnance in Palau left over from World War II, particularly in Peleliu and Angaur. Take care, particularly when diving, hiking or exploring caves.
Crime
Crime levels are low. However, you should take sensible precautions to protect your belongings.
Water sports
Wear appropriate safety equipment and take local advice on safety. There are over 60 vertical drop-offs in the diving areas and some are for experienced divers only. Ensure you have comprehensive travel insurance and that it provides sufficient cover for any activities you plan to undertake, including medical evacuation.
