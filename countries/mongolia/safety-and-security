Terrorism
There is a high threat of terrorist attack globally affecting UK interests and British nationals, including from groups and individuals who view the UK and British nationals as targets. Stay aware of your surroundings at all times.  
UK Counter Terrorism Policing has information and advice on staying safe abroad and what to do in the event of a terrorist attack. Find out how to reduce your risk from terrorism while abroad.
Terrorism in Mongolia
Although there is no recent history of terrorism in Mongolia, attacks cannot be ruled out.    
Political situation
There have been occasional instances of civil and political unrest resulting in protests and violence. Avoid large gatherings and demonstrations for your personal safety.
Crime
Pickpockets may operate in markets and crowded public places. The risk increases during the festivals of Tsagaan Sar (New Year, celebrated from December to February) and Naadam (July). Take extra precautions during these periods.
Occasionally large groups of people, including children and teenagers, harass pedestrians for money as they get into vehicles or walk into pubs or restaurants. Keep your mobile phone, passport and money in a secured bag on your person, and leave valuables in a hotel safe if possible.
Violent incidents are rare, but foreigners have been assaulted and robbed in Ulaanbaatar. Avoid being out alone at night, and ask hotels, restaurants or clubs to order a car for you. If hailing a ride, use only licensed taxis such as VIP Taxis. Alternatively use the taxi app UBCab, which is trackable.
Reporting crime
The Mongolian government has asked foreigners to report crimes so they can investigate and keep records. You do not need to have any further involvement and will be free to leave once you’ve made your report.
In an emergency call the police on 102 or +976 102 from an international mobile phone. There should be someone available on this number who can speak to you in English.
Laws and cultural differences
Personal ID
Always carry your passport – a copy is not sufficient if the police ask you for ID, and you could be fined. Keep copies of the photo page and the page with your Mongolian entry stamp in a separate place.
If you are a resident, carry your registration card.
Respecting religious customs
Show respect in Buddhist monasteries. Always ask for permission to take photographs and do not touch sacred images or objects.
Illegal drugs and prison sentences   
It is illegal to possess or use of any type of drugs, including cannabis. If you are found guilty of drug trafficking, you could face a life sentence. Mongolian prisons have very basic facilities.
Using cameras
It is illegal to photograph or video police, police escorts or military personnel. You could be arrested and fined. The court decides the fine based on the degree of social danger of the crime and the income of the defendant.
LGBT+ travellers
Although not illegal, same-sex relationships are not generally accepted socially.
Read more advice for LGBT+ travellers.
Wildlife, animal products and souvenirs   
It is illegal to buy, sell, kill or capture any protected species of wild animal or trade its parts without a licence. You could get a fine and a prison sentence.
Phone and wifi coverage
Most UK phone networks operate in the cities and wifi is widely available in hotels, restaurants and bars, especially in Ulaanbaatar. You can buy local SIM cards and mobile phones. In rural Mongolia there are large areas that do not have network coverage.
Road travel
You need a 1968 international driving permit (IDP) and a UK driving licence to drive in Mongolia. The 1949 IDP is not accepted any more. You cannot buy an IDP outside the UK, so get one before you travel.
There are a high number of road accidents, due to:
low driving standards
speeding
poorly maintained vehicles
difficult terrain
dangerous road conditions
Driving in Ulaanbaatar is hazardous as roads are heavily congested. Outside the capital, only about 10% of the country’s roads are tarmacked and signposting is minimal. If you are planning to drive in rural Mongolia, see information on driving abroad and prepare by:
researching your route
asking local guides or drivers about the road conditions ahead
checking World Meteorological Organization weather forecasts for Mongolia
taking back-up communication devices such as a satellite phone
packing plenty of water and provisions
sharing details of your route and expected arrival and departure times
Mongolia does not have an extensive road network and driving can be dangerous due to the terrain.
