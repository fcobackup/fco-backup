Moving around in Slovenia
On 19 October, the Slovene government announced a coronavirus epidemic in Slovenia, which will last for 30 days. New measures will come into force from 20 October. The requirement to follow social distancing measures remains in place. Further measures may follow at short notice.
Public spaces and services
Protective masks (or other material covering the nose and mouth) must be worn in indoor public areas, on public transport and in busy public outdoor spaces such as high streets, where maintaining social distance is not possible.
From 20 October, the following measures are in place for all of Slovenia:
All public and private gatherings are limited to six people (except where a household numbers more than 6 people).
All larger gatherings (both public and private) are prohibited.
A curfew is imposed every day from 2100-0600. There are exceptions for access to essential services, protecting life, health and property and for travelling to/from work if you cannot work from home.
Movement between regions is prohibited, with some exceptions:
Travelling to/from work
Economic, agricultural or forestry activities
Protecting health, life or property
Caring for family members
Accessing pharmacies or health services
Accessing foreign Embassies or Consulates
Accessing urgent services
Access to property for maintenance or seasonal work
The Slovene authorities have also introduced a Red, Amber and Green rating system, to determine which additional COVID-19 prevention measures are in place within regions in Slovenia.
How a region is rated is determined by three criteria:
The number of cases per 100,000 over the previous 14 days.
The number of hospitalised patients.
The number of patients in Intensive Care Units.
The government ranks eleven of Slovenia’s twelve statistical regions as RED:
Central Slovenia
Gorenjska
Goriška
Koroška
Podravska
Pomurska
Primorsko-Notranjska
Savinjska
Southeastern Slovenia
Zasavska
Posavska
Obalno-kraška
In these regions (which include the city of Ljubljana), the following additional rules will apply, in addition to the measures outlined above:
Face masks must be worn in all public spaces at all times
No visits to care homes or hospitals
Closure of restaurants and bars
Closure of gym and sports facilities for recreational team sports
Beauty salons and hairdressers to serve one customer at a time
Total ban on all public events, except those already mandated by the National Public Health Authority (NIJZ)
Suspension of all non-essential hospital and dentist visits
For the region rated as Amber, (Obalno-kraška) the following additional restrictions apply:
The number of people in indoor spaces will be limited by the size of the space.
There are no visits to care homes or hospitals.
Public transport (buses and trains) is running. You are required to wear a protective mask, sanitise your hands with the supplied hand sanitiser and maintain a safety distance of at least 1.5m.
Wherever possible, tickets should be bought in advance (online, ticket machines and at sales counters). Taxi services continue to be available.
