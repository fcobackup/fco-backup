The information on this page covers the most common types of travel and reflects the UK government’s understanding of the rules currently in place. Unless otherwise stated, this information is for travellers using a full ‘British Citizen’ passport.
The authorities in the country or territory you’re travelling to are responsible for setting and enforcing the rules for entry. If you’re unclear about any aspect of the entry requirements, or you need further reassurance, you’ll need to contact the embassy, high commission or consulate of the country or territory you’re travelling to.
You should also consider checking with your transport provider or travel company to make sure your passport and other travel documents meet their requirements.
Entry rules in response to coronavirus (COVID-19)
Entry to Kazakhstan
Most foreign nationals, including those from the UK, are currently prevented from travelling to Kazakhstan.
Testing / screening on arrival
Travellers from most countries are required to show a coronavirus free certificate issued within five days of arrival.
Those who do arrive are also subject to 48 hours mandatory quarantine while testing for coronavirus takes place.
Monitoring measures may vary according to the severity of the outbreak in the country of origin, and could include:
daily health monitoring by telephone call after arrival
health monitoring at the traveller’s place of residence
quarantine in a hospital for 14 days
You should carry additional supplies of necessary medication and toiletries in carry-on luggage.
If you need further information about entry requirements, contact the local immigration authorities or the nearest Kazakh embassy. You should also check with your airline or travel company for the latest information.
Quarantine requirements
Travellers entering Kazakhstan who test positive for coronavirus are currently being confined in state facilities for 14 days upon arrival; this may be subject to change.
Data collection
Travellers are required to provide details of where they are staying in Kazakhstan and to confirm they will abide by all coronavirus restrictions.
Testing on departure
Travellers will be screened by having their temperature taken and assessed for other coronavirus symptoms on departure from Kazakhstan.
Regular entry requirements
Visas
A visa is required to enter Kazakhstan. This is a recent change, due to the coronavirus outbreak. Applicants must also present a medical certificate confirming that they do not have a coronavirus infection, issued within 48 hours prior to their visit to the consular office. Failure to present such a certificate will result in cancellation of the Kazakh visa.
You should contact your nearest Embassy of Kazakhstan for further information.
Make sure you have the right visa for the purpose of your travel, especially for business visas or work permits. Check the validity dates of your visa and any associated restrictions carefully before you travel.
If you violate the conditions of your visa, you could face a fine, a short term of imprisonment and/or a ban on entry to Kazakhstan for up to five years. Overstaying your visa may result in similar penalties. The Kazakh authorities recently announced that anyone who has overstayed their visa due to the coronavirus outbreak has until 5 August to leave the country, without a penalty.
Registration
As of 10 January 2020, it is the responsibility of the host person or hotel to notify immigration authorities of a foreigner’s arrival. The notification should be made within three working days from the date of the guest’s arrival in country and can be done online on the Visa and Migration portal or in writing to the Migration Service.
Passport validity
Your passport should be valid for a minimum period of three months beyond the expiry date of your visa. Your passport should also have at least 1 blank page for your visa.
UK Emergency Travel Documents
UK Emergency Travel Documents (ETDs) are accepted for entry, airside transit and exit from Kazakhstan. If using an ETD to leave Kazakhstan, you may need to get an exit visa from the Migration Service (formerly the OVIR). This process can take five working days or longer. Check with the Migration Service for more information before confirming your travel plans.
Dual nationality
Dual nationality isn’t recognised in Kazakhstan. If you enter Kazakhstan on a Kazakh passport and also hold British nationality the British Embassy can only provide very limited consular assistance. In cases of arrest or detention, consular access is unlikely to be granted.
Customs
The government of Kazakhstan imposes limits on how much foreign currency can be imported or exported, and certain goods are subject to custom regulations. For further information please visit the website of the Ministry of Foreign Affairs of the Republic of Kazakhstan.
