Coronavirus guidance is being updated.
Read the Prime Minister’s statement for the latest information.

The information on this page covers the most common types of travel and reflects the UK government’s understanding of the rules currently in place. Unless otherwise stated, this information is for travellers using a full ‘British Citizen’ passport.
The authorities in the country or territory you’re travelling to are responsible for setting and enforcing the rules for entry. If you’re unclear about any aspect of the entry requirements, or you need further reassurance, you’ll need to contact the embassy, high commission or consulate of the country or territory you’re travelling to.
You should also consider checking with your transport provider or travel company to make sure your passport and other travel documents meet their requirements.
Restrictions in response to coronavirus
Entry
Like other EU countries, Sweden has banned entry to non-EU and non-EEA citizens arriving from outside of the EU until at least 30 June. British nationals are not affected by this ban.
Restrictions by neighbouring countries
Countries neighbouring Sweden (Denmark, Norway and Finland) have introduced restrictions. The Danish Government has closed its borders to most foreign nationals until further notice. Those normally living and working in Denmark will still be able to enter the country from Sweden.
In addition, those who need to transit through Denmark in order to return to their place of residence will be able to. However tourists and those the Danish authorities say cannot demonstrate a recognised purpose (residence, work, delivery of goods, transit) to enter Denmark will not be allowed to cross the border.
Regular entry requirements
Border controls
Border controls are in place in Sweden for people travelling from Denmark via the Öresund crossing and arriving on ferries from Denmark and Germany. Make sure you carry a passport or national ID card when entering Sweden. More detailed information is available from the Swedish authorities.
Passport validity
Your passport should be valid for the proposed duration of your stay; you do not need any additional period of validity on your passport beyond this.
The rules on travel will stay the same until 31 December 2020.
Visas
If you hold a British Citizen passport, you do not need a visa to enter Sweden. If you’re planning a stay of longer than 3 months, see our Living in Sweden guide and contact the Swedish Embassy if you have further questions.
The rules on travel will stay the same until 31 December 2020.
UK Emergency Travel Documents
UK Emergency Travel Documents (ETDs) are accepted for entry, airside transit and exit from Sweden.
Travelling with children
If you’re travelling with children other than your own, you should carry a letter of consent from the child’s parent or guardian.
