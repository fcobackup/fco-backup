The organisation that has invited you should inform the chair or co-chair of the COVID-19 Incident Management System (IMS) in advance of your visit, of the purpose of your visit, the number of travellers, duration of visit, activity to be conducted, exact location you will stay, contact details while in Liberia, and address and contacts of references in Liberia.

Humanitarian workers deploying to Liberia
If you are deploying to Liberia for a period of less than 15 days you should contact your organisation for advice on which rules to follow.
If you are deploying to Liberia for a period of 15-60 days, you should follow a different process:
The organisation that is deploying you should inform the chair or co-chair of the COVID-19 Incident Management System (IMS) in advance of your proposed deployment, of the purpose of your deployment, the area of deployment, exact location you will stay, and contact details while in Liberia.
You must present a negative PCR COVID-19 test result certificate from an accredited lab within 96 hours of testing (i.e. your test sample must have been collected a maximum of 4 days before arrival in Liberia).
You must self-isolate for 7 days, beginning the day after arrival in Liberia. You must remain in your hotel or place of lodging and inform your employer if you develop any symptoms of COVID-19.
At the end of your 7-day self-isolation period, you must be tested for COVID-19 by the National Public Health Reference Laboratory team. Sample collection involves taking a swab of the inside of your nose and the back of your throat, using a long cotton bud, for PCR testing. Sample processing could take several days. See Testing on departure for information on test locations.
If your PCR test result is negative, you can proceed with your deployment. If your PCR test is positive, you will be subject to Liberia’s case management guidelines. This means NPHIL will consider on a case-by-case basis and you may be taken to a government COVID-19 treatment unit. Private health care facilities are not currently permitted to treat COVID-19 patients. Home-based care is considered on a case-by-case basis.
Exemptions to PCR testing on arrival:
Children under the age of 5 years old are exempt from COVID-19 testing and do not require a test result certificate.
Cabin crew, captains, flight engineers and first officers with layovers less than 48 hours are exempt from testing if they complete pre-boarding testing as per their airline’s policy and comply with screening procedures while in Liberia. They must complete screening on arrival and proceed to their designated flight crew hotel. If layover is more than 48 hours, cabin crew, captains, flight engineers and first officers must undergo PCR testing before leaving Liberia (see Testing on departure)
Diplomats and their families, honorary consuls, duly accredited international organisations’ staff and Liberian diplomats must present a negative PCR COVID-19 test result certificate from an accredited lab within 96 hours of testing (i.e. your test sample must have been collected a maximum of 4 days before arrival in Liberia). Alternatively, voluntary testing at the airport is available free of charge. If you do not present a valid negative PCR COVID-19 test result certificate, NPHIL staff will seek to test you on arrival.
You should not use the NHS testing service to get a test in order to facilitate your travel to another country. You should arrange to take a private test.
You should be prepared for travel restrictions, and changes to screening and quarantine requirements with no advance notice.
Quarantine requirements
Depending on the length and reason for you visit, you may not have to isolate on arrival. However, for the majority of travellers Liberia recommends self-isolation for 7 days after arrival. Humanitarian works staying longer than 15 days will need to isolate on arrival for 7 days and then take a further PCR test. There is a risk for British nationals of being put into a government quarantine or medical facility, either on arrival or during your trip to Liberia. Liberian precautionary observation centre (POCs) are basic, and not guaranteed to meet Public Health England standards.
You are at risk of being put into quarantine or instructed to self-isolate even after completing your 14 days of post-arrival self-isolation, if you develop symptoms (fever, cough or respiratory illness), or it is suspected you have been in contact with some who has tested positive for coronavirus. If you test positive for COVID-19, you may be transferred to a government quarantine facility or treatment centre. You are strongly advised to familiarise yourself with these risks before travelling.
If you are travelling on behalf of government, an international organisation/NGO or a company, you should check with your organisation whether they have pre-arranged a private POC, i.e. quarantine facility, authorised by NHPIL. The British Embassy cannot provide POC facilities. If you show symptoms, you may be transferred to a government POC or treatment centre
Visitors arriving on a laissez-passer (except UN or EU), may also be taken to quarantine for secondary screening. Any suspicion of illegal attempts to circumvent the process will result in 14 days of quarantine.
