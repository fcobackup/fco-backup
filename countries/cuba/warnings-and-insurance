Hurricane Rafael
Cuba experienced a nationwide electric grid outage following the passage of hurricane Rafael. Power is in the process of being restored. When restored, supply will be intermittent. Local transport may be disrupted due to fuel shortages.
You should monitor local media for updates, and take precautions including conserving water, food and mobile phone charge. Ensure you have enough fuel before setting off on your journey.
