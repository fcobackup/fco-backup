The FCO advise against all travel within 25km of Eritrea’s land borders, with the exception of the towns of Senafe and Tessenei (as shown on the map). See Local travel.
All foreign nationals must apply in advance for a travel permit to leave Asmara. This includes diplomats. See Travel permits and Consular assistance.
The Eritrean authorities consider all British nationals holding either Eritrean or PFDJ identity documents (including out of date documents) as Eritrean nationals. The British Embassy is unable to offer consular assistance to dual nationals in Eritrea. See Dual nationals.
Five British nationals were provided with consular assistance in Eritrea in 2017. Constraints on travel within Eritrea means the British embassy in Asmara is unable to offer consular assistance to British nationals outside Asmara.
Although there’s no recent history of terrorism in Eritrea, attacks can’t be ruled out. See Terrorism.
If you’re abroad and you need emergency help from the UK government, contact the nearest British embassy, consulate or high commission.
