The South African Government announced that its land border between South Africa and Lesotho is open. However Lesotho has not yet eased restrictions on its border. Crossing the land border between South Africa and Lesotho is therefore still restricted to the categories listed above. You can also enter South Africa via land borders if you are returning to the UK. See our Travel Advice for South Africa for further information.
Limited passenger air services between Johannesburg and Moshoeshoe International Airport have restarted. The categories of persons allowed entry and the COVID-19 PCR test requirements are the same as for the land borders.
From 9 January, visitors arriving into the UK who have been in or transited through Lesotho in the previous 10 days will not be permitted entry. British and Irish citizens, and third country nationals with residence rights in the UK arriving in the UK from Lesotho, need to self-isolate on their return. Check the latest guidance for England, Northern Ireland, Scotland and Wales. See Coronavirus.
From 1 January onwards those with residence rights includes: holders of Indefinite Leave to Remain; holders of existing leave to enter or remain (i.e those with biometric Residence permits) or an entry clearance/visa that grants such leave e.g. students, workers, etc (excluding visit visas); holders of EU Settlement Scheme (“EUSS”) leave; those who have rights of entry under the Withdrawal Agreements (including returning residents with a right of residence under the EEA Regulations and EEA frontier workers); family members of EEA nationals with rights under the Withdrawal Agreement.
Other countries may restrict movement or bring in new quarantine rules with little warning. You should check the travel advice for the countries on your route for the latest information.
See Entry requirements to find out what you will need to do when you arrive in Lesotho.

COVID-19 vaccines if you live in Lesotho
As information is available about the national vaccination programme, this page will be updated.
The Medicines and Healthcare Products Regulatory Agency (MHRA) is the UK authority responsible for assessing the safety, quality and efficacy of vaccines. It has authorised the Pfizer/BioNTech, Oxford/AstraZeneca and Moderna vaccines for temporary supply and use in the UK. Find out more about MHRA approval for these vaccines.
