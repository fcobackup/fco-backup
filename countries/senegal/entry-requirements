This page reflects the UK government’s understanding of current rules for people travelling on a full ‘British Citizen’ passport, for the most common types of travel.
The authorities in Senegal set and enforce entry rules. For further information contact the embassy, high commission or consulate of the country or territory you’re travelling to. You should also consider checking with your transport provider or travel company to make sure your passport and other travel documents meet their requirements.
Entry rules in response to coronavirus (COVID-19)
Entry to Senegal
British nationals are not subject to entry restrictions when entering Senegal.
Despite this, some airlines are only allowing foreign nationals with proof of residency in Senegal to travel. You should check with your airline before travelling what documentation you will need to carry with you.
Several airlines continue to request a letter of support from the Senegalese Embassy in London (or elsewhere if you are not travelling from the UK) before boarding flights to Senegal. Please note that the Senegalese Embassy has now stopped issuing letters of support for UK nationals to enter Senegal, as they are no longer required.
Airlines also request passengers to fill in a locator form at check-in.
To enter Senegal individuals over 2 years old must provide a negative PCR test dated no more than 5 days earlier, issued in the country where you started your trip and authorised by that country or a recognised health organisation.
You should not use the NHS testing service to get a test in order to facilitate your travel to another country. You should arrange to take a private test.
You must also complete and submit a ‘Public Health Passenger Locator’ form on arrival in Senegal. You’ll need to submit this form at border control. You can access the form on the Dakar Airport website.
