No current departure options
There are currently no commercial options available to return to the UK from Montenegro, due to measures taken by the government and neighbouring countries. Non-commercial air transport (general aviation) is exempt from this ban.
We know this is concerning for British people trying to leave Montenegro. The UK government is working closely with airlines, the Montenegrin authorities and other governments to make sure options are available for you to return to the UK as soon as possible.

You should contact your airline for the latest information on flight status and availability over the coming months, however please bear in mind that flights could be cancelled at short notice. Dubrovnik and Belgrade airports are open to commercial flights, from where it is possible to take connecting flights in order to return to the UK. Transit time must be less than 24 hours.
If you are a British national who wishes to leave Montenegro by car, please contact the British Embassy in Podgorica, for help with obtaining the necessary country exit permit from the Montenegrin authorities.
You will need to pay for your return travel to the UK. If departure options are available but you cannot afford the travel costs and have exhausted all other options for getting funds, you may be eligible to apply for an emergency loan from the government. This is a last resort option and you would need to repay the loan when you are back in the UK.
For more information, you should contact Corporate Travel Management (CTM). CTM are a commercial partner of the FCO and are authorised to administer such loans on behalf of the FCO.
