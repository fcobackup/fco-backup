Returning to the UK
Travelling from and returning to the UK
Check what you must do to travel abroad and return to England, Scotland, Wales or Northern Ireland.
If you plan to pass through another country to return to the UK, check the travel advice for the country you’re transiting. If you will pass through a red list country, book your hotel quarantine package before travelling to the UK.
You are responsible for organising your own COVID-19 test, in line with UK government testing requirements. Testing is widely available from private clinics in New Providence and in main tourist locations on outer islands. A list of testing sites is available.
Be prepared for your plans to change
No travel is risk-free during COVID. Countries may further restrict travel or bring in new rules at short notice, for example due to a new COVID-19 variant. Check with your travel company or airline for any transport changes which may delay your journey home.
If you test positive for COVID-19 in The Bahamas before returning to the UK, you will be expected to self-isolate in a hotel, private residence or medical facility. You should also be expected to be contacted by local health authorities to confirm that you are complying with self-isolation rules. Should you need to leave your place of self-isolation for essential purposes then arrangements can be made with the local authorities. It is important to note that people under 17 years of age cannot apply for a Travel Health visa. They must therefore arrive in The Bahamas with a parent or guardian.
Plan ahead and make sure you:
can access money
understand what your insurance will cover
can make arrangements to extend your stay and be away for longer than planned
