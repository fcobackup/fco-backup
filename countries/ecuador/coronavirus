Travel in Ecuador
As of 4 May, the Government introduced a new phase of “social distancing” to loosen up restrictions progressively according to the situation in each canton. The system has three levels: red, amber and green.
Public spaces and services
On 15 June, President Moreno renewed the state of emergency for a further 60 days. It will now remain in force until 15 August. This includes general nationwide measures such as:
self-isolation and extra precaution advised for people over 60 years old, and people whose medical conditions make them vulnerable to COVID-19
mandatory use of face masks in public spaces. Fines will be given to those who do not comply. Each city will define the cost of the fine
strong recommendation for all individuals to comply with social distancing measures and practice frequent hand washing
pubs, nightclubs and children playgrounds remain closed
schools at all levels and universities remain closed nationwide. Classes will be delivered online
all public gatherings are prohibited
physical activities in closed spaces will be limited to those Green-rated cantons. Outdoor activities are allowed if they comply with local social distancing measures approved by each canton
from 5 August, some beaches will reopen and will be monitored through the “Distancia2” app
tourist transport operators (vehicles and boats) will be allowed to provide their services in Amber and Green level cities. Other transport services (door to door) remain forbidden
inter-provincial travel by private car is permitted between Amber and Green level cities
inter-provincial travel is allowed between Amber and Green level cities and where local governments have agreed to open bus terminals
passengers travelling on domestic flights between Quito and Guayaquil must present a negative COVID-19 test. The authorities will accept antibody tests (“quick tests”) and Polymerase Chain Reaction tests (PCR) taken at laboratories approved by the Ministry of Health. PCR tests will be valid if taken up to 72 hours prior to departure and quick tests within 24 hours. Tests can be taken at airports. This measure will run until 21 August. From then on, random tests will be carried out
passengers who have completed mandatory self-isolation (APO) at authorised hotels/temporary accommodation, are no longer required to have a COVID-19 test for domestic flights, just to present their APO certificate issued by the Ministry of Health
inter-provincial package deliveries are allowed
all businesses and industries must prepare a health prevention protocol to address COVID-19
