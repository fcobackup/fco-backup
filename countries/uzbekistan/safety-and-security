Crime
Violent crimes against foreign nationals are rare. Muggings, pick pocketing, snatch-and-grab robberies, theft of unattended bags and purse snatching are believed to be more common, especially in crowded places (bazaars, public transportation). Home burglaries and break-ins occur, even in wealthier neighbourhoods.
You should exercise caution and take measures to protect your personal security as you would when visiting any European country.
There have been reports of raids on local establishments, including restaurants. Foreigners haven’t been deliberately targeted, but the use of violence against restaurant guests and staff has been reported. If you’re caught up in such a situation like this, keep calm, follow any instructions given and leave the area as soon as it is permitted and safe to do so.
Dual nationality
Dual nationality is not recognised in Uzbekistan. If you enter Uzbekistan on an Uzbek passport and also hold British nationality the British Embassy can only provide very limited consular assistance. In cases of arrest or detention consular access is unlikely to be granted.
Local travel
Much of the guidance in the following (travel) sections has been overtaken by the strict measures put in place by the Uzbek Government and internationally to combat the spread of Covid-19. But it remains valid in the longer term, once normal travel in and to Uzbekistan can resume.
On 1 May 2020, a partial collapse of the Sardoba Reservoir dam caused significant flooding in the Syrdarya region. You should exercise caution if within the area and follow the advice of local authorities and emergency services.
On 6 November 2019, it was reported that 17 people were killed in an armed attack on a Tajik security check-point on the Uzbek/Tajik border. Daesh/ISIS claimed responsibility. You should exercise caution and vigilance, particularly if travelling near or across the Uzbek/Tajik border.
Tensions exist over recognition of the Uzbek/Kyrgyz border. There have been a number of security incidents in this region including several gunfire exchanges. As above, security incidents have also been reported along the Uzbek/Tajik border.
Land borders between Uzbekistan and neighbouring states, particularly Kyrgyzstan and Tajikistan, are often closed at short notice. Check in advance which border posts are open. The land border with Afghanistan is currently closed.
Care should be taken when travelling in the areas bordering Tajikistan, Kyrgyzstan and Afghanistan, as some border areas may be land-mined. Borders crossing points are also subject to closure without notice.
Take care if you travel to the Fergana Valley given the potential for tensions in the region.
Road travel
If you drive in Uzbekistan, make sure you have all registration papers, including motor insurance. You must carry your UK Driving Licence or an International Driving Permit at all times.
You can drive in Uzbekistan with a valid UK driving licence for the whole length of your visit. It is recommended to make a copy of your driving licence translated either into Russian or Uzbek to make interaction with local authorities and traffic police easier, although it is not legally required. If you’re living in Uzbekistan, it is recommended to get a local driving licence or its equivalent.
If you choose to use an International Driving Permit, from 28 March 2019, you will need to have a 1968 International Driving Permit (IDP) to drive in Uzbekistan. From 1 February 2019, you can only get IDPs over the counter from 2,500 UK Post Offices. You will not be able to buy an IDP outside the UK, so get one before you travel.
Take care as many roads are poorly-surfaced and badly-lit.
Driving is on the right in Uzbekistan. Vehicles approaching a roundabout have the right of way over vehicles already on the roundabout.
Seatbelts for drivers and passengers are compulsory and the use of mobile phones while driving is prohibited.
There are security checkpoints at the city limits of Tashkent and other towns.
A new regulation has been introduced allowing only licensed taxis (with certain colour and signs and card payment equipment) to operate in Uzbekistan. However, unlicensed taxis continue to operate. You should use official taxis where possible.
Many buses and taxis in Uzbekistan run on Compressed Natural Gas and safety regulations are often not followed. Where possible you should opt for modern vehicles when travelling by bus or taxi.
You’re advised to use only official taxis. Many do not have rear seat belts, so you may wish to ask for a taxi with seat belts in the front and rear.
Rail travel
Take care when travelling long distances by train. If you have to travel overnight, keep valuables in a safe place. Don’t leave your belongings in the compartment unattended. Lock the door from the inside. You will need to present your passport with valid visa when booking train tickets.
Air travel
Uzbekistan Airways operate regular services to a number of European destinations, including London, although presently flights are limited due to COVID restrictions. Uzbekistan is also served by Turkish Airlines.
We can’t offer advice on the safety of individual airlines. However, the International Air Transport Association publishes a list of registered airlines that have been audited and found to meet a number of operational safety standards and recommended practices. This list is not exhaustive and the absence of an airline from this list does not necessarily mean that it is unsafe.
In 2008 the International Civil Aviation Organisation carried out an audit of the level of implementation of the critical elements of safety oversight in Uzbekistan.
A list of incidents and accidents in Uzbekistan can be found on the website of the Aviation Safety Network.
Political situation
The political situation in Uzbekistan is stable.
You should avoid any demonstrations or large gatherings of people. Exercise caution and maintain a high level of security awareness, particularly in public places.
