This page has information on travelling to Hong Kong.
This page reflects the UK government’s understanding of current rules for people travelling on a full ‘British Citizen’ passport from the UK, for the most common types of travel.
The authorities in Hong Kong set and enforce entry rules. If you’re unsure how Hong Kong’s entry requirements apply to you, contact its UK embassy, high commission or consulate.
All travellers
Although Hong Kong is now part of the People’s Republic of China, it remains a Special Administrative Region (SAR) with its own immigration controls. You can visit Hong Kong for up to 6 months without a visa. For up-to-date advice on entry requirements and restrictions, please visit the Hong Kong SAR Government’s website.
Hong Kong does not require travellers to provide a negative Covid-19 test result to enter the SAR, regardless of your vaccination status.
All travellers must pass temperature checks upon arrival.
Flights may be subject to scheduling change at short notice. Ensure you keep in close contact with your airline and be prepared to change your plans.
Testing on arrival
The Hong Kong Government continues to advise all inbound travellers to conduct daily rapid antigen tests from the day of arrival into Hong Kong (that is, Day 0) and Day 5 after arrival.
If you test positive for COVID-19, you are no longer required to isolate, however please refer to the latest guidance issued by the Hong Kong SAR Government on how to minimise the spread of Covid-19.
Proof of vaccination status
Travellers do not need to be fully vaccinated, or show proof of vaccination to enter Hong Kong.
