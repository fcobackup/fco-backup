Travel in Switzerland
You should follow the rules on hygiene and social distancing. These include:
Washing your hands regularly and thoroughly
Keeping a distance of at least 1.5 metres from other people
If it is not possible to maintain that distance, wear a face mask.
Wearing a face mask is compulsory when travelling on public transport, and at Geneva, Zurich and Basel airports. It is compulsory to wear a face mask on all flights to and from Switzerland. Failure to do so is punishable by a fine. Children under the age of 12 are exempt from this requirement, as are individuals who are unable to wear a mask for medical reasons. Cantons have imposed further restrictions, and you should check cantonal websites for further details.
Public spaces and services
Gatherings of more than 15 people are prohibited in public places. Wearing a face mask is compulsory in public places such as shops, banks, post offices, museums, libraries and cinemas. Failure to do so is punishable by a fine. Businesses and public services are open with social distancing measures in place. Eating and drinking in restaurants and bars must be at a table. You may be asked to leave your details (e.g. when visiting bars and restaurants) to enable contact tracing.
Cantons have imposed further restrictions, and you should check cantonal websites for further details.
