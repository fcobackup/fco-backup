There is potential for further demonstrations with a risk of violence in Santiago, Valparaiso, Viña del Mar, Antofagasta, Concepcion and other major cities.
In Santiago, protests largely took place in Plaza Baquedano/Plaza Italia and in Las Condes, Providencia and Vitacura districts. In Valparaiso, protests have frequently taken place on a Friday. If protests take place, you should follow the instructions and advice of the local authorities, remain vigilant, monitor local media for updates and avoid protests and demonstrations.
