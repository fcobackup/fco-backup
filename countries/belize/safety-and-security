Terrorism in Belize 
Although there is no recent history of terrorism in Belize, attacks cannot be ruled out.  
Political situation  
Political demonstrations take place in Belize City and Belmopan, but most are peaceful. Follow the local media and avoid large gatherings and demonstrations. 
Travel near the Belize-Guatemala border 
Only use officially recognised border crossings. The official land border with Guatemala is the Western Border at Benque Viejo Del Carmen. You can also go by boat from Punta Gorda to Puerto Barrios or Livingston.  
Crime 
You should report all incidents of crime, including assault, robbery and theft to the police. Call the police on 911 to make a statement. Investigations could take several weeks. For a fee, you can get a copy of the police report. Police capacity is limited and many crimes remain unsolved. 
Violent crime and criminal gangs 
Belize has one of the highest murder rates in the world. Cases of armed robberies, burglaries, theft, rape and sexual assault are on the increase. 
Serious gang-related violence happens in Belize City, particularly in the area to the south of the Haulover Creek (known as Southside). Tourists are not normally the targets of gang violence, but anyone near an incident could be affected. You should: 
follow the advice of your hotel and local authorities  
be watchful of your surroundings 
On 26 March, in response to escalating public safety concerns following a recent spate of shootings and retaliations in specific areas, the Government implemented a State of Public Emergency in Southside Belize City, Hattieville area and parts of the Cayo District: Roaring Creek Village, Another World area and Young Bank area, Camalote village). Heightened security in those areas includes a greater police presence and a curfew for minors from 8pm to 6am unless accompanied by an adult.
Armed criminal gangs have been active in the remote forested areas of Belize, particularly the border area with Guatemala and close to tourist sites. However, the area is patrolled by the Belize Defence Force and incidents of crime affecting tourists are uncommon. 
Muggings 
Most muggings happen in Belize City, but can also take place elsewhere, including tourist destinations such as San Pedro, Caye Caulker, Placencia and San Ignacio. You should: 
avoid dark alleys 
not hitchhike or accept lifts from strangers 
keep valuables out of sight  
be aware that wearing expensive jewellery could attract attention 
try to travel in groups 
use a qualified guide for trips off the beaten track 
only use accommodation and campgrounds that appear genuine and established

Transport risks  
Road travel  
If you are planning to drive in Belize, see information on driving abroad.   
You can use a UK photocard driving licence to drive in Belize for up to 3 months. If you still have a paper driving licence, you may need to update it to a photocard licence. For longer stays, you must get a Belize driving permit from the Department of Transport in your district.  
Driving standards 
Road traffic accidents are common. Local driving and vehicle maintenance standards are poor. Public buses are not well maintained and many do not have seatbelts. Take care when driving, particularly during rainy conditions. If you need to drive at night, be aware of the risks, including: 
high levels of drink-driving  
mostly unlit highways 
roads with potholes, unpaved dirt shoulders and few lane markings  
flooded temporary bridges and causeways during severe weather in southern parts of the country, particularly in Stann Creek and Toledo
Taxis  
Only take registered taxis with green licence plates. Always ask the fare before getting in, and expect to pay in cash.  
Extreme weather and natural disasters 
Read more advice on what to do if you are caught up in extreme weather or natural hazards. 
Hurricanes  
The hurricane season normally runs from June to November. Monitor local weather updates from the National Meteorological Service of Belize and follow any advice from the National Emergency Management Organisation. 
Flooding 
Heavy rainfall can cause flooding. Follow the weather forecasts from the National Hydrological Service.  
Earthquakes 
Belize is not directly affected by earthquakes, but tremors from earthquakes in neighbouring countries can occasionally be felt in Belize. There can occasionally be tsunami warnings.   
The US Federal Emergency Management Agency has advice about what to do before, during and after an earthquake.
