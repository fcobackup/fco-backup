There are currently no commercial options available to return to the UK from Cameroon. Cameroon’s land, sea and air borders are closed and international flights suspended until further notice.
UK special flight
Booking has now closed for a special flight the UK will operate from Douala and Yaoundé on Thursday 14 May for British tourists, short term visitors and their direct dependants to return to the UK. This will be the only option to return to the UK for the foreseeable future.
Travel to the airport
You should travel to the airport as you normally would, by private or public transport.
All passengers will have their temperature checked on arrival at the airport and anyone displaying coronavirus (COVID-19) symptoms will not be allowed to travel. Bring your own mask or face covering and gloves as you will not be allowed into the airport without them.
Your journey home
The National Travel Health Network and Centre (NaTHNaC) provides advice on how to stay safe as you travel by air.
When you arrive back in the UK, follow the guidance for when you return to the UK on steps you should take to protect yourself and others.
Future travel options
If you cannot leave Cameroon at this time, see advice on staying in Cameroon during coronavirus.
The UK government is working closely with airlines, the Cameroonian authorities and other governments to make sure options are available for you to return to the UK as soon as possible. A number of chartered repatriation flights organised by foreign governments have successfully left Cameroon and there may be further flights arranged. There are occasionally places available on these for British nationals.
Information about these flights is generally only available at short notice therefore you should e-mail ConsularYaoundeEnquiries@fco.gov.uk with your full name, date of birth, passport number, telephone number, address in the UK and e-mail address if you are seeking to leave Cameroon.

Help and support
You will need to pay for your return travel to the UK. If departure options are available but you cannot afford the travel costs and have exhausted all other options for getting funds, you may be eligible to apply for an emergency loan from the government. This is a last resort option and you would need to repay the loan when you are back in the UK. For more information, you should contact Corporate Travel Management (CTM). CTM are a commercial partner of the FCO and are authorised to administer such loans on behalf of the FCO.
If you need urgent consular assistance, you can contact the British High Commission on +44 207 008 1500 / +237 222220545.
The High Commission cannot provide further information or advice about departure options over the phone. This page will be updated when UK and commercial departure options become available. To get the latest information, sign up for travel advice email alerts.
