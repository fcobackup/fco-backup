COVID-19 restrictions are likely to remain in some areas. Even where city-wide lockdowns have been lifted, further localised lockdowns are likely to be imposed where positive COVID-19 cases are identified. There may be requirements for those wishing to depart certain cities. You should check carefully before you travel as local arrangements are liable to change at short notice.
If you’re planning travel to China, find out what you need to know about entry requirements in the Entry requirements section.
It is more important than ever to get travel insurance and check it provides sufficient cover. See the FCDO’s guidance on foreign travel insurance.
The Chinese authorities continue to impose various control and quarantine measures across the country. This includes restrictions on movement, reduced transport, entry and exit controls for cities, towns and villages, and isolation requirements for travel between different parts of the country. Lockdowns can be implemented with little warning and may result in disruptions to medical and other basic services, including food delivery. You should ensure you have prepared additional supplies of food, water and medication.
If you test positive for COVID-19 you will be placed into a designated COVID hospital for centralized care. You will remain there until you have tested negative for COVID-19 multiple times, the processes for which can take a number of weeks. You may be separated from your child if one of you tests positive for coronavirus. Whilst we cannot prevent this, if it happens to you or is about to happen, you can call +86 (0)10 8529 6600 for 24/7 urgent consular assistance. Non-residents may be charged for their care.

In light of protests and demonstrations in Hong Kong, there are reports of greater scrutiny from mainland authorities at border crossings between the mainland and Hong Kong.

China has a zero tolerance policy on drugs. There are severe penalties for drugs-related offences including the death penalty. Police often raid bars and nightclubs checking for the use of illicit substances. Raids on private homes have also occurred. See Local laws and customs
Terrorists are likely to try to carry out attacks in China. Although foreigners haven’t been specifically targeted, attacks may occur in places visited by foreigners. You should take particular care during national holidays or when transiting public transport hubs, and always follow the advice of the local authorities. Previous attacks have targeted public places including on one occasion at a railway station and an open air market in 2014. There have been no recent attacks in the main tourist areas. The risk is higher in the Xinjiang Uyghur Autonomous region. You should take particular care and remain vigilant when travelling to or within Xinjiang. See Terrorism

If you’ve formally renounced Chinese citizenship, you should carry evidence that you have done so. See Local laws and customs
