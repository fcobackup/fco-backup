Cases of coronavirus (COVID-19) have been confirmed in Ghana. The Ghanaian authorities have introduced a number of measures to limit the spread of the virus.
The Government of Ghana has set out guidance to curb the spread of coronavirus: gatherings of 25 or above are no longer allowed to take place unless it is a funeral, people are strongly advised to wash their hands, use hand sanitisers and avoid shaking-hands with one another. People are advised to adhere to strict social distancing.
On 19 April, the Government of Ghana announced the lifting of movement restrictions in Greater Accra and Greater Kumasi effective from 01:00 GMT on 20 April. Businesses are now open, but schools, restaurants and public gatherings remain closed. Domestic flights are permitted to fly - contact your local airline for details. International flights remain suspended. See the Ministry of Information for full details on the restriction of movement, including a list of affected areas.

Entry and borders
Given the rise of the number of cases of coronavirus (COVID-19) in Ghana, on 21 March the Government of Ghana announced the closure of the country’s borders until further notice. International flights into Ghana and all international flights out of Ghana are suspended. This means British Nationals cannot enter Ghana at the current time.
