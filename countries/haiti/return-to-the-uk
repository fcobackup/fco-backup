All commercial flight options for British nationals to return to the UK from Haiti have ceased and no further flights are currently planned.
We know this is concerning for British people trying to leave Haiti. The UK government will continue working closely with airlines, the Haitian authorities and other governments to make sure options are available for you to return to the UK.
What to do
If you cannot leave Haiti at this time, you should:
follow the advice of local authorities, including local measures to help minimise your risk of exposure to coronavirus
find accommodation that’s suitable for your needs
keep in regular contact with family and friends at home, so they know you are safe and well
let us know you are in Haiti by e-mailing us: UK.inDominicanRepublic@fco.gov.uk

Future travel options
The UK government is working closely with airlines, the Haitian authorities and other governments to make sure options are available for you to return to the UK as soon as possible.
This travel advice will be updated when departure options become available. Sign up for travel advice email alerts and follow the British Embassy on Twitter.
You will need to pay for your return travel to the UK. If departure options are available but you cannot afford the travel costs and have exhausted all other options for getting funds, you may be eligible to apply for an emergency loan from the government. This is a last resort option and you would need to repay the loan when you are back in the UK. For more information, you should contact Corporate Travel Management (CTM). CTM are a commercial partner of the FCO and are authorised to administer such loans on behalf of the FCO.
Arrival in the UK
When you arrive back in the UK, follow the guidance for when you return to the UK on steps you should take to protect yourself and others.
Help and support
