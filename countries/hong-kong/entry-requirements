This page reflects the UK government’s understanding of current rules for people travelling on a full ‘British Citizen’ passport, for the most common types of travel.
The authorities in Hong Kong set and enforce entry rules. For further information contact the embassy, high commission or consulate of the country or territory you’re travelling to. You should also consider checking with your transport provider or travel company to make sure your passport and other travel documents meet their requirements.
Entry rules in response to coronavirus (COVID-19)
Entry to Hong Kong
Currently the UK is on the Hong Kong SAR government’s list of “high risk places”. This means that most travellers arriving from the UK must be fully vaccinated Hong Kong residents. From 29 October, proof of a single dose of the BioNTech vaccination will be accepted for 12-17 year-old Hong Kong residents travelling from the UK, or those unable to receive a second vaccination for health reasons. Accompanied minors who are Hong Kong residents or children of Hong Kong residents (who are below the age of 12) are also allowed to enter Hong Kong. All other persons from ‘high risk places’ will be denied entry to Hong Kong.
Travellers arriving to Hong Kong will need to provide a negative nucleic acid test result for COVID-19, taken no more than 72 hours prior to their departure. Effective from 26 June, the Hong Kong Government has specified that this must be a polymerase chain reaction (PCR) based nucleic acid test. Other types of tests such as the reverse transcription loop-mediated isothermal amplification (RT- LAMP) will not be accepted and do not fulfil the relevant boarding requirement.
Travellers from “high risk” places will then be subject to 21 days of compulsory quarantine at a designated quarantine hotel on arrival, followed by 7 days of self-monitoring. Travellers arriving at Hong Kong International Airport from these places need to provide confirmation of a hotel room reservation in a designated quarantine hotel in Hong Kong for 21 days, starting on the day of their arrival. You should check the Hong Kong SAR government’s website for important details about the documents required and check the Hong Kong SAR government’s list of designated hotels when you make your booking. You must take designated transport, which is provided by the government, from the airport to your hotel.
Enhanced Quarantine & Surveillance Measures on Omicron Variant
Effective from 28 November the Hong Kong SAR Government have implemented additional quarantine requirements in response to the Omicron variant. Travellers from specified “high risk” countries will be required to serve the first seven days of their quarantine period at the Hong Kong SAR government’s Penny’s Bay Quarantine Centre, as well as undergo daily testing whilst there. You can find further details on the Hong Kong SAR government website.
At the airport
All passengers, whether departing, arriving or transferring/transiting need to wear facemasks in all passenger accessible areas of Hong Kong International Airport. You can find further details on the Hong Kong SAR government website.
Demonstrating your COVID-19 status
The Hong Kong SAR government will accept the UK’s proof of COVID-19 recovery and vaccination record. Your NHS appointment card from vaccination centres is not designed to be used as proof of vaccination and should not be used to demonstrate your vaccine status.
Health declaration form
All inbound travellers via Hong Kong International Airport need to submit a health declaration form.
Testing on arrival
All travellers ending their journey at Hong Kong International Airport will have to provide a saliva sample which will be tested for coronavirus. After collecting baggage, travellers will be taken by shuttle bus to the designated location. Travellers will have to wait for test results, before proceeding to their mandatory quarantine hotel.
Travellers will be required to remain at the airport, or a specified hotel overnight, whilst awaiting test results. Passengers arriving on morning flights must proceed to the Temporary Specimen Collection Centre located in the Midfield Concourse (MFC) in the restricted area of Hong Kong International Airport. You will receive test results on the same day. This could take 8 or more hours. Passengers arriving in the afternoon and evening will need to wait for test results overnight, and will be temporarily accommodated in the Department of Health Holding Centre for Test Results (HCTR) set up in the Rambler Hotel in Tsing Yi. Please note that children under the age of 16 cannot stay at the Rambler Hotel unaccompanied. Parents who stay with their child at the HCTR on the first night whilst awaiting test results, will have to continue to self-isolate for the full 14 days. If travelling unaccompanied, there is a risk that a child may have to stay alone overnight at the airport on arrival while awaiting test results. Further information is available on the Centre for Health Protection’s website.
Children over the age of 16 travelling to Hong Kong on their own must be met by an adult for checking in to the HCTR whilst they await test results. Please contact the Port Health Authority for the latest guidance (+852 3904 9333).
If the sample tests positive, the Hong Kong authorities will notify the individual and arrange for admission to a public hospital where they will remain in isolation until for at least 10 days. The individual must then undergo a further 14 days in a quarantine facility. If you are deemed to be a close contact of a positive case, you will be place in a Hong Kong government quarantine centre for 21 days. All arrivals including those who test negative for coronavirus need to undergo 21-day compulsory quarantine in a designated hotel. See “Quarantine requirements” below.
You may be separated from your child if one of you tests positive for coronavirus. If this happens to you, you can call +(852) 2901 3000 for 24/7 urgent consular assistance.
Quarantine requirements
Quarantine is mostly spent at a designated hotel. Family members of someone who tests positive, or those who have been in close contact, will be placed in a government quarantine centre.
Children travelling alone will also need to quarantine for 21 days on arrival in a designated hotel. It is down to hotel policy whether a child can self-isolate alone. Further details can be found on the Hong Kong SAR government’s website and you should call the Port Heath Division (+852 3904 9333) to understand the latest requirements if your child is travelling alone.

For all quarantine arrangements in Hong Kong:
you’re not allowed to leave your designated quarantine location for 21 days. This means you’re also unable to leave Hong Kong for the duration of the quarantine
if you’re allocated a government quarantine centre, you may be asked to contribute around £20 (HK$200) per night towards the cost
items that can be taken in to government quarantine are restricted. There is no smoking allowed and no alcohol. Depending on your centre, facilities may be basic: there may be no fridge and no air-conditioning
you will be issued with a bluetooth-enabled wristband which will be activated at the airport and linked to a mobile app ‘StayHomeSafe’ on your phone. The bluetooth-enabled wristbands will alert the authorities if the wearer leaves their registered address with or without their phone
Failure to comply with the quarantine conditions may result in you being immediately taken to government quarantine facilities. You could face a 6-month prison sentence and a substantial fine. You should comply with the requirements of your quarantine arrangements.
See the Hong Kong government coronavirus website for further information.
Transiting Hong Kong
Transit services at Hong Kong International Airport resumed on 15 June 2020 for passengers who can be checked through from port of origin to final destination. Transiting between flights operated by different airlines is now allowed. Transiting through Hong Kong from, but not to, mainland China is now allowed. You should check with your travel agent or airline before travelling and check the Hong Kong International Airport website.
There is a risk you will be placed into isolation in hospital in Hong Kong or 21 days government quarantine. All passengers transiting Hong Kong International Airport will be subject to advanced screening measures, including temperature checks. Passengers deemed to have a high temperature will undergo further checks by the Port Health Office at the airport. If you meet further risk criteria, you will be transferred to a Hong Kong public hospital for mandatory checks/treatment, where it is highly likely you will be asked to complete a mandatory COVID-19 test. If you successfully pass health screening you need to sit in designated areas at boarding gates and use designated queues in dining facilities and shops, in line with Hong Kong International Airport anti-virus measures.
Travel between Hong Kong, Macao and mainland China
All border crossings with mainland China remain closed indefinitely, with the exception of the Shenzhen Bay Checkpoint and the Hong Kong-Zhuhai-Macau Bridge. All passengers wanting to board a shuttle bus to cross the bridge departing from Hong Kong to Macau must present a certificate confirming that they have tested negative for COVID-19 within seven days of their departure. The special ferry service between Taipa Ferry Terminal in Macao and Hong Kong International Airport has now ceased operations. All ferry crossings between Hong Kong and mainland China are currently not in operation with the exception of the service from Shenzhen Shekou Port to Hong Kong International Airport. Kai Tak Cruise and Ocean Terminals are also closed to passengers indefinitely.
Arrivals from mainland China, Taiwan and Macao must quarantine at home or in a hotel for 14 days. Certain groups of people travelling from mainland China, Taiwan and Macao may be granted an exemption from quarantine requirements by applying in advance to the Chief Secretary of the Administration. These groups include people involved in receiving or providing education and those travelling for purposes relating to manufacturing operations, business activities or the provision of professional services in the interest of Hong Kong’s economic development.
Hong Kong residents in mainland China may be eligible for the Return2hk scheme, which enables quarantine free travel from mainland China to Hong Kong. You can find further information on the Hong Kong SAR government coronavirus website.
