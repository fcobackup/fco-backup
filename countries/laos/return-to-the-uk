Departing after 12 December 2021
If you plan to fly from, or depart, Laos after 12 December 2021, you do not need to notify the British Embassy. We have confirmed to the Ministry of Foreign Affairs that the final notification we will send will be for any flights on 12 December. Normal immigration procedures should be now in operation.
The British Embassy recommends arriving to check in as early as possible for flights, and building in additional time for border crossings to take into account any teething issues as immigration processes restart.
Any British nationals who have contacted us regarding departures after this date should receive a communication about the new arrangements.
