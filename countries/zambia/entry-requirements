This advice reflects the UK government’s understanding of current rules for people travelling on a full ‘British citizen’ passport from the UK, for the most common types of travel.
The authorities in Zambia set and enforce entry rules. If you’re not sure how these requirements apply to you, contact the Zambian High Commission in the UK.
COVID-19 rules
There are no COVID-19 testing or vaccination requirements for travellers entering Zambia.
Passport validity requirements
To enter Zambia, your passport must have an ‘expiry date’ at least 6 months after the date you arrive. It must have at least 2 blank pages for entry stamping.  
Make sure you get your passport stamped.
Check with your travel provider that your passport and other travel documents meet requirements. Renew your passport if you need to.
You will be denied entry if you do not have a valid travel document or try to use a passport that has been reported lost or stolen.
Dual nationality
Zambia recognises dual nationality. However, to avoid delays at the airport you should leave Zambia on the same passport you used to enter.
Visa requirements
You must have a visa to enter Zambia. If you’re a visitor, and your visit is less than 90 days, you can get a visa on arrival. You must be able to show:
valid return or onward tickets
enough money for your stay
You can also get visas in advance using Zambia’s e-visa service.
If you’re a business traveller, you can get a free 30-day visa on arrival by showing a letter of invitation from the sponsoring organisation. After 30 days you must apply for a temporary employment permit at a Zambia immigration office. This will allow you to stay in Zambia for the duration of the permit. 
For further information, contact the Zambian High Commission in the UK or the Zambian Department of Immigration.
KAZA UNIVISA
The KAZA UNIVISA, for use in the Kavango Zambezi Transfrontier Conservation Area, is valid for unlimited travel between Zambia and Zimbabwe and for day trips to Botswana. It costs 50 US dollars and is valid for 30 days.
You can apply online in advance, or get the visa on arrival if you are arriving at:
Kenneth Kaunda International Airport, Lusaka
Harry Mwanga Nkumbula International Airport, Livingstone
by land at Livingstone, Victoria Falls (Zambia-Zimbabwe border)
by land at Kazungula (Zambia-Botswana border)
Departure tax
On leaving Zambia, all air passengers must pay the equivalent to 25 US dollars and a security charge of 3 US dollars. Both charges are normally included in the cost of an air ticket, but you will have to pay in cash with Zambian kwacha if they are not.
Vaccination requirements
At least 8 weeks before your trip, check the vaccinations and certificates you need in TravelHealthPro’s Zambia guide.
Depending on your circumstances, this may include a yellow fever vaccination certificate.
Customs rules
There are strict rules about goods you can take into or out of Zambia. You must declare anything that may be prohibited or subject to tax or duty.
