The information on this page covers the most common types of travel and reflects the UK government’s understanding of the rules currently in place. Unless otherwise stated, this information is for travellers using a full ‘British Citizen’ passport.
The authorities in the country or territory you’re travelling to are responsible for setting and enforcing the rules for entry. If you’re unclear about any aspect of the entry requirements, or you need further reassurance, you’ll need to contact the embassy, high commission or consulate of the country or territory you’re travelling to.
International air passengers arriving in Pakistan from 00:01 UTC/ 05:01 PST on 21 March will need to present an original test result for coronavirus (COVID-19). The test must have been taken in the 24 hours prior to boarding the flight, and must show the name and passport number of the passenger. You will be required to complete a separate health declaration form on arrival in Pakistan. UK health institutions do not issue coronavirus (COVID-19) medical certificates. From 00:01 UTC/ 05:01 PST on 21 March the risk of being unable to enter Pakistan will be extremely high. You should factor this into your travel plans, and contact your airline. International arrivals, in particular those showing symptoms of coronavirus (COVID-19) on arrival at Karachi airport, may be asked by the Provincial Government of Sindh to self-isolate for 14 days.
You should also consider checking with your transport provider or travel company to make sure your passport and other travel documents meet their requirements.
