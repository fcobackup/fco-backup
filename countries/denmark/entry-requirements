This page has information on travelling to Denmark. Check what you must do to return to the UK.
This page reflects the UK government’s understanding of current rules for people travelling on a full ‘British Citizen’ passport from the UK, for the most common types of travel.
The authorities in Denmark set and enforce entry rules. You can check with the Danish authorities on their helpline (+45 7020 6044) for advice on the conditions of entry for foreign nationals.
If you’re fully vaccinated
If you are travelling from the UK to Denmark and have been fully vaccinated you can enter Denmark without a COVID-19 test or self-isolation.
You will need proof of being fully vaccinated at least 14 days prior to arrival.
Find out if you qualify as fully vaccinated in Denmark on the Danish coronavirus website.
Proof of vaccination status
You must present proof that you have been fully vaccinated to enter Denmark.
You can use the NHS COVID Pass to demonstrate your vaccination record when entering Denmark. If you have not received a booster (3rd dose of vaccine), your second vaccine dose must have been administered between 14 and 270 days prior to travel. If you are travelling with a printed PDF proof of vaccination status, it must date from 1 November to ensure that the certificate can be scanned successfully. Your NHS appointment card from vaccination centres is not designed to be used as proof of vaccination and should not be used to demonstrate your vaccine status.
If you’re not fully vaccinated
If you are travelling to Denmark from the UK and have not been fully vaccinated or recovered from COVID-19 you will need to:
take a COVID-19 test within 24 hours of arrival in Denmark
self-isolate for 10 days after arriving in Denmark. You can end self-isolation with a negative PCR-test taken at least 4 days after arrival.

You will need evidence of a positive PCR-test taken more than 11 days but less than 180 days ago.
Entry to the Faroe Islands
When you travel to the Faroe Islands or Greenland, you are entering the Kingdom of Denmark. This means that Danish COVID-19 entry requirements also apply to the Faroe Islands and Greenland. However, some local rules do apply.
Travel to the Faroe Islands
You are advised to take a COVID test two days after arrival, or if you have any symptoms.
If you have tested positive for COVID-19, you are required to self-isolate for at least 10 days, counting from the date your symptoms appeared and/or the date you received your positive test result. You will be contacted by the Chief Medical Officer, who will decide when you are recovered.
Everyone who has been in contact with an infected person should self-isolate for at least 10 days, regardless of vaccine received or previous infection status. The Chief Medical Officer will decide when you can be released from self-isolation.
Details of test centres and opening hours are available online.
You should check the latest guidance on entry requirements for travel to the Faroe Islands before departure.
Travel to Greenland
You can only enter Greenland, if you are fully vaccinated or have previously been infected with COVID-19. Residents and children 11 years and younger are exempt from the vaccination requirement.
Unvaccinated or partially-vaccinated children 2 - 11 years of age must quarantine for 5 days upon arrival. If the person does not show any symptoms, they may end quarantine on the sixth day. This is regardless of their or parents’ vaccination status.
Persons that have previously been infected with COVID-19 must be able to show proof of a positive PCR test result that is at least 14 days old, but no more than 12 weeks old, at the time of travel.
If you are fully vaccinated or have been previously infected with COVID-19, you do not need to quarantine on arrival.
Be aware that restrictions on entry to Greenland may be reinstated at any time depending on the national and global spread of COVID-19. There may also be limited flight capacity.

Face masks at Danish airports
You must wear a medical mask throughout terminals in Danish airports, when you enter the terminals, on board the plane, and until you exit your destination airport. The Danish health authorities recommend you change your mask every 3 to 4 hours. Children 6 and under are exempt.
Regular entry requirements
The Danish authorities have border controls at the land border with Germany. There are also border controls for travellers from Rønne, Helsingør, Frederikshavn, Grenaa and those using the Øresund Bridge, including all train traffic from Sweden.
If you’re arriving in Denmark using the land border, or by rail, road, or ferry you should carry your passport with you. Allow additional time for crossing the border, and follow the instructions of local authorities.
Check with local media, your carrier, ferry operator or Danish State Railways (DSB) for more information.

These must include a photograph, the holder’s full name, social security number or date of birth, holders signature, a stated validity and information on the issuing authority. Children under 18 accompanied by an adult with the appropriate ID are not required to carry ID themselves.
Visas for Denmark
The rules for travelling or working in European countries changed on 1 January 2021:
you can travel to countries in the Schengen area for up to 90 days in any 180-day period without a visa. This applies if you travel as a tourist, to visit family or friends, to attend business meetings, cultural or sports events, or for short-term studies or training
if you are travelling to Denmark and other Schengen countries without a visa, make sure your whole visit is within the 90-day limit. Visits to Schengen countries within the previous 180 days before you travel count towards your 90 days
to stay longer, to work or study, for business travel or for other reasons, you will need to meet the Danish government’s entry requirements. Check with the Danish Embassy what type of visa, if any, you will need
if you stay in Denmark with a residence permit or long-stay visa, this does not count towards your 90-day visa-free limit
Any time you spent in Denmark or other Schengen countries before 1 January 2021 does not count towards your 90-day visa-free limit.
At Danish border control, you may need to queue in separate lanes from EU, EEA and Swiss citizens.
Check your passport is stamped if you enter or exit the Schengen area through Denmark as a visitor. Border guards will use passport stamps to check you’re complying with the 90-day visa-free limit for short stays in the Schengen area. If relevant entry or exit stamps are not in your passport, border guards will presume that you have overstayed your visa-free limit.
You can show evidence of when and where you entered or exited the Schengen area, and ask the border guards to add this date and location in your passport. Examples of acceptable evidence include boarding passes and tickets.
You may also need to:
show a return or onward ticket
show you have enough money for your stay
If you are resident in the Denmark your passport should not be stamped. You should proactively show your proof of residence as well as your valid passport at Danish border control. For further information see our Living in Denmark guide.
Visas for Greenland and Faroe Islands
Greenland and the Faroe Islands are not members of the European Union. You don’t need a visa to enter for tourism, but you should get a work and residence permit before entry if you intend to live and work there.
Passport validity
If you are planning to travel to an EU country (except Ireland), or Switzerland, Norway, Iceland, Liechtenstein, Andorra, Monaco, San Marino or Vatican City, you must meet the Schengen area rules.
Your passport must meet 2 requirements. It must be:
less than 10 years old on the day you enter (check the ‘date of issue’)
valid for at least 3 months after the day you plan to leave (check the ‘expiry date’)
We are asking the European Commission to clarify the 10-year rule. Their guidance for Schengen border guards may not be updated until the spring of 2022. Until then, for some Schengen countries your passport may need to be less than 10 years old during your whole visit, and the 3 months at the end of your visit may need to be within 10 years of your passport’s issue date.
Check both the issue date and the expiry date in your passport. If you renewed your passport early, extra months may have been added to its expiry date. This could affect the requirement for your passport to be less than 10 years old.
Contact your travel provider or embassy of the country you are visiting if you think that your passport does not meet both these requirements. Renew your passport if you need to.
UK Emergency Travel Documents
If you have lost your passport UK Emergency Travel Documents (ETDs) are accepted for entry, airside transit and exit from Denmark. Your ETD must be valid for the proposed duration of your stay.
