There are currently no commercial options available to return to the UK from Venezuela. Borders have closed indefinitely since 16 March.
Future Travel Options
Domestic and international regular commercial flights are, in principle and subjected to further local authorities’ announcements, meant to progressively re-start from 13 July 2020 onwards. Remain in touch with your airline or travel agent to stay informed on their future scheduled operations.
If you would like to register your details with the British Embassy in Caracas to be included in communications about possible flights out of Venezuela, email the British Embassy Caracas and include your full name, date of birth, UK passport number, e-mail address, a mobile number and your current location in Venezuela. The Embassy sometimes hears of flights leaving Venezuela at short notice. In your e-mail you should indicate if you would be happy for us to share your details with other Embassies, local authorities and airlines.
You will need to pay for your return travel to the UK. If departure options are available but you cannot afford the travel costs and have exhausted all other options for getting funds, you may be eligible to apply for an emergency loan from the government. This is a last resort option and you would need to repay the loan when you are back in the UK.
For more information, you should contact Corporate Travel Management (CTM). CTM are a commercial partner of the FCO and are authorised to administer such loans on behalf of the FCO.
