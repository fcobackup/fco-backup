The information on this page covers the most common types of travel and reflects the UK government’s understanding of the rules currently in place. Unless otherwise stated, this information is for travellers using a full ‘British Citizen’ passport.
The authorities in the country or territory you’re travelling to are responsible for setting and enforcing the rules for entry. If you’re unclear about any aspect of the entry requirements, or you need further reassurance, you’ll need to contact the embassy, high commission or consulate of the country or territory you’re travelling to.
You should also consider checking with your transport provider or travel company to make sure your passport and other travel documents meet their requirements.
Entry rules in response to coronavirus (COVID-19)
Entry to Equatorial Guinea
Equatorial Guinea has reopened its borders to nationals, residents, diplomats and visa holders travelling for business reasons or with government approval. A previous ban on travellers from the UK has now been lifted.
Restrictions on the number of flights are in place. National carriers are allowed two weekly flights and international carriers are permitted one weekly flight. Diplomatic missions and international organisations must submit a list of their personnel and/or family members travelling to Equatorial Guinea, in advance of arrival to the Ministry of Foreign Affairs and Cooperation, confirming date of arrival, flight number and place of origin.
On arrival, passengers are required to undergo a rapid COVID-19 test. You will also be required to provide proof of a negative coronavirus (COVID-19) test result, using a polymerase chain reaction (PRC) test, taken within the last 48 hours.
All passengers are then required to quarantine for 4 days, even if they test negative, and take a second test once the 4 days have passed. Those who test negative after the second test will be free to leave quarantine. Those who test positive will be required to isolate immediately. Oil company employees will be able to isolate in oil company isolation facilities, whilst other individuals will have to go to one of the hotels which the government of Equatorial Guinea has nominated for isolation until a negative test is returned. This applies to all, including those under 18. Authorities may withdraw passports from passengers if an invalid PCR test is presented.
You should not use the NHS testing service to get a test in order to facilitate your travel to another country. You should arrange to take a private test.
Screening on arrival
Your temperature will be taken at arrival at airports and ports.
Visas
You will need a visa to visit Equatorial Guinea. Equatorial Guinea diplomatic missions abroad may issue diplomatic and business entry visas to Equatorial Guinea, however this is kept under review.
The Government of Equatorial Guinea has confirmed it will not penalise British nationals whose visas have expired while they are unable to leave the country due to coronavirus restrictions. If this is your situation, you should write a letter to the Ministry of Foreign Affairs (Visa Section) informing them, and keep a copy for future visa applications. You will be allowed to leave the country freely when able to, and this will not affect your chances of being granted a visa in the future.
Regular entry requirements
Passport validity
Your passport should be valid for a minimum period of 6 months from the date of entry.
Visas
British nationals need a visa to visit Equatorial Guinea. For further information on entry requirements, contact the Embassy of Equatorial Guinea in London: 13 Park Place, St James’, London SW1A 1LP; telephone: 020 7499 6867.
Check that your passport is properly stamped at the airport, on arrival and departure, before leaving the immigration desk. There have been reports of travellers being delayed or threatened with detention because their passports have not been properly stamped.
If you replace your passport the Equatorial Guinea authorities will require the old passport prior to issuing a replacement visa in your new passport. The authorities will not admit travellers on visas entered into old passports, even if the visa is still valid.
Long-term visitors are required to obtain a residence permit of 1 year validity from the Ministry of National Security. Holders of a residence permit no longer require a visa to exit or enter Equatorial Guinea during the validity of their residence permit.
If you’re arriving by air you may be required to fill in a health questionnaire related to recent travel to Ebola-affected countries (Liberia/Guinea/Sierra Leone).
