Cases of coronavirus (COVID-19) have been confirmed in Papa New Guinea. The authorities have introduced a number of measures to limit the spread of the virus.
Papua New Guinea has confirmed its first case of coronavirus (COVID-19) on 20 March. The Government has declared a 14 day State of Emergency from 24 March.
Travel
Movement between provinces has been banned, and domestic flights and public transport suspended. As of 22 March, for seven days, no visitor may enter PNG except for health workers, diplomats with special authorisation, flight crew or military personnel. If you have travelled to mainland China, a country in the European Union, Iran, South Korea, the United Kingdom or the United States of America, you must complete a 14 day quarantine outside the country before being allowed into Papua New Guinea. The situation may change rapidly. Follow local guidance at all times.
The Government of Australia has announced that from 9pm Australia Eastern Standard Time on 20 March, entry to the country will only be permitted to Australian citizens or permanent residents. This follows a similar announcement by New Zealand from 19 March. As many flight connections to and from Papua New Guinea connect in Australia and New Zealand, options to depart Papua New Guinea have reduced. If you’re currently a visitor in Papua New Guinea, you’re advised to prepare to leave as soon as possible. If you’re resident in Papua New Guinea, you should be aware of the potential impact of the border closures and flight restrictions on future travel plans.
Transit through Australia
To transit through Australia before 1200 AEDT on 24 March you need to have applied for an exemption. You can find out more information on this and apply on the Australian Department of Home Affairs website. You should contact our Sydney consulate using the online contact form once you have requested your exemption.
From 23 March at 2359 local time, no short-term visitors from anywhere in the world will be able to enter or transit through Singapore.
For seven days from Sunday 22 March, no international passengers will be allowed to fly into Port Moresby except for health workers, diplomats with special authorisation, flight crew or military personnel. If you have travelled to mainland China, a country in the European Union, Iran, South Korea, the United Kingdom or the United States of America, you must complete a 14 day quarantine outside the country before being allowed into Papua New Guinea. There is also a ban on cruise ships and leisure yachts with more than fifteen people on board, on land border crossings between Indonesia and Papua New Guinea, and on sea crossings between the Solomon Islands and Bougainville.
