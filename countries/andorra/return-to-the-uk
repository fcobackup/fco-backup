If you wish to leave Andorra, you’re advised to contact your travel operator to make arrangements to do so as soon as possible. If you’re transiting through France or Spain, you should refer to the Spain travel advice or France travel advice for information on the restrictions to entry and movement in those countries, and follow the advice of the Spanish or French authorities.

You will need to pay for your return travel to the UK. If departure options are available but you cannot afford the travel costs and have exhausted all other options for getting funds, you may be eligible to apply for an emergency loan from the government. This is a last resort option and you would need to repay the loan when you are back in the UK. For more information, you should contact Corporate Travel Management (CTM). CTM are a commercial partner of the FCO and are authorised to administer such loans on behalf of the FCO.
