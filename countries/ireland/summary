Travel to Ireland is subject to entry restrictions
The Irish Government has extended the ban on flights and passenger ferry journeys from Great Britain to Ireland until at least 31 December. This applies to people in Great Britain regardless of nationality. Essential supply chain workers are exempt (see ‘Entry rules in response to coronavirus’ below). Ferry crossings from Great Britain to Ireland will continue for freight, including accompanied freight, but not passengers. Ferry crossings from Ireland to Great Britain will continue for passengers and freight and you are advised to follow relevant local UK guidance on arrival. If you were due to travel to or from Ireland please contact your travel operator. Further updates will be published when they are available. Check our advice on things to consider, and be prepared to stay overseas longer than planned. Northern Ireland is not affected by this announcement.
All arrivals, including Irish residents, arriving from overseas must complete a Public Health Passenger Locator Form prior to arriving in Ireland. The form may be used by health authorities to contact passengers in order to verify their location in the country.
In general, people are requested to restrict their movements for 14 days when they arrive into Ireland from another country. This applies to all travellers, including Irish citizens and people with no symptoms. Arrivals from Northern Ireland are exempt, as are people in certain defined categories as set out on the Irish Government’s website.
Ireland is implementing the EU ‘traffic lights’ approach to travel, which applies to countries in the EU/EEA and UK. In line with the EU ‘traffic lights’ approach a combined indicator map will be published each week by the European Centre for Disease Prevention and Control (ECDC). Passengers from “green” regions are not required to restrict their movements for 14 days on arrival in Ireland.
Passengers arriving from an “orange”, “red” or “grey” region are requested to restrict their movements for 14 days (other than in the case of the defined categories listed on the Irish government website). At present, this continues to include arrivals to Ireland from Great Britain.
Until further notice, passengers arriving into Ireland from Denmark are requested to self-isolate for 14 days after their arrival, including those travelling for an essential purpose.
