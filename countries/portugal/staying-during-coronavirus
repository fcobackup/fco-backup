Portugal declared a state of emergency on 18 March. This activated a series of measures including significant restrictions on movement throughout the country. On 30 April, the Portuguese government announced the transition to a ‘state of public calamity’ and started a phased de-escalation plan. Progression through the stages will depend on the continued control of the COVID-19 outbreak in Portugal.
