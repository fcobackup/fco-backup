Drugs
Drug laws are similar to those in the UK. Possessing or trafficking drugs will be dealt with severely. If convicted a lengthy prison sentence is usual.
ID Laws
Under Austrian law, you’re required to have your passport readily accessible at all times. If you don’t carry your passport with you, your passport must be in the same district as you, and you must be able to access it within a reasonable time. A UK driving licence isn’t recognised as an official form of ID.
Dress
It’s illegal in Austria to wear in a public place any clothing or object which conceals the face and makes facial features unrecognisable. Failure to comply with this law is punishable by an on-the-spot fine of up to €150. You could also be required to attend a police station if you refuse to uncover your face once asked, or if your identity is impossible to determine. The law applies to both residents and visitors. See the website of the Austrian Interior Ministry for more information on the law and a list of exemptions. This does not apply to medical or fabric face masks, which are compulsory in some situations due to coronavirus. See Coronavirus for more details.
Public transport
If you use an individual paper ticket on a bus, tram or train, make sure you validate it in the machine on the vehicle or in the station. If you don’t validate your ticket, you may have to pay a high, on-the-spot fine.
Taking food and drink into the EU
You cannot take meat, milk or products containing them into EU countries. There are some exceptions for medical reasons, for example certain amounts of powdered infant milk, infant food, or pet food required for medical reasons. Check the rules about taking food and drink into the EU on the European Commission website.
