This advice reflects the UK government’s understanding of current rules for people travelling on a full ‘British citizen’ passport from the UK, for the most common types of travel. 
The authorities in Grenada set and enforce entry rules. If you’re not sure how these requirements apply to you, contact the Grenadian High Commission in the UK. 
COVID-19 rules 
There are no COVID-19 testing or vaccination requirements for travellers entering Grenada. 
Passport validity requirements 
To visit Grenada, your passport must have an ‘expiry date’ at least 6 months after the date you arrive.  
Check with your travel provider that your passport and other travel documents meet requirements. Renew your passport if you need to.  
You will be denied entry if you do not have a valid travel document or try to use a passport that has been reported lost or stolen. 
Make sure you get your passport stamped. 
Make sure the border control officer puts a stamp in your passport. If you do not get a stamp in your passport, you’ll be considered an illegal visitor.  
Visa requirements 
You can visit Grenada without a visa.  
On entry, you’ll be allowed to stay for a maximum period of 3 months. 
To stay longer (to work or study, for business travel or for other reasons), you must meet the Grenada Immigration Department’s entry requirements. 
It’s illegal to overstay the entry period or to work without a work permit. 
Vaccination requirements  
At least 8 weeks before your trip, check the vaccinations and certificates you need in TravelHealthPro’s Grenada guide. 
Depending on your circumstances, this may include a yellow fever certificate. 
Customs rules 
There are strict rules about goods you can take into or out of Grenada. You must declare anything that may be prohibited or subject to tax or duty.
