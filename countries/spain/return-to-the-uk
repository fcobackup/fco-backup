There remain commercial options to return to the UK from Spain.
If you live in the UK and are currently visiting Spain, you’re strongly advised to return now by commercial means. Don’t run the risk of getting stranded.
UK special charter flights will only operate for priority countries where commercial flights are not possible. You should not assume that these flights will become available in countries where commercial routes are operating. Please do not contact the contracted travel management company if no flight is advertised here.
Flights
Airports across Spain remain open, but airlines are operating heavily reduced services. Information on the latest flight availability can be found on the British Embassy Facebook page. This is intended as a guide to help travellers, not a definitive statement of availability and in many cases includes indirect flights. Check airline websites, including comparison websites for the latest times and information.
Travel to airports to leave Spain is still permitted, but you may be asked to provide evidence that you are departing Spain (i.e. plane ticket).
Road travel
Land borders remain open to leave Spain.
Although driving restrictions and vehicle occupancy limitations are in force in Spain, the Spanish Interior Ministry and Policia Local have confirmed that cars and minivans carrying families/groups of passengers is permitted, as long as the purpose of the journey is to return to your country of residence. All passengers should carry their passports and proof of where they live. You may also find this letter useful should you be required to explain your reason for travel.
You can still drive through France to return to the UK. The French government have implemented their own measures, including required documents for travel into, and transit through, France. Check the latest FCO travel advice for France ahead of your journey.
Ferry
There are no passenger ferries currently operating between Spain and the UK. You should make alternative arrangements to return to the UK.
Arrival in the UK
When you arrive back in the UK, follow the guidance for when you return to the UK on steps you should take to protect yourself and others.
Help and support
You will need to pay for your return travel to the UK. If you cannot afford travel costs and have exhausted all other options for getting funds, you may be eligible to apply for an emergency loan from the government. This is a last resort option and you would need to repay the loan when you are back in the UK. For more information, you should contact CTM via email at EMEArepatriations@travelctm.com or phone on +44 20 7429 9990. CTM are a commercial partner of the FCO and are authorised to administer such loans on behalf of the FCO.
If you need urgent consular assistance, contact the British Embassy. The Embassy cannot provide further information or advice about departure options over the phone.
If you cannot return to the UK
If you cannot travel back to the UK due to ill health or reduced mobility, you may wish to consider looking for longer-term accommodation in Spain until the State of Emergency is lifted. If you need medical treatment, the UK EHIC is still valid for the rest of 2020.
