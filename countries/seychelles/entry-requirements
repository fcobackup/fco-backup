Entry rules in response to coronavirus (COVID-19)
On 25 March 2021, Seychelles opened its borders to visitors irrespective of their vaccination status. All visitors must present a negative PCR test, taken within 72 hours prior to departure, and must stay in approved accommodation. There will be no quarantine requirement and no restriction on movement for most visitors upon entry to Seychelles. Visitors must adhere to public health measures.
On 6 May, the Government of Seychelles announced that, with immediate effect, visitors who have been in Bangladesh, Brazil, India, Pakistan or South Africa within 14 days prior to travel will not be permitted to enter Seychelles. This will be revised at a later date.
If you plan to travel to Seychelles, you must do so in accordance with current UK COVID-19 restrictions and should familiarise yourself with the travel advisory at the Ministry for Foreign Affairs and Tourism website and the ‘conditions for entry’ section of the Ministry of Health website, which outline all requirements for entry and pre-travel conditions which must be met.
An application for entry form should also be completed and returned to the Public Health Authority before travel. Work permit holders must also be cleared by the Department of Employment and Immigration. If you’re uncertain of your status, you should contact the Department of Employment and Immigration before attempting to enter Seychelles.
You can find a travel advisory detailing the full entry procedures for all travellers at the Ministry for Foreign Affairs and Tourism website and ‘conditions for entry’ at the Ministry of Health website. You’re strongly advised to familiarise yourself with the full entry requirements before you travel. These may be updated regularly and without warning.
A Health Travel Authorisation is required for travellers entering Seychelles by sea. Travellers arriving by sea who have spent at least 14 days at sea since their last port of call do not require a PCR test. Clients or crew who wish to disembark before completion of 14 days since their last port of call must have proof of vaccination and undertake a PCR test on arrival. If you are travelling by sea, you should follow the guidelines on the ‘conditions for entry’ at the Ministry of Health website.
Cruise ships from any country worldwide will not be permitted to berth in Seychelles until further notice.
Screening on arrival
All visitors must present a negative PCR test on arrival, taken within the 72 hours prior to their departure.
All passengers will be temperature checked at all ports of arrival. If symptoms of COVID-19 are found to be present, tests will be conducted. Those found to be positive will be quarantined and re-checked.
Quarantine requirements
There will be no quarantine requirements and no restriction on movement for most visitors upon entry to Seychelles.

Gainful Occupational Permit (GOP) holders may enter Seychelles from any country and will not face quarantine if they have completed a full dose of vaccination at least two weeks before travelling. All unvaccinated GOP holders travelling to Seychelles will be expected to undergo 7 days of quarantine in a private quarantine facility or a certified tourism establishment.
If you intend to travel to Seychelles, you should familiarise yourself with the ‘conditions for entry’ section of the Ministry for Health website.
Regular entry requirements
The Government of Seychelles is reviewing its policies on work permits (Gainful Occupational Permits) for foreign nationals.
