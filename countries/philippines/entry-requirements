The information on this page covers the most common types of travel and reflects the UK government’s understanding of the rules currently in place. Unless otherwise stated, this information is for travellers using a full ‘British Citizen’ passport.
The authorities in the country or territory you’re travelling to are responsible for setting and enforcing the rules for entry. If you’re unclear about any aspect of the entry requirements, or you need further reassurance, you’ll need to contact the embassy, high commission or consulate of the country or territory you’re travelling to.
You should also consider checking with your transport provider or travel company to make sure your passport and other travel documents meet their requirements.
Visas
You can enter the Philippines without a visa for an initial period of 30 days. You can also get a tourist visa from the Philippine Embassy before you travel, which will allow an initial 59 day stay.
You can apply to extend your stay at the offices of the Bureau of Immigration. Overstaying without the proper authority is a serious matter and can lead to detention pending payment of outstanding fees and fines and voluntary deportation at your own expense.
Living, working or studying in the Philippines
If you intend to live, work, or study in the Philippines you’ll need to have certain UK documents (eg birth certificates, marriage certificates, UK police certificates, school documents) legalised by the FCO Legalisation Office and by the Philippine Embassy in London before relocating to the Philippines. These documents are required by the local authorities when applying for long-term resident visas. Contact the Legalisation Office and the Philippine Embassy in London for more details.
Passport validity
As of November 2015, the Philippine Bureau of Immigration has amended its rules about passport validity. British passports no longer need to have a minimum period of 6 months validity from the date of arrival. Your passport should be valid for the proposed duration of your stay. No additional period of validity beyond this is required.
Yellow fever certificate requirements
Check whether you need a yellow fever certificate by visiting the National Travel Health Network and Centre’s TravelHealthPro website.
Evidence of onward travel
Entry to the Philippines may be refused if you are unable to produce evidence of return or onward travel - for example an onward or return air ticket.
Departure tax
If you’re leaving the country from Cebu Mactan airport you must pay a departure tax of 750 pesos in local currency or the equivalent in US dollars. From 1 February, there’s no longer a departure tax at Manila airport. This information is subject to change and you should check with local authorities before you travel.
UK Emergency Travel Documents
UK Emergency Travel Documents (ETDs) are valid for entry into the Philippines, but you’ll need to get a Philippine visa before entry. If you are entering the Philippines on an ETD, it should be valid for 6 months from the date of arrival. If you get an ETD from the British Embassy in Manila, you should get the necessary stamps from the Bureau of Immigration before attempting to leave the Philippines otherwise you’re likely to face problems at the point of departure. If you enter the Philippines on an ETD and intend to continue your journey onwards using the flights detailed on your ETD, you also need to apply for the necessary stamps from the Bureau of Immigration before departing the Philippines.
Children travelling to the Philippines without their parents
Non-Filipino children under the age of 15, who are not travelling with a parent or joining a parent in the Philippines, must apply for a Waiver of Exclusion Ground (WEG) for entry into the Philippines. You can do this at the Philippine Embassy in London or on arrival through the Bureau of Immigration. For either application, you will need to submit the right documentation and pay a fee. For more information and details of payment, visit the Department of Foreign Affairs’ website
If a minor under the age of fifteen is travelling to visit a parent they should carry a copy of their parents’ resident visa.
