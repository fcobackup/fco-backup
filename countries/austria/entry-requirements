This page has information on travelling to Austria. Check what you must do to return to the UK..
This page reflects the UK government’s understanding of current rules for people travelling on a full ‘British Citizen’ passport, for the most common types of travel.
The authorities in Austria set and enforce entry rules. You can read an English version of the rules from the Austrian transport ministry but it can take time to be updated and translated from the German version. The Austrian embassy in London also has information for travellers..
You should also check with your airline.
If you’re fully vaccinated
You must show either proof of full vaccination or recent (within the past 180 days) recovery from COVID-19 to enter Austria. You should also present a negative PCR test not more than 72 hours old when you arrive.
If you received a booster vaccination 120 days or more after your second shot, you do not need to provide a PCR test. For arrivals on and after 1 February 2022, this reduces to 90 days. Proof of recovery in the past 180 days, alongside two vaccinations, counts as a booster.
Without a negative PCR test or proof of a booster at the time of entry, you must fill in a pre-travel clearance form and enter quarantine. You can leave quarantine with a negative PCR test result.
Proof of vaccination status
For two-shot vaccines (e.g. AstraZeneca, Pfizer, Moderna), you must show that you received the second injection no more than 270 days before arrival.
For the Johnson & Johnson vaccine, you must show that you received a booster no more than 270 days before arrival.
If you received a booster more than 120 days after being fully immunised (90 days from 1 February 2022), this must not have been more than 270 days before arrival.
Different vaccine validity rules apply once in Austria: two-dose vaccinations are only valid for 180 days (210 days for under 18 year olds). A booster is still valid for 270 days.
Austria will accept the UK’s proof of COVID-19 recovery and vaccination record and proof of COVID-19 vaccination issued in the Crown Dependencies.
Austrian immigration officials will insist on QR codes, as provided by the UK COVID Pass, as proof of vaccinations and boosters, and have denied entry to those without this evidence. Your NHS appointment card from vaccination centres is not designed to be used as proof of full vaccination.
Residents of Austria
Residents of Austria or another EU/EEA state who cannot provide proof of vaccination or recovery can enter Austria but must fill in a pre-travel clearance form and enter quarantine for 10 days. You can leave quarantine after 5 days with a negative PCR test result.
If you’re not fully vaccinated
If you’re not fully vaccinated and cannot prove recovery from COVID-19 in the past 180 days, you cannot enter Austria.
There are exemptions, including residents of Austria or an EU/EEA country; pregnant women; regular commuters for work, educational and family purposes; and people who want to visit their partner. Pregnant women and people who cannot be vaccinated without risk must carry a medical certificate. See more information on exemptions from the Austrian Embassy..
If you’ve had COVID-19 in the past 180 days
If you have recovered from a recent COVID-19 infection and have had two shots of an accepted vaccine (one shot of Johnson & Johnson), you count as boosted and do not need to show a PCR test on arrival. If you have recovered and have not had two shots of a valid vaccine, you will need to show a negative PCR test not more than 72 hours old.
If you have recovered within the past 90 days, you can use a medical certificate (including the date of recovery) as a substitute for the PCR test. You must complete this form in English.
You can use the NHS Covid app or the EU Covid Pass to prove recent infection. Printed versions and medical certificates of vaccination or recovery are also accepted. An NHS email/SMS of a positive test is not sufficient to prove recovery.
Children and young people
Children under the age of 12 do not need proof of vaccination/recovery or a PCR test if accompanied by fully vaccinated or recovered adults. If the accompanying adult has to quarantine, the child must quarantine too. The child can then leave self-isolation at the same time as the adult.
Children aged 12 or over and born on or after 1 September 2006 can use the first PCR test of their Holiday Ninja Pass to enter Austria. Find out how to apply online.
For anyone born before 1 September 2006, the adult entry rules apply.
If you’re transiting through Austria
For a transit journey without a stopover in Austria, neither a pre-travel clearance nor proof of vaccination/past infection/negative test are required. During transit, you can only make essential stops, such as to refuel or use the toilet. You may need to show proof of your final destination.
Exemptions
For exemptions, including pregnant women and travel on compassionate grounds, see information on exemptions from the Austrian Embassy.
HGV drivers
HGV drivers from the UK entering Austria do not have to show a negative COVID-19 test, proof of vaccination or proof of recovery and do not have to quarantine.
Regular entry requirements
Visas
The rules for travelling or working in European countries changed on 1 January 2021:
you can travel to countries in the Schengen area for up to 90 days in any 180-day period without a visa. This applies if you travel as a tourist, to visit family or friends, to attend business meetings, cultural or sports events, or for short-term studies or training
if you are travelling to Austria and other Schengen countries without a visa, make sure your whole visit is within the 90-day limit. Visits to Schengen countries within the previous 180 days before you travel count towards your 90 days
to stay longer, to work or study, for business or for other reasons, you will need to meet the Austrian government’s entry requirements. Check with the Austrian Embassy what type of visa and/or work permit you may need
if you stay in Austria with a residence permit or long-stay visa, this does not count towards your 90-day visa-free limit.
Any time you spent in Austria or other Schengen countries before 1 January 2021 does not count towards your 90-day visa-free limit.
At Austrian border control, you may need to queue in separate lanes from EU, EEA and Swiss citizens.
Check your passport is stamped if you enter or exit the Schengen area through Austria as a visitor. Border guards will use passport stamps to check you’re complying with the 90-day visa-free limit for short stays in the Schengen area. If relevant entry or exit stamps are not in your passport, border guards will presume that you have overstayed your visa-free limit.
You can show evidence of when and where you entered or exited the Schengen area, and ask the border guards to add this date and location in your passport. Examples of acceptable evidence include boarding passes and tickets.
You may also need to:
show a return or onward ticket
show you have enough money for your stay
If you are resident in Austria your passport should not be stamped. You should proactively show your proof of residence as well as your valid passport at Austrian border control. For further information, see our Living in Austria guide.
Passport validity
If you are planning to travel to an EU country (except Ireland), or Switzerland, Norway, Iceland, Liechtenstein, Andorra, Monaco, San Marino or Vatican City, you must meet the Schengen area rules.
Your passport must meet 2 requirements. It must be:
less than 10 years old on the day you enter (check the ‘date of issue’)
valid for at least 3 months after the day you plan to leave (check the ‘expiry date’)
We are asking the European Commission to clarify the 10-year rule. Their guidance for Schengen border guards may not be updated until the spring of 2022. Until then, for some Schengen countries your passport may need to be less than 10 years old during your whole visit, and the 3 months at the end of your visit may need to be within 10 years of your passport’s issue date.
Check both the issue date and the expiry date in your passport. If you renewed your passport early, extra months may have been added to its expiry date. This could affect the requirement for your passport to be less than 10 years old.
Contact your travel provider or embassy of the country you are visiting if you think that your passport does not meet both these requirements. Renew your passport if you need to.
Travelling with children
If you are a single parent, or travelling with a child who is not your own, you will need documentary evidence of parental responsibility and a letter of consent. For further information on exactly what will be required at immigration contact the Austrian Embassy in London.
UK Emergency Travel Documents
UK Emergency Travel Documents are accepted for entry, airside transit and exit from Austria.
