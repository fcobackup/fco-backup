The information on this page covers the most common types of travel and reflects the UK government’s understanding of the rules currently in place. Unless otherwise stated, this information is for travellers using a full ‘British Citizen’ passport.
The authorities in the country or territory you’re travelling to are responsible for setting and enforcing the rules for entry. If you’re unclear about any aspect of the entry requirements, or you need further reassurance, you’ll need to contact the embassy, high commission or consulate of the country or territory you’re travelling to.
You should also consider checking with your transport provider or travel company to make sure your passport and other travel documents meet their requirements.

You should be prepared for travel restrictions, and changes to screening and precautionary observation requirements with no advance notice. If you are planning travel to Liberia, you should check the National Public Health Institute of Liberia (NPHIL) website frequently for updated information (select “Travel Advisory” or recent updates).
The Government of Liberia has announced the suspension of all commercial flights (except cargo, charter and special flights) for 21 days, effective from 23:59 GMT 23 March. This will run until 14 April.
Keep up to date with real-time information from your airline, tour operator or accommodation provider on the impact on any existing travel plans.
There is a high risk for British nationals of being put into 14 days of quarantine, either on arrival or during your trip to Liberia. Liberian quarantine centres are basic, and not guaranteed to meet Public Health England standards.
You are at risk of being put into quarantine or instructed to self-isolate for 14 days after you have arrived in Liberia, if you either develop symptoms (fever, cough or respiratory illness), or it is suspected you have been in contact with some who has tested positive for coronavirus. You are strongly advised to familiarise yourself with these risks before travelling. Current entry measures are: All travellers arriving in Liberia will be screened for coronavirus. You will have to fill out a form before leaving the aeroplane, detailing your travel history in the last 14 days. Point of Entry staff will evaluate it. NPHIL strongly discourages travellers from countries with 200 or more cases from visiting Liberia unless absolutely necessary.
All travellers arriving in Liberia who, within 14 days prior, have visited a country that has more than 200 confirmed cases of coronavirus (as listed by the World Health Organisation), will have to spend 14 days under precautionary observation. This includes visitors who have been in the UK in the previous 14 days. This does not include transiting a country with more than 200 cases, as long as passengers remain inside the airport.
All foreign citizens at Precautionary Observation Centre (POCs) will have their passports removed. NPHIL advises that passports will be handed over to citizens’ Embassies. You will be given a copy of your passport to retain whilst in the POC.
If you are travelling on behalf of government, an international organisation/NGO or a company, and have visited a country with 200 or more cases: before travelling you should check with your organisation whether they have pre-arranged a private POC, i.e. quarantine facility, authorised by the National Public Health Institute of Liberia (NHPIL). The British Embassy cannot provide POC facilities. Your organisation must notify NPHIL of your travel plans before you board your flight. If your organisation has made authorised arrangements, you will be escorted to an approved POC for monitoring. A medical team will check twice daily for signs of fever, coughing or respiratory distress. If you show symptoms, you may be transferred to the government COVID-19 treatment centre.
All other travellers who have visited a country with 200 or more cases will have to stay in a government POC, i.e. quarantine. If you show symptoms (fever, coughing or respiratory distress), you may be transferred to the government COVID-19 treatment centre.
For travellers who have visited geographically large countries with 200 or more cases (e.g. USA, Brazil, India), NPHIL will decide on precautionary observation if there are 50 or more cases in any state, region or province. You will have to show NPHIL your full flight itinerary, including flight origin. If you do not provide this information, you will automatically be taken to a POC. If you show symptoms (fever, coughing or respiratory distress), you may be transferred to the government COVID-19 treatment centre.
Visitors from countries with 50 to 199 confirmed cases in the previous 14 days will be evaluated based on the specific geographic areas visited. If you have visited a region or state of the country with 100 or more confirmed cases, you will have to undergo precautionary observation (quarantine). If you show symptoms (fever, coughing or respiratory distress), you may be transferred to the government COVID-19 treatment centre.
Visitors from countries with 15 to 50 cases in the previous 14 days will be documented and asked to do self-monitoring. You must report immediately to NPHIL’s emergency number (4455) if you experience any of the following symptoms: fever, cough or respiratory illness. If you show symptoms, you may be transferred to the government COVID-19 treatment centre.
Visitors arriving on a laissez-passer (except UN or EU), will also be taken to a POC (quarantine) for secondary screening. Any suspicion of illegal attempts to circumvent the process will result in 14 days of quarantine.
