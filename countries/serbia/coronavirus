Public spaces and services
There are nationwide rules in place restricting movement and limiting activity. It is mandatory to maintain physical distance of at least 1.5m in all public spaces. Protective face masks are mandatory in all public indoor spaces as well as in outdoor spaces where is not possible to maintain distance. Failure to wear a mask when required will incur a fine. Indoor and outdoor gatherings, with the exception of cinemas and theatres, are limited to 10 people.
In Belgrade, where an emergency situation has been declared, businesses including bars and restaurants are not allowed to operate between 11pm and 6am. Those with outdoor spaces may stay open until 1am.
Emergency situations related to the growth of COVID-19 infection have also been declared in over 25 municipalities across Serbia and the rules in these towns may be much more strict.
Additional rules and penalties vary in different towns and cities, especially in any that have declared emergency situations, and rules can change rapidly. You should follow the latest local guidance - check news outlets regularly for up to date information.
Further restrictions may be introduced, both nationwide and locally, including at short notice. Infringements of these procedures may result in fines and/or a prison sentence.
Healthcare in Serbia
It may be difficult to access satisfactory healthcare for any medical issue, including COVID-19, in areas where an emergency situation has been declared. There are reports that it is difficult to obtain tests, including for symptomatic individuals. Temporary additional hospitals are being established in some towns, including Belgrade, in order to admit COVID-19 patients.
The Serbian Ministry of Health website gives up to date information on the number of coronavirus cases confirmed and tests carried out in Serbia. It includes regional data maps. This website also includes helpline telephone numbers.
