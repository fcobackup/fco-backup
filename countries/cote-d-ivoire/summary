All international flights to and from Côte d’Ivoire have been suspended until further notice. The UK will operate a special flight to the UK from Felix Houphouet Boigny International Airport, Abidjan, on 2 June. For information on how to book, see Return to the UK.
Given the rapidly changing situation in Côte d’Ivoire we are temporarily withdrawing a limited number of UK staff and their dependents from our Embassy. The Embassy will continue to carry out essential work including providing 24/7 consular assistance and support to British people in Côte d’Ivoire.
Terrorists are likely to try to carry out attacks in Côte d’Ivoire. There is an increased risk of terrorism and kidnap in northern border areas, due to the porous nature of borders into the Sahel region. However, there remains a risk elsewhere in the country. Attacks on beach resorts, hotels, cafés and restaurants visited by foreigners are possible and could occur without warning. Be especially vigilant in these places. See Terrorism
You will need to get a visa before you travel. See Visas
Violent crime can occur at any time. Be particularly vigilant and take care when travelling by road, especially at night. See Crime
