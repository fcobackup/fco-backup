The Foreign and Commonwealth Office (FCO) advise against all but essential travel to Kosovo following the Government of Kosovo’s decision to introduce stringent measures to prevent the spread of coronavirus (COVID-19). We recommend that British Nationals who wish to leave the country make arrangements to do so as soon as possible.
The authorities in Kosovo have introduced a number of measures in response to the coronavirus (COVID-19) pandemic. These include: severe restrictions on international travel; school closures; closure of shops except for food shops and pharmacies; closure of bars and restaurants and suspension of public transport in a number of cities.

There is an ongoing global outbreak of coronavirus (COVID-19) and cases have been confirmed in Kosovo. The authorities in Kosovo have introduced a number of strict precautionary measures. All flights into Kosovo have been cancelled from 16 March and flights departing are likely to be severely disrupted, if not cancelled. Land borders are closed to non-Kosovo citizens. See Health
Protests have the potential to turn violent, you should take care if you see large crowds gathering during heightened political tensions in the city. Check local media, consult hotel receptions for advice and regularly review information on this site for updates.
There have been violent clashes in the north of Kosovo and incidents involving grenades and vehicle explosions in northern Mitrovica. Be cautious and avoid public gatherings, particularly around the Austerlitz Bridge area which separates Mitrovica north and south.
Terrorists are very likely to try to carry out attacks in Kosovo. Attacks could be indiscriminate, including in places visited by foreigners, large public gatherings and cultural events. Terrorists may target religious sites, including churches. See Terrorism
High levels of air pollution can occur in Kosovo. See Health
It’s possible to travel from Serbia into Kosovo, and back again. You’ll probably encounter problems entering Serbia from Kosovo if your passport shows you entered Kosovo directly from anywhere else other than Serbia. If tensions rise in the north it’s better to avoid border crossing Gates 1 and 31 (Leposavic and Zubin Potok). See Northern Kosovo
Residual landmines and other unexploded ordnance remain in Kosovo, although all roads and tracks have been cleared. See Local travel
Most visits to Kosovo are trouble-free. 
If you’re abroad and you need emergency help from the UK government, contact the nearest British embassy, consulate or high commission. Consular support is limited in parts of Kosovo where we advise against all but essential travel.
Take out comprehensive travel and medical insurance before you travel.
