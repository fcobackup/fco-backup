Warning
FCDO advises against all travel to parts of Burkina Faso.

Your travel insurance could be invalidated if you travel against advice from the Foreign, Commonwealth & Development Office (FCDO).
Areas where FCDO advises against travel
FCDO advises against all travel to Burkina Faso, except to the capital, Ouagadougou.
FCDO advises against all but essential travel to Ouagadougou, up to the toll booths on all roads out of the city.
This is due to the threat of terrorist attacks and terrorist kidnap, and the unstable political situation in the country.
Find out more about why FCDO advises against travel.
Limited consular support 
There is no British Embassy in Burkina Faso and all consular support is provided from the British Embassy in Accra, Ghana. They cannot provide in-person assistance.
If there is serious violence, unrest or a deterioration in the security situation, it could be difficult to leave safely. Do not rely on the British government to evacuate you as they may not be able to do so. Have your own plans on how you would leave the country, make sure you keep all travel documentation up to date and monitor the local situation.
