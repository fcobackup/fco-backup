Healthcare in Peru
Medical treatment is not easily available and can be more difficult to access outside of Lima. Make sure you have appropriate travel health insurance and accessible funds to cover the cost of any medical treatment abroad and repatriation.
If you need emergency medical assistance during your trip in Lima, dial one of the following numbers: +51 1 416 6767 (Lima - Alerta Med), or +51 1 467 4861 (Lima - Clave Medica) and ask for an ambulance. These services are private, so you will need to pay for them.
FCDO has a list of medical providers in Peru where some staff will speak English.
