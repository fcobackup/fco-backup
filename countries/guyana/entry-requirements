This page has information on travelling to Guyana. Check what you must do to return to the UK.
This page reflects the UK government’s understanding of current rules for people travelling on a full ‘British Citizen’ passport from the UK, for the most common types of travel.
The authorities in Guyana set and enforce entry rules.
All travellers
British nationals do not need visas to visit Guyana. Visitors are generally given 30 days to remain in Guyana, but extensions can usually be obtained from the Ministry of Home Affairs in Georgetown. The Guyanese authorities are very severe on visitors who overstay or abuse the conditions of their stay. Conviction for overstaying will result in one year imprisonment, a fine of up to G$50,000 (Guyana dollars) and deportation - at the deportee’s expense - upon release.
All incoming passengers must take a PCR SARs-CoV-2 or SARS-CoV-2 Antigen test 72 hours before travel. If the Antigen or PCR SARs-CoV-2 test results exceed 72 hours from the date it was taken, travellers are required to have a repeat Antigen or PCR test upon arrival in Guyana. Passengers who are required to be re-tested shall bear the financial cost of doing so at the airport testing facility.
Passengers whose tests were taken within 72 hours upon arrival in Guyana, who are asymptomatic, and who are fully vaccinated against SARS-CoV-2, will be permitted to leave the airport after being granted clearance by Immigration and Customs officials.
