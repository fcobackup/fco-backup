Coronavirus guidance is being updated.
Read what you can and cannot do

Bring enough cash for the duration of your stay. Credit cards are not widely accepted beyond Tashkent and the main tourist areas of Samarkand and Bukhara. Travellersâ€™ cheques are not normally accepted. There are very few cash dispensers. US dollars are the most widely accepted foreign currency. Only change money through official exchange booths. It is illegal to change money on the black market, and harsh penalties will be imposed on those caught doing so. Damaged or marked bank notes will not be accepted at official exchange locations.
You will need to complete a foreign currency declaration form when you arrive, and keep a copy yourself. You cannot leave with more foreign currency than you arrive with.
