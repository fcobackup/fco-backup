The information on this page covers the most common types of travel and reflects the UK government’s understanding of the rules currently in place. Unless otherwise stated, this information is for travellers using a full ‘British Citizen’ passport.
The authorities in the country or territory you’re travelling to are responsible for setting and enforcing the rules for entry. If you’re unclear about any aspect of the entry requirements, or you need further reassurance, you’ll need to contact the embassy, high commission or consulate of the country or territory you’re travelling to.
You should also consider checking with your transport provider or travel company to make sure your passport and other travel documents meet their requirements.
Entry rules in response to coronavirus (COVID-19)
Entry to Romania
On 5 October 2020, the Romanian Government issued an updated list of countries for which COVID-19 travel restrictions are in place.
Travellers arriving into Romania from the UK must quarantine for 14 days on arrival. If however, after 8 days of quarantine, you present no specific COVID-19 symptoms and take a COVID-19 test which returns a negative result, you may leave quarantine after 10 days.
Travellers planning to stay in Romania for 3 days or less are exempt from quarantine, as long as they provide evidence of a negative COVID-19 test, taken within 48 hours before entering the country.
Regular entry requirements
Visas
If you hold a British Citizen passport, you don’t need a visa to enter Romania. If you’re planning a stay of longer than 3 months, see our Living in Romania guide and contact the Romanian Embassy if you have further questions. 
The rules on travel will stay the same until 31 December 2020.
Visas from 1 January 2021
The rules for travelling or working in Europe will change from 1 January 2021:
You will be able to travel to Romania for up to 90 days in any 180-day period without a visa for purposes such as tourism. This is a rolling 180-day period.
As Romania is not within the Schengen area, visits to other EU countries will not count against this total.
To stay for longer, to work or study, or for business travel you will need to meet the entry requirements set out by Romania. This could mean applying for a visa or work permit. You should check with the Romanian Embassy what type of visa, if any, you will need.
Periods of stay authorised under a visa or permit will not count against the 90-day limit.
The European Commission has not yet set out how the limit of 90 days in any 180-day period for visa-free travel will be implemented for those who are already travelling in the EU or Schengen Area on 31 December 2020.
If you are travelling to Romania before 31 December 2020 and will stay until 1 January 2021 or later, you should check with the Romanian Embassy for information on how the 90-day visa-free limit will apply to you.
At border control for Romania, you may need to:
show a return or onward ticket
show you have enough money for your stay
use separate lanes from EU, EEA and Swiss citizens when queueing
Your passport may be stamped on entry and exit.
Passport validity
The rules on travel will stay the same until 31 December 2020.
Your passport should be valid for the proposed duration of your stay; you do not need any additional period of validity on your passport beyond this.
Passport validity from 1 January 2021
From 1 January 2021, you must have at least 6 months left on an adult or child passport to travel to most countries in Europe (not including Ireland).
If you renewed your current passport before the previous one expired, extra months may have been added to its expiry date. Any extra months on your passport over 10 years may not count towards the 6 months needed.
Check your passport is valid for travel before you book your trip. You will need to renew your passport before travelling if you do not have enough time left on your passport.
Parental consent when travelling with minors
Some British nationals travelling with minors who hold Romanian citizenship (irrespective of whether they hold citizenship of other countries) are prevented from leaving the country without notarised parental consent from the minor’s non-travelling parent/s. While enforcement of this may vary at borders, British nationals travelling with minors who hold Romanian citizenship should obtain notarised parental consent before departure from Romania.
A list of the public notaries can be found on the website of the National Union of Public Notaries from Romania.
Working in Romania
If you intend to work in Romania, you should register with the Romanian Office for Immigrants. No separate work permit is required. You can also register as self-employed. For further information on working in Romania, contact the General Inspectorate for Immigration at 15A, Lt. col. Marinescu C-tin Street, Sector 5, Bucharest; email: igi@mai.gov.ro.
Customs regulations
Information on customs regulations is available on the website of the National Customs Authority of Romania.
UK Emergency Travel Documents
UK Emergency Travel Documents are accepted for entry, transfer and exit from Romania.
