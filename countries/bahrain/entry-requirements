This information is for people travelling on a full ‘British citizen’ passport from the UK. It is based on the UK government’s understanding of Bahrain’s current rules for the most common types of travel.
The authorities in Bahrain set and enforce entry rules. If you’re not sure how these requirements apply to you, contact the Bahrain Embassy in the UK.  
Passport validity requirements
To enter Bahrain, your passport must have an ‘expiry date’ at least 6 months after the date you arrive.  
Check with your travel provider that your passport and other travel documents meet requirements. Renew your passport if you need to.
You will be denied entry if you do not have a valid travel document or try to use a passport that has been reported lost or stolen.
If you are a dual Bahraini-UK national the authorities may require you to enter and exit Bahrain on a Bahrain travel document only. If your Bahraini passport is not valid or in your possession, seek advice from your nearest Bahraini Embassy before you travel to Bahrain. Bahraini passport renewals whilst in Bahrain may take a long time and could potentially disrupt your travel plans. Decisions related to entering and exiting Bahrain are always made by the Bahraini authorities.
If you are not sure how these requirements apply to you, contact the Bahrain Embassy in the UK or Bahrain’s  Nationality, Passports and Residency Affairs (NPRA).
Visa requirements

Applying for a visa

Travel bans

are involved in legal proceedings
have unpaid debt

If you’re involved in a dispute, including civil and criminal disputes or immigration violation, you may be stopped from leaving the country. The travel ban will not be lifted until the issue is resolved. You may not know you’re subject to a travel ban until you try to leave or enter Bahrain. You can check with the Bahrain Immigration Department to see whether you’re subject to a travel ban.
Vaccine requirements
To enter Bahrain, you must have a certificate to prove you’ve had a yellow fever vaccination if you’re coming from a country listed as a transmission risk.
