Restrictions in response to coronavirus
Cruise ships from any country worldwide will not be permitted to berth in Seychelles until further notice and passengers from cruise ships will not be permitted to disembark. If you have made plans to travel to or from Seychelles by cruise ship, then you should contact your tour operator for further information.
From 1 June, Seychelles International Airport may allow private jets and commercial charter flights to land if they are carrying passengers who will then be transferred to authorised yachts, or to specifically authorised tourist facilities. For now, all passengers must have proof of a negative coronavirus test performed in the 48 hours prior to boarding. Limited commercial options may also become available in the coming weeks. You should contact your airline and the Seychelles Department of Health to understand when and if you will be permitted entry to Seychelles.
Any passengers arriving in Seychelles will be subject to a two week mandatory isolation or quarantine. All entry to the country must be approved by the Public Health Commissioner.
Permission for yachts to enter Seychelles waters may be granted by the Public Health Commissioner. Permission for crew to disembark will not be granted until the vessel has spent at least 14 days at sea. If you intend to enter Seychelles waters and if you wish to disembark from a vessel, you are required to contact the Seychelles Department of Health before attempting to do so.

The authorities in the country or territory you’re travelling to are responsible for setting and enforcing the rules for entry.
