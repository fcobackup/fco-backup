The Foreign and Commonwealth Office (FCO) is advising British nationals against all non-essential international travel at this time. Existing advice for Georgia remains in place:
The FCO advise against all travel to:
the breakaway regions of South Ossetia and Abkhazia
The British government does not recognise the unilateral declarations of independence made by the de facto authorities in the breakaway regions of Abkhazia and South Ossetia. Consular support is not available in parts of Georgia where the FCO advise against all travel. See Local travel
Cases of coronavirus (COVID-19) have been confirmed in Georgia. The Georgian Government has introduced a number of measures to limit the spread of the virus. See Coronavirus
The political situation in Georgia is generally calm, but demonstrations and opposition rallies are likely, sometimes at short notice. You should remain vigilant, stay away from any large gatherings and demonstrations and follow the advice of local authorities. See Political situation
Foreign nationals have been detained on arrival in Georgia for possession of medicines that would not normally be problematic in the UK or other countries. See Travelling with medicines
Take out comprehensive travel and medical insurance before you travel to Georgia. You may face difficulties if you cannot provide evidence of valid travel insurance on arrival. See Travel insurance
Take care when driving and if possible avoid driving at night. See Road travel
There is some risk from unexploded ordnance in areas along the Administrative Boundary Lines with South Ossetia and Abkhazia, and near the border with Azerbaijan (Red Bridge area in particular). Areas where unexploded ordnance might be present are not always marked. See Local travel
Terrorist attacks in Georgia can’t be ruled out. See Terrorism
You can contact the emergency services by calling 112.
If you’re abroad and you need emergency help from the UK government, contact the nearest British embassy, consulate or high commission.
