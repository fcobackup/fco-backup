See the TravelHealthPro website for further advice on travel abroad and reducing spread of respiratory viruses during the COVID-19 pandemic.
International travel
If you’re a British national intending to travel to Laos, you should check with your airline due to restrictions affecting all nationalities travelling from or transiting countries with community transmission of Covid-19. Departing flights are unaffected. You should sign up for email alerts for updates to this travel advice.
Commercial flights to and from Laos remain very limited. Check with your travel company for the latest information.
Entry and borders
The government of the Lao PDR has suspended the visa on arrival service at all international entry points. No visas are being issued to people travelling from or transiting a country with ongoing COVID-19 outbreak. However, the authorities may consider granting entry permission for foreigners (experts, technicians and foreign nationals that are needed for essential projects) who wish to travel to Laos. See Entry requirements
Travel in Laos
There are no national travel restrictions within Laos and taxis, public transport and domestic flights have resumed services. You will need to wear a mask. Temperature checks are in operation in some locations. On 4 December a localised travel restriction was introduced on entering or leaving Luang Namtha Province; please check with local authorities before travelling to that area, and confirm any internal flights with the airline.
Travel via Thailand
An Emergency Decree is currently in force stating all foreign nationals are barred from entering or transiting Thailand except in certain limited circumstances. If you do not meet these criteria you should not try to enter or transit Thailand. You should check the Thailand travel advice for further details.
The Thai government has announced that all Thailand-Laos border crossings are closed until further notice, including the Friendship Bridge between Vientiane and Nong Khai. Only commercial goods are permitted to cross at present. There may be exemptions for medical emergencies at the discretion of the Laos and Thai medical authorities.
Accommodation
Hotels and private rental accommodation is available throughout Laos, although a number of hotels/hostels are currently closed due to reduced tourist numbers. You should arrange accommodation in advance of travel.
Public places and services
Most businesses including restaurants, shops, food markets, gyms/spas, sports facilities, night markets, cinemas, casinos and tourist attractions are open. In some locations COVID preventative measures are in place. These include providing alcohol gel, face masks being worn, maintaining 1m physical distancing, and checking temperatures.
Some venues where the 1m social distancing rule cannot be applied, such as karaoke and night clubs, remain closed.
Social gatherings, weddings and traditional events are now permitted as long as COVID-19 prevention measures and social distancing of 1m are in place.
Further measures may be introduced at short notice. You should follow the advice of the Lao authorities.

COVID-19 vaccines if you live in Laos
As information is available about the national vaccination programme, this page will be updated.
The Medicines and Healthcare Products Regulatory Agency (MHRA) is the UK authority responsible for assessing the safety, quality and efficacy of vaccines. It has authorised the Pfizer/BioNTech, Oxford/AstraZeneca and Moderna vaccines for temporary supply and use in the UK. Find out more about MHRA approval for these vaccines.
British nationals living overseas should seek medical advice from their local healthcare provider in the country where they reside.
