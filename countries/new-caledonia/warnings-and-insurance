FCDO advises against all but essential travel to New Caledonia
Your travel insurance could be invalidated if you travel against FCDO advice. Consular support is also severely limited where FCDO advises against travel.
Given ongoing tensions, we advise against all but essential travel to New Caledonia.

There is no British Embassy in New Caledonia and the British Embassy in Paris, France, supports British nationals who need emergency help from the UK government.
If you are in New Caledonia and in need of UK consular assistance, please contact the British Embassy in Paris which operates a 24/7 consular telephone service.
