Travelling to areas within 20km of the Ecuadorean border with Colombia to which the FCDO advises against all but essential travel to carries significant risks due to the presence of organised crime linked to the production and trafficking of drugs.
The security situation in those areas of Esmeraldas, Carchi and Sucumbios provinces, which lie outside the 20km border zone can change quickly. If you are travelling to these areas, including Cuyabeno, the Napo river, and the El Angel ecological reserve where there are a number of eco lodges, you should take local advice, pay close attention to warnings issued by the Ecuadorean authorities and be particularly cautious and vigilant. Illegal armed groups and criminal gangs are present in these areas. Travelling during daylight hours and with a reputable operator with official guides, emergency plans and good communication systems will reduce risks. Some lodges are a long distance from the nearest major hospital and helicopter evacuation may be necessary in an emergency. See Local travel
The nationwide political protests across Ecuador that began on 13 June 2022 ceased on 30 June following an agreement between the government and protestors. The situation in the country has calmed since the agreement.
The nationwide protests in June, and previously in October 2019, caused extensive disruption. Some protests became violent, especially in Quito, and led to a number of fatalities. Avoid any protests or demonstrations and keep up to date with development via official local sources.
If you’re planning travel to Ecuador, find out what you need to know about coronavirus there in the Coronavirus section.
COVID-19 means it is more important than ever to get travel insurance and check it provides sufficient cover. See the FCDO’s guidance on foreign travel insurance.
