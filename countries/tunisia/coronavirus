If you think you have COVID-19 symptoms, you should call a doctor or lab. They will ask a series of questions to assess whether it is likely that you have COVID-19. If COVID-19 is suspected, then they may arrange for someone to come to your home or hotel to conduct a test and they will advise you to self-isolate. You can pay for a test, if required for travel purposes, at the Institut Pasteur.
COVID-19 vaccines if you live in Tunisia
Wherever possible British nationals should aim to be vaccinated in the country where they live. The Tunisian government has announced that foreign nationals resident in Tunisia can register for a COVID-19 vaccine on the government’s EVAX website.
As further information is available about the national vaccination programme, this page will be updated. Sign up to get email notifications.
The Medicines and Healthcare Products Regulatory Agency (MHRA) is the UK authority responsible for assessing the safety, quality and efficacy of vaccines. It has authorised the Pfizer/BioNTech, Oxford/AstraZeneca and Moderna vaccines for temporary supply and use in the UK. Find out more about MHRA approval for these vaccines.
British nationals living overseas should seek medical advice from their local healthcare provider in the country where they reside. Information about vaccines used in other national programmes, including regulatory status, should be available from the local authorities. This list of Stringent Regulatory Authorities recognised by the World Health Organisation may also be a useful source of additional information.

Returning to the UK
When you return, you must follow the rules for entering the UK.
No testing is available at the airport or sea ports. Passengers travelling from Tunisia, who require a test for the country they are travelling to, should arrange a private test.
You should contact local authorities for information on testing facilities. A test can be organised on the Ministry of Health webpage (available in French only).
There have been some reports of travellers from Tunisia being denied entry to a third country, on suspicion of carrying fake PCR test results. This may affect you if you are transiting in one country before onward travel to the UK.
For verification, travellers are advised to carry the original copy of their negative PCR test result, and ensure this has been signed and stamped by the laboratory, before travelling. A QR code on digital test results, if provided by the laboratory, can also be presented to verify the result. This applies above all for travel from Tunisia to France.
