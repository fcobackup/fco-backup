Terrorism in Hungary
Terrorist attacks in Hungary cannot be ruled out.
Political situation
Political demonstrations can take place in Budapest and across Hungary. Demonstrations often happen around important national holidays, such as 15 March (anniversary of 1848 Revolution) and 23 October (anniversary of 1956 anti-Soviet Uprising). Peaceful demonstrations have sometimes turned violent. Avoid demonstrations, monitor the local media and be aware of your surroundings.
Crime
Protecting your belongings
Tourists can be targets for petty crime in Hungary, especially in big cities. Take sensible precautions. Bag snatching and pick-pocketing are common, especially in Budapest. Theft of and from vehicles is common.
Take care:
on busy public transport
in train stations
at markets
in places with high numbers of tourists
Scams in restaurants, bars and clubs
Some restaurants, bars and clubs might charge high amounts for food and drink. Tourists have been taken to cashpoints with demands for the money to pay the bill. Always ask to see the menu and price list before ordering drinks or food, and check your bill carefully before paying. Be wary of establishments where menus do not properly display prices. Report any incidents to the police.
Some taxi drivers are part of these frauds. They may receive a commission to recommend certain bars, clubs and restaurants to passengers. If a taxi driver offers to take you to a bar or club, or you are approached on the street with an invitation, be cautious. Use taxis from a reputable local company.
Use official ATMs or banks. Do not change money on the street.
Drink and food spiking
There have been reports of drinks being spiked, particularly in Budapest bars. Buy your own drinks and keep sight of them at all times.
Laws and cultural differences
Personal ID
Carry your passport at all times. You must show ID if requested. A photocopy is not acceptable.
Illegal drugs and prison sentences
Hungarian laws on the possession and use of drugs are very strict and carry serious penalties and custodial sentences.
LGBT+ travellers
Same-sex relationships and civil partnerships are legal in Hungary but same-sex marriages are not recognised in Hungarian law. Budapest is generally tolerant and open. Recent Pride events have passed without incident, but historically there have been counter-events which have led to verbal, and sometimes physical, confrontation. Outside of Budapest, public affection may receive unwanted attention. Read more advice for LGBT+ travellers.

Transport risks
Public transport
You could be fined if you do not follow the rules of the transport ticket system. Make sure:
on the Metro, you validate your ticket before you get onboard at the entrance to the station
on buses, trams or trolley buses, you validate your ticket immediately after boarding
you keep your ticket until the end of your journey and show it to ticket inspectors if requested
you validate a new ticket each time you change lines or mode of transport
you have the special ticket which is required for the night service network
More information on ticket conditions and prices is available from the Budapest Transport Authority.
Road travel
If you are planning to drive in Hungary, see information on driving abroad and read the RAC guide.
Licences and permits
You can drive in Hungary with a UK driving licence.
If you’re living in Hungary, check the Living in Guide for information on requirements for residents.
Driving a British car abroad
You may need a UK sticker to drive your car outside the UK. In 2021, UK stickers replaced GB stickers. Check guidance on displaying number plates.
Driving regulations
Hungary has a no-alcohol driving policy. It is illegal to drink any alcohol and then drive in Hungary.
You must use headlights on roads outside towns even in daytime.
Toll roads
If you want to use major highways in Hungary, you must buy a motorway vignette (ticket) in advance of your journey. The vignette is a form of toll. If you use the roads without purchasing a vignette, you will be fined.
Haulage vehicles
If you are driving a large haulage vehicle through Hungary, make sure you have full vehicle documentation. International loads must be supported by a TIR carnet providing a full inventory of the goods being carried. You must leave a financial bond with the Hungarian customs when transiting Hungary with a cargo. The financial bond, minus an administration fee, is returned when you leave the country.
If you are planning to transit Hungary with consignments of humanitarian aid following a disaster, or medical aid, contact the Hungarian Embassy in London in advance to apply for a waiver.
Rail travel
Take care when travelling by train (domestically and internationally) and keep your belongings in sight. Take extra care on night trains. Travel with companions where possible and secure your compartment from the inside.
