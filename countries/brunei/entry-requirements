This information is for people travelling on a full ‘British citizen’ passport from the UK. It is based on the UK government’s understanding of Brunei’s current rules for the most common types of travel.
The authorities in Brunei set and enforce entry rules. If you’re not sure how these requirements apply to you, contact the Brunei High Commission in the UK.
COVID-19 rules 
There are no COVID-19 testing or vaccination requirements for travellers entering Brunei. 
Passport validity requirements 
Your passport must have an ‘expiry date’ at least 6 months after the day you enter Brunei. It must not be damaged or have any pages missing. If your passport does not meet these conditions, you may be refused entry and detained. 
Check with your travel provider that your passport and other travel documents meet requirements. Renew your passport if you need to.  
Visa requirements 
British citizen passport holders may enter Brunei for up to 90 days without a visa. If you have another type of British nationality, check visa requirements with Brunei immigration authorities. 
To stay longer (to work or study, for business travel or for other reasons), you must meet the Brunei government’s entry requirements. Check which type of visa or work permit you need with the Brunei High Commission in the UK.  
Make sure you get your passport stamped.
Make sure you get your passport stamped when you enter Brunei. Do not overstay your visa, or violate the terms of entry. Penalties include detention and caning. 
Dual nationality 
Brunei does not recognise the dual nationality of Bruneians. The immigration authorities can refuse your entry if you hold a Bruneian passport and a passport of a different nationality.
If you’re a dual national, you should use the same passport to enter and exit Brunei. The passport you use for entry will determine your nationality in Brunei. If you enter on a Brunei passport, you cannot access British consular assistance, as you will be treated as a Bruneian.  
Declaration form

From 7 September 2024, in response to the spread of the Mpox virus, it is now mandatory for all travellers into Brunei (via land, air or sea) to complete the Health Declaration Form upon arrival. More information can be found at the Ministry of Health website.
