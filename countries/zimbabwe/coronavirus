Cases of coronavirus (COVID-19) have been confirmed in Zimbabwe. The Zimbabwean authorities have introduced a number of measures to limit the spread of the virus.
Travel restrictions
The Government of Zimbabwe has declared a national disaster in response to coronavirus (COVID-19) and put in place screening procedures for coronavirus at all entry points, including land borders and airports. Anyone arriving from a country affected by coronavirus, including the UK, and displaying a symptom associated with the virus will be placed in a Government of Zimbabwe facility for testing. If the results are positive then people will be treated in a Government of Zimbabwe treatment centre.
Many visitors from the UK travel to Zimbabwe via Kenya or South Africa. Both countries have put in place travel restrictions on individuals from countries affected by coronavirus (COVID-19), including the United Kingdom. Follow our travel advice for Kenya or South Africa for information on entry requirements, and consult your nearest South African or Kenyan High Commission
A number of airlines are cancelling or reducing their inward and outward flight schedules. You should urgently contact your airline if you are due to travel to or from Zimbabwe.
