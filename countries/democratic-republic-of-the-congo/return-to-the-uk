Current Government of DRC restrictions mean that no scheduled passenger flights are permitted to enter or leave DRC. The British Embassy is in contact with airlines and local authorities to ensure British people can return to the UK from DRC as soon as possible.
If you are a British National who wishes to leave DRC you should register your interest to leave DRC by email to Kinshasa.Consular@fco.gov.uk. The British Embassy is issuing regular updates on Twitter and Facebook with the latest available information on departure options from DRC. You should check Travel Advice for any country that you will transit on the way back to the UK.
