Healthcare facilities in Armenia 
Public medical facilities and treatment in Yerevan are generally sufficient for minor or straightforward ailments. Public healthcare outside Yerevan is likely to be basic. Private hospitals in Armenia are of a good standard but can be expensive.
Make sure you have adequate travel health insurance and accessible funds to cover the cost of any medical treatment abroad and repatriation.
