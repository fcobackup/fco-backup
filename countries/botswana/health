Before you travel check that:
your destination can provide the healthcare you may need
you have appropriate travel insurance for local treatment or unexpected medical evacuation
This is particularly important if you have a health condition or are pregnant.
Emergency medical number
Call 997 and ask for an ambulance.
Contact your insurance company quickly if you’re referred to a medical facility for treatment.
Vaccine recommendations and health risks
At least 8 weeks before your trip:
check the latest vaccine recommendations for Botswana
see where to get vaccines and whether you have to pay on the NHS travel vaccinations page
See what health risks you’ll face in Botswana including:
malaria, which is reported in April 2025 to have spread to areas where it is not usually present
schistosomiasis
There are occasional outbreaks of anthrax among wild animals. Do not touch dead animals or carcases. If you suspect that you have come into contact with anthrax, seek urgent medical advice.
If you intend to camp or walk in the bush, take precautions to avoid tick bites, as they can cause several dangerous diseases.
Medication
The legal status and regulation of some medicines prescribed or bought in the UK can be different in other countries.

Healthcare in Botswana
On 26 August 2025 Botswana declared a public health emergency due to shortages of essential medicines and equipment. Some non-urgent surgeries have also been temporarily suspended in public health facilities.
Healthcare in Botswana is usually good in major towns, but medical facilities and communications are limited in rural areas. For serious medical treatment, medical evacuation to the UK or South Africa may be necessary.
Private hospitals will not treat you unless you can pay, and the cost may be high. Public hospitals will only take you as an emergency patient if you have full insurance. For outpatient treatment, you will need to pay up front.
Make sure you have adequate travel health insurance and accessible funds to cover the cost of any medical treatment abroad and repatriation.
