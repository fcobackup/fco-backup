The UK does not recognise Taiwan as a state and has no diplomatic relations with Taiwan, so limited support is available to British nationals. Please refer to the British Office in Taipei for further information.
2025 Urban Resilience Air Defence Exercise
Taiwan’s authorities are scheduled to hold the 2025 Urban Resilience Air Defence Exercise from 15 to 18 July. This will be held across Taiwan, and outlying islands. The date and time of the exercise will vary by region. During the exercise, a 30-minute alarm will sound, then evacuation procedures and traffic control will take place in each region.
When the alarm sounds (you will also receive warning message on your mobile phone), follow the guidance of the police and civil defence staff and evacuate to nearby shelters. If you are in the exercise area and fail to comply, you may face fines ranging from 30,000 New Taiwan Dollars to 150,000 New Taiwan Dollars.
Further details, including when the exercise will take place in each region, can be found on the Taipei City Government’s website.
