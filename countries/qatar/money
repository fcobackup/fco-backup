The currency in Qatar is the Qatari Riyal (QAR).
UK credit and debit cards are widely accepted within the larger stores, whilst smaller or stand-alone local stores generally use cash, particularly in the Souqs.
ATMs are located in the major shopping malls, some Souqs, hotels and on the street. As in any country, take sensible precautions when handling cash and credit cards in public or at cash machines.
There are limits to the amount of currency, financial bearer negotiable instruments, precious metals and precious stones that you can carry into or out of Qatar. This is currently set at 50,000QAR (approximately £10,200). If you bring in more than this, you must complete a declaration form and provide any further information as requested by customs officials. Items to be declared include, but are not limited to:
Currency – Qatari riyal or foreign currencies
Financial bearer negotiable instruments – travellers cheques, money orders, cheques, promissory notes including those endorsed without restriction, incomplete, payable to a fictitious payee, signed but without the payees name
Precious metals – gold, silver, platinum etc.
Precious stones – diamonds, emeralds, rubies, sapphires, pearls etc.
Failure to comply with these rules could lead to fines or imprisonment, as well as seizure of such funds.
