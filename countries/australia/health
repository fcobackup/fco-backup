Before you travel check that:
your destination can provide the healthcare you may need
you have appropriate travel insurance for local treatment or unexpected medical evacuation
This is particularly important if you have a health condition or are pregnant.
Emergency medical number
Dial 000 and ask for an ambulance.
Contact your insurance or medical assistance company promptly if you’re referred to a medical facility for treatment.
Vaccinations and health risks
At least 8 weeks before your trip check:

Healthcare facilities in Australia
While you are in Australia, you can access essential and urgent medical care through the UK-Australia Reciprocal Healthcare Agreement. Find out more about healthcare for UK citizens in Australia.
Essential and urgent hospital treatment is free. There is a charge to visit GPs and receive prescriptions. Some costs can be recovered through Medicare, Australia’s universal health insurance scheme. You can enrol with Medicare through Services Australia.
If you’re not covered by reciprocal healthcare arrangements between Australia and the UK, costs of treatment can be high.
The standard of healthcare in Australia is very good. UK residents are entitled to limited subsidised health services from Medicare for medically necessary treatment while visiting Australia. These provisions do not apply to non-visitors, for example those studying in Australia. Other exclusions under the reciprocal agreement include pharmaceuticals (unless you’re in hospital), use of ambulance services and medical evacuations, which are very expensive.
