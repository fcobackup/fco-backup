This advice reflects the UK government’s understanding of current rules for people travelling on a full ‘British citizen’ passport from the UK, for the most common types of travel.
The authorities in South Korea set and enforce entry rules. If you’re not sure how these requirements apply to you, contact the South Korean Embassy in the UK.
COVID-19 rules
There are no COVID-19 testing or vaccination requirements for travellers entering South Korea.
Passport validity requirements
If you are visiting as a tourist for up to 90 days, your passport must have an ‘expiry date’ after the date you are leaving South Korea.
If you are entering South Korea on a long-term visa, your passport should have an ‘expiry date’ at least 6 months after the date you arrive.
Check with your travel provider that your passport and other travel documents meet requirements. Renew your passport if you need to.
You will be denied entry if you do not have a valid travel document or try to use a passport that has been reported lost or stolen.
Visa requirements
You do not need a visa to visit South Korea as a tourist for up to 90 days. You must have an onward or return ticket. It’s illegal to work on a tourist visa, whether as a teacher or in any other capacity.
If you are travelling for any purpose other than short-term business or tourism, check visa requirements with the South Korean Embassy in the UK.
For those in South Korea on a work visa, all employment changes must be authorised by Korean Immigration.
Re-entry permits for long-term visa holders
Most foreign nationals in South Korea on long-term visas are allowed to re-enter South Korea within one year of departure without the need for a re-entry permit. Check with the Korea Immigration Service.
If you are resident and intend to spend more than a year outside of South Korea, in most cases, you must apply for a multiple re-entry permit via the Hi Korea website before departure. If you require a re-entry permit, engage early with the immigration authorities and apply for a re-entry permit at least 4 working days ahead of any planned travel. 
Visas for working as an English teacher
To get a visa to teach English in South Korea, you must have a 3-year university degree. A Teaching English as a Foreign Language (TEFL) qualification alone is not enough. If you are found to have a teaching visa by deception, you will be detained and deported.
British nationals teaching English in South Korea have sometimes found living and working conditions to be below their expectation or have had difficulties getting the correct visas and residence permits. Some also report more serious problems such as breach of contract, confiscation of passport, payment being withheld and inadequate insurance.
Check all terms and conditions of your employment carefully. If possible, speak to other teachers from the place where you plan to work before accepting any offer. If you are in South Korea and in need of assistance, you should contact British Embassy in Seoul.
Vaccination requirements
At  least 8 weeks before your trip, check the vaccinations and certificates you need in TravelHealthPro’s South Korea guide.
Customs rules
There are strict rules about goods you can take into or out of South Korea. You must declare anything that may be prohibited or subject to tax or duty.
