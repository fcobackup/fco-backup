Coronavirus travel health
Check the latest information on risk from COVID-19 for Taiwan on the TravelHealthPro website
See the TravelHealthPro website for further advice on travel abroad and reducing spread of respiratory viruses during the COVID-19 pandemic.
International arrivals
When COVID-19 levels in Taiwan were low, every positive case was hospitalised, even asymptomatic cases. Following a recent spike in cases only serious cases will now be hospitalised, while less serious, including asymptomatic cases, will be admitted into an enhanced centralised quarantine centre or hotel with professional medical staff on site. The decision on which category individual cases fall into will be made by the Taiwan Centers for Disease Control (CDC) and on a case by case basis.
You should refer to the Taiwan Centers for Diseases Control website or contact their helpline on 1922 for information on testing facilities.

Be prepared for your plans to change
No travel is risk-free during COVID. Countries may further restrict travel or bring in new rules at short notice, for example due to a new COVID-19 variant. Check with your travel company or airline for any transport changes which may delay your journey home.
Plan ahead and make sure you:
can access money
understand what your insurance will cover
can make arrangements to extend your stay and be away for longer than planned
Pre-Departure COVID-19 PCR Testing
Any individual who receives a positive COVID-19 PCR test will not be permitted to board an aircraft to depart Taiwan. Instead, you will be required by law to complete a mandatory quarantine: the length of which will depend on the seriousness of the case. Individuals with mild or no symptoms will be admitted into an enhanced centralised quarantine centre or hotel for this period. It may also be possible to quarantine at your residential property providing this meets the quarantine requirements. Any individual with moderate or more severe symptoms may be hospitalised. This applies to all nationalities and age groups and is irrespective of the purpose of their intended travel. The decision regarding these arrangements will be made by the Taiwan Centers for Disease Control (CDC) and on a case by case basis.
Any individual who receives a positive COVID-19 PCR test will be contacted by their local health bureau who will advise on their mandatory quarantine arrangements. Visit the Taiwan Centers for Disease Control website or contact their helpline on 1922 for further information.
Further information regarding quarantine requirements at your residential property can be found in the Healthcare in Taiwan section.
For passengers travelling with children, you should check with your airline before you travel regarding the COVID-19 test requirements.

Quarantine requirements for domestic COVID-19 cases
The Central Epidemic Command Centre (CECC) has announced new measures for home care management for individuals who have contracted COVID-19 domestically in Taiwan. Individuals who present asymptomatic or mild COVID-19 symptoms and meet the required criteria will now be permitted to undergo their mandatory quarantine at their residential address. Individuals with moderate or severe symptoms will be admitted directly to an enhanced centralised quarantine centre or hospital for treatment. The length of your quarantine period will depend on the seriousness of your COVID-19 infection.
You will be required to undergo an initial COVID-19 PCR test which the local authorities will arrange for you. No further COVID-19 tests will be required during this period unless you have been instructed separately by the local authorities. The cost of this COVID-19 PCR test and any further COVID-19 tests will be covered by the Taiwanese authorities.
You can end your quarantine after 10 days providing that your health condition has improved. If you are still presenting symptoms after 10 days, you are required by law to contact your local health department or the Taiwan Centers for Disease Control to report this. A decision will then be made on a case by case basis whether further tests or quarantine is required.
If you choose to quarantine at your residential address, closely monitor your symptoms throughout your quarantine period and contact 119 or your local health department if you need medical assistance.
You should refer to the Taiwan Centers for Disease Control (CDC) or contact their helpline on 1922 for further information.
Contact tracing requirements in Taiwan
The Central Epidemic Command Centre (CECC) has announced the launch of a new self-reporting contact tracing system for members of the public who have contracted COVID-19 locally in Taiwan.
Any individual who receives a positive COVID-19 PCR test will receive a text message from the local authorities which advises on their positive test result and a link to the new self-reporting portal. You will then be required to report your condition, recent contact history and whether you require any medical assistance by logging on to the online system and following the instructions provided. Once completed, you will then receive instructions from the system advising on your quarantine and any further testing requirements.
You should refer to the Taiwan Centers for Disease Control (CDC) or contact their helpline on 1922 for further information.
