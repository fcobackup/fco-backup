Entry rules in response to coronavirus (COVID-19)
Entry to Bermuda
All visitors from a country classified by the WHO as having community transmission of COVID-19 (including the UK) will need to apply for a Bermuda COVID-19 Travel Authorisation 1 to 3 days before departure. By applying for a Travel Authorisation, visitors and residents agree to comply with Bermuda’s quarantine and public health laws instructions at all times.
From 23 August 2021, all immunised travellers will be given a red wristband upon arrival. Immunised travellers with pretest must wear it until receiving the negative arrival test. Immunised travellers without pretest must wear until receiving the negative Day 4 test. All unimmunised children travelling with an immunised parent/guardian will be given a red wristband upon arrival, which must be worn until receiving Day 4 test result.
Effective September 26 2021, unimmunised travellers must complete their mandatory 14 day quarantine at an accommodation of their choice (at home or other accommodation). For further information, you should visit the Government of Bermuda website.
You must wear face masks when travelling to the departure airport and practice social distancing at the departure airport.
Upon arrival, you must show a copy of your Travel Authorisation and present a copy of the pre-departure PCR COVID-19 negative test result to health officers on request.
All travellers will undergo PCR COVID-19 testing at the Bermuda L.F. Wade International Airport. It is important that you adhere to the COVID-19 guidance and quarantine in your accommodation until airport test results are ready. Failure to adhere to guidelines could result in a fine of up to $25,000 and/or up to six months imprisonment.
