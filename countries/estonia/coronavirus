Travel in Estonia
Nationwide restrictions related to coronavirus and penalty for violating the restrictions is available on the website of the Estonian government.
Additional nationwide restrictions are in place from 24 November and will be reviewed every two weeks.
You must wear a mask or cover your nose and mouth in public indoor spaces, including public transport, shops and malls.
People with medical exemptions and children under the age of 12 are not required to wear a mask or cover their nose and mouth if sufficient social distancing is maintained.
A public indoor space is any space intended for public use that anyone can enter without registering in advance. This includes public transport.
The ‘2+2 Rule’ extends to all public indoor spaces. This rule allows two people to meet, keeping a distance of two metres from other people at all times.
The ‘10+2 Rule’ applies in catering establishments (for example, restaurants, cafés, and bars) and places where entertainment services are provided (for example cinemas). This rule means that a group of up to 10 people may meet, while maintaining a distance of two metres from others outside the group. These restrictions do not apply to family units.
Additional restrictions are in place in both Ida-Viru and Harju Counties (including Tallinn city) which require the closure of restaurants, entertainment venues and gyms.
