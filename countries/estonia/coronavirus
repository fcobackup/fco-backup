See the TravelHealthPro website for further advice on travel abroad and reducing spread of respiratory viruses during the COVID-19 pandemic.
Entry and borders
Travellers arriving from the UK are required to self-isolate for 10 days.
See Entry requirements to find out what you will need to do when you arrive in Estonia, options for shortening the self-isolation period and list of exemptions from the restrictions, including for travellers who are double vaccinated.
Returning to the UK
When you return, you must follow the rules for entering the UK.
You are responsible for organising your own COVID-19 test, in line with UK government testing requirements. You should contact local authorities for information on testing facilities and obtaining test certificates. You should check that the test result can be provided in the correct format and language.
Be prepared for your plans to change
No travel is risk-free during COVID. Countries may further restrict travel or bring in new rules at short notice, for example due to a new COVID-19 variant. Check with your travel company or airline for any transport changes which may delay your journey home.
If you test positive for COVID-19, you may need to stay where you are until you test negative. You may also need to seek treatment there.
Plan ahead and make sure you:
can access money
understand what your insurance will cover
can make arrangements to extend your stay and be away for longer than planned

COVID-19 vaccines if you live in Estonia
We will update this page when the Government of Estonia announces new information on the national vaccination programme. You can sign up to get email notifications when this page is updated.
The Estonian national vaccination programme started in December 2020 and is using the Pfizer-BioNTech, Moderna, AstraZeneca and Johnson and Johnson vaccines. Please note that the Government of Estonia recommends that only those aged over 50 receive the AstraZeneca vaccine. The Government of Estonia has stated that British nationals resident in Estonia are eligible for vaccination if they choose to join the programme. Further information on the vaccination programme is available on the Government of Estonia Ministry of Health website.
Find out more, including about vaccines that are authorised in the UK or approved by the World Health Organisation, on the COVID-19 vaccines if you live abroad.
If you’re a British national living in Estonia, you should seek medical advice from your local healthcare provider. Information about COVID-19 vaccines used in the national programme where you live, including regulatory status, should be available from local authorities.
If you receive your COVID-19 vaccination in Estonia, you can get an EU Digital COVID Certificate from the national authorities. The Certificate proves that you have been vaccinated against COVID-19, received a negative test result, or recovered from COVID-19. It will help facilitate your travel within the EU and, in some countries, you can use it to demonstrate your COVID-19 status to businesses and other organisations. For further information visit the European Commission’s EU Digital COVID Certificate page.
