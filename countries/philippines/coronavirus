Be prepared for your plans to change
No travel is risk-free during COVID. Countries may further restrict travel or bring in new rules at short notice, for example due to a new COVID-19 variant. Check with your travel company or airline for any transport changes which may delay your journey home.
If you test positive for COVID-19, you may need to stay where you are until you test negative. You may also need to seek treatment there.
Plan ahead and make sure you:
can access money
understand what your insurance will cover
can make arrangements to extend your stay and be away for longer than planned
Travel in the Philippines
Measures have been introduced by the Philippine government to prevent the spread of coronavirus; these differ across the country.
Community quarantine restrictions remain in place in many locations. You should check with the Inter-Agency Task force and your Local Government Unit for the latest information on the restrictions where you are.
The wearing of face shields while on public and private transport is now mandatory. This includes but is not limited to trains, buses, jeepneys, taxis, boats and ships. The order also includes aeroplanes. You should check with your airline in advance whether they will provide a shield or whether you need to bring your own.
You should closely monitor announcements from local authorities to understand the latest restrictions and regulations where you’re situated, and their impact on your ability to travel and access essential services. Check the requirements of your local authority such as barangay clearance, health certificate or travel authority for any travel outside of your residence, including to the airport. For further information on rules and restrictions relating to quarantine classifications, visit the Department for Health website.
Travel to the airport
Since November 2020, some airports including Ninoy Aquino International Airport (NAIA) have required passengers to download the ‘Traze Contact Tracing’ app prior to entry. You can find further information on the NAIA facebook page.
If you plan to take a commercial flight but are experiencing difficulty travelling to the airport due to community quarantine restrictions, the British Embassy can provide a letter to facilitate your passage through checkpoints. You can submit your request to our Consular team via the web contact form. You can also seek assistance from your local Department of Tourism office, which may be able to offer advice on transport options or hotels.
The Philippine government has confirmed that foreign nationals will be able to leave the Philippines at any time during the period of enhanced quarantine. See Entry requirements.
There is disruption to travel routes both domestically and across the region. Check with your travel provider for updates.

COVID-19 vaccines if you live in the Philippines
We will update this page when the Government of the Philippines announces new information on the national vaccination programme. You can sign up to get email notifications when this page is updated.
The Philippines national vaccination programme started in March 2021 and is using the AstraZeneca, Janssen (Johnson and Johnson), Pfizer-BioNTech, Moderna, Sinovac and Sputnik V vaccines. The Government of the Philippines has stated that British nationals resident in the Philippines are eligible for vaccination if they choose to join the programme, on the same priority basis as Filipino nationals. Registration for vaccines will take place at a local level and you should contact your Local Government Unit for further information. The Philippines Department of Health has published Frequently Asked Questions about COVID vaccines in the Philippines.
