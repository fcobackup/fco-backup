Cases of coronavirus (COVID-19) have been confirmed in Paraguay. The Paraguayan authorities have introduced measures to limit the spread of the virus.
The Paraguayan government has announced that they expect all flights to stop operating out of Paraguay from Saturday 21 March. LATAM Airline continues, however, to operate some flights from Asuncion to SÃ£o Paulo during the week beginning 22 March. Some flights continue to fly onwards from Brazil to the UK. All direct flights from Asuncion to Europe have been suspended.
This information may change at very short notice. You must check flights / connecting flights with your travel agent / insurers before booking.
The FCO strongly encourage non-resident British nationals in Paraguay to consider leaving to avoid difficulties they will face if flights out of the country and the region are further restricted and they are unable to get home.
Non-resident British nationals in Paraguay who wish to leave should contact their airline or tour operator. We suggest you look at booking flights through other countries such as Brazil while it is still a possibility.
Those who have arrived in Paraguay within the last 14 days must comply with the self-isolation requirement for 14 days or leave the country immediately.
