There are limited commercial options to return to the UK from Poland.
If you live in the UK and are currently visiting Poland you’re strongly advised to return now by commercial means. Don’t risk getting stranded.
UK special charter flights will only operate for priority countries where commercial options are not possible. You should not assume that these flights will become available in Poland because commercial routes are operating. Please do not contact the contracted travel management company if no flight is advertised here.
Flights
The suspension of international air transport has been extended until at least 6 June and may be further extended. LOT Polish Airlines have organised some repatriation flights between the UK and Poland, but there are currently no flights planned after the 27 May Warsaw to London Heathrow departure.
If you have booked a standard airline ticket, check with your airline for the latest schedule and information on flight availability, and for refund/rebooking processes if your flight has been cancelled.
Travel via Germany
FlixBus and Sindbad are coach operators providing services from Poland to Germany. Limited flights to the UK are available from German cities, including Berlin and Frankfurt. Check FCO travel advice for Germany for further updates.
Road
You can depart Poland by car or limited coach services over some land border crossings, though the situation could change quickly. If you are willing to make a longer journey, Sindbad provides a coach service to London from Poland (journey times are around 24 hours including channel crossing).
Countries neighbouring Poland have also introduced border restrictions (Czech Republic, Germany, Lithuania, Russia, Slovakia and Ukraine). Check country specific FCO travel advice for any country that you plan to transit on the way back to the UK for details.
Financial assistance for travel
You will need to pay for your return travel to the UK. If departure options are available but you cannot afford the travel costs and have exhausted all other options for getting funds, you may be eligible to apply for an emergency loan from the government. This is a last resort option and you would need to repay the loan when you are back in the UK.
For more information, contact Corporate Travel Management (CTM). CTM are a commercial partner of the FCO and are authorised to administer such loans on behalf of the FCO.
Your journey home
The National Travel Health Network and Centre (NaTHNaC) provides advice on how to stay safe as you travel by air.
If you’re returning home before 8 June, follow the guidance for when you return to the UK on steps you should take to protect yourself and others. From 8 June there will be new rules for entering the UK.
