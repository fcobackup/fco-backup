Coronavirus travel health
Check the latest information on risk from COVID-19 for Slovakia on the TravelHealthPro website
See the TravelHealthPro website for further advice on travel abroad and reducing spread of respiratory viruses during the COVID-19 pandemic.
Entry and borders
See Entry requirements to find out what you will need to do when you arrive in Slovakia.
Returning to the UK
When you return, you must follow the rules for entering the UK.
You are responsible for organising your own COVID-19 test, in line with UK government testing requirements. You should contact local authorities for information on testing facilities or see this list of laboratories offering tests. Some of these can provide test certificates in English on request.
Be prepared for your plans to change
No travel is risk-free during COVID. Countries may further restrict travel or bring in new rules at short notice, for example due to a new COVID-19 variant. Check with your travel company or airline for any transport changes which may delay your journey home.
If you test positive for COVID-19, you may need to stay where you are until you test negative. You may also need to seek treatment there.
Plan ahead and make sure you:
can access money
understand what your insurance will cover
can make arrangements to extend your stay and be away for longer than planned
Public spaces and services
The Slovak government has eased many of the restrictions on public life which were imposed to counter the spread of COVID-19.
The measures and restrictions in a given district, including requirements on facemasks and negative COVID-19 testing for certain activities, may change according to the local epidemiological situation, as set out in a colour-coded framework known as the ‘Covid Automat’. Availability of services and rules on events are also covered. Details can be found on the Slovak government website (in Slovak only). You can check the local restrictions in each district by typing its name into the Slovak government’s online search tool. You may wish to use an online translation tool, as the English language pages are not updated regularly. You can also find details of the latest restrictions on the website of the local English-language media, the Slovak Spectator.
For more information check the Slovak Public Health Authority (in Slovak only). The International Organisation for Migration (IOM) also has information in English. You should also monitor developments on local English language media such as Radio Slovakia International and The Slovak Spectator.
Healthcare in Slovakia
If you are in Slovakia and you are concerned that you may have the symptoms of coronavirus, you should follow the advice of the Slovak authorities and contact your usual healthcare provider by telephone or email, not in person. If your symptoms are severe, you should call 155 or 112, where some operators may speak English.
The Slovak government website has information in English and advice on how to get tested for Covid-19 (currently in Slovak only). You can also consult your nearest regional office of the Slovak Public Health Authority on their website.
For contact details of local hospitals visit our list of healthcare providers. UK-issued prescriptions are not accepted at Slovak pharmacies, and you should bring sufficient supplies with you to cover your stay. If you need repeat medication you would need to consult a local doctor to get a Slovak prescription issued.

COVID-19 vaccines if you live in Slovakia
Wherever possible British nationals should aim to be vaccinated in the country where they live. As information is available about the national vaccination programme, this page will be updated. You can sign up to get email notifications.
All British residents of Slovakia and full-time students can register to receive a COVID-19 vaccination through the Slovak national vaccination programme, regardless of whether they are registered with the Slovak public health insurance schemes. This follows the Slovak Health Ministry’s expansion of eligibility criteria on 14 June. Further details are on the Slovak Health Ministry website (in Slovak only) and translated into English on the local English-language Slovak Spectator website. You can find more information on the Slovak vaccination programme on the Slovak Government website (in Slovak only). You can register for a vaccination by completing and submitting a form (currently in Slovak only). Information and registration is also available by calling 0800 174 174 within Slovakia or +421 222 200 910 from abroad.
If you receive your COVID-19 vaccination in Slovakia, you can get an EU Digital COVID Certificate from the national authorities. The Certificate proves that you have been vaccinated against COVID-19, received a negative test result, or recovered from COVID-19. It will help facilitate your travel within the EU and, in some countries, you can use it to demonstrate your COVID-19 status to businesses and other organisations. For further information visit the European Commission’s EU Digital COVID Certificate page.
The Medicines and Healthcare Products Regulatory Agency (MHRA) is the UK authority responsible for assessing the safety, quality and efficacy of vaccines. It has authorised the Pfizer/BioNTech, Oxford/AstraZeneca and Moderna vaccines for temporary supply and use in the UK. Find out more about MHRA approval for these vaccines.
British nationals living overseas should seek medical advice from their local healthcare provider in the country where they reside. Information about vaccines used in other national programmes, including regulatory status, should be available from the local authorities. This list of Stringent Regulatory Authorities recognised by the World Health Organisation may also be a useful source of additional information. Find out more about the COVID-19 vaccines on the World Health Organization COVID-19 vaccines page.
