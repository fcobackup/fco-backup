Travel in Lesotho
The Government of Lesotho has partially lifted restrictions on movement. However all persons are still required to remain at home unless providing or acquiring goods or services, or attending funerals and religious services.
Anyone leaving their place of residence must wear a mask or face covering. This includes in public and private vehicles, walking in the street, and in shops and public offices.
Travel by vehicle is permitted only when necessary to obtain goods and services. Restrictions to limit the number of passengers carried have now been lifted but face coverings should still be worn on public transport.
Accommodation
Hotels and guest houses are permitted to operate with specific conditions. Many have not yet reopened following the lifting of some of Lesotho’s lockdown restrictions. You should check with your travel agent or accommodation provider for details.
Public places and services
Schools are closed except for the years taking exams. Most businesses and offices are allowed to operate provided health regulations and social distancing are observed.
Anyone leaving their place of residence must wear a mask.
Purchase of alcohol is restricted. Cafes and restaurants may only provide take away meals, and only between 8am and 8pm. Parks and nightclubs are not yet allowed to open.

Healthcare in Lesotho
Medical care in Lesotho is limited. Most expatriates use medical facilities in South Africa. Access to these facilities is currently restricted due to the new South African visa requirements.
