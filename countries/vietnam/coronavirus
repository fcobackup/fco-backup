Coronavirus travel health
Check the latest information on risk from COVID-19 for Vietnam on the TravelHealthPro website
See the TravelHealthPro website for further advice on travel abroad and reducing spread of respiratory viruses during the COVID-19 pandemic.
International travel
Commercial flights to and from Vietnam remain very limited. A number of airline websites allow online booking from Vietnam. However, check carefully in advance whether these flights are guaranteed to fly and whether they are passenger flights. Flights and transit arrangements are still prone to changes and cancellation with little notice.
You should be alert to announcements from local authorities.
If you are returning to the UK, a transit stop in the journey may require you to self-quarantine on arrival. See guidance on entering or returning to the UK
There are some restrictions on airside transit at airports you may transit when travelling to and from Vietnam which you should check in advance to ensure you will be able to transit, particularly transit times, visa and transit visa requirements and whether your baggage can be transferred airside at transit points.
Entry and borders
See Entry requirements to find out what you will need to do when you arrive in Vietnam.
Returning to the UK
When you return, you must follow the rules for entering the UK.
You are responsible for organising your own COVID-19 test, in line with UK government requirements. The Vietnamese authorities have issued information on testing facilities and procedures (only available in Vietnamese). The testing facilities can be contacted directly.
Be prepared for your plans to change
No travel is risk-free during COVID. Countries may further restrict travel or bring in new rules at short notice, for example due to a new COVID-19 variant. Check with your travel company or airline for any transport changes which may delay your journey home.
If you test positive for COVID-19, you may need to stay where you are until you test negative. You may also need to seek treatment there.
Plan ahead and make sure you:
can access money
understand what your insurance will cover
can make arrangements to extend your stay and be away for longer than planned
Public spaces and services
The measures to combat COVID-19 vary from province to province and can be expected to increase and change at short notice. You should be alert to local variations, take a precautionary approach and be ready to comply with local authorities.
Mask wearing is compulsory in public settings. Those not wearing masks may be liable to spot fines.
Starting from midnight on 9 July 2021, Ho Chi Minh City will apply social distancing measures under Directive 16 for 15 days.
In accordance with the Directive, you should ensure you are strictly following the social distancing rules in place. These include but are not limited to:
Staying at home and only going outside for essential needs such as food shopping, obtaining medicine, or urgent medical services
Ban on gatherings of more than two people at public places.
Suspension of public transportation
Ban on travelling to other localities
If in doubt, check with your local authorities to make sure that you are in compliance and to avoid being fined.
To ensure the safety and wellbeing of British nationals and our staff, the British Consulate-General in Ho Chi Minh City will be closed for notarial appointments until further notice. We will keep you updated when you can reschedule your appointments.
