Coronavirus (COVID-19): stay up to date
Cases of coronavirus (COVID-19) have been confirmed in Mongolia. The Mongolian authorities have introduced measures to limit the spread of the virus. For more information, see the Coronavirus page of this advice.
See coronavirus travel advice for guidance on international travel. Sign up for email alerts for Mongolia travel advice.
The Foreign and Commonwealth Office (FCO) advise against all but essential travel to Mongolia, due to travel and entry restrictions implemented by the Mongolian Government related to the coronavirus (COVID-19) pandemic. There is an ongoing global outbreak of coronavirus and cases have been confirmed in Mongolia. See Coronavirus
It is currently not possible for British nationals to enter or exit Mongolia due to restrictions imposed by the Mongolian Government. See Coronavirus.
We are aware of charter flights being arranged by the Government of Mongolia to Seoul on 30 April and to Frankfurt on 2 May. If you wish to leave Mongolia, please send contact details and a photo of the ID page of your passport to consular.mongolia@fco.gov.uk. We will add you to our list and keep you updated on costs and arrangements.
As further information on charter flights becomes available it will be shared on these pages and on the British Embassy Ulaanbaatar Twitter and Facebook sites. See Return to the UK
Around 6,500 British nationals visit Mongolia annually. Most visits are trouble-free.
Mongolia takes border security very seriously and foreign nationals aren’t routinely permitted access to border areas. The authorities can regard zones of up to 100km inside the border as a border area. If you wish to travel in these areas, you must get permission from the State Frontier Guard Authority. Only a few specified land border crossings are open to foreigners. See Border crossings
Although there’s no recent history of terrorism in Mongolia, attacks can’t be ruled out. See Terrorism.
Avoid going out on foot alone at night. Foreigners stand out and can be targeted for attack because of their comparative wealth. See Crime.
If you’re abroad and you need emergency help from the UK government, contact the nearest British embassy, consulate or high commission.
Take out comprehensive travel and medical insurance before you travel.
