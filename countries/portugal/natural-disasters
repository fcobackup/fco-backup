Forest fires
There’s an increased risk of forest fires during summer months and when the weather is hot and dry. Forest fires are highly dangerous and unpredictable. If you’re travelling at these times, check the weather conditions with the Portuguese Met Office and areas where fires may be active with the local Civil Protection authorities. If you see a forest fire, call the emergency services on 112.
Take care when visiting or driving through woodland areas. Make sure cigarette ends are properly extinguished, do not light barbecues and do not leave empty bottles behind. Causing a forest fire is treated as a criminal offence in Portugal even if unintentional.
