The currency of Mozambique is the Metical (‘meticais’ in plural).
Don’t enter or exit the country with more than 500 Meticais.
Make sure you can access money in a variety of ways. Travellers’ cheques are not commonly accepted. US dollars and South African rand are the main exchange currencies.
Credit cards are increasingly accepted in the larger cities. You should tell your bank before using your card in Mozambique.
