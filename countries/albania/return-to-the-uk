Future travel options
The Minister of Health suspended all direct flights between the UK and Albania on 22 December. The Government of Albania keeps this decision under constant review. Currently all direct fights between the UK and Albania are suspended until at least 1 February. You should check with your airline before attempting to travel. If you arrived in Albania via a third country from the UK, you are expected to self-isolate for a period of 14 days. On returning to the UK, you will be expected to follow the UK rules, including self-isolation as appropriate. The British Embassy is aware of situations where recent visitors to Albania have stayed less than 14 days and been fined when checking in at the airport to leave the country for breaking the self-isolation rules (fines can be in excess of £5,000).

If you are worried about overstaying in Albania due to international travel restrictions, you should send a request via e-mail to migracioni.tirane@asp.gov.al and policiakufitare@asp.gov.al and request an extension to your stay in Albania. You should attach your travel document to the e-mail. You should retain the confirmation e-mail as you will need to show it at the police checkpoint when you exit Albania once travel restrictions are removed.
Travelling to the airport
Public transport and taxis are operating as normal.
Your journey home: re-entering the UK
When you return, you must follow the rules for entering the UK. You:
need to provide your journey and contact details up to 48 hours before you’re due to arrive in the UK
are not allowed to leave the place you’re staying for the first 14 days you’re in the UK except in very limited situations (known as ‘self-isolating’)
See also the list of people who are exempt from the border rules.
The National Travel Health Network and Centre (NaTHNaC) also provides advice on how to stay safe as you travel by air.
