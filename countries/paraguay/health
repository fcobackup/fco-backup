Medication
The legal status and regulation of some medicines prescribed or bought in the UK can be different in other countries.
If you need a regular prescription, you should bring enough medication with you.
Read best practice when travelling with medicines on TravelHealthPro.
The NHS has information on whether you can take your medicine abroad.
Healthcare in Paraguay
There are some good private medical facilities, but only in the major cities. Hospitals and GPs will expect immediate payment for medical services. Some types of medicines may not be available.
Elsewhere, facilities may not meet UK standards. Make sure you have adequate travel health insurance and accessible funds to cover the cost of any medical treatment and repatriation.
