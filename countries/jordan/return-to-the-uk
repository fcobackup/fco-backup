There are currently no commercial options available to return to the UK from Jordan.
Flights in and out of the country have been suspended, and land and sea borders are closed. The Government of Jordan has confirmed that these measures will remain in place until 11 May, and there are strong indications that the flight suspension and border closures will continue beyond this date.
The British Embassy are currently scoping an opportunity for British nationals to leave Jordan. While there is currently no confirmed flight we anticipate that there might be a flight to London Heathrow taking place in the next couple of weeks.
If you are a British citizen and you wish to return to the United Kingdom on a flight coordinated by the embassy you will need to confirm your interest by emailing a copy of the bio data page in your passport to cons.amman@fco.gov.uk by 08:00 on Wednesday 29th April 2020 . Any flight options will be on a commercially operated basis only and you will need to pay for your ticket(s).
What to do
If you cannot leave Jordan at this time, you should:
follow the advice of local authorities, including local measures to help minimise your risk of exposure to coronavirus
find accommodation suitable for your needs
keep in regular contact with family and friends at home, so they know you are safe and well
consult your insurance provider, tour operator and transport or accommodation provider about the impact of the situation on your plans

Future travel options
You will need to pay for your return travel to the UK. If departure options are available but you cannot afford the travel costs and have exhausted all other options for getting funds, you may be eligible to apply for an emergency loan from the government. This is a last resort option and you would need to repay the loan when you are back in the UK. For more information, you should contact Corporate Travel Management (CTM). CTM are a commercial partner of the FCO and are authorised to administer such loans on behalf of the FCO.
Arrival in the UK
When you arrive back in the UK, follow the guidance for when you return to the UK on steps you should take to protect yourself and others.
Help and Support
If you need urgent consular assistance, you can contact the British Embassy on +962 (6) 5909200
The Embassy cannot provide further information or advice about departure options over the phone. This page will be updated when departure options become available.
