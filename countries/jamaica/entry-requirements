This page reflects the UK government’s understanding of current rules for people travelling on a full ‘British Citizen’ passport, for the most common types of travel.
The authorities in Jamaica set and enforce entry rules. For further information contact the embassy, high commission or consulate of the country or territory you’re travelling to. You should also consider checking with your transport provider or travel company to make sure your passport and other travel documents meet their requirements.
Restrictions in response to coronavirus
Entry to Jamaica
The following measures apply to travellers to Jamaica:
All travellers from 12 years and upwards arriving in Jamaica must present a certificate issued by a UKAS accredited laboratory showing a negative COVID-19 molecular (PCR, NAA, RNA) or Antigen test result, with the test taken within the 72 hours prior to the date of travel
Since 1 March 2022, travellers are no longer required to quarantine on arrival, as long as they provide a negative test taken up to three days before arrival in Jamaica. For example, if you arrive on Friday, the test can be taken as early as Tuesday
Testing and screening on arrival
All travellers arriving in Jamaica may be tested for COVID-19 if assessed as high-risk as a result of exhibiting symptoms, exposure to persons who have tested positive, belonging to a high-risk group or other risk factors. Travellers may be screened for symptoms at the airport.
Regular entry requirements
Visas
British nationals don’t need a visa to visit Jamaica. Visitors are usually granted entry for a maximum of 90 days.
The date by which you must leave Jamaica will be stamped in your passport. If you wish to extend your stay beyond this date you will need to apply to the Jamaican Passport, Immigration and Citizenship Agency. Overstaying without the proper authority can result in detention and/or a fine.
For further information about entry requirements, see the website of the Jamaican High Commission.
Passport validity
Your passport should be valid for the proposed duration of your stay; you don’t need any additional period of validity on your passport beyond this.
UK Emergency Travel Documents
UK Emergency Travel Documents (ETDs) are accepted for entry to and exit from Jamaica. If your passport has been stolen you do not need to obtain a police report unless it is for insurance purposes. If you’re travelling via the USA using an ETD, you’ll need to get a US visa as ETDs are not valid for entry into the United States under the Visa Waiver Programme (VWP).
Yellow fever certificate requirements
Check whether you need a yellow fever certificate by visiting the National Travel Health Network and Centre’s TravelHealthPro website.
Arrival and departure taxes
Arrival and departure taxes are usually included in the cost of your ticket, but this isn’t always the case for charter flights. Departure tax is US $35 for air passengers. Check with your carrier if you’re unsure whether the tax has been included in your ticket. Landing fees for cruise ship passengers are usually included in the cost of the cruise.
Customs regulations
You can bring local currency (Jamaican dollars) into the country. However, you must declare on your customs form all currencies and monetary instruments over the value of US$10,000.
Personal imports of meat and dairy products from the UK are banned. Customs officials may search baggage and will destroy banned foodstuffs.
