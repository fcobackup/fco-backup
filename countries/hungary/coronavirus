Be prepared for your plans to change
No travel is risk-free during COVID. Countries may further restrict travel or bring in new rules at short notice, for example due to a new COVID-19 variant. Check with your travel company or airline for any transport changes which may delay your journey home.
If you test positive for COVID-19, you may need to stay where you are until you test negative. You may also need to seek treatment there.
Plan ahead and make sure you:
can access money
understand what your insurance will cover
can make arrangements to extend your stay and be away for longer than planned

COVID-19 vaccines if you live in Hungary
We will update this page when the Government of Hungary announces new information on the national vaccination programme. You can sign up to get email notifications when this page is updated.
The Hungary national vaccination programme started in December 2020 and is using the AstraZeneca, Pfizer-BioNTech, Moderna, Janssen (Johnson and Johnson), Sinopharm and Sputnik V vaccines. The Government of Hungary has stated that British nationals resident in Hungary are eligible for vaccination if they choose to join the programme, including those unable to register for a TAJ number.
The Hungarian authorities have asked people to register their interest in receiving a vaccine on the National Health Insurance Fund of Hungary (NEAK) website (in Hungarian only). Once registered, the authorities will invite people for vaccination based on the order of priority determined by the national vaccination programme. You may check if your registration for the vaccine has been successful.
Those who have tested positive for coronavirus over the past 3 months can now also receive their first dose.
As of 1 August, if you are over 18 and have received both the first and second doses of your C-19 vaccination in Hungary, you are eligible for a third (booster) dose. The third dose should come at least four months after the second one. You can book your third dose online. Booking is currently available only for those who have a Hungarian health insurance (TAJ) number.
Vaccinated persons and those who have previously contracted the COVID-19 virus are eligible for a Hungarian Immunity Certificate.
If you have received your vaccination in Hungary but have not received your immunity certificate, you should check on the status of your certificate with your local government office (Kormanyablak) either in person or online (Hungarian Government Services System (Ügyfélkapu) account required). If they say that there is not enough information in their database about your vaccination, then you should ask the doctor who arranged your vaccine to check if your details are correctly entered in the Hungarian Electronic Health Service System (EESZT) as a foreigner, along with an ID number issued by your government.
If you are a permanent resident in Hungary and received your vaccination abroad (in the UK) and you would like to receive a Hungarian immunity certificate, you should contact your local government office (Kormanyablak) either in person or online (Hungarian Government Services System (Ügyfélkapu) account required) to register your vaccination and apply for an immunity certificate.
Find out more, including about vaccines that are authorised in the UK or approved by the World Health Organisation, on the COVID-19 vaccines if you live abroad. If you’re a British national living in Hungary, you should seek medical advice from your local healthcare provider. Information about COVID-19 vaccines used in the national programme where you live, including regulatory status, should be available from local authorities.
If you receive your COVID-19 vaccination in Hungary, you can get an EU Digital COVID Certificate from the national authorities. The Certificate proves that you have been vaccinated against COVID-19, received a negative test result, or recovered from COVID-19. It will help facilitate your travel within the EU and, in some countries, you can use it to demonstrate your COVID-19 status to businesses and other organisations. For further information visit the European Commission’s EU Digital COVID Certificate page.
