Moving around in Barbados
For information on entering Barbados, see Entry Requirements
The government of Barbados imposes a 14 day quarantine in a government facility for all persons arriving on the island.
A daily curfew is in operation. Monday – Thursday the curfew period is from 10:00pm to 5:00am and from Friday to Sunday the curfew is from 8:00pm to 5:00am. Outside of these hours the government of Barbados continues to encourage essential movements only although more business are now open. You should continue to observe social distancing and practice good hygiene at all times.
Wearing a face mask is actively encouraged and some premises will only allow you to enter if you are wearing a face mask. You may have your temperature taken when entering some premises.
Beaches are opened from 5:00am to 6:30pm daily. Restaurants are open for dining, but under strict guidelines. Many restaurants only allow dine-in when a reservation has been made. Pre-ordered takeway, drive through pickup or home deliver are alternative options to dining in. You cannot drink alcohol in public. Churches and faith based organisations have re-opened but under strict guidelines.
You should follow the Barbados Government Information Service on Facebook for further details as plans are subject to change at short notice.

Finance
There is a range of financial support from the government that you can access while you are unable to return due to coronavirus restrictions.
If you’re in Barbados, and have exhausted all other options to cover essential living costs while you wait to return home, you could apply for an emergency loan for your living costs from the UK government. You can only apply if you normally live in the UK and you cannot return home. This last-resort option is for those most in need, and you would need to repay the loan when you are back in the UK. Apply for an emergency loan.
