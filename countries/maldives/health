Medical facilities are limited. There are only a handful of fully equipped hospitals on the capital island, Malé and in Hulhumale. Although most resort islands are within easy reach of a doctor, (and some high-end resorts have their own medical facilities), many are several hours’ travel away from the hospital facilities on Malé. Many resort islands are more than an hour away from the nearest decompression chamber.
Make sure you have adequate travel health insurance and accessible funds to cover the cost of any medical treatment abroad and repatriation.
If you need emergency medical assistance during your trip, dial 102 and ask for an ambulance. You should contact your insurance/medical assistance company promptly if you are referred to a medical facility for treatment.
