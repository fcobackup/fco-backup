In early October the Slovene authorities introduced a Red, Amber and Green rating system, to determine which additional COVID-19 prevention measures are in place within regions in Slovenia. All regions are currently rated Red, and must follow the measures outlined above.
How a region is rated is determined by three criteria:
The number of cases per 100,000 over the previous 14 days.
The number of hospitalised patients.
The number of patients in Intensive Care Units.
The government currently ranks all of Slovenia’s twelve statistical regions as RED.
From midnight on 16 November public transport (buses and trains) will be suspended for an initial two week period. Taxis will still be permitted to operate.
Wherever possible, tickets should be bought in advance (online, ticket machines and at sales counters). Taxi services continue to be available.
The Slovene government provides English-language coronavirus guidance and updates.
