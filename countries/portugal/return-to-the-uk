Returning home from the Azores

The Regional Government has imposed restrictions on movement between municipalities on the Island of São Miguel. You can still travel to the airport, but you will be required to show your boarding pass or airline ticket to the police on request.
Road
There are border controls on the land border with Spain. Cross border workers, goods traffic and people entering or leaving Portugal to return to their place of residence will be allowed to travel.
You can still drive through Spain and France to return to the UK. The French government have implemented their own measures, including required documents for travel into, and transit through, France. Before travelling through France, check our travel advice for France.

If you are planning to use this route, check the latest travel advice for Spain and France ahead of your journey. The Spanish authorities have published a list of hotels and guesthouses (at the end of this document) that will remain open during the state of emergency.
