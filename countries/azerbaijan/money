The currency of Azerbaijan is the manat (AZN)
All goods and services are paid in local currency. Pounds sterling, US dollars and euros are easily exchanged. Major hotels, supermarkets and restaurants in Baku usually accept credit cards. There are ATMs in most major towns and cities.
Take extra care when paying with credit cards or withdrawing money from ATMs and let your credit/debit card provider know where you’re going to avoid your card being blocked for anti-fraud reasons. Report anything suspicious to your credit/debit card provider as early as possible. If you suspect you have been a victim of credit card fraud you can find guidance from the UK Card Association.
