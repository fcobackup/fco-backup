The UK government is working closely with airlines, the Lebanese authorities and other governments to make sure options are available for British nationals to return to the UK as soon as possible. Beirut’s Rafic Hariri International Airport reopened on 1 July 2020. Its capacity will initially be limited to 2000 passengers daily, with limited flight options.
