This information is for people travelling on a full ‘British citizen’ passport from the UK. It is based on the UK government’s understanding of Kyrgyzstan’s current rules for the most common types of travel.
The authorities in Kyrgyzstan set and enforce entry rules. If you’re not sure how these requirements apply to you, contact the Kyrgyz Embassy in the UK.
COVID-19 rules
There are no COVID-19 testing or vaccination requirements for travellers entering Kyrgyzstan.
Passport validity requirements
If you’re visiting or resident in Kyrgyzstan, your passport must have an ‘expiry date’ at least 6 months after the day you arrive.
Check with your travel provider that your passport and other travel documents meet requirements. Renew your passport if you need to.
You will be denied entry if you do not have a valid travel document or try to use a passport that has been reported lost or stolen.
Visa requirements
You can enter Kyrgyzstan as a visitor for stays of up to 60 days without a visa. You must not stay more than 60 days in any 120-day period.
To stay longer (to work or study, for business travel or for other reasons), you must meet the Kyrgyz government’s entry requirements. Check which type of visa or work permit you need with the Kyrgyz Embassy. The Kyrgyzstan Ministry of Foreign Affairs also has information on visas.
Applying for a visa
Apply for a visa online from the Kyrgyzstan Ministry of Foreign Affairs.
Travelling through Kyrgyzstan
If you’re travelling through Kyrgyzstan on your way to another country and will be passing through immigration (sometimes known as a layover), you must follow Kyrgyzstan’s entry requirements.
Vaccine requirements
For details about medical entry requirements and recommended vaccinations, see TravelHealthPro’s Kyrgyzstan guide.
Registering with the authorities
If you’re visiting Kyrgyzstan for more than 60 days, you must register online with the State Registration Service (SRS) (in Kyrgyz and Russian). You must register within 5 days of your entry into Kyrgyzstan for the period of your visa’s validity.
Non-Kyrgyz nationals with a permanent residency permit can host visitors to Kyrgyzstan and register them with the State Registration Service. See information on registration in English.
Kyrgyz-British dual nationality
Kyrgyzstan does not recognise dual nationality. If you enter Kyrgyzstan on a Kyrgyz passport and hold British nationality, the British Embassy can only provide very limited consular assistance. If you’re arrested or detained, the Kyrgyz authorities are unlikely to allow you to get help from the British Embassy.
Customs rules
There are strict rules about goods you can take into or out of Kyrgyzstan (in Russian). You must declare anything that may be prohibited or subject to tax or duty.
