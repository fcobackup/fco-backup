You can spread the virus even if you don’t have symptoms.

Under Montenegrin law you must carry a valid form of ID with you at all times, for example a driving licence, passport or equivalent, otherwise you may be fined. Keep a photocopy of your passport in a safe place.
Drug laws are similar to those in the UK. Possession or trafficking of drugs will attract strict penalties and often a lengthy prison sentence.
Taking photographs of military and police installations, personnel or vehicles is forbidden and may lead to arrest and prosecution by the local authorities.
There are no laws against same-sex sexual activity and there’s a general tolerance towards same-sex couples in Montenegro. However, due to the conservative nature of society, overt public displays of affection may attract unwanted attention. Pride events have been held since 2013 and generally take place without incident. You can find more local information on LGBT issues on the website of Queer Montenegro. See our information and advice page for the LGBT community before you travel.
