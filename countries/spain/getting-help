Reporting crime
To report a crime, including stolen property and lost or stolen passports, you can file a police report (‘denuncia’) at the nearest station of the:
National Police (‘Policia Nacional’)
regional police (‘Ertzaintza’ in the Basque Country, ‘Mossos d’Esquadra’ in Catalonia and ‘Policia Foral’ in Navarre)

Some Spanish cities also offer a Foreign Tourist Assistance Service (‘Servicio de Atención al Turista Extranjero’ or ‘SATE’) where you can report crimes in English.
While in Spain, you can file a police report online for minor offences such as stolen bags or thefts from your car. If you’ve had belongings stolen, you may need to get a police report for insurance purposes.
If you want to report a violent crime or sexual assault, you must go in person to the nearest police station.
