The British Embassy cannot guarantee seats on any of these flights. You will be responsible for payment of the ticket. Individuals who book on any of these flights are responsible for making their own onward travel arrangements. You should also check FCDO Travel Advice regarding onward flights to the UK from the destinations listed above.
If you book a seat you should make sure your luggage will be checked through to your destination. If the airline cannot undertake this task, you should check with the airport, through which you are transiting, whether you will be allowed to collect your luggage and then check-in for your next flight.
As further information becomes available it will be shared on these pages and on the British Embassy Ulaanbaatar Twitter and Facebook sites.
You will need to pay for your return travel to the UK. If departure options are available but you cannot afford the travel costs and have exhausted all other options for getting funds, you may be eligible to apply for an emergency loan from the government. This is a last resort option and you would need to repay the loan when you’re back in the UK.
