This page gives you guidance on how to stay safely in Laos as a visitor, if you are unable to return to the UK.
Everyone should comply with the measures put in place in Laos to limit the spread of coronavirus (COVID-19).
Moving around in Laos
For information on entering Laos, see Entry Requirements
As from Monday 4 May, the Lao Government has eased some of the ‘lockdown’ measures that were previously in place.
Some cafes, markets, restaurants, shopping centres and offices may open, but entertainment venues such as gyms and large gatherings will remain closed for now. All people residing in Laos must continue to practice physical distancing, including while exercising, and remember to wear masks and regularly wash hands.
Supermarkets, pharmacies and shops selling foodstuffs remain open.
Bars and clubs, and educational institutions are closed.
Travel between provinces remains controlled except for essential purposes. Public transport (including domestic flights and buses) remain suspended.
Further measures may be introduced at short notice. You should follow the advice of the Lao authorities.
Visas
The Department of Immigration reopened on 4 May and foreigners are required to maintain valid visas for the period of their stay in Laos. If your visa expired during the lockdown period, you will be required to pay the regular fee for any days without a visa since 9 April in addition to the cost of any extension. Immigration departments will re-impose overstay fines after Friday 8 May.

Finance
There is a range of financial support from the government that you can access while you are unable to return due to coronavirus restrictions.
If you’re in Laos, and have exhausted all other options to cover essential living costs while you wait to return home, you could apply for an emergency loan for your living costs from the UK government. You can only apply if you normally live in the UK and you cannot return home. This last-resort option is for those most in need, and you would need to repay the loan when you are back in the UK. Apply for an emergency loan.

If you need urgent consular assistance, contact your nearest British embassy, high commission or consulate. All telephone numbers are available 24/7.
