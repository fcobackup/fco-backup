Terrorists are likely to try to carry out attacks in Saudi Arabia. The main threat is from Daesh (formerly referred to as ISIL). Attacks could be indiscriminate, including in places visited by foreigners. Opportunistic attacks on Saudi or western targets are also possible. You should be vigilant and follow the advice of the local authorities.
The Saudi security forces have successfully disrupted a number of attack plots, but the scale of extremist activity is significant and attacks continue to take place.
Be especially vigilant during periods of religious significance (including the holy month of Ramadan) and public holidays; terrorist groups sometimes call for attacks at these times. Terrorists carried out several attacks in Saudi Arabia during Ramadan in 2016.
There are posts on jihadist websites and social media encouraging attacks against British, western and other interests, including teachers, schools, oil workers, residential compounds, military, transport and aviation interests, as well as crowded places, including restaurants, hotels, shopping centres and mosques. Further attacks are likely.
If you’re living in Saudi Arabia, you should regularly review and make sure you’re satisfied with the security measures provided by the management and local authorities at the residential compound where you live, the place where you work and the school where your children study.
