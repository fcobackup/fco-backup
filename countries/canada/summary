Around 724,000 British nationals visit Canada each year. Most visits are trouble free.
Environment Canada have issued weather warnings for parts of the Rockies in Alberta and British Columbia, where a major winter storm is expected to bring heavy snow and strong winds lasting from late Friday 27 to Monday 30 September. Treacherous travel conditions are expected. If you are in any of these areas you should monitor the progress of any approaching storm and snowfall on Environment Canada and follow instructions issued by local authorities.
Visitors travelling to Canada by air are now expected to get an electronic travel authorisation (eTA) to enter Canada. For more information about the eTA system, and to apply online, visit the official Canadian government website. See Entry requirements
If you’re visiting Canada you’ll need an eTA to board your flight unless you’re otherwise exempted (for example, if you have a valid Canadian visa or a permanent resident card). If you have British-Canadian dual nationality you won’t be able to apply for an eTA and you’ll need to present a valid Canadian passport to board your flight to Canada.
Terrorists are likely to try to carry out attacks in Canada. See Terrorism
Severe snow storms are a regular occurrence during winter. Monitor local news and weather reports and visit Environment Canada. See Local Travel and Natural Disasters
If you’re abroad and you need emergency help from the UK government, contact the nearest British embassy, consulate or high commission.
