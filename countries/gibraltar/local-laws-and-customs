There’s a low tolerance of any alcohol or drug-related crime (eg being drunk in a public place).
Attitudes towards Lesbian, Gay, Bisexual and Transgender (LGBT) people are generally tolerant in Gibraltar. Same-sex marriage has been legal in Gibraltar since December 2016. There is an active gay community, but given the small size of Gibraltar there are few places which are exclusively LGBT orientated. See our information and advice page for the LGBT community before you travel.
Import and export of goods
Gibraltar is not part of the EU Common Customs Territory.
The amount of goods (e.g. tobacco and alcohol) that you can take into and out of Gibraltar is more limited than for visits between the UK and other EU countries.
Information on duty free allowances when arriving in Gibraltar can be found on the Gibraltar Customs website.
If you regularly enter or return to Gibraltar (more than once per calendar month), you are not entitled to duty free imports.
You should declare any duty free goods to Spanish customs officers if you are entering Spain from Gibraltar.
If you’re returning directly to the UK from Gibraltar, see this information on duty free allowances.
