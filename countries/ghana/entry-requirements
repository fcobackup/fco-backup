This page has information on travelling to Ghana.
This page reflects the UK government’s understanding of current rules for people travelling on a full ‘British Citizen’ passport from the UK, for the most common types of travel.
The authorities in Ghana set and enforce entry rules. If you’re unsure how Ghana’s entry requirements apply to you, contact its UK embassy, high commission or consulate.
All travellers
You need a visa to enter Ghana. See Visas section for more information.
Check your passport and travel documents before you travel
Check with your travel provider to make sure your passport and other travel documents meet their requirements.
Passport validity
Your passport should be valid for a minimum period of 6 months from the date of entry into Ghana.
Visas
You need a visa to enter Ghana. Ghana’s UK visa service is operating. Visit the Ghana High Commission website to stay up to date and to make an online application.
If you are in Ghana and need to extend your visa, you will need to visit the Ghana Immigration Service (GIS) office in person. It isn’t possible to call about an individual case or to book an appointment in advance. Office opening hours are 8 am to 5 pm. The GIS office is off Ako Adjei overpass on Independence Avenue in Accra.
Dual nationality
Ghana recognises dual nationality. To avoid visa fees, Ghanaian-British dual nationals should register with the Interior Ministry in Ghana and get a Dual Nationality card. Production of this card at point of entry into Ghana will indicate that a visa is not required.
Yellow fever certificate requirements
You will be expected to present a yellow fever certificate on arrival in and departure from Ghana.
Volunteering
If you are travelling to work in a volunteer programme or for work experience you should be fully aware of the terms and conditions of your stay and be sure that you will be working for a reputable organisation before you commit yourself to travel. You should read further information on how to stay safe and healthy overseas when volunteering.
Residents
If you live in Ghana you should register with the National Identification Authority (NIA) of Ghana and get a non-citizen Ghana card. This applies to:
foreign nationals permanently resident in the country
foreign nationals resident in the country for at least 90 days in any calendar year
foreign nationals aged 6 years and above
A non-citizen Ghana card is required to apply for a residence permit, for admission into educational institutions in Ghana, for all financial transactions including opening a bank account, payment of taxes, registration of sim cards, and applications for public or government services, facilities, approvals and permissions. You can complete this registration process at any one of the following places:

All residents of Ghana are also encouraged to sign up to the National Health Insurance scheme.
