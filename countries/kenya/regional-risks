Warning
FCDO advises against all but essential travel to parts of Kenya.

This section has safety advice for regions of Kenya. It only covers regions where FCDO has specific advice.
You should also read FCDO’s overall travel advice and safety and security advice.
Kenya-Somalia border and northern parts of the east coast
Due to the risk of terrorism from groups based in Somalia, FCDO advises against all travel to:
Mandera County
Tarbaj and Wajir East constituencies in Wajir County, except for Wajir Town
areas of Wajir County within 60km of Kenya’s border with Somalia
Garissa County - except for Garissa Town, the constituency of Lagdera and the areas of Balambala constituency which lie north and west of the main road which runs from Saka on the Tana River up to the intersection with the C81 Road
Lamu County, except for Lamu Island and Manda Island
FCDO advises against all but essential travel to:
Garissa Town
Tana River County north of the Tana River as far as the town of Saka
within 15km of the east coast between the Tana River and the Galana (Athi-Galana-Sabaki) River
There have been frequent attacks in the north-eastern border regions, most of which were attributed to Al Shabaab.
Attacks have killed members of the Kenyan security forces as well as civilians. The Kenyan security forces have increased their presence in the affected areas. Armed militia groups operate within the Boni National Reserve and along the border with Somalia. See Terrorism.
Lamu Island and Manda Island
If you travel to Lamu Island or Manda Island, you should fly to Lamu Airport (a civilian airport on Manda Island). Do not travel by road. See Terrorism.
Jomo Kenyatta International Airport to Nairobi City
For travel between Jomo Kenyatta International Airport and Nairobi City, you should use the Mombasa Road or the Nairobi Expressway. See Transport risks.
North and north-east Kenya
Rural areas, particularly in the north and north-east of Kenya, occasionally experience cattle rustling, banditry and ethnic clashes. Foreign nationals are not usually the target, but you should take great care.
Turkana, West Pokot, Elgeyo-Marakwet, Baringo, Laikipia and Samburu counties
The Kenyan government has imposed a dusk-to-dawn curfew in parts of Turkana, West Pokot, Elgeyo-Marakwet, Baringo, Laikipia and Samburu counties. Follow local security measures and use caution.
Kenya-Ethiopia border
There have been attacks using landmines around Moyale, close to the main A2 road south. Vehicles crossing the Kenya-Ethiopia border at this point should stay on the A2. Avoid staying at the rest house at Sololo – travel directly to Marsabit before breaking the journey.
Mount Elgon
There is a large security presence in Mount Elgon because of armed clashes. Further incidents are possible. Seek local advice before you set off.
