The information on this page covers the most common types of travel and reflects the UK government’s understanding of the rules currently in place. Unless otherwise stated, this information is for travellers using a full ‘British Citizen’ passport.
The authorities in the country or territory you’re travelling to are responsible for setting and enforcing the rules for entry. If you’re unclear about any aspect of the entry requirements, or you need further reassurance, you’ll need to contact the embassy, high commission or consulate of the country or territory you’re travelling to.
You should also consider checking with your transport provider or travel company to make sure your passport and other travel documents meet their requirements.
Restrictions in response to coronavirus (COVID-19)
Entry to Austria
Entry to Austria without the need for a COVID-19 test or quarantine is now possible from the UK. The previous requirement for a COVID-19 test or quarantine was removed on 27 July 2020.
Entry to Austria without the need for a COVID-19 test or quarantine is also possible for UK nationals travelling from a country on the Austrian government’s “list of countries where COVID-19 is sufficiently controlled”, who have not travelled outside of these countries in the 10 days before arriving in Austria.
If you have travelled in the 10 days before you arrive in Austria to a country not on the Austrian government’s “list of countries where COVID-19 is sufficiently controlled”, you will need a medical certificate not more than 72 hours old, confirming a negative test for COVID-19, or to isolate for 10 days upon arrival without leaving your accommodation. You can end isolation early with a negative coronavirus test.
If you have travelled in the 10 days before you arrive in Austria to a country for which the Austrian government has a travel warning, you will need to isolate for 10 days upon arrival without leaving your accommodation and you must either have a medical certificate not more than 72 hours old, confirming a negative test for COVID-19 on entry, or take a test at your own cost within 48 hours of arrival. It is not possible to end the isolation early with a negative test.
