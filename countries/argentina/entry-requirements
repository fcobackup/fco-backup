This page has information on travelling to Argentina. Check what you must do to return to the UK.
This page reflects the UK government’s understanding of current rules for people travelling on a full ‘British Citizen’ passport from the UK, for the most common types of travel.
The authorities in Argentina set and enforce entry rules.
All travellers
Argentina’s borders are open to all travellers, providing they comply with immigration requirements.
All travellers must fill in an electronic ‘sworn statement’ form within 48 hours of travelling informing about their vaccination status and declaring that they do not have any COVID-19 symptoms. If you are an Argentine national or a resident of Argentina, and you are entering the country by land for less than 24 hours, you are exempt from this requirement.
Non-resident foreign nationals must also have medical insurance with comprehensive cover for coronavirus, including hospitalisation and the costs of self-isolation and medical transport services for positive and suspected cases, as well as for close contacts. If you are entering the country by land for less than 24 hours, you are exempt from this requirement.
If you’re not fully vaccinated
COVID-19 testing is recommended for those travellers who are not vaccinated or have not received a complete course of a vaccine, within 24 hours of arriving in Argentina. This recommendation does not apply to children aged 5 or under. The cost of this test must be covered by the individual. Whether you have received a complete course of a vaccine or not, will be determined by the authorities of the country where you received your vaccine.
Check your passport and travel documents before you travel
Passport validity
If you are visiting Argentina, your passport should be valid for the proposed duration of your stay. No additional period of validity beyond this is required.
If you are a resident in Argentina, your passport must be valid for entry. No additional period of validity beyond your arrival date is required.
Visas
You don’t need a visa to enter or travel through Argentina as a visitor, unless you’re travelling on an Emergency Travel Document. To apply for this visa you must contact the Consulate of the Argentine Republic closest to you.
On presentation of a valid British passport you will be granted permission to stay in the country for a period of up to 90 days at the discretion of the Immigration Officer. Proof of your entry will be sent to you via the email address you registered when completing the electronic ‘sworn statement’ form. You can also obtain proof of your last entry or exit from Argentina from the Argentine Migration Office website. If you wish to extend your stay for another 90-day period, seek advice from the Argentine Migration Office.
If you’re travelling to Argentina for any purpose other than tourism, contact the Consulate of the Argentine Republic in London.
Emergency Travel Documents (ETDs)
Emergency Travel Documents (ETDs) are accepted for entry, airside transit and exit from Argentina. However, holders of an ETD must apply for the appropriate Argentine visa to enter the country. For entry into Argentina, your ETD should be valid for the proposed duration of your stay. No additional period of validity beyond this is required.
Check with your travel provider to make sure your passport and other travel documents meet their requirements.
