The authorities in the country or territory you’re travelling to are responsible for setting and enforcing the rules for entry. If you’re unclear about any aspect of the entry requirements, or you need further reassurance, you’ll need to contact the embassy, high commission or consulate of the country or territory you’re travelling to.

Entry rules in response to coronavirus (COVID-19)
Entry to Lithuania
British nationals resident in the UK may travel to Lithuania. The Lithuanian Government recommends that all arrivals from the UK self-isolate for 14 days. You should register with the Lithuanian Ministry of Health within 24 hours of arrival in Lithuania.
Some commercial airlines have begun to offer direct flights between Lithuania and the UK. Details of flights can be found on airlines’ websites.
Visitors are not allowed from countries where incidence of COVID-19 exceeds 25 cases per 100,000 of population in the last 14 days. Where incidence has been between 15 to 25 cases per 100,000 population in the last 14 days, visitors are allowed to enter Lithuania, but are advised (and in some cases obliged) to self-isolate for 14 days. If the incidence rate does not exceed 15 cases per 100,000 of population in the last 14 days, there will be no restrictions on entry into Lithuania. A complete list of countries subject to entry restrictions is published on the Lithuanian Government Korona Stop website.
On arrival at an airport, seaport or other entry point from a country with over 15 cases per 100,000, you are advised not to use public transport to reach your place of residence. It is recommended that you use your own vehicle or ask a member of your household to take you to your place of residence.
Passenger ferry services are operating between Klaipeda and Kiel (Germany), and Klaipeda and Karlshamn (Sweden). You should keep up to date with information from your tour operator, transport or accommodation provider on the impact on any existing travel plans.
The movement of goods is not restricted.
