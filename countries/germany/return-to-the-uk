There are commercial options to return to the UK from Germany.
UK special charter flights will only operate for priority countries where commercial flights are not possible. You should not assume that these flights will become available in countries where commercial routes are operating. Please do not contact the contracted travel management company if no flight is advertised here.
You will need to pay for your return travel to the UK. If departure options are available but you cannot afford the travel costs and have exhausted all other options for getting funds, you may be eligible to apply for an emergency loan from the government. This is a last resort option and you would need to repay the loan when you are back in the UK.
For more information, contact Corporate Travel Management (CTM). CTM are a commercial partner of the FCO and are authorised to administer such loans on behalf of the FCO.
Flights
Flights to London are available from Berlin, Düsseldorf, Frankfurt am Main and Munich.
British Airways, Eurowings, Lufthansa and Ryanair are operating. Check airline websites for the latest flight schedules and availability. You should ensure you are aware of your airline’s policy on protective measures on board flights; some carriers have made the wearing of face masks compulsory, for example.
In order to return to Northern Ireland, there are flights to Dublin operated by Ryanair. Check travel advice for Ireland
Road
If you plan to return to the UK by road, it is possible to transit through neighbouring countries if:
you have evidence of your onward journey
you do not show symptoms of illness that could indicate a coronavirus infection
An example of ‘acceptable evidence’ would include a confirmed ferry or Eurotunnel booking to the UK.
In order to travel through France, you should also complete a personal travel waiver certificate. Check the latest travel advice for France ahead of your journey.
As with other forms of transport, many cross-Channel operators are operating substantially reduced services for passenger traffic. Passengers should check with their operator before departing, and may still be subject to severe disruption. Check travel advice for any country that you will transit on the way back to the UK.
Your journey home: re-entering the UK
When you return, you must follow the rules for entering the UK. You:
need to provide your journey and contact details up to 48 hours before you’re due to arrive in the UK
are not allowed to leave the place you’re staying for the first 14 days you’re in the UK except in very limited situations (known as ‘self-isolating’)
See also the list of people who are exempt from the border rules.
The National Travel Health Network and Centre (NaTHNaC) also provides advice on how to stay safe as you travel by air.
