If you test positive for COVID-19, you may need to stay where you are until you test negative. You may also need to seek treatment there.
Plan ahead and make sure you:
can access money

Wherever possible British nationals should aim to be vaccinated in the country where they live. We will update this page when the Government of Bonaire, St Eustatius and Saba (BES) islands announces new information on the national vaccination programme.

The BES Islands national vaccination programme started in February 2021 and is using the Pfizer/BioNTech and Moderna vaccines. British nationals resident in BES Islands are eligible for vaccination.
