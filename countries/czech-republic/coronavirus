The Czech authorities have put in place a series of measures in response to the coronavirus (COVID-19) pandemic.
On 12 March, the Czech government declared a 30-day State of Emergency in response. Measures include:
Restrictions on entry
Only those holding Czech residency are permitted to enter the country. Anyone who enters the Czech Republic from a high-risk country (which includes the UK) will be required to self-isolate for 14 days. The list of high risk countries is available from the Czech Ministry of Foreign Affairs.
Foreign nationals, including UK citizens, are permitted to leave the country, but may not be able to re-enter the Czech Republic. Czech nationals are not permitted to leave the country unless they can prove residency elsewhere. Exemptions exist and more details can be found on the website of the Czech Ministry of the Interior.
Czech residency cards are needed to prove residency when boarding flights or crossing a land border into the Czech Republic. If you do not have your residency card, you can demonstrate residency through a letter from your employer, a rental contract or proof of a Czech bank account.
Transit through the Czech Republic
UK nationals can transit through the Czech Republic without Czech residency if they have a letter of confirmation from the British Embassy and can demonstrate their purpose is to travel straight back to the UK. Alongside an official letter from the Embassy, those intending to transit the Czech Republic must provide evidence of onward travel and a signed declaration of honour, and meet the requirements set out below to cover their mouth and nose. Further information, including the declaration form, are available on the Ministry of Interiorâ€™s website. All UK nationals who wish to transit the Czech Republic must contact the British Embassy in the country where they are located, at least 24 hours before making their journey, to request a letter of confirmation to allow them to transit the Czech Republic. We also advise UK nationals to contact their travel provider to confirm their journey can go ahead.
Transport restrictions
From Saturday 14 March, emergency measures restricting international transport entered into effect. The Czech Government Office website (in English) has further information.

From Monday 16 March, Czech nationals will be prevented from leaving the country by car.
Restrictions on freedom of movement and social distancing measures
From 16 March to 1 April, all residents in the Czech Republic are permitted to leave their homes only when absolutely necessary, for example to travel to and from work, to buy groceries, to visit a doctor or close relative, or to make other essential journeys.
From 18 March, anyone leaving their homes must have their mouth and nose covered. This should be done using a face mask if available, although scarves are allowed if a face mask cannot be obtained.
From Saturday 14 March, all shops are now closed until 1 April, with the exception of supermarkets, pharmacies, opticians, newsagents, shops selling electronics, petrol stations and e-shops with home delivery. Restaurants, bars and pubs are closed, but can sell food to take away.
From 10 March, schools and universities have been ordered to close. Kindergartens remain open in some areas. UK nationals in need of specific information on education are advised to contact their local Czech authorities.
