The weather can change rapidly and it is often possible to experience several seasons in a single day. The sun can be very strong, wear good sunglasses, a hat and high-factor sunscreen.
Air travel
The latest Falkland Islands Government advice for travel to the islands is: https://www.falklands.gov.fk/covid-19/travel/southbound
You can fly between the Islands with the Falkland Islands Government Air Service (FIGAS) who operate four Britten Norman ‘Islander’ aircraft from Stanley airport; book directly through FIGAS or with a local tour operator. Check that your flight has been confirmed the afternoon before you are due to fly. In bad weather, check your flight is going ahead before you travel to the airport.
LATAM normally operates weekly scheduled air services to Mount Pleasant Airport on the Falkland Islands, from Chile and Brazil. Both commercial services were suspended due to COVID-19. The service to Chile recommenced on 2 July 2022. The service linking the Falkland Islands with Brazil remains suspended. Check with LATAM in advance for up to date information on air services.
The RAF operates a fare-paying service from RAF Brize Norton to Mount Pleasant Airport, twice weekly. This flight has a refuelling stop in Cape Verde, though passengers are not permitted to disembark.
This service can be subject to delays due to poor weather, especially during the southern hemisphere winter. Total journey time is approximately 22 hours. For further information and how to book this service visit the Falkland Islands Tourist Board website or contact the Falkland Islands Government Office.
Carry some US dollars in case the flight is diverted to South America or North Africa.
The Falkland Islands Tourist Board can advise further.

Road travel
Four wheel drive vehicles are most commonly used. Roads in Stanley are surfaced, as is the majority of the 35-mile Mount Pleasant Airport to Stanley road. There are around 600 miles of unsurfaced roads on the Islands. Coach, local bus and taxi services to and from Mount Pleasant Airport are available and can be booked in advance. Taxis are available in Stanley. Speed limits are 25mph in the Stanley area and 40mph on other roads.
Because of the condition of most roads, and the strong winds, you should take great care when driving outside Stanley, especially on the road between Mount Pleasant Airport and Stanley. Deaths have occurred on this road and accidents are commonplace. Self-drive four-by-four vehicles are available for hire and a UK driving licence is sufficient. Laws on the wearing of seat belts and drink driving are strictly enforced.
Unexploded Ordnance
The Falkland Islands completed its mine clearance programme in late 2020. The result is that the islands were declared mine free, though visitors should be aware that mines and unexploded ordnance from the 1982 conflict can still be found on any of the major battlefields or be washed up on beaches.
If you come across anything you think may be ordinance, follow the guidance from the Royal Falkland Islands Police:
Do NOT touch the item
Clearly mark the area where the item is located
If safe to do so take a picture of the item but do not approach
Call 999 from a safe distance and wait for the police to arrive.
