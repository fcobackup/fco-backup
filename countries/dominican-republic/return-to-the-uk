The Dominican Republic government has closed the country’s borders and all international flights have been suspended except “ferry flights” to repatriate foreign nationals.
There are still commercial options to return to the UK from the Dominican Republic.
If you live in the UK and are currently visiting the Dominican Republic, you are strongly advised to return now by commercial means. Don’t risk getting stranded.
UK special charter flights will only operate for priority countries where commercial flights are not possible. You should not assume that these flights will become available in the Dominican Republic because commercial routes are operating. Please do not contact the contracted travel management company if no flight is advertised here.
The Embassy is keeping a record of British visitors currently in the Dominican Republic. If you are a British National who lives in the UK and you are currently trying to get home from the Dominican Republic, please contact the Embassy on UK.inDominicanRepublic@fco.gov.uk with your name, your passport number and your contact details in the Dominican Republic.

These JetBlue and Delta routes are the only commercial flights we are aware of that have the necessary authorisation to depart the Dominican Republic during the current border closures. If we become aware of any other commercial flight options, we will publish these on our Travel Advice and social media (@UKinDomRep on Facebook and Twitter).
JetBlue and Delta are still operating flights to New York from Santo Domingo. JetBlue also has flights scheduled to New York from Punta Cana and Puerto Plata. Limited onward flights from the USA to the UK are still operating.
British Nationals may be able to travel to the UK via the United States from the Dominican Republic, providing they hold a valid ESTA. You should consult the ESTA pages to check individual eligibility.
Passengers must have an onward ticket to the UK in order to transit and be able to prove that they have not been in Europe, China or Iran in the past 14 days. Otherwise you may be denied boarding or entry on arrival at a US port. To check remaining available routes, please consult with the airlines JetBlue and Delta or travel providers.

You will need to pay for your return travel to the UK. If departure options are available but you cannot afford the travel costs and have exhausted all other options for getting funds, you may be eligible to apply for an emergency loan from the government. This is a last resort option and you would need to repay the loan when you are back in the UK. For more information, you should contact Corporate Travel Management (CTM). CTM are a commercial partner of the FCO and are authorised to administer such loans on behalf of the FCO.
