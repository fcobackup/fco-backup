Travel Restrictions and Borders
The Gabonese authorities have announced the suspension of all international flights until further notice. All land, sea and air borders have been closed indefinitely. Visa applications for individuals travelling from counties affected by coronavirus, including the UK, have been suspended until further notice.
Local Measures
A State of Emergency has been announced from 12 April for an initial period of 15 days. Travel within the Grande Libreville area and across Gabon has been restricted. Military forces have been granted authority to enter private properties to enforce the restrictions against group gatherings. Markets will only open three times per week.
Gatherings of more than 10 people have been banned. The wearing of masks in public areas is obligatory.
The Government has implemented a daily curfew from 19:30 to 06:00.
Failure to comply with the measures above would constitute a criminal offence.
Pharmacies and health centres remain open.
See the TravelHealthPro website for further advice on travel abroad and reducing spread of respiratory viruses during the COVID-19 pandemic.
Visas
The Government of Gabon has confirmed it will not penalise British nationals whose visas have expired while they are unable to leave the country due to the borders being closed. Immigration Police will not pursue you if this is your situation. You will be allowed to leave the country freely when able to, and this will not affect your chances of being granted a visa in the future.
