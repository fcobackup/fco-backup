The information on this page covers the most common types of travel and reflects the UK government’s understanding of the rules currently in place. Unless otherwise stated, this information is for travellers using a full ‘British Citizen’ passport.
The authorities in the country or territory you’re travelling to are responsible for setting and enforcing the rules for entry. If you’re unclear about any aspect of the entry requirements, or you need further reassurance, you’ll need to contact the embassy, high commission or consulate of the country or territory you’re travelling to.
You should also consider checking with your transport provider or travel company to make sure your passport and other travel documents meet their requirements.
Entry rules in response to coronavirus (COVID-19)
Entry to Lesotho
Lesotho’s borders are closed except for all but essential trade.
SAA Airlink flights between Maseru and Johannesburg Airport have been suspended.
Moshoeshoe International Airport and the border crossing points at Maseru Bridge, Caledonspoort (Butha Buthe), Maputsoe Bridge, Qacha’s Nek Bridge and Vanrooyens Gate (Mafeteng) remain open, but with reduced operating hours, for conveyance of essential goods and services only.
Entry and exit to Lesotho is allowed with approval from the Ministry of Home Affairs to provide or receive emergency medical services for a life threatening condition.
Transiting via South Africa
The Ministry of Foreign Affairs has advised that foreign visitors will be permitted to leave Lesotho to catch flights out of South Africa when flights resume. However, visitors to Lesotho must travel through, or transit via, South Africa.
South Africa has put in place travel restrictions and visa requirements for individuals from countries affected by coronavirus, including the United Kingdom. Follow our travel advice for South Africa and consult your nearest South African High Commission. If you have a confirmed ticket on a commercial ‘repatriation flight’ departing from South Africa you should contact the British High Commission on BHC.Maseru@fcdo.gov.uk at least 3 weeks in advance of your planned travel date for assistance with crossing the Lesotho – South Africa border.
Screening on arrival
Anyone entering Lesotho will be screened for coronavirus. You should also comply with any additional screening measures by the authorities if asked. Anyone showing symptoms of coronavirus may be placed in an isolation facility in a government hospital.
Quarantine requirements
All individuals who have been in coronavirus-affected areas within the past 14 days, including the UK, are required to self-quarantine at their permanent or temporary place of residence for 14 days. This may be monitored by health officials. This self-isolation period may be required to take place in a government-nominated hotel at the visitor’s expense.
If you need further information about entry requirements, contact the local immigration authorities or the nearest Lesotho High Commission.
Data collection
Anyone permitted to enter Lesotho will be required to provide details of where they will be staying during the compulsory quarantine.
Regular entry requirements
Visas
British nationals can obtain entry visas on arrival. Overstaying without proper authority is a serious matter. You may be held in detention. 
Passport validity
Your passport should be valid for a minimum period of 90 days from the date of exit from Lesotho. You must have at least 2 blank pages in your passport when you present it at immigration to enter or leave Lesotho.
UK Emergency Travel Documents
UK Emergency Travel Documents are accepted for entry into, transit and exit from Lesotho. Your Emergency Travel Document should have a minimum of 6 months remaining validity.
Yellow fever certificate requirements
Check whether you need a yellow fever certificate by visiting the National Travel Health Network and Centre’s TravelHealthPro website.
South Africa
If you intend to visit South Africa before or after travelling to Lesotho your passport should have at least 2 additional blank pages when you present it at immigration to enter or leave South Africa. South Africa recently introduced a visa requirement for travellers from the UK.
