The Foreign and Commonwealth Office (FCO) advise against all travel to:
Nagorno-Karabakh and the military occupied area surrounding it
within 5km of the Line of Contact
within 5km of the border with Armenia.
Tensions between Azerbaijan and Armenia over Nagorno-Karabakh continue. Several ceasefire violations along the Line of Contact separating the opposing forces and elsewhere on the inter-state border between Azerbaijan and Armenia have taken place in 2017, resulting in a number of deaths and casualties. See Local travel
Anyone who has visited Nagorno-Karabakh without the permission of the Azerbaijani authorities will be refused entry to Azerbaijan.
All British nationals travelling to Azerbaijan must get a visa in advance. See Visas
Terrorists are likely to try to carry out attacks in Azerbaijan. See Terrorism
Around 7,000 British nationals visit Azerbaijan every year, mainly on business. Most visits are trouble free. 
If youâ€™re abroad and you need emergency help from the UK government, contact the nearest British embassy, consulate or high commission.
Take out comprehensive travel and medical insurance, including cover for medical evacuation, before you travel.
