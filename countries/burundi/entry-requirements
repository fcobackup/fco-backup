Land borders with Tanzania and the DRC border crossing at Gatumba-Uvira are open. All other land and maritime borders are closed with the exception of goods and cargo.
All travellers to Burundi must have proof of a negative COVID-19 test issued in the last 72 hours. Travellers to and from Burundi must also book arrival and departure COVID-19 tests through the Ministry of Health before their arrival/departure. Arriving passengers will be tested at Bujumbura airport where they will be required to show the QR code from their COVID-19 arrival test booking.
Arrivals at Bujumbura International Airport need to pay US $100 in cash for their PCR test. At land and maritime border crossings, foreigners are required to pay US $15 for a test, whilst Burundians are required to pay 15,000 Burundian Francs. All payments must be in cash.
Those under 18 will be asked to present identification and will be exempted from paying for the test. Passengers will receive an email with the results of their tests. You should not use the NHS testing service to get a test in order to facilitate your travel to another country. You should arrange to take a private test.
Pre-departure tests cost 60,000 Burundian Francs and must be paid for in cash at the Central Bank (BRB).Visitors to Burundi must get a visa before travel, via any Burundian diplomatic mission.
Quarantine requirements
Passengers do not have to quarantine on arrival but should self-isolate for 24 hours while awaiting the results of the PCR test. Any visitor who tests positive will be asked to self-quarantine until they have recovered, in a hotel of their own choice, at their own cost.
There is no assistance available for people who may need to leave their hotel. Ambulances from various hospitals can be called if there is a need to be transferred at hospital.
