If you live in the UK and are currently visiting Cambodia you’re strongly advised to return now by commercial means. Don’t run the risk of getting stranded.
UK special charter flights will only operate for priority countries where commercial flights are not possible. You should not assume that these flights will become available in countries where commercial routes are operating. Please do not contact the contracted travel management company if no flight is advertised here.
International flights
There are very few remaining international flights out of Cambodia and they are reducing rapidly as a result of travel restrictions in the region and globally.
It is still possible to buy tickets for a special commercial Vietnam Airlines flight from Phnom Penh to London that will leave at 00:05 on 14 April. You can book this flight online via the Vietnam Airlines website. Ticket sales will be available online until 21:00 local time on 13 April. You may also purchase tickets at the airport ahead of departure via cash or credit card.
Those that have registered for this flight, will have received an email from the Embassy detailing next steps.
The only other flight option out of Cambodia to the UK is via Seoul with Korean Airways (limited availability) Contact your airline or travel company and your insurance provider as soon as you are able, and keep up to date with the latest developments.
The British Embassy is issuing regular updates on its Facebook page.
Travelling to the airport
The Prime Minister announced on 9 April, a ban on all travel between provinces. This ban will come in to effect at midnight 9 April and last until midnight 16 April.
We know that this will be of concern to all of you who are based outside of Phnom Penh and were planning on catching flights over the coming days. Our Embassy gained agreement from the authorities that any British nationals travelling to Phnom Penh to catch flights will be allowed through checkpoints. Our strong advice is that anyone who has a flight booked or is planning to fly before 16 April, travels to Phnom Penh as soon as possible.
