At least 8 weeks before your trip, check the latest country-specific health advice from the National Travel Health Network and Centre (NaTHNaC) on the TravelHealthPro website. Each country-specific page has information on vaccine recommendations, any current health risks or outbreaks, and factsheets with information on staying healthy abroad. Guidance is also available from NHS (Scotland) on the FitForTravel website.
General information on travel vaccinations and a travel health checklist is available on the NHS website. You may then wish to contact your health adviser or pharmacy for advice on other preventive measures and managing any pre-existing medical conditions while you’re abroad.
The legal status and regulation of some medicines prescribed or purchased in the UK can be different in other countries. If you’re travelling with prescription or over-the-counter medicine, read this guidance from NaTHNaC on best practice when travelling with medicines. For further information on the legal status of a specific medicine, you’ll need to contact the embassy, high commission or consulate of the country or territory you’re travelling to.
While travel can be enjoyable, it can sometimes be challenging. There are clear links between mental and physical health, so looking after yourself during travel and when abroad is important.

Coronavirus
Cases of coronavirus (COVID-19) have been confirmed in Uruguay. The Uruguayan authorities have introduced a number of measures to limit the spread of the virus. The FCO strongly encourages non-resident British nationals in Uruguay to leave and return home as soon as possible to avoid difficulties if flights out of the country and the region are further restricted. This is a rapidly evolving situation and new measures are expected, we advise that you continue to check for further announcements made during the daily briefings here.
To date, the Uruguayan government has introduced a range of mandatory measures to combat the spread of coronavirus. This includes:
• Partial border closure and mandatory 14-day quarantine for passengers arriving from WHO declared risk or symptomatic countries (China, South Korea, Japan, Singapore, Iran, Spain, Italy, France and Germany) and those who have had contact with a coronavirus infected person.
• Cruise ships allowed to refuel and take on supplies in Montevideo on a case by case basis
• Suspending direct flights to and from Europe and the US (from 20 and 18 March respectively)
• Closing the border with Argentina (including ferry services)

• Suspension of all public shows; closure of public buildings such as museums and libraries along with gambling halls and equestrian events; and the suspension of public and private education centres for at least 14 days (from 14th March);
• Introduction of maximum pricing for indispensable hygiene products and the removal of taxes from multiple products; and, • All non-essential public officials are required to work remotely.
The Government has also made a number of recommendations:
• That all large commercial premises, such as shopping centres, close for an undefined period, with the exception of pharmacies and supermarkets;
• The population has been asked to maintain social distancing, including through working remotely, avoiding public transport and large gatherings, and staying at home as much as possible. Police Officers will be urging people to avoid crowds; and,
• Citizens that present symptoms are asked to request home health care and not visit health centres and hospitals. Non-urgent procedures should be rescheduled.
You will need to check the Travel Advice for any country you will be transiting or visiting after or before Uruguay as there may be other restrictions in place.
