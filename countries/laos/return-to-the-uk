There are currently only occasional charter flights which allow a return to the UK, via third countries. The UK government is working closely with airlines to make sure options are available for you to return to the UK.
Flights
Vientiane Lockdown – Travel into and out of the capital is possible if you are fully vaccinated, and some charter international flights from Vientiane will continue. Domestic flights resumed in June with a reduced service for eligible travellers who are fully vaccinated. Those who are not fully vaccinated, or are travelling with unvaccinated children, require permission from the COVID-19 National Taskforce. There are limited internal flights and public transport options, which means British nationals who need to travel to Vientiane to depart on international flights may need to make arrangements for travel by private vehicle and carry evidence of a flight booking. You should check with Lao authorities for details of local requirements.
The British Embassy is aware of an increasing number of proposed charter flights from Vientiane, which are all subject to sufficient reservations and Lao government approval. You should review all terms and conditions including the refund policy before committing to any flights.

If your return journey to the UK transits another country, you should check whether it is subject to a travel ban or any other additional requirements, before committing to flights. Restrictions are liable to change and therefore you should stay up to date with our travel advice for countries that you will be transiting.
Lao Government COVID-19 regulations require that you inform the Embassy if you’re departing Laos.
If you are leaving Laos, email BritishEmbassy.Vientiane@fcdo.gov.uk with your full name, contact telephone number, passport number, flight details and a scan or photograph of the identification page of your passport. Please contact the Embassy at least 7 working days before your departure.
The Embassy will inform the Lao Ministry of Foreign Affairs of departing British nationals as required by the Lao government.
