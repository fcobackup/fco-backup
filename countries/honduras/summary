Protests have taken place across Honduras since June 2019. Although normally peaceful, these can rapidly turn violent and be accompanied by a general break-down in law and order, including looting. The police have frequently responded with tear gas; deaths and injuries have also been reported. Although the protests are normally restricted to the main cities (especially Tegucigalpa, San Pedro Sula and La Ceiba), road blocks can occur anywhere at short notice, and these can cause significant travel disruptions; Tegucigalpa’s Tocontin airport was also closed for most of a day in late May. Military police and the army are being deployed across the country in an attempt to restore law and order.
Travel plans may be impacted at short notice. You should avoid all demonstrations, and do not try to pass through blockades. You should follow the advice of local authorities and your tour operator or airline, and monitor local and social media for updates.
