There remain extremely limited commercial options to return to the UK from Turkey and these may stop at short notice.
There is a route from Istanbul to the UK via Minsk with Belavia airlines – see below for further details. You may require a permit to travel to the airport – see Travel Permit section below.
If you live in the UK and are currently visiting Turkey, you’re strongly advised to return now by commercial means. Don’t run the risk of getting stranded.
UK special charter flights will only operate for priority countries where commercial flights are not possible. You should not assume that these flights will become available in countries where commercial routes are operating. Please do not contact the contracted travel management company if no flight is advertised here.
What to do
If you cannot leave Turkey at this time, you should:
follow the advice of local authorities, including local measures to help minimise your risk of exposure to coronavirus
find accommodation that’s suitable for your needs
keep in regular contact with family and friends at home, so they know you are safe and well
if you are visiting Turkey and normally resident in the UK, please register with the Embassy through our new registration process (see below)
One commercial flight route to the UK (via Minsk) is still operating, but this is subject to change and cancellation at short notice. There is no guarantee of how long the Minsk flights will continue to operate.
The British Embassy is issuing regular updates on Twitter and Facebook with the latest available information on flight departure options from Turkey.
As there are limited commercial means of returning to the UK from Turkey, you should contact your travel provider as soon as you can for more information. Note that plans might change at short notice.
Belavia - via Minsk
The next Belavia flight from Istanbul to Minsk is scheduled to operate on Wednesday 15 April. However, all flights are subject to change at short notice. You should contact the airline to confirm flight details.
The timing of this flight has been changed to an early morning departure, to facilitate a same day connecting flight onward to London or Paris, and can be booked on one ticket to allow for an easier journey with hold baggage. This flight is bookable direct with the airline on their website.
Additionally, any passengers who had a ticket for the cancelled Belavia Istanbul to Minsk flight on the 12th April, and who would like to transfer their ticket to the Wednesday flight, should contact +90 532 266 1210 either on WhatsApp or by telephone.
From Thursday 16th April, flights operate once daily from Istanbul to Minsk. Flights from Minsk to London operate on Monday, Wednesday, Friday and Sundays. However there are no flight from Minsk to the UK between Tuesday 21st – Friday 24th April inclusive. Flights are bookable with Belavia, however you need to book two separate tickets (Istanbul – Minsk / Minsk – London) and travel with cabin baggage only.
Please be aware that this route requires waiting overnight in Minsk airport and you are not officially permitted clear immigration without being subject to mandatory quarantine, although we have heard that some travellers have been allowed with proof of an onward flight reservation. We do not recommend leaving the airport.
For the latest flight information, you should check with the airline before making any flight reservations.
