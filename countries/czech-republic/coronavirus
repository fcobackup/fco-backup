Travel in the Czech Republic
There are various measures in place to control the spread of coronavirus. The details of these measures can be found in the sections below.
Public spaces and services
It is mandatory to cover your mouth and nose in all indoor and outdoor public spaces. From 25 February, you are required to wear a face covering of FFP2 standard or higher (in Czech known as ‘respirátor’), or two medical face masks, in places with a high number of people, such as public transport, shopping centres or in medical facilities. The full list can be found in the list of measures published by the Ministry of Health (in Czech only). The Czech government advises that people adhere to social distancing of 2m where possible when in public. You must avoid all non-essential movement, except for travelling to work, shopping or visiting parks for exercise. All shops and services are closed, except for pharmacies and grocery stores, with social distancing measures in place. Restaurants and bars are closed, but some offer a takeaway service. Drinking alcohol in public spaces is forbidden.
All cultural venues, including museums, galleries, theatres and attractions such as zoos, are closed.
A maximum of 2 people are allowed to gather inside or outside, except for family members from the same household. The Czech Government has directed that all people should reduce contact with persons from other households. You should not leave your place of residence between 9pm and 5am unless you are travelling to, or from work, or making an essential trip.
Full details of all restrictive measures in place, including permitted reasons for moving around (including during curfew hours) and some rules on the operation of shops, can be found in English on the website of the Ministry of Health.
Schools are open for a limited number of age groups. UK nationals in need of specific information on education are advised to contact their local Czech authority.

COVID-19 vaccines if you live in Czech Republic
Wherever possible British nationals should aim to be vaccinated in the country where they live. As further information is available about the national vaccination programme, this page will be updated. Sign up to get email notifications.
Residents of the Czech Republic, including British nationals, are eligible to receive the vaccine through the Czech national vaccination programme in accordance with their rollout plan. If you are currently eligible for a vaccine, i.e. you have residency in the Czech Republic and are 80+ or work as a health professional, you can now register for a vaccine. Details of the national vaccination programme and the online booking system are available on the Ministry of Health website.
The Czech Ministry of Health has recently updated the online booking system and UK nationals can now register for a vaccine by using their health insurance number instead of a birth registration number. The health insurance number is provided by your Czech health insurance company and can be found on the insurance card issued by the company, in the box labelled “číslo pojištěnce”.
The Medicines and Healthcare Products Regulatory Agency (MHRA) is the UK authority responsible for assessing the safety, quality and efficacy of vaccines. It has authorised the Pfizer/BioNTech, Oxford/AstraZeneca and Moderna vaccines for temporary supply and use in the UK. Find out more about MHRA approval for these vaccines.
British nationals living overseas should seek medical advice from their local healthcare provider in the country where they reside. Information about vaccines used in other national programmes, including regulatory status, should be available from the local authorities. This list of Stringent Regulatory Authorities recognised by the World Health Organisation may also be a useful source of additional information. Find out more about COVID-19 vaccines on the World Health Organisation COVID-19 vaccines page.
