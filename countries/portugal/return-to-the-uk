Since 19 March flights from Portugal to countries outside the EU/EEA, with the exception of the UK, USA, Canada, Venezuela, South Africa and Portuguese speaking countries have been suspended. Flights to Brazil are limited to Rio de Janeiro and SÃ£o Paulo. Flights to and from Italy and Spain remain suspended.
While flights to the UK are not affected by these measures, airlines have cancelled a number of flights between the UK and Portugal. If your travel plans are likely to be affected or you want to check on the status of your flight, contact your airline or travel company for the latest information.
British Nationals who wish to leave the country should make arrangements to do so as soon as possible as transport options to leave Portugal may not be available indefinitely.
