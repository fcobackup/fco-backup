Before you travel check that:
your destination can provide the healthcare you may need
you have appropriate travel insurance for local treatment or unexpected medical evacuation
This is particularly important if you have a health condition or are pregnant.
Emergency medical number
Dial 103 and ask for an ambulance. The operator answering may not speak English.
Contact your insurance company quickly if you’re referred to a medical facility for treatment.
Vaccine recommendations and health risks
At least 8 weeks before your trip:
check the latest vaccine recommendations for Kazakhstan
see where to get vaccines and whether you have to pay on the NHS travel vaccinations page
See what health risks you’ll face in Kazakhstan including biting insects and ticks.

Medication
The legal status and regulation of some medicines prescribed or bought in the UK can be different in other countries.
Read best practice when travelling with medicines on TravelHealthPro.
Basic medications such as aspirin are available without a prescription. It’s best to bring enough medication with you.
If you need prescription medication while in Kazakhstan, you will need a valid prescription either from a local doctor or your UK prescription translated into Kazakh or Russian. Medications often come under different brand names, so ask for the drug’s generic name. If they are not available locally, it may be possible to get drugs to be couriered through a private clinic, for example, International SOS clinic.
Healthcare in Kazakhstan
The medical facilities in Kazakhstan are not as advanced as in the UK. Make sure you have adequate travel health insurance and accessible funds to cover the cost of medical treatment or evacuation by air ambulance and repatriation. Medical staff do not typically speak English.
FCDO has a list of medical facilities in Kazakhstan where some staff will speak English.
