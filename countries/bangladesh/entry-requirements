Warning
FCDO advises against all but essential travel to Bangladesh.

This information is for people travelling on a full ‘British citizen’ passport from the UK. It is based on the UK government’s understanding of Bangladesh’s current rules for the most common types of travel.
The authorities in Bangladesh set and enforce entry rules. If you are not sure how these requirements apply to you, contact the Bangladesh High Commission London.
COVID-19 rules
There are no COVID-19 testing or vaccination requirements for travellers entering Bangladesh.
Passport validity requirements
When you apply for a visa to visit Bangladesh, your passport must have:
at least 6 months remaining validity
at least 2 blank pages
no damage
Check with your travel provider that your passport and other travel documents meet the requirements. Renew your passport if you need to.
You will be denied entry if you do not have a valid travel document or try to use a passport that has been reported lost or stolen.
Checks at border control
Make sure you get your passport stamped.
Make sure you get a stamp in your passport when you arrive. You must show immigration officers this arrival stamp when you leave Bangladesh.
Visa requirements
You must have a visa to travel to Bangladesh, unless you have a ‘no visa required’ stamp in your UK passport.
At Bangladeshi border control, you may also need to show a return or onward ticket.
If you are working in Bangladesh, you must get an Income Tax Clearance Certificate or an Income Tax Exemption Certificate before leaving Bangladesh. You get application forms from the National Board of Revenue, Bangladesh.
Applying for a visa
Apply for a visa from the Bangladesh High Commission London.
If you plan to use Bangladesh as a hub to visit other countries in the region, make sure you get a multiple-entry visa.
Depending on your circumstances, you may be able to apply for a visa when you arrive at Dhaka airport. You must have a return ticket to apply for a visa on arrival. Visas on arrival are:
single entry
valid for 15 to 30 days
not guaranteed – Bangladeshi immigration officers issue them at their discretion
If your visa expires while you are in Bangladesh, you can apply for a visa extension from the Department of Immigration and Passports. You may get a fine for overstaying.
British nationals of Bangladeshi origin
British nationals of Bangladeshi origin may be able to apply for a ‘no visa required’ stamp from the Bangladesh High Commission in London.
Contact the Bangladesh High Commission in London if you have questions.
Air passengers in transit
If you are in transit to another country, you do not need a Bangladesh visa as you will not pass through Bangladeshi border control – this is sometimes called ‘staying airside’.
Vaccine requirements
To enter Bangladesh, you must have certificates to prove you’ve had:  
a yellow fever vaccination if you’re coming from a country listed as a transmission risk
a polio vaccine, if you’re coming from a polio-affected country
For full details about medical entry requirements and recommended vaccinations, see TravelHealthPro’s Bangladesh guide.
Customs rules
There are strict rules about goods you can take into or out of Bangladesh. You must declare anything that may be prohibited or subject to tax or duty.
Taking money into or out of Bangladesh
You may need to declare foreign currency or Bangladeshi taka, depending on the amount you are travelling with. See Bangladesh Customs’ rules on bringing money into or out of Bangladesh.
You can cash travellers’ cheques at banks and airports. ATMs are available in most urban areas and accept UK cards. There are fewer ATMs in rural areas.
