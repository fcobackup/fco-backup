The FCDO advises against all travel to Sudan
This page reflects the UK Government’s understanding of current rules for people travelling on a full ‘British Citizen’ passport from the UK, for the most common types of travel.
The authorities in Sudan set and enforce entry rules. If you’re unsure how Sudan’s entry requirements apply to you, contact the Sudanese Embassy in London.
All travellers
Entry requirements for Sudan are the same for all travellers, regardless of COVID-19 vaccination status.
Children and young people
In addition to a visa, children under 18 must have their father’s consent to enter and exit Sudan. Formally, children travelling without their father will need a letter clearly providing consent for the child to enter and exit Sudan, though this is not always enforced. The letter should be stamped at the Sudanese Embassy before travel.
Where the father is absent or deceased, mothers or guardians should get a court order which clearly shows that the mother or guardian has sole custodial rights for the children. Where the parents are divorced, this should be accompanied by divorce documents. Where the father is deceased, this should be accompanied by a death certificate. Contact the Sudanese Embassy in London for more information.
Check your passport and travel documents before you travel
Passport validity
Your passport should be valid for a minimum period of 6 months from the date of entry into Sudan.
Visas
British nationals need to apply for a visa via the Sudanese Embassy in London to visit Sudan. The FCDO currently advises against all travel to Sudan.
You should register with the Aliens Department at the Ministry of Interior within 3 days of your arrival in the country. You will need 2 passport size photos. The fee is the Sudanese Pound equivalent of around £35. If you don’t register within 3 days of arrival, you may be fined. Some of the larger hotels will do this for you but you should ask when you check-in.
Formally, visitors to Sudan on a single entry visa need to get an exit visa to leave the country, though this is not always enforced. Exit visas can be processed at the airport. If requested, you should be ready to show proof of your sponsor and pay the exit visa fee of 50 US dollars.
Most foreign residents, including British nationals, also need an exit permit. You should check the details with your sponsor, before your arrival, to ensure that you understand and are happy with the process.
Previous travel to Israel
If your passport has an Israeli visa or Israeli entry or exit stamps you will not be allowed to enter Sudan.
