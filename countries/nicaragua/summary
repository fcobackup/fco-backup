Many areas of the country experienced a period of political unrest in April 2018, resulting in hundreds of deaths and detentions according to UN reports. Protests led to violent clashes and use of tear gas, rubber bullets and live ammunition. The situation is now quieter but remains unpredictable. You should stay well away from all demonstrations and gatherings, even if apparently peaceful, as these could result in outbreaks of violence. See Political situation.
Flooding and landslides caused by hurricanes Eta and Iota, which struck Central America in November 2020, caused significant damage to infrastructure on the North Atlantic coast and along the border with Honduras. The rainy season normally runs from May to November. Hurricanes can affect Nicaragua during this period. You should plan any essential travel carefully. You should monitor local and international weather updates from the [US National Hurricane Centre]. Follow the advice of local authorities, including any evacuation orders. See Natural disasters. See our tropical cyclones page for advice about what to do if you are caught up in a storm.
