FCDO advises against all travel to Russia
FCDO continues to advise British nationals against all travel to Russia. Russia’s ongoing invasion of Ukraine means the situation in Russia is unpredictable. This includes:
security incidents, such as drone attacks, happening in some parts of the country
lack of available flights to return to the UK
a limited ability for HMG to provide consular assistance
Your travel insurance could be invalidated if you travel against FCDO advice. Consular support is also severely limited where FCDO advises against travel.
Situation in Russia
The Russian invasion of Ukraine is ongoing. International and domestic response to this action is affecting conditions within Russia and for those traveling to Russia. There have been numerous reports of drone attacks, explosions and fires in areas in Western and Southern Russia, particularly near the Russian border with Ukraine, Moscow and St Petersburg. The situation remains unpredictable, and could escalate further without warning.
Political rallies and demonstrations can occur in Moscow, St Petersburg and other places across Russia. Check the local media for the latest information, be vigilant, and avoid any political demonstrations or gatherings.
Consider leaving Russia
If your presence in Russia is not essential, we strongly advise that you consider leaving by remaining commercial routes.
British nationals should exercise extreme caution at all times. Consider the risks if you decide to leave Russia. Travel within or out of Russia is at your own risk.
If you choose to stay in Russia
If you decide to remain in Russia, you should:
keep your departure plans under constant review
ensure your travel documents are up to date
monitor the local media
stay alert to security warnings and follow the advice of local authories
seek cover inside buildings or underground passage ways, and avoid glazed areas in a drone attack
sign-up to email alerts for Russia travel advice.
Read FCDO advice on what to do if you’re affected by a crisis abroad and how to prepare.
Travel within and out of Russia
You cannot fly from Russia directly to the UK, or via EU countries. There are connecting flights from Russia via the Middle East, Serbia and Turkey to the UK and other destinations. However, this could change at short notice or flights might sell out quickly. Check the latest information with your airline or travel provider.
Restrictions in Russia
There are severe restrictions on the publishing and distribution of information related to the Russian armed forces and any military operations. People charged under these laws face heavy sentences. See IT and social media on the Local laws and customs page.
International sanctions against Russia
The UK government has imposed sanctions against a number of Russian companies and individuals as well as other finance, trade and transport sanctions. These sanctions may have an effect on transactions in or, with Russia. More information about Russia sanctions is available on GOV.UK including on the application of sanctions prohibitions and requirements to British nationals.
MasterCard and Visa have suspended operations in Russia. This means that MasterCard and Visa cards issued outside of Russia will not work at Russian merchants or ATMs. Cards issued inside Russia continue to work in Russia but they will not work outside of Russia. Be aware that it may not be possible for you to access your funds through Russian banks or to make payments to Russian businesses with non-Russian credit/debit cards.
In May 2022, the UK government designated Aeroflot, Rossiya Airlines, Ural Airlines and Russian Railways for the purposes of UK sanctions. This means that British nationals and others who are bound by UK sanctions are prohibited from entering into transactions which result in making funds directly or indirectly available to these companies, such as purchasing tickets from them. However, the Office for Financial Sanctions Implementation has issued a general licence which means that for journeys originating in, or within, Russia, British nationals may purchase tickets from these companies without breaching UK sanctions.
Help and support for British nationals in Russia
The British Embassy in Moscow is open, but the situation could change at short notice. We may be restricted in the consular support we can provide in-person in country.
Consular support is severely limited in parts of Russia due to the security situation and the size of the country, particularly in the North Caucasus.
If you need consular assistance, call the British Embassy Moscow +7 495 956 7200 and then select the option for consular assistance. Phone lines are answered 24 hours a day.
You can contact the Russian emergency services on 112.
Dual Nationals
Dual British-Russian nationals will be treated as Russian nationals by the Russian authorities. The consular support we can provide will be severely limited. If you are arrested or detained we are unlikely to get authorisation from the Russian authorities to provide consular support.
In 2022, Russia declared a “partial” mobilisation of Russian citizens to join the military forces. British nationals holding Russian passports could be in scope for mobilisation or conscription.
