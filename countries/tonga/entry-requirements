The Government of the Kingdom of Tonga advises all foreign visitors to hold comprehensive travel insurance. Additionally, all foreign nationals must present proof of vaccination status at check-in for flights and ships. Foreign Nationals who are medically exempt from receiving the COVID-19 vaccine will need to provide medical documents to the Ministry of Health in order to be permitted entry. For more information contact the Ministry of Health at travel@health.gov.to.
Foreign travellers
Foreign travellers aged 12 years and above are normally required to be fully vaccinated with the prescribed two COVID-19 vaccine doses (or one dose of Johnson & Johnson) before seeking entry to Tonga. Proof of vaccination status is required on check-in for flights and ships. All travellers are also encouraged to have their booster dose(s) complete before travelling to Tonga.
Tonga will accept the UK’s printed version of proof of COVID-19 vaccination  and proof of COVID-19 vaccination issued in the Crown Dependencies. Your NHS appointment card from vaccination centres is not designed to be used as proof of vaccination and should not be used to demonstrate your vaccine status.
A COVID-19 vaccine certificate is required for check-in. Ideally a hard copy of the vaccine certificate should be presented at check-in unless you are permitted an exemption (see the ‘If you are not fully vaccinated’ section below) However, electronic documents, including emails, on mobile phones or other electronic devices are acceptable.
All documents presented must be in English. The use of any other language will result in you being denied boarding.
Failure to produce a vaccination certificate without an exemption from the Ministry of Health, will result in you being denied boarding and entry to Tonga.
