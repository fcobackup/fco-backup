Entry rules in response to coronavirus (COVID-19)
Entry to Barbados
Barbados has published travel protocols setting out its entry requirements in relation to COVID-19. Visit the Visit Barbados website for full details. You should read these before your departure and monitor the pages on a regular basis as the requirements may change at short notice
Testing on arrival
The Government of Barbados advises that all travellers present a COVID-19 negative test result on arrival that meets their entry requirements whenever possible. You should check the protocols to confirm and understand all requirements. The test should be a COVID-19 PCR antigen test, undertaken at an accredited laboratory no more than 72 hours in advance of your flight’s departure. All passengers are also required to submit an Embarkation/Disembarkation (ED) card 24 hours prior to travel, to which they should upload their negative test result.
If you arrive in Barbados without a qualifying negative test, you will be subjected to a mandatory test on arrival and will be required to quarantine until the result is received. We strongly advise that if at all possible, you arrive in Barbados with a COVID-19 negative PCR test.
Anyone who tests positive for COVID-19 will be placed in isolation until they have recovered. You may also be required to quarantine at any stage of your visit if the Government of Barbados deems that you have come into close contact with a COVID-19 positive individual.
You can find full details of the protocols at Visit Barbados webiste and are advised to read and understand the requirements carefully before departure.
You should also monitor the website on a regular basis as the requirements may change at short notice.
Regular entry requirements
Visas
British passport holders don’t need a visa to visit Barbados.
On entry, you will normally be granted a specified period to stay. If you wish to stay longer, you must apply and pay for an extension of stay through the Barbados Immigration Department.
It’s an offence to overstay the entry period or to work without a work permit.
Passport validity
Your passport should be valid for the proposed duration of your stay. No additional period of validity beyond this is required.
UK Emergency Travel Documents
UK Emergency Travel Documents (ETDs) are accepted for entry, airside transit and exit from Barbados.
Departure tax
A departure tax of BDS$55 (US$27.50) applies for all passengers over 2 years old leaving Barbados. From 1 October 2018, an additional fee has been added. Passengers flying outside of the Caribbean region pay US$70 per person, and those flying within the Caribbean pay US$35 per person. Most airlines include the cost within the ticket price. If in doubt, you should check with your airline or tour operator.
