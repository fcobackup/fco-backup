Political situation
Demonstrations, and other forms of protest, are subject to various restrictions. Different types of protests can take place at short notice throughout the country, particularly on Fridays. You should take precautions for your personal safety by avoiding political gatherings and demonstrations. Follow instructions given by local security authorities.
Crime
Outside of business and diplomatic travel, currently there are few British visitors to Algeria. While most visits to Algeria are trouble-free, in certain areas of larger cities incidents of robbery, pickpocketing and petty thefts do occur. Avoid areas that you don’t know, especially after dark. Avoid carrying large amounts of money or valuables around with you.
You are advised to maintain at least the same level of personal security awareness as in the UK and take care when walking or travelling alone.
Local travel
You should check the latest guidance of local authorities before moving around the country. If possible you should arrange to be met on arrival in Algeria.
Mobile phone coverage can be patchy or unavailable in more remote areas, particularly in the south of Algeria. Some online maps may not be accurate in remote areas.
Business visitors without established contacts should seek advice in the first instance from the British Embassy Algiers or the Algeria desk in the Department for Business and Trade.
If you’re travelling as a tourist, confirm your travel plans before you arrive in Algeria, using a reputable tour operator with good local knowledge. Where possible, stay in pre-arranged accommodation at your destination.
If you plan to tour the Casbah area of Algiers, use a good local guide and make sure your hosts/hotel know about your plans.
Wildfires caused significant damage and numerous deaths in wilayas east of Algiers in the summers of 2023, 2022 and 2021. Similar fires could flare up in the same or other areas without warning, especially during periods of extreme weather. You should follow local advice and avoid travelling to areas where fires may break out.
Security arrangements
The Algerian authorities devote considerable resources to the safety of foreign visitors. In cities there’s a clear security presence, which can feel intrusive. Authorities will want to know your travel plans when travelling outside major cities and may assign police or gendarmes to protect you.
Road travel
Although you may drive in Algeria with a valid UK driving licence for a maximum of 3 months, the Algerian authorities may also request an International Driving Permit (IDP). You’re strongly advised to apply for a valid IDP for your temporary stay in Algeria. You will not be able to buy an IDP outside the UK, so get one before you travel. For more information on local regulations, visit the Algerian Interior Ministry website.
If you’re planning to hire a car, check with your car hire company for information on their requirements before you travel.
Algeria has a very high road traffic accident rate and driving standards can be erratic. There is very little lane discipline and often confusion about the right of way, especially at roundabouts. Take particular care when crossing roads on foot, even where there is a signal allowing you to do so.
Roads are over a reasonable standard, although large potholes can appear quickly, particulary after heavy rain. Most towns have large speed bumps.
Driving at night can be hazardous, particularly out of towns, due to a lack of road lighting and unlighted vehicles. Exercise caution and slow down if you approach sand drifts on the roads.
You may come across military or police security checks. If you do, approach slowly, don’t cross boundaries without permission and be prepared to present photo ID if asked.
You should check the availability of fuelling stations before traveling long distances in remote areas.
Rail travel
Rail travel is generally safe, although safety standards tend to be lower than those in the UK. There is a risk of petty crime on trains.
Dual nationals
Algerian family law is different from UK law. If you’re a dual British-Algerian national, take particular care if child custody or forced marriage is likely to become an issue during your stay. Children (under the age of 19 years and one day) leaving Algeria need written authorisation from their parent with legal guardianship to travel if they’re travelling alone or accompanied by an adult. If you have any concerns, seek advice before travelling to Algeria or agreeing to family members travelling to Algeria.
