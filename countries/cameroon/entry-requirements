The information on this page covers the most common types of travel and reflects the UK government’s understanding of the rules currently in place. Unless otherwise stated, this information is for travellers using a full ‘British Citizen’ passport.
The authorities in the country or territory you’re travelling to are responsible for setting and enforcing the rules for entry. If you’re unclear about any aspect of the entry requirements, or you need further reassurance, you’ll need to contact the embassy, high commission or consulate of the country or territory you’re travelling to.
You should also consider checking with your transport provider or travel company to make sure your passport and other travel documents meet their requirements.
Entry rules in response to coronavirus (COVID-19)
Entry to Cameroon
There are now some commercial flight options to leave Cameroon. See Coronavirus
Access across Cameroon’s land and sea borders is currently restricted.
Proof of a recent (no older than three days before application) negative coronavirus test must be provided to obtain a visa.
Separately, you must have proof of a recent (no older than three days before first boarding) negative coronavirus test to board your flight to Cameroon and to enter at Yaoundé or Douala Airports. Your negative coronavirus test result should be in PDF format, clearly stating the date of the test and the type of test (e.g. PCR).
You should not use the NHS testing service to get a test in order to facilitate your travel to another country. You should arrange to take a private test.
Testing/screening on arrival
On 29 October, the Cameroonian authorities decreed that passengers coming from some countries particularly affected by COVID-19 (described as in ‘the red zone’, but with no further clarification) will be subjected to extra testing for COVID-19 on arrival at Yaoundé and Douala international airports. At present this includes all passengers arriving from Europe, including the UK. These tests are compulsory. Results are returned while passengers are at the airport. There is no fee.
This is in addition to the requirement to have a negative test 72 hours before embarkation on the first leg of your journey to Cameroon.
Quarantine requirements
If you have a proof of a recent (no older than three days before boarding) negative coronavirus test, you will normally not have to self-isolate. Anyone that has developed symptoms of Coronavirus on their travel or tests positive on arrival at Yaoundé or Douala airport must quarantine at a government-monitored hotel for 14 days. These requirements are regularly evolving.
Regular entry requirements
Visas
The Cameroonian High Commission in London has reopened for business. Currently business and diplomatic visas are being issued.
There is currently no visa-on-arrival service at either Yaoundé or Douala International Airport.
The Government of Cameroon has confirmed it will not penalise British nationals whose visas have expired while they are unable to leave the country due to coronavirus restrictions. Immigration Police will not pursue you if this is your situation, you will be allowed to leave the country freely when able to, and this will not affect your chances of being granted a visa in the future.
If you have a query about your immigration status while in Cameroon, contact the General Delegation for National Security in Yaoundé (telephone: +237 22221 2884).
Dual nationality
Cameroon doesn’t recognise dual nationality in adults. If you have acquired British citizenship but previously held Cameroon citizenship, or as an adult still hold a Cameroon passport, you should not attempt to enter Cameroon on your Cameroonian passport because this is against the law.
Passport validity
Your passport should be valid for a minimum period of six months from the date of your visa application.
UK Emergency Travel Documents
UK Emergency Travel Documents are accepted for entry into Cameroon, provided they include the necessary visa.
Yellow fever certificate requirements
You must present a yellow fever certificate upon arrival in Cameroon. Check the requirements by visiting the National Travel Health Network and Centre’s TravelHealthPro website.
