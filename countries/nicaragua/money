The US Dollar, either in cash or travellers’ cheques, is the only foreign currency freely exchangeable in Nicaragua. Banks don’t exchange sterling. Avoid using informal street money changers as there have been reports of assaults on people exchanging money in the streets.
Banks will often have affiliated money changers outside the branch, which avoids long queues. These recognised money changers work bank hours and display identification. You can withdraw cash in US dollars or local Cordobas from ATMs.
