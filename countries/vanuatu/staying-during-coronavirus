Everyone should comply with the measures put in place in Vanuatu to limit the spread of coronavirus (COVID-19).
Moving around in Vanuatu
For information on entering Vanuatu and transit through Australia, see Entry Requirements.
There are no restrictions in place on social gatherings. Restaurants, bars and supermarkets are permitted to open as usual, although some are operating a restricted service or have closed altogether in response to falling trade.

If you hold a short term visa for Vanuatu which is close to expiry, you should report to the Director of Immigration to have your visa extended.
