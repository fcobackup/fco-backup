Visas
British passport holders donâ€™t need a visa to enter Bermuda as a visitor, but you must book accommodation before you arrive. Visitors are usually granted entry for up to 90 days. For further enquiries about visas, visit the website of the nearest British Embassy or High Commission, or the Government of Bermuda website.
If you wish to extend your stay while in Bermuda, you must get permission from the Bermuda Department of Immigration before your initial 21 day stay ends. While an extension of stay is not automatic, extensions are normally granted.  
Passport Validity
You must hold a valid passport to enter Bermuda. Your passport should be valid for the proposed duration of your stay. No additional period of validity beyond this is required.
Work permits
If you wish to work in Bermuda, you must secure a job before coming to the island. Your employer will then apply to the Department of Immigration for a work permit, and once this is received you may enter the country to work. You may not seek employment while visiting Bermuda.
