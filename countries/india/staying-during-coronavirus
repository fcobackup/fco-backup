Everyone should comply with the measures put in place in India to limit the spread of coronavirus (COVID-19).
Moving around in India
On 17 May, the Government of India extended the lockdown across India until 31 May.
The Indian Ministry of Home Affairs has issued new guidelines to regulate activities in this period. Movement is restricted between 7 pm to 7 am except for essential activities or medical emergencies in all zones. . Other restrictions vary between areas so it is important to follow local directives.
Domestic flight operations will resume on 25 May. More information and detailed guidance is available on the Ministry of Civil Aviation’s website.
All international flights currently remain suspended. Limited train services have resumed, but metro rail services remain prohibited. Limited inter-state movements of passenger vehicles and buses is now permitted this will vary from state to state within India.
All essential services (including groceries, pharmacies, ATMs) continue to function. The Government of India has ordered that food, medicines and other supplies remain available, but we are aware that some supplies are running low, and some shops are closed.
The wearing of facial/cloth masks is now compulsory in all public places. There are strict restrictions on large gatherings. You may be penalised if you violate restrictions.

Visas
Check the validity of your Indian visa. If it has expired, or is due to expire, you will need to apply for a visa extension via the FRRO website. We are aware that there are currently issues with the FRRO website – we are working with the relevant authority to rectify. Try at off-peak times if you are experiencing problems. Visa free travel for Overseas Citizens of India (OCI) is also suspended.
All regular and e-visas which have expired since 1 February, or are due to expire during the suspension of international air travel, will be extended at no cost if you apply online. This extension will be granted for a period of up to 30 days from the date that international air travel resumes.
The Government of India has published FAQs for foreigners currently in India who are worried about overstaying their visa. Visit the FRRO website if you have any visa-related queries.
Accommodation
If your hotel asks you to leave, ask them to provide alternative accommodation, or talk to the police who can assist. If you have nowhere to go and you need urgent help, contact the nearest British consulate:
New Delhi: +91 (11) 2419 2100
Chennai: + 91 (44) 42192151

Health
If you need medicine, check with your nearest pharmacy or ask your accommodation provider to help. Carry any medical papers or prescriptions and be prepared to answer questions if stopped by the police. If your usual medication is not available, consult a local doctor for an Indian alternative or go to the nearest hospital. In a genuine medical emergency, call an ambulance.

Coronavirus
It is a mandatory requirement in a number of states for foreign nationals to complete a health declaration. You may be liable for prosecution if you are symptomatic or a confirmed case and deliberately attempt to hide symptoms and/or travel history.
The Indian Government has expanded testing, including through private laboratories, though testing is still available only on the prescription of a registered medical practitioner. A Government supported central help line number +91-11-23978046 can be used to re-direct you to a medical practitioner. If you have symptoms of COVID-19 (coughing and fever and/or shortness of breath) and would like to get tested and get more information, contact a registered medical practitioner. See additional guidance on testing.
Finance
There is a range of financial support from the government that you can access while you are unable to return due to coronavirus restrictions.
If you’re in India, and have exhausted all other options to cover essential living costs while you wait to return home, you could apply for an emergency loan for your living costs from the UK government. You can only apply if you normally live in the UK and you cannot return home. This last-resort option is for those most in need, and you would need to repay the loan when you are back in the UK. Apply for an emergency loan.
