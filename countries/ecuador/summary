The Foreign and Commonwealth Office (FCO) advise against all travel within the 20km exclusion zone along the border with Colombia, except for the official border crossing town of Tulcan in Carchi province.
The FCO advises against all but essential travel to Ecuador, with the exception of the Galapagos Islands. This advice does not apply to transit through Quito or Guayaquil Airports for onward travel to Galapagos, which is currently not significantly affected.

There have been extensive protests across Ecuador since 3 October following new economic measures announced by the Government on 1 October. This has caused nationwide disruption, with demonstrations and road blockages in many provinces.
On that basis, the FCO advises against all but essential travel to Ecuador. The Galapagos Islands have not been significantly affected, nor has transit through Quito and Guayaquil airports to Galapagos.
Further demonstrations are expected over the next few days, especially in the Andean region. A State of Emergency was declared on 3 October and remains in place. In response to widespread protests and disruption within the capital, the Government announced a 3pm curfew in Quito and the valleys on 12 October, until further notice. You should ensure that you comply with the requirements of the emergency measures, including curfews. Stay indoors and avoid movement in Quito and the surrounding valleys while the curfew is in place.
This curfew is in addition to the curfew announced on 8 October, restricting access between 20:00 and 05:00 in the Historic Centre in Quito and in other areas of strategic importance across Ecuador, including ports, airports, Government buildings and energy infrastructure. Official documents will be required for access to ports and airports within these times. Military personnel have been deployed nationwide, and security forces have used tear gas to disperse crowds. The President has moved the seat of government from the capital to Guayaquil.
Tensions remain high and the situation is volatile. You should avoid all demonstrations, as some have turned violent and resulted in injuries and several fatalities. The Historic Centre in Quito and the vicinity of the National Assembly are a particular focus for protests.
Travellers should consider carefully the practicalities and security implications of their travel plans. You should avoid inter-city travel by land where possible. Allow extra time to reach your destination and check travel plans regularly - you may need to change your plans. If your travel is affected by roadblocks, remain where you are until you have identified a safe route and means to travel. National supply chains are also being affected. You should ensure you have adequate essential supplies (food, water, fuel and medicine).
Monitor official sources via the ECU 911 emergency services - be wary of unverified, unofficial information. Updates on transport disruption are available on the ECU 911 website, from the Municipal Transport Agency for Quito and the Municipal Transport Agency for Guayaquil. If you need urgent consular assistance, contact the British Embassy Quito on +593 (0)2 397 2200.
Access to Quito airport has been blocked on 12 October. Some international and domestic flights have been cancelled. You should check your flight status with your airline before traveling to the airport. For live updates on all flights, monitor the Quito International Airport and Guayaquil International Airport websites (in Spanish).
