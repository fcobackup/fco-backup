The information on this page covers the most common types of travel and reflects the UK government’s understanding of the rules currently in place. Unless otherwise stated, this information is for travellers using a full ‘British Citizen’ passport.
The authorities in the country or territory you’re travelling to are responsible for setting and enforcing the rules for entry. If you’re unclear about any aspect of the entry requirements, or you need further reassurance, you’ll need to contact the embassy, high commission or consulate of the country or territory you’re travelling to.
You should also consider checking with your transport provider or travel company to make sure your passport and other travel documents meet their requirements.
Restrictions in response to coronavirus (COVID-19)
Entry to Austria
Entry to Austria without the need for a COVID-19 test or quarantine is possible from the UK, except for people who have been to these regions in the 10 days prior to travelling to Austria:
North East
East Midlands
Yorkshire and the Humber
If you arrive from these regions, or have been to these regions in the last 10 days, you must present on arrival a medical certificate not more than 72 hours old, confirming a negative test for COVID-19. Testing on arrival is available at Vienna and Salzburg airports, and costs approximately €120 per test. If you cannot present a negative test result upon arrival, you must isolate for 10 days and take a test at your own cost within 48 hours. You can end self-isolation early with a negative test result.
Entry to Austria without the need for a COVID-19 test or quarantine is possible for UK nationals travelling from a country or region on the Austrian government’s “list of countries where COVID-19 is sufficiently controlled”, who have not travelled elsewhere in the 10 days before arriving in Austria.
If you have travelled in the 10 days before you arrive in Austria to a country or region for which the Austrian government has a travel warning, you must present on arrival a medical certificate not more than 72 hours old, confirming a negative test for COVID-19. If you cannot present a negative test result, you must isolate for 10 days upon arrival, and take a coronavirus test within 48 hours at your own cost. You can end self-isolation early with a negative test result.
If you have travelled in the 10 days before you arrive in Austria to anywhere not on the Austrian government’s “list of countries where COVID-19 is sufficiently controlled” nor to a country for which the Austrian Government has a travel warning, you must present on arrival a medical certificate not more than 72 hours old, confirming a negative test for COVID-19. If you cannot present a negative test result, you must isolate for 10 days upon arrival. You can end isolation early with a negative coronavirus test if you wish to take one at your own cost.
You should not use the NHS testing service to get a test in order to facilitate your travel to another country. You should arrange to take a private test.
Transit Austria
If you’re transiting through Austria without a stopover, you do not need a medical certificate if you can prove you are transiting.
Neighbouring countries are may be restricting movement across borders and conducting health checks. Check the travel advice for any country you need to travel through.
Regular entry requirements
Visas
If you hold a British Citizen passport, you don’t need a visa to enter Austria. If you’re planning a stay of longer than 3 months, see our Living in Austria guide and contact the Austrian Embassy if you have further questions.
The rules on travel will stay the same until 31 December 2020.
Visas from 1 January 2021
The rules for travelling or working in Europe will change from 1 January 2021:
You will be able to travel to countries in the Schengen area for up to 90 days in any 180-day period without a visa for purposes such as tourism. This is a rolling 180-day period.
Therefore, if you’re travelling to Austria, previous visits to the Schengen area within the 180 days before your date of travel would count against the 90-day limit.
If you are travelling visa-free to Austria and to other countries in the Schengen area, make sure your whole visit is within the limit.
To stay for longer, to work or study, or for business travel you will need to meet the entry requirements set out by Austria. This could mean applying for a visa or work permit. You should check with the Austrian Embassy what type of visa, if any, you will need.
Periods of stay authorised under a visa or permit will not count against the 90-day limit.
The European Commission has not yet set out how the limit of 90 days in any 180-day period for visa-free travel will be implemented for those who are already travelling in the EU or Schengen Area on 31 December 2020.
If you are travelling to Austria before 31 December 2020 and will stay until 1 January 2021 or later, you should check with the Austrian Embassy for information on how the 90-day visa-free limit will apply to you. This also applies if your stay includes travel to other Schengen area countries.
At border control for Austria, you may need to:
show a return or onward ticket
show you have enough money for your stay
use separate lanes from EU, EEA and Swiss citizens when queueing
Your passport may be stamped on entry and exit.
Passport validity
The rules on travel will stay the same until 31 December 2020.
Your passport should be valid for the proposed duration of your stay; you do not need any additional period of validity on your passport beyond this.
Passport validity from 1 January 2021
From 1 January 2021, you must have at least 6 months left on an adult or child passport to travel to most countries in Europe (not including Ireland).
If you renewed your current passport before the previous one expired, extra months may have been added to its expiry date. Any extra months on your passport over 10 years may not count towards the 6 months needed.
Check your passport is valid for travel before you book your trip. You will need to renew your passport before travelling if you do not have enough time left on your passport.
Travelling with children
If you are a single parent, or travelling with a child who is not your own, you will need documentary evidence of parental responsibility and a letter of consent. For further information on exactly what will be required at immigration contact the Austrian Embassy in London.
UK Emergency Travel Documents
UK Emergency Travel Documents are accepted for entry, airside transit and exit from Austria.
