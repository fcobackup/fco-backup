There is an ongoing outbreak of coronavirus (COVID-19) and the Nauru authorities have introduced travel restrictions. See Health
The Government of Australia has announced that from 9pm local time on 20 March, entry to the country will only be permitted to Australian citizens or permanent residents. This follows a similar announcement by New Zealand from 19 March. As many flight connections to and from Nauru connect in Australia and New Zealand, options to depart Nauru are likely to reduce. If you’re currently a visitor in Nauru, you’re advised to prepare to leave as soon as possible. If you’re resident in Nauru, you should be aware of the potential impact of the border closures and flight restrictions on future travel plans.
Most visits to Nauru are trouble-free. Accommodation options are limited. We recommend that you plan flights and book accommodation well in advance of travel.
Although there’s no recent history of terrorism in Nauru, attacks can’t be ruled out. See Terrorism
There’s no British Consulate in Nauru. Consular support is severely limited, however, the British High Commission Honiara in Solomon Islands can provide some consular support to British nationals.
Take out comprehensive travel and medical insurance before you travel.
