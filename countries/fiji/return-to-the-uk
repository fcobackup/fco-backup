We encourage British nationals in Fiji to register their details with the British High Commission. If you are a UK/EU national seeking to leave Fiji to return home, send your details to SuvaCS@fco.gov.uk with the following information for all passengers:

date of birth
current location
telephone numbers if you have one
intended destination
In registering your details, you will receive regular information about the situation in Fiji, including if any further flights become available.
On 26 March, Nadi Airport closed to all scheduled international flights. Fiji Airways have indicated they will continue to operate ad hoc flights and we will try to publish details of these on our Facebook and Twitter pages. You should also follow Fiji Airways Twitter page.
A UK-organised special flight left Nadi on 29 April. As this enabled all visitors to return home.
Your journey home
The National Travel Health Network and Centre (NaTHNaC) provides advice on how to stay safe as you travel by air.
When you arrive back in the UK, follow the guidance for when you return to the UK on steps you should take to protect yourself and others. ###Future options
We do not anticipate further UK charter flights at this time.
You will need to pay for your return travel to the UK. If departure options are available but you cannot afford the travel costs and have exhausted all other options for getting funds, you may be eligible to apply for an emergency loan from the government. This is a last resort option and you would need to repay the loan when you are back in the UK. For more information, you should contact Corporate Travel Management (CTM). CTM are a commercial partner of the FCO and are authorised to administer such loans on behalf of the FCO.
If you cannot leave Fiji at this time, you should:
follow the advice of local authorities, including local measures to help minimise your risk of exposure to coronavirus
find accommodation that’s suitable for your needs
keep in regular contact with family and friends at home, so they know you are safe and well
See more information and advice about staying where you are if you cannot return to the UK.

If you need urgent consular assistance, you can contact the British High Commission on +679 3229 100 or +679 3229 132.
