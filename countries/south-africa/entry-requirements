This page has information on travelling to South Africa. Check what you must do to return to the UK.
This page reflects the UK government’s understanding of current rules for people travelling on a full ‘British Citizen’ passport from the UK, for the most common types of travel.
The authorities in South Africa set and enforce entry rules.
All travellers
You can travel to South Africa for any purpose for up to 90 days without a visa.
You may need to complete a health form to enter South Africa.
See Visas and Passport validity sections for more information.
If you’re fully vaccinated
If you are fully vaccinated, you do not need to take a coronavirus test to travel to South Africa. You will need to present your vaccination certificate during travel and on arrival.
South African authorities have confirmed that vaccines recommended and approved for use by the World Health Organisation are accepted. This includes the Moderna, Oxford/AstraZeneca, and Pfizer/BioNTech vaccines used in the UK vaccine programme.
Any valid vaccination certificate is acceptable, including the NHS COVID pass. You should ensure you can present the digital version, with the QR code, when you arrive.
If you’re not fully vaccinated
Unvaccinated people must provide a valid certificate of a negative COVID-19 PCR test, which was obtained not more than 72 hours before the date of travel.
If you’ve had COVID-19 in the past year
To avoid disruption to your plans, you should present either a valid vaccination certificate or PCR test (as above). If you need to rely on a COVID-19 recovery certificate you should check with your nearest South African Embassy or High Commission before travel.
Children and young people
Children under 5 do not require a PCR test to enter South Africa. Children aged 5 and over must present a PCR test or proof of vaccination on arrival.
If you’re transiting through South Africa
The rules set out above also apply to travellers wishing to transit South Africa.
Exemptions
There are no exemptions to South Africa’s entry requirements.
Check your passport and travel documents before you travel
Check with your travel provider to make sure your passport and other travel documents meet their requirements.
Passport validity
If you are visiting South Africa, your passport should be valid for 6 months from the date you arrive.
Your passport should be valid for at least 30 days beyond your intended date of exit from South Africa, in line with South African immigration regulations. However, some immigration officials still request that a passport should have at least 6 months validity on the date of entry to South Africa. To avoid problems at the airport on arrival, you’re advised to ensure your passport is valid for six months.
Your passport should have at least two blank pages when you arrive in South Africa.
Dual citizenship
If you hold South African citizenship, you must enter and exit South Africa on your South African passport. It is an offence for a South African citizen aged 18 or over to enter or leave the country on a foreign passport.
Visas
If you’re visiting South Africa for tourism or business purposes for a period of up to 90 days, you don’t need a visa.
For more information on visas, contact the South African High Commission.
Travelling with children
There are special requirements for travelling to South Africa with children under the age of 18. There are different requirements for unaccompanied children entering South Africa.
Check the advisory from the South African Department of Home Affairs for more details, and consult your nearest South African high commission or embassy if you have any questions about these requirements.
Biometric capturing
South Africa has implemented biometric capturing at all ports of entry. This may result in some delays at land borders. You should allow additional time for border crossings.
Yellow fever certificate requirements
Check whether you need a yellow fever certificate by visiting the National Travel Health Network and Centre’s TravelHealthPro website.
UK Emergency Travel Documents
South African authorities advise that UK Emergency Travel Documents (ETDs) are accepted for entry, transit and exit from South Africa. ETDs should have a minimum of 6 months validity for entry, transit or exit.
