It is illegal to change money on the streets. You should change money only in recognised exchange shops, banks and hotels.
The Romanian authorities treat all drug-related and sex offences very seriously. The age of consent is 18. If you are convicted, you can expect a prison sentence.
Homosexuality has been legal in Romania since 1996. The country has made significant progress in LGBT rights legislation since 2000 including wide–ranging anti-discriminatory laws, equalising the age of consent and laws against homophobic hate crimes. Bucharest’s annual Pride, usually accompanied by a LGBT film and art festival, has grown in recent years and is gaining the support of more public figures. Since 2017, a Pride event has also been held in the city of Cluj. The country remains generally socially conservative resulting in the majority of LGBT people not being openly gay and there being very few gay bars or clubs in Bucharest or the other main cities. You can find local information on LGBT issues in Romania on the website of ACCEPT. See our information and advice page for the LGBT community before you travel.
Most airports and military bases will have signs prohibiting photography. Ask permission before photographing anything potentially sensitive (eg official buildings, police cars).
