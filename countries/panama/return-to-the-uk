Normal commercial flights have now ceased operating to/from Panama until at least the 22 April. If you’re in Panama, you should seek accommodation for the duration.
We understand some airlines are working with the Panamanian Government to consider a limited number of exceptional flights to reschedule those whose original flights have been cancelled. Airlines will be able to advise if these become available.
If you’re a visitor in Panama and want to stay up to date with our latest information, email BEPanama.CV@fco.gov.uk. For specific consular support, contact the Embassy through the recommended consular contacts.
