Travel to Italy is subject to entry restrictions
A negative COVID test is required when you arrive in Italy from the UK. You’ll be asked to show evidence that you tested negative in a test administered in the 72 hours before your travel.
You should not use the NHS testing service to get a test in order to facilitate your travel to another country. You should arrange to take a private test.
Alternatively, you can get a free test on arrival at some airports, or at a testing facility in Italy shortly after you arrive. If you test positive within Italy, you will be required to quarantine. The time spent in quarantine can vary greatly from approximately 10 days to 3 weeks. Travellers should be prepared for this eventuality.
The same testing requirement is in place for all people entering Italy from Spain, France, the Netherlands, Belgium and the Czech Republic.
Additionally, if you have stayed in or transited through a small number of listed countries in the 14 days prior to entering Italy, you’ll need to self-isolate for 14 days on entering Italy. If you cannot do that for any reason, then entry to Italy may be refused.
You should download and complete a self-declaration from the Ministry of Interior before you travel to Italy and inform local authorities of your presence.
See Entry requirements for more information before you plan to travel.
