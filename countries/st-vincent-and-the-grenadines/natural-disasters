Hurricanes
The hurricane season in the Caribbean normally runs from June to November. You should follow and monitor local and international weather updates from the World Meteorological Organisation and the US National Hurricane Centre and follow the advice of local authorities, including any evacuation orders.
See our Tropical cyclones page for advice about how to prepare effectively and what to do if you’re likely to be affected by a hurricane or tropical cyclone.
Earthquakes
Earthquakes are a potential threat and tremors are felt occasionally in the Caribbean. In the event of an earthquake, you should be directed by the local authorities. To learn more about what to do before, during and after an earthquake, visit the website of the US Federal Emergency Management Agency.
Volcanoes
The SVG Prime Minister reported on 29 December 2020 that La Soufriere volcano on St Vincent was in an active state of effusive eruption. On 8 April 2021, there was a significant uptick in volcanic activity with scientists assessing an explosive volcanic eruption could occur in a matter of hours or days. The Prime Minister therefore decided to upgrade the level to a stage 4 disaster alert and issued an immediate evacuation order for those persons living in the RED Zone on the Windward and Leeward side of the island.
During the morning of 9 April 2021, there were several explosive eruptions of La Soufriere and an ash plume 6km high. Argyle International Airport was closed until further notice.
Explosive eruptions could theoretically continue for weeks to come. During this period, British Nationals should heed the advice of local authorities.
You should monitor the alert level of the underwater volcano ‘Kick’em Jenny’, located 5 miles off the coast of Grenada. Observe any maritime exclusion zones and follow the advice of the local authorities in the event of increased activity or an eruption.
