There are currently extremely limited commercial options available to return to the UK from Rwanda.
All flights to and from Kigali International Airport are suspended until 19 May (which could be extended). Emergency flights are the only exceptions. All land borders are also closed (except to returning Rwandan citizens and legal residents).
This travel advice will be updated when departure options become available. Sign up for travel advice email alerts. If you wish to leave Rwanda, you should also notify the British High Commission Kigali.
If you cannot leave Rwanda at this time, see advice on staying in Rwanda during coronavirus.
You will need to pay for your return travel to the UK. If departure options are available but you cannot afford the travel costs and have exhausted all other options for getting funds, you may be eligible to apply for an emergency loan from the government. This is a last resort option and you would need to repay the loan when you are back in the UK. For more information, contact Corporate Travel Management (CTM). CTM are a commercial partner of the FCO and are authorised to administer such loans on behalf of the FCO.
Exit screening
Exit screening is in place for all departing travellers. Any travellers exhibiting a symptom associated with coronavirus will be prevented from leaving the country and will be moved to isolation for testing. If an individual tests positive, they will be treated in a Government of Rwanda healthcare facility.
