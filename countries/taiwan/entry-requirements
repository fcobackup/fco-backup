Entry rules in response to coronavirus (COVID-19)
Entry to Taiwan
From 9 November all passengers arriving into Taiwan must declare if they have had COVID-19 symptoms in the last 14 days. If you report symptoms you must have a PCR test at the airport or a hospital immediately after entry into Taiwan. If you test negative you must have a second test after 24 hours. You will have to wait for both results at a designated quarantine centre. If you have two negative results you will be able to leave the quarantine centre and carry out your 14 day self-isolation at your home, if appropriate, or in a designated quarantine hotel. A positive test will mean hospitalisation.
From 1 December 2020 to 28 February 2021 all passengers, regardless of nationality or travel purpose, arriving or transiting in Taiwan are required to present a certificate of a negative COVID-19 RT-PCR test in order to be able to board their flight to Taiwan. Any exemption due to exceptional circumstances will require prior approval before departure.
The test needs to have taken place within 72 hours before their date of departure. Test Certificates of a negative COVID-19 RT-PCR must be issued by a recognised medical institution in the country of departure and include the following information: the passenger’s full name as per their passport, the date of birth or passport number of the traveller, specimen collection date and test report date, the virus name, testing method and the test result. Test Certificates are required to be produced in either English or Chinese; however, in situations where the passenger provides a certificate in either French or Spanish, if the certificate is in the official language of the place of departure, and ground personnel of the airline are able to assist with the inspection of the content, the certificate may be accepted.
Anyone found to provide false or incorrect test results, or evade or obstruct the quarantine measures, may face a fine of between NT$10,000 to NT$150,000 and further criminal charges.
Refer to the Taiwan Centers for Disease Control for further information regarding Test Exemptions, Test Certificates and COVID-19 test requirements.
You should not use the NHS testing service to get a test in order to facilitate your travel to another country. You should arrange to take a private test.

Before you travel you should apply for a visa to enter Taiwan. This can be done at the Taipei Representative Office (TRO) in the country from which you plan to travel. The rules on who can enter Taiwan may change at short notice, so you should contact the TRO for the latest information.

The Taiwanese authorities announced in March that travellers already in Taiwan who arrived under a visa waiver, visitor visa or landing visa before 21 March, and had not overstayed their entry conditions, would be granted an automatic 30-day extension of their stay. This has now been extended by further 30 day periods. The extension will be applied automatically, no application is required. Your total period of stay, including extensions, cannot exceed 180 days. For more information, you should contact the National Immigration Agency (NIA).
If you wish to stay over 180 days, you may apply to do so if you have a legitimate reason for needing to remain in Taiwan or are unable to leave. Restrictions apply and not all British nationals will be eligible. You cannot apply more than 15 days before the 180 day point. For more information, you should contact the National Immigration Agency (NIA). The British Office is unable to issue letters or endorsements to support any application to remain.
