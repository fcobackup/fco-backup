There is a military conflict ongoing in the north of Ethiopia. Military clashes are now occurring in Tigray, Amhara and Afar regional states. The conflict has potential to escalate quickly and with little warning. The FCDO advises against all travel to Tigray and within 30km of its borders with Amhara and Afar regional states, and to specific areas in Amhara and Afar where fighting is likely. The FCDO advises against all but essential travel to northern areas of Amhara, and north and western areas of Afar regions because of the risk of the conflict spreading to new areas without prior warning. If you are in the vicinity of military activity and you cannot leave safely, you should stay indoors, away from windows and remain alert to developments that would enable you to leave safely.
