FCDO advises against all but essential travel to North Korea.
This advice reflects the UK government’s understanding of current rules for people travelling on a full ‘British citizen’ passport from the UK, for the most common types of travel.
The authorities in North Korea set and enforce entry rules. If you’re not sure how these requirements apply to you, contact the Embassy of the Democratic People’s Republic of Korea (DPRK) in London by email at prkinfo@yahoo.com, or by telephone on 020 8992 4965 .
Tourists can normally only travel to North Korea as part of an organised tour. Independent travellers will need a sponsor and permission from the Ministry for Foreign Affairs. This is usually only possible for business travellers.
COVID-19 rules
No entry into North Korea is permitted whilst COVID-19 border restrictions remain in place.
Passport validity requirements
Your passport should be valid for the proposed duration of your stay. No additional period of validity beyond this is required.
Check with your travel provider that your passport and other travel documents meet requirements. Renew your passport if you need to.
You will be denied entry if you do not have a valid travel document or try to use a passport that has been reported lost or stolen.
Visa requirements
You will need a visa to enter North Korea. For further information contact the Embassy of the Democratic People’s Republic of Korea (DPRK) in London by email at prkinfo@yahoo.com, or by telephone on 020 8992 4965.
Applying for a visa
Visa application enquires should be made directly to the embassy.
Vaccination requirements
At least 8 weeks before your trip, check the vaccinations and certificates you need in TravelHealthPro’s North Korea guide.
Registration with the authorities
You must register with the Ministry of Foreign Affairs if your visit is for more than 24 hours. Most hotels will automatically complete this process on your behalf.
Some hotels may insist on full cash payment in advance when you check in.
Customs rules
You must leave any Global Positioning System technology with North Korean customs. You can collect your devices when you leave North Korea.
You can bring a foreign mobile phone into the country, but you must register it at the border. You can only use it with a North Korean SIM card.
Avoid bringing books or other written material in the Korean language, including anything with religious content. Consider carefully any films or television programmes that you bring into the country, either on DVD or on data storage devices. Any literature or media deemed to have an anti-government message or deemed subversive or pornographic by the authorities in North Korea risk confiscation, with severe penalties including imprisonment as a result.
There have also been cases of travel guides being confiscated at the airport on arrival; they are usually returned on departure.
Taking money into North Korea
Shops and restaurants list prices in the local currency (North Korean won) but usually charge foreigners in foreign currency. They convert the won price using official exchange rates.
The euro and US dollar are the most widely accepted currencies, although some places accept Chinese yuan.
It is illegal to import and export the local currency. There are no restrictions on importing and exporting foreign currency, but you must declare it at customs. Credit cards and travellers cheques are not accepted.
