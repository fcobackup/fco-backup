Terrorism in Ireland
Terrorist attacks in Ireland cannot be ruled out.
Demonstrations 
Demonstrations, political gatherings, or marches can take place with little or no warning, particularly in cities.  
Whilst most demonstrations are peaceful, they can cause disruption, including to transport routes. If you’re near areas where they are taking place, you should remain aware of what is happening around you and follow the advice of the police and local authorities.
Crime
Take precautions to reduce the risk of bag-snatching or pickpocketing. Avoid carrying valuables and large amounts of money. Lock your vehicle and park where possible in a secure car park. Most incidents occur in the larger cities.
Laws and cultural differences
Illegal drugs
Possession of even small quantities of drugs, including cannabis, carry severe penalties.
You should expect a long jail sentence and heavy fines for possessing, using or smuggling illegal drugs, including when transiting through the airport. Do not offer to carry any items for anyone else when entering or leaving Ireland.
Airports in Ireland have excellent technology and security for detecting illegal items. This is also used to scan the baggage of transiting passengers.
