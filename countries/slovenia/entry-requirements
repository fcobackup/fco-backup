This page has information on travelling to Slovenia. Check what you must do to return to the UK.
This page reflects the UK government’s understanding of current rules for people travelling on a full ‘British Citizen’ passport from the UK, for the most common types of travel.
The authorities in Slovenia set and enforce entry rules.
All travellers
If you are travelling to Slovenia indirectly, please refer to the Travel Advice for the countries through which you will be transiting.
If you are not resident in Slovenia, you should be aware that for stays longer than 90 days, you will be required to register as a Temporary Resident. Contact the Uprava Enota (the department that handles these applications) at +386 1 306 3034 or ue.ljubljana@gov.si. The department is open from Monday to Thursday from 8am-6pm and on Friday from 8am-2pm.
All travellers arriving in Slovenia must continue to complete the Digital Passenger Locator Form 24 hours before arrival, if entering via an airport or a ferry terminal. The form is not required if entering overland at a border crossing. On completion of the Passenger Locator Form you will receive a QR code which must be shown on entry. The link to the Digital Passenger Locator Form can be found on the Slovene Government website.
All travellers arriving in Slovenia will no longer be required to present proof of vaccination or a negative COVID-19 test.
If you’re fully vaccinated
Entry requirements for Slovenia are the same for all travellers, regardless of COVID-19 vaccination status.
Proof of vaccination status
You no longer need to provide proof of your vaccination status for entry to Slovenia.
If you’re not fully vaccinated
Entry requirements for Slovenia are the same for all travellers, regardless of COVID-19 vaccination status.
EU guidelines continue to recommend against allowing entry to non-vaccinated travellers from third countries unless their journey is deemed essential. In line with this, entry will be denied to persons (citizens of third countries who do not hold Slovenian residence) with apparent signs of sickness, and those transiting through Slovenia who do not meet the criteria for entering their country of destination.
Children and young people
All children must also continue to complete the Digital Passenger Locator Form 24 hours before arrival, if entering via an airport or a ferry terminal. The form is not required if entering overland at a border crossing. On completion of the Passenger Locator Form you will receive a QR code which must be shown on entry. The link to the Digital Passenger Locator Form can be found on the Slovene Government website.
If you’re transiting through Slovenia
Transiting is when you pass through one country on the way to your final destination.
Transiting through Slovenia is permitted.
As of 19 February 2022, restrictions due to COVID-19 no longer apply when entering Slovenia. This means that the RVT (recovered/vaccinated/tested) condition no longer has to be met at the border and travellers will no longer be ordered to quarantine at home.
This also applies to transit through Slovenia. The only restriction on transit is that travellers must have proof that they will be able to leave the territory of the Republic of Slovenia and enter a neighbouring country.
More information on transiting Slovenia can be found on the Ministry of the Interior website .
If you are travelling to neighbouring countries you should check the travel advice for the latest information on entering those countries. See travel advice for Austria, Croatia, Hungary and Italy.
Internal checkpoints on the Schengen borders with Italy, Austria and Hungary have been removed.
Exemptions
As travellers are not required to prove their vaccination status or present a test certificate, previously allowed exemptions are no longer relevant.
Check your passport and travel documents before you travel
Passport validity
If you are planning to travel to an EU country (except Ireland), or Switzerland, Norway, Iceland, Liechtenstein, Andorra, Monaco, San Marino or Vatican City, you must meet the Schengen area rules.
Your passport must meet two requirements. It must be:
less than 10 years old on the day you enter (check the ‘date of issue’)
valid for at least 3 months after the day you plan to leave (check the ‘expiry date’)
We are asking the European Commission to clarify the 10-year rule. Their guidance for Schengen border guards may not be updated until the spring of 2022. Until then, for some Schengen countries your passport may need to be less than 10 years old during your whole visit, and the 3 months at the end of your visit may need to be within 10 years of your passport’s issue date.
Check both the issue date and the expiry date in your passport. If you renewed your passport early, extra months may have been added to its expiry date. This could affect the requirement for your passport to be less than 10 years old.
Contact your travel provider or embassy of the country you are visiting if you think that your passport does not meet both these requirements. Renew your passport if you need to.
Visas
You can travel to countries in the Schengen area for up to 90 days in any 180-day period without a visa. This applies if you travel as a tourist, to visit family or friends, to attend business meetings, cultural or sports events, or for short-term studies or training.
If you are travelling to Slovenia and other Schengen countries without a visa, make sure your whole visit is within the 90-day limit. Visits to Schengen countries within the previous 180 days before you travel count towards your 90 days.
To stay longer, to work or study, for business travel or for other reasons, you will need to meet the Slovenian government’s entry requirements. Check with the Slovene Embassy what type of visa and/or work permit, you may need.
If you are travelling to Slovenia for work, read the guidance on visas and permits.
If you stay in Slovenia with a residence permit or long-stay visa, this does not count to-wards your 90-day visa-free limit.
Passport stamping
Check your passport is stamped if you enter or exit the Schengen area through Slovenia as a visitor. Border guards will use passport stamps to check you’re complying with the 90-day visa-free limit for short stays in the Schengen area. If relevant entry or exit stamps are not in your passport, border guards will presume that you have overstayed your visa-free limit.
You can show evidence of when and where you entered or exited the Schengen area, and ask the border guards to add this date and location in your passport. Examples of acceptable evidence include boarding passes and tickets.
You may also need to:
show a return or onward ticket
show you have enough money for your stay
If you are resident in Slovenia, read our Living in Slovenia guide for passport stamping information.
UK Emergency Travel Documents
UK Emergency Travel Documents (ETDs) are accepted for entry, airside transit and exit from Slovenia.
