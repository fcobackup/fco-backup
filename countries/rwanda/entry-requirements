This page reflects the UK government’s understanding of current rules for people travelling on a full ‘British Citizen’ passport from the UK, for the most common types of travel.
The authorities in Rwanda set and enforce entry rules.
All travellers
The Government of Rwanda has published updated guidance for passengers arriving in and departing from Rwanda.
All travellers arriving in Rwanda must present a negative Rapid (Lateral Flow) Test or a PCR test, taken no more than 72 hours prior to departure. You should not use the NHS testing service to get a test in order to facilitate your travel to another country. You should arrange to take a private test that provides a result certificate.
Accompanying children under 5 years old do not need a COVID-19 test result.
Completing a Passenger Locator Form is no longer a requirement before departure.
Certain meeting venues and national parks still require Covid tests. Testing is available at health facilities and other designated sites for 5,000 RWF (or US$5) for rapid antigen tests, and 50,000 RWF (or US$50) for PCR tests (required to access Virunga National Park). Rwandan citizens pay a subsidized cost for PCR tests of 30,000 RWF (or US$30)
You should monitor the website of the office of the Prime Minister of Rwanda and the Twitter account of the Office of the Prime Minister for further updates.
You will need a visa to enter or travel through Rwanda as a visitor.

Passport validity
Your passport should be valid for at least 6 months from the date of entry into Rwanda. You’ll need one blank page on your passport for entry stamps.
Visas
You need a visa to enter Rwanda. Thirty-day tourist visas are free and available on arrival for citizens of member states of the Commonwealth (including the UK), as well as for those of the African Union and the Francophonie.
You can also choose to get a visa in advance at any Rwandan diplomatic mission or online. Further information about visa requirements is available from the Rwandan High Commission.
If you’re planning to apply for resident/business or missionary multiple entry visas on entry to Rwanda you will need to get UK police clearance before you travel. You can find details of how to do this on the ACRO Criminal Records Office website. This usually takes a minimum of 10 working days to process.
Yellow fever certificate requirements
Check whether you need a yellow fever certificate by visiting the National Travel Health Network and Centre’s TravelHealthPro website.
UK Emergency Travel Documents
UK Emergency Travel Documents (ETDs) are accepted for entry, airside transit and exit from Rwanda. If you’re travelling into Rwanda on an ETD, you’ll be expected to provide Rwandan Immigration with a reason for the use of an ETD, e.g. proof of residency. If you’re seeking to use a two-way ETD, should clear this with Rwandan Immigration before you travel.
Returning to the UK
The Government of Rwanda has published updated guidance for passengers arriving in and departing from Rwanda.
All Rwandan travellers aged 12 years and above must show proof of full vaccination before departing Rwanda by air.
A COVID-19 test is no longer a requirement to depart Rwanda by air. However, COVID-19 testing (at own cost) is available for all travellers whose final destination requires one, at health centres and other designated sites. Travellers are advised to check with airlines about the COVID-19 requirements of the final destination and/or transit countries and plan for their RT-PCR test accordingly.
