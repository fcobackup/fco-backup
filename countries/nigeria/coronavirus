Travel in Nigeria
Passengers will be asked to follow a number of additional health procedures, including the following:
you must wear a mask or face covering
all passengers’ temperature will be taken on arrival at the airport
you are required to observe social distancing measures
you will be asked to use hand washing facilities installed outside the airports
your bags will be sprayed with decontamination fluids
The Nigerian government strongly encourages travellers to re-consider all non-essential travel (domestic and international), during the holiday season to help fight the spread of coronavirus.
Most states in Nigeria have introduced their own restrictions on movement. All travellers and residents in Nigeria are encouraged to monitor announcements by the Nigerian authorities on further restrictions, which may be introduced at short notice.
The Federal Government has relaxed the lockdown restrictions in place in Abuja and Lagos and replaced them with new requirements, including a nationwide daily night time curfew between midnight and 4am and the mandatory use of face masks in public.
Public spaces and services
Gatherings of over 50 people outside of work places are prohibited, including all weddings, conferences and sporting events. Bars, restaurants other than in hotels, events and recreational centres are currently closed. Places of worship are permitted to hold services, subject to limitations set by state authorities.
Visits to public institutions, including government buildings, have been limited.
Additional measures include a mandatory requirement to wear face masks in public spaces. Check the Nigerian Centre for Disease Control website for updates on further guidance on the implications of the lockdown restrictions.
Healthcare in Nigeria
Pharmacies are classified as an essential service, and will remain open. Most medicines that require a prescription from a doctor in the UK will require one in Nigeria. If necessary, you should get an electronic prescription from your medical practitioner to enable a local doctor to write one.
Unlike in the UK, you will need to go to a pharmacy or chemist to obtain most over-the-counter medicines. Only a very limited selection are available at supermarkets or other stores. Pharmacies are widely available. They will accept prescriptions from the UK.

COVID-19 vaccines if you live in Nigeria
Wherever possible British nationals living in Nigeria should aim to be vaccinated in Nigeria. You should seek advice from your healthcare provider on the availability of vaccines locally. You can also obtain further information from National Primary Health Care Development Agency (NPHCDA) or contact individual State Health authorities who will be responsible for the vaccine roll out in each State.
A national vaccination programme was launched on 5 March. Health workers (and other front line staff) will be prioritised in the first phase. This will be followed by phase 2 (people aged 50 and above) and phase 3 (people with co-morbidities).
The vaccine registration e-portal is now open on the NPHCDA website. Nigerians and residents of Nigeria will be eligible according to priority. You should upload your National Identity Number (NIN), passport or other forms of ID as advised on the portal in order to register. You can get further information on registration from the NPHCDA on 00 234 (0) 803 123 0415/0416.
As further information becomes available about Nigeria’s national vaccination programme, this page will be updated.
The Medicines and Healthcare Products Regulatory Agency (MHRA) is the UK authority responsible for assessing the safety, quality and efficacy of vaccines. It has authorised the Pfizer/BioNTech, Oxford/AstraZeneca and Moderna vaccines for temporary supply and use in the UK. Find out more about MHRA approval for these vaccines.
Information about vaccines used in other national programmes, including regulatory status, should be available from the local authorities. This list of Stringent Regulatory Authorities recognised by the World Health Organisation may also be a useful source of additional information. Find out more about COVID-19 vaccines on the World Health Organisation COVID-19 vaccines page.
