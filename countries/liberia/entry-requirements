Entry rules in response to coronavirus (COVID-19)
Entry to Liberia
Passengers who have travelled from India, Pakistan or Bangladesh in the previous 14 days are banned from entering Liberia.
Roberts International Airport (RIA) is open for commercial flights. There are no direct flights from the UK. Air France, Brussels Airlines and Royal Air Maroc usually offer a connecting service via Paris, Brussels or Casablanca. However, services between the UK and Casablanca are not operating currently. Flight availability could change at very short notice. Some regional airlines are operating with reduced flight schedules. If you wish to travel, you should contact your airline or travel agent for confirmation of flight schedules. You must wear a mask during transit and on arrival in Liberia. In Roberts International Airport, you must stand in marked spaces within the terminal to allow for social distancing.
Before travelling to Liberia, you must have a negative COVID-19 PCR test result from an accredited lab, regardless of COVID-19 vaccination status. Your test must be conducted a maximum of 96 hours before arrival in Liberia.
Before arrival, in Liberia, you must download the Lib Travel mobile app from Android Play or the Apple Store. If you have problems with the app, staff at Roberts International Airport can assist you.

You must complete a Health Screening Arrival Form before arrival, for monitoring and contact tracing. You must provide your passport details, contact details in Liberia, next of kin details, your travel details (including flight details, with seat number and any transit locations), any countries visited in the previous 14 days, and you must complete the symptom checker. You must select a payment option for your COVID-19 test (payment via app or payment on arrival). Some travellers have reported problems with online payment. You should ensure you carry sufficient cash (US dollars) for payment on arrival. If double-charged you can present proof of online payment and seek a refund. Each adult traveller must download the app and register individually. You can register children via a parent’s app. When you arrive in Liberia, you must be able to show proof that you have completed the symptom tracker form. If you experience problems using the app, staff will assist you at the airport on arrival.
Currently all land borders (with Sierra Leone, Guinea and Côte d’Ivoire) are closed to travellers. Ports remain open.
Testing / screening on arrival
On arrival at Roberts International Airport, travellers will be screened for COVID-19 using rapid tests, with results available in approximately 20 minutes. Any travellers testing positive will be transported by health authorities to the government “Precautionary Observation Center (POC)”, or mandatory quarantine facility, at Star Base. Travellers will be held there pending PCR results and may not be released until confirmed negative for COVID-19. Travellers staying at the POC will usually be given a second test between day 7-9 of quarantine and may be released the following day (i.e. day 8-10) if results are negative. PCR test results usually take several days and at busy periods have taken two weeks due to laboratory backlogs. See Quarantine requirements for more information on the Star Base POC.
All non-exempt travellers arriving in Liberia will be ested for the coronavirus. For exemptions, see Exemptions to testing on arrival below. Different rules apply for travellers who have been in Nepal or Brazil in the previous 14 days, see separate guidance below.
On arrival at entry points, staff will check your temperature and you must wash your hands with soap and water. You must show your symptom checking screening form (mobile app) to public health staff. You must also show your flight itinerary
If you display symptoms of coronavirus, public health officials may take you to a government quarantine or medical facility. See Quarantine requirements
Passengers entering Liberia will be tested for COVID-19 by the National Public Health Reference Laboratory team (unless exempt from testing). Sample collection involves taking a swab of the inside of your nose and the back of your throat, using a long cotton bud, for rapid testing. Results should be available within 20 minutes. You may also be required to submit a sample for PCR testing. Sample processing could take several days. You will receive a unique identification number to retrieve your test results online
You must present proof of payment for your test before your sample is collected. Travellers arriving from ECOWAS countries must pay US$50. Travellers from countries outside the ECOWAS region must pay US$75. There are two payment options available. You can pay in advance via the Lib Travel mobile app, or alternatively, you can pay at the United Bank for Africa (UBA) banking window (in US dollars cash or by card) on arrival
To check PCR test results online, visit the Self Check Portal 2 to 3 days after your sample was collected. You must enter your unique identification number (provided when your sample was collected), and your year of birth. The National Reference Lab is experiencing capacity constraints and your result may be delayed beyond the 72 hours target. Individuals have reported delays of approximately 2 weeks
Government of Liberia strongly recommends that all travellers self-isolate for 7 days and self-monitor symptoms via the Lib Travel app for 14 days, beginning the day after arrival in Liberia.
If your PCR test is positive, you will be subject to Liberia’s case management guidelines. This means the National Public Health Institute of Liberia (NPHIL) will consider your care on a case-by-case basis and you may be taken to a government COVID-19 Treatment Unit. Private health care facilities are not currently permitted to treat COVID-19 patients. Home-based care is considered on a case-by-case basis, but is unlikely to be granted to travellers taken to the Precautionary Observation Centre.
For information on testing for travellers departing Liberia, see International Travel.
Travellers from India, Pakistan or Bangladesh
Passengers who have travelled from India, Pakistan or Bangladesh in the previous 14 days are banned from entering Liberia.
Travellers from Nepal or Brazil
If you have been in Nepal or Brazil in the previous 14 days there are additional entry requirements (managed quarantine). You must complete the general traveller processes above (provide negative PCR test result, complete a Health Screening Arrival Form before arrival, provide your travel itinerary and submit a sample for PCR testing on arrival). You must also book your managed quarantine package before arrival in Liberia.
On arrival, all travellers from Nepal or Brazil will be taken directly from the airport to a government-approved quarantine facility (“Precautionary Observation Center/POC”). You must pay your quarantine fees before entering the facility. You will be tested 7 days after arrival. If your test is negative you will be released. It may take several days to receive this result, so you could spend up to 10 days in the POC.
If you test positive for COVID-19 while in the POC, you will be transferred from your POC to a government COVID-19 Treatment Unit at Star Base. You will only be released from the treatment unit after two consecutive negative COVID-19 tests. This could mean staying for 20 days or more. Liberian POCs and treatment units are basic, and not guaranteed to meet Public Health England standards.

Exemptions to testing on arrival:
Children under the age of 5 years old are exempt from COVID-19 testing and do not require a test result certificate. However, you should check your airline’s requirements.
Cabin crew, captains, flight engineers and first officers with layovers less than 48 hours are exempt from testing if they complete pre-boarding testing as per their airline’s policy and comply with screening procedures while in Liberia. They must complete screening on arrival and proceed to their designated flight crew hotel. If layover is more than 48 hours, cabin crew, captains, flight engineers and first officers must undergo PCR testing before leaving Liberia (see Coronavirus testing for departing travellers)
Diplomats and their families, honorary consuls, duly accredited international organisations’ staff and Liberian diplomats must present a negative PCR COVID-19 test result certificate from an accredited lab within 96 hours of testing (i.e. your test sample must have been collected a maximum of 4 days before arrival in Liberia). Alternatively, voluntary testing at the airport is available free of charge. If you do not present a valid negative PCR COVID-19 test result certificate, NPHIL staff will seek to test you on arrival.
You should not use the NHS testing service to get a test in order to facilitate your travel to another country. You should arrange to take a private test.
You should be prepared for travel restrictions, and changes to screening and quarantine requirements with no advance notice.
Quarantine requirements
Any travellers receiving a positive rapid test result on arrival at Roberts International Airport will be transported by health authorities to the government “Precautionary Observation Centre (POC)”, or mandatory government quarantine facility, at Star Base. Travellers will be held at Star Base pending PCR results and may not be released until confirmed negative for COVID-19 Travellers staying at the POC will usually be given a second test between day 7-9 of quarantine and may be released the following day (i.e. day 8-10) if results are negative. PCR test results usually take several days and at busy periods have taken two weeks due to laboratory backlogs. Liberian POCs are basic, and not guaranteed to meet Public Health England standards.
Travellers from Nepal or Brazil must stay in an approved quarantine facility for a minimum of 8 days (see Travellers from Nepal or Brazil above).
For other travellers, depending on the length and reason for your visit, you may not have to isolate on arrival. However, for the majority of travellers Liberia recommends self-isolation for 7 days after arrival. There is a risk for British nationals of being put into a government quarantine or medical facility, either on arrival or during your trip to Liberia. Liberian precautionary observation centre (POCs) are basic, and not guaranteed to meet Public Health England standards.
You are at risk of being put into quarantine or instructed to self-isolate even after completing your post-arrival self-isolation, if you develop symptoms (fever, cough or respiratory illness), or it is suspected you have been in contact with some who has tested positive for coronavirus. If you test positive for COVID-19, you may be transferred to a government quarantine facility or treatment centre. You are strongly advised to familiarise yourself with these risks before travelling.
If you are travelling on behalf of government, an international organisation/NGO or a company, you should check with your organisation whether they have pre-arranged a private POC, i.e. quarantine facility, authorised by NHPIL. The British Embassy cannot provide POC facilities. If you show symptoms, you may be transferred to a government POC or treatment centre.
Visitors arriving on a laissez-passer (except UN or EU), may also be taken to quarantine for secondary screening. Any suspicion of illegal attempts to circumvent the process will result in removal to quarantine.
