Cases of coronavirus (COVID-19) have been confirmed in the Dominican Republic. The local authorities have introduced measures to limit the spread of the virus.
The FCO strongly encourage non-resident British nationals in Dominican Republic to consider leaving quickly to avoid difficulties they will face if travel out of the country and the region are further restricted and they are unable to get home.

The Dominican government has established a dedicated website and helpline (to access, please call *462) to provide more information on the Dominican Republic’s response to coronavirus. Both of these services operate in Spanish. The helpline is experiencing a high volume of calls and is likely to be under pressure.
Entry and borders
All of the Dominican Republic’s air, land and sea borders closed with effect from 6am on 19 March until 18 April. This applies to journeys both to and from the Dominican Republic.
A quarantine requirement has been imposed for visitors who have been in Europe, China, South Korea or Iran during the previous two weeks. You should comply with additional screening and quarantine measures put in place by the authorities. These regulations may be subject to change at short notice and you should check with your travel provider before your journey.
Cruise ships are not being allowed to dock in Dominican ports, with immediate effect.
Information is available (in Spanish) from the Ministry of the Presidency.
