Cases of coronavirus (COVID-19) have been confirmed in Armenia.
The Government of Armenia declared a State of Emergency, initially from 16 March to 14 April. This has since been extended to 14 May.
On 24 March the Government of Armenia also announced a nationwide lockdown, limiting free movement in Armenia for an initial 7-day period in order to limit the spread of coronavirus (COVID-19). These measures have since been extended until further notice. Individuals and family groups are required to self-isolate and leave their accommodation only in exceptional circumstances. There are exceptions for grocery and pharmacy shopping and limited physical exercise activities. Individuals leaving their homes/accommodation are required to complete and carry a standardised form about their movement activity and carry their passport. Workers in specific sectors attending workplaces must also carry a signed authorisation form from their employer. These restrictions also apply to foreign nationals.
Entry and borders
The Armenian authorities have introduced severe restrictions on people entering the country. The majority of foreign nationals who have travelled from or via countries with outbreaks of COVID-19 within 14 days of travel will not be allowed to enter Armenia during this period. This ban on entry currently applies to UK citizens.
Travellers able to enter Armenia will be subject to health screening measures on arrival which may include self-isolation, quarantine or hospitalisation.
On 24 February the Armenian authorities announced that the Meghri border crossing with Iran would be closed and scheduled flights between Armenia and Iran would be suspended, other than for Armenian and Iranian citizens to be returned to their respective countries.
With effect from 14 March, the borders between Armenia and Georgia will be closed for the movement of people, other than for the return of the citizens of each country to their country of origin. This does not apply to the movement of goods.
Local measures
The Armenian authorities have also introduced a number of other emergency measures and restrictions, including a ban on public gatherings. You should follow the advice of local authorities.
Further information
If you need further information about entry requirements, contact the local immigration authorities or the nearest Armenian Embassy. You should also check with your airline or travel company for the latest information.
