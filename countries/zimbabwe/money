As of 24 June 2019, financial transactions are officially conducted in the local currency known as “Zimbabwe Dollars.” This includes Zimbabwean bond notes, bond coins and mobile money such as ECOCASH: currently, there is no new “Zimbabwe dollar” note. Prices and transactions will mainly be in Zimbabwean (RTGS) dollars but US dollars may be accepted in some businesses. You should check before making a transaction whether the price quoted is in Zimbabwean (RTGS) or US dollars as the symbol for both is $, and it is recommended to check exchange rates prior to any transaction. Zimbabwe is currently experiencing a severe shortage of cash. It’s not currently possible to make cash withdrawals with an international bank card. Credit and debit cards are increasingly being used for transactions.
Banks are experiencing challenges dispensing foreign currency cash including for international transfers from outside of Zimbabwe. There are some bureau de change which will accept and change foreign currency, particularly US dollars. The exchange rate is currently unpredictable.
You should check in advance what payment methods a restaurant, hotel or tour operator will accept.
It’s illegal to leave Zimbabwe with more than $2,000 (or equivalent) in cash. It’s illegal to exchange foreign currency anywhere other than at officially licensed dealers (eg banks or bureau de change). Carry small denomination notes as change is rarely available in smaller businesses.
