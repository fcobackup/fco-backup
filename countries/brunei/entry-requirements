The information on this page covers the most common types of travel and reflects the UK government’s understanding of the rules currently in place. Unless otherwise stated, this information is for travellers using a full ‘British Citizen’ passport.
The authorities in the country or territory you’re travelling to are responsible for setting and enforcing the rules for entry. If you’re unclear about any aspect of the entry requirements, or you need further reassurance, you’ll need to contact the embassy, high commission or consulate of the country or territory you’re travelling to.
You should also consider checking with your transport provider or travel company to make sure your passport and other travel documents meet their requirements.
Entry rules in response to coronavirus (COVID-19)
Entry to Brunei
Entry to Brunei is severely restricted. It is not yet clear which exceptional circumstances, if any, foreign nationals may be permitted to enter Brunei.
Brunei continues to enforce an exit travel ban, including for permanent residents, and expatriate workers (green identity card holders), and their dependents. Exceptions will be considered by the Prime Minister’s Office on a case-by-case basis, through email applications to travelapplication@jpm.gov.bn giving 14 days’ notice of the intention to travel, and setting out reasons why they need to leave the country. Full details are available on the Prime Minister’s Office website.
From 1 August, all foreigners entering or leaving Brunei via a land border will be required to pay $3 BND per person on exit and $3 BND on return or entry.
Quarantine requirements
If the Government of Brunei permits you entry, you will be required to go into quarantine on arrival at a government booked facility (usually a local hotel).
Testing/screening on arrival
On 16 April, the Minister of Health announced that all foreigners will have to pay $1,000 BND for a COVID-19 test upon arrival, and would need to cover the cost of their stay in a quarantine facility (14 days from the date of arrival). Quarantine charges can vary, depending on the quarantine facility you are placed in.
You should ensure that you have the means to pay for your COVID-19 test and the full 14-day quarantine period.
Immigration Control Posts at Brunei’s land borders are operating shortened hours from 6am to 8pm. There are health and temperature screening measures at borders. You should comply with any additional screening measures put in place by the local authorities.
Data collection
On arrival in Brunei, you will be encouraged to download the BruHealth app. Failure to use the app may result in you not being able to access a number of day-to-day facilities.
Regular entry requirements
Visas
British Citizen passport holders may enter Brunei for up to 90 days without a visa. If you have another type of British nationality, check with Brunei immigration authorities about visa requirements.
Make sure the entry stamp in your passport indicates the validity of your stay. There are strict penalties for overstaying.
If you’re staying longer than 90 days and/or visiting for non-tourist purposes, you will need to get a visa from the nearest Brunei diplomatic mission before you travel.
Passport validity  
Your passport should be valid for a minimum period of 6 months from the date of entry into Brunei. 
Dual nationality
Brunei doesn’t recognise dual nationality. You can be refused entry if you’re found to be holding two passports of different nationality. If you’re a dual national, it’s advisable to enter Brunei on the passport on which you exited your last country of departure. While in Brunei your nationality will be deemed to be that shown on the passport which you used to enter the country. This may affect the consular assistance that you receive in Brunei.
Yellow fever certificate requirements
Check whether you need a yellow fever certificate by visiting the National Travel Health Network and Centre’s TravelHealthPro website.
UK Emergency Travel Documents
UK Emergency travel documents are accepted for entry, airside transit and exit from Brunei. They should have at least 6 months validity. You’ll have to obtain an exit and entry visa from Brunei Immigration before you travel.
