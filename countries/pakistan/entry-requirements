The information on this page covers the most common types of travel and reflects the UK government’s understanding of the rules currently in place. Unless otherwise stated, this information is for travellers using a full ‘British Citizen’ passport.
The authorities in the country or territory you’re travelling to are responsible for setting and enforcing the rules for entry. If you’re unclear about any aspect of the entry requirements, or you need further reassurance, you’ll need to contact the embassy, high commission or consulate of the country or territory you’re travelling to.
Restrictions in response to coronavirus
Entry and travel restrictions
The Pakistani authorities have closed land borders with Afghanistan, India and Iran. Despite this, there are ongoing limited border openings for repatriation and trade. Those crossing into Pakistan may have to comply with coronavirus testing and quarantine measures. The FCO currently advises against travel to the most of the Afghanistan and Iran border areas. See Summary.
Screening and quarantine measures for international air arrivals
International air passengers travelling to Pakistan will be subject to thermal screening on arrival. The current Pakistan Civil Aviation Authority (CAA) guidelines require all passengers arriving in Pakistan to submit a health declaration form which will be made available on your flight or upon arrival at the airport. You will also be subject to thermal screening for high temperatures. If you do not have any COVID-19 symptoms you will be allowed to proceed through the airport and will be given instructions to self-isolate at your residence for 14 days.
If you do have symptoms of COVID-19 including fever, cough, breathing difficulty, you may be taken to a facility for a swab test, where you will be asked to wait for the results of the test. If the test is positive, you will receive advice about next steps including possible self-isolation for 14 days at your residence or transfer to a hospital. If the test is negative you will be allowed to go to your residence with instructions to self-isolate for 14 days.
Please call the British High Commission on 051 201 2000 in the event that you are moved to a testing facility. Before travelling, make sure you have a form of payment for food and water during this quarantine and testing period.
You may also be required to follow special measures before boarding flights to Pakistan and while on board the aircraft, including the wearing of a face mask. Reinforcement of screening and administrative measures at all sea ports has been announced.
