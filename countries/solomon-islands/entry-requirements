With effect from 3 February, the Solomon Islands Government has introduced new travel restrictions in response to the coronavirus outbreak. This includes that any person who has travelled from China or transited through China at any time during the 14 days immediately before the day on which the person arrives in Solomon Islands will not be permitted to enter Solomon Islands.
Further, travellers originating from affected countries and regions travelling through Papua New Guinea, Fiji, Kiribati, Vanuatu and Nauru will not be permitted to enter Solomon Islands, unless travellers are able to provide evidence that they have not travelled from or transited through any affected country at any time during the 14 days immediately before the day on which they arrive in the Solomon Islands. Flights from Brisbane to Honiara will be subject to close monitoring and strict clearance by the relevant authorities at Honiara international airports. Given the fast moving situation, you are advised to familiarise yourself with controls in place and to check with your airline before you travel.
