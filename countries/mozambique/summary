On 5 to 6 October 2017, there were prolonged armed clashes with police in the town of Mocímboa da Praia (between Palma and Pemba) in Cabo Delgado province. Since the first clash, there have been smaller clashes and attacks in the neighbouring districts. At the end of May 2018, villagers were reported killed in the area of Olumbi in the district of Palma. There are reports of an increased security presence in the region, including road blocks. You should check local and social media for updates before you travel to the area and follow the advice of the local authorities.
Some tensions remain in Zambezia, Sofala, Manica and Tete provinces, mainly between the opposition party’s militia and state security forces. There were sporadic attacks in these provinces for much of 2016. A truce was declared on 27 December 2016.
In 2016 there were armed attacks on vehicles on main roads in Manica, Sofala, Tete and Zambezia provinces. Police convoys were in operation but have now stopped.
Traffic accidents are common due to the condition of the roads, poor driving and vehicle standards. Always drive carefully and be aware of pedestrians using the roads.
