Be prepared for your plans to change

Plan ahead and make sure you:
can access money
understand what your insurance will cover
can make arrangements to extend your stay and be away for longer than planned
If you test positive for COVID-19 in Angola, you and everyone living with you in your household must self-isolate in private accommodation or in a hotel, for 7 days. You can exit quarantine if you test negative after 7 days.
The Angolan authorities may occasionally conduct wellbeing checks during the period of quarantine, to ensure self-isolation compliance. You are not permitted to leave your accommodation during self-isolation. Food and household essentials can be ordered online and will be delivered to your hotel room or private accommodation.
