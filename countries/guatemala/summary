On 12 April 2020, the Guatemalan Government announced new restrictions to prevent the spread of coronavirus (COVID-19). People are now required to comply with social distancing of at least 1.5 metres and to use masks in all public spaces. This includes walking in the streets. People that have recuperated from COVID-19 and those under quarantine must use masks inside their houses. Those not complying with these measures could face fines, and may potentially face civil and criminal charges. Fines range from £700 to £15,000. These measures will be in place until further notice. All previous restrictions remain in place.
The Government of Guatemala announced that from 4am on 20 April 2020 to 27 April 2020, the curfew hours would change, starting at 6pm and ending at 4am each day.
On 19 April 2020, local authorities announced that restrictions on movement around the country will continue, meaning that people cannot move between departments. However, this will only be applicable to people from the departments of Guatemala City, Chimaltenango, Sacatepequez and El Progreso. These measures will be in place from 20 April to 4am on 27 April 2020. These measures aim to ease overcrowding in popular tourist spots, thereby preventing the spread of coronavirus. The existing curfew and other restrictions remain in place.
