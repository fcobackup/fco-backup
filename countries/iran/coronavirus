Be prepared for your plans to change
No travel is risk-free during COVID-19. Countries may further restrict travel or bring in new rules at short notice, for example due to a new COVID-19 variant. Check with your travel company or airline for any transport changes which may delay your journey home.
If you test positive for COVID-19, you may need to stay where you are until you test negative. You may also need to seek treatment there.
Plan ahead and make sure you:
can access money
understand what your insurance will cover
can make arrangements to extend your stay and be away for longer than planned
Healthcare in Iran
In 2022 there were reports of shortages of some basic medicines in Iran. If you are a British national residing in Iran and undertaking medical or cosmetic treatment, you may not receive adequate care in the case of emergency.
If you think you have COVID-19 symptoms, you are advised to take a test and to self-isolate at home until you receive the results. If the symptoms are not serious, you should continue to self-isolate at home but if the symptoms persist and/or worsen then you are advised to go to a hospital for treatment. If you are a mono-British national, you should contact your travel insurance provider for advice; if you test positive for COVID-19, you will be referred to a specialist Coronavirus hospital or unit.
