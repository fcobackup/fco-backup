Travel in Hungary
Everyone should comply with the measures put in place in Hungary to limit the spread of COVID-19.
Curfews are no longer in place. Shops and service providers are able now open as normal. The Government is asking that people maintain a distance of one and a half meters in the shopping malls and face masks are mandatory. (Be aware, individual store policies may vary).
People who have received their first vaccine dose are issued with an Immunity Certification from the Government.
The terraces and gardens of restaurants are open for everyone. Mask ¬wearing for guests is not mandatory. Indoor areas of restaurants are only open to Immunity Certificate holders and their children under 18. Use of indoor toilet facilities within a restaurant by those with no Immunity Certificate is permitted whilst wearing a mask.
Only Immunity Certificate holding adults may visit leisure facilities (including zoos, museums, theatres, cinemas, gyms and indoor swimming pools). 16 to 18-year-olds can go to cinemas and theatres without adults if they have Immunity Certificates. Mask wearing is not mandatory. Adult Immunity Certificate holders and their under 18 children can also attend sport and cultural events, where they are not required to wear a mask. Clubs and music venues can only be visited by people with Immunity Certificates. Group outdoor exercises are allowed. Hotels are open to Immunity Certificate holders, their under 18 children and to business travellers. Open air events up to 500 people may be held. Family and private gatherings are allowed up to 50 people. Weddings may take place with up to 200 people. Previous limits on the number of people attending funerals are no longer in effect. It is mandatory to wear a face mask on public transport and taxis, in shops, health and social care institutions, and public offices (i. e. places where Immunity Certificates are not required). However, it is no longer mandatory to wear face masks at train and bus stations and stops. Compliance with the rules is monitored and violators can face a fine.
Visits to hospitals and social care facilities are allowed. However, a patient may only be visited by one person a day, for a maximum of 60 minutes, and the visitor must have an Immunity Certificate.

COVID-19 vaccines if you live in Hungary
Wherever possible British nationals should aim to be vaccinated in the country where they live. As further information is available about the national vaccination programme, this page will be updated. Sign up to get email notifications.
The Hungarian authorities have asked people to register their interest in receiving a vaccine on the https://vakcinainfo.gov.hu website. Once registered, the authorities will invite people for vaccination based on the order of priority determined by the national vaccination programme. You may check if your registration for the vaccine has been successful on the https://vakcinareg.neak.gov.hu/regisztracio/ website.
Those who have tested positive for coronavirus over the past 3 months can now also receive their first dose.
Vaccinated persons and those who have previously contracted the COVID-19 virus are eligible for a Hungarian Immunity Certificate.
If you have not received your certificate you should ask the doctor who arranged your vaccine to see if your details are correctly entered in the Hungarian Electronic Health Service System (EESZT) as a foreigner, along with an ID number issued by your government. You can also check on the status of your certificate with your local government office (Kormanyablak) either in person or online (Hungarian Government Services System (Ügyfélkapu) account required), however they can only assist if your details are correctly entered in the EESZT database.
The Hungarian authorities have confirmed that all people resident in Hungary are eligible for vaccination, even those unable to register for a TAJ number.
The Medicines and Healthcare Products Regulatory Agency (MHRA) is the UK authority responsible for assessing the safety, quality and efficacy of vaccines. It has authorised the Pfizer/BioNTech, Oxford/AstraZeneca and Moderna vaccines for temporary supply and use in the UK. Find out more about MHRA approval for these vaccines.
British nationals living overseas should seek medical advice from their local healthcare provider in the country where they reside. Information about vaccines used in other national programmes, including regulatory status, should be available from the local authorities. This list of Stringent Regulatory Authorities recognised by the World Health Organisation may also be a useful source of additional information. Find out more about COVID-19 vaccines on the World Health Organisation COVID-19 vaccines page.
