The information on this page covers the most common types of travel and reflects the UK government’s understanding of the rules currently in place. Unless otherwise stated, this information is for travellers using a full ‘British Citizen’ passport.
The authorities in the country or territory to which you’re travelling are responsible for setting and enforcing the rules for entry. If you’re unsure about any aspect of the entry requirements, or you need further reassurance, you should contact the embassy, high commission or consulate of the country or territory to which you’re travelling.
You should also consider checking with your transport provider or travel company to make sure your passport and other travel documents meet their requirements.
Travel restrictions
All air-travellers arriving on direct flights from countries deemed to be high-risk due to the coronavirus outbreak, including from France, will be required to spend 14 days in quarantine or self-isolation on arrival in Madagascar. This is in addition to existing measures that deny entry to travellers that have been in China, Italy, South Korea and Iran within the 14 days prior to arriving in Madagascar.
Direct flights between Madagascar and France, as well as direct flights with the French départements of Réunion and Mayotte, will be suspended from 20 March. From then all air-travellers on indirect flights but originating from high-risk countries will be denied entry to Madagascar. We believe this will include the UK and are seeking clarification.
From 15 March all international flights, regardless of origin, have to land at Ivato airport in the capital, Antananarivo, and are no longer allowed to fly direct to regional Malagasy airports.
You should check Travel Advice (South Africa, Ethiopia, Mauritius and Kenya) for information regarding flights from Madagascar to local hubs such as Johannesburg, Addis Ababa, Mauritius and Nairobi.
Cruise ships will not be permitted to berth in Madagascar’s ports for 30 days from 15 March.
Visas
You can buy a 30, 60 or 90-day tourist visa on arrival at the airport in cash using US$, Euros, or Malagasy Ariary.
Alternatively, you can apply for an e-visa on the official Malagasy e-visa website before you travel.
You will be asked for evidence of onward or return travel at check-in and on arrival in Madagascar.
Make sure an entry stamp is recorded in your passport, and that your visa is valid for the period and purpose of your journey. A tourist visa cannot be extended beyond 90 days. Overstaying may lead to detention and deportation.
Passport validity
Your passport must have at least 6 months’ validity remaining on your date of entry into Madagascar. You should have at least 2 blank pages in your passport on arrival.
Airport security fee
Airport security tax has been imposed since 1 March 2014. This tax is normally included in the ticket fare.
UK Emergency Travel Documents
UK Emergency Travel Documents are accepted for entry, airside transit and exit from Madagascar.
Travelling with children
Children already in possession of a visa don’t need further parental approval to enter Madagascar. A parent leaving Madagascar alone with a child must carry written authorisation from the absent parent.
