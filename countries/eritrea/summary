Cases of coronavirus (COVID-19) have been confirmed in Eritrea. See information on measures introduced in Eritrea to limit the spread of the virus. Find out how to return to the UK from Eritrea.

The Foreign and Commonwealth Office (FCO) is advising British nationals against all non-essential international travel at this time. Existing advice for Eritrea remains in place:
The FCO advise against all travel to:
within 25km of Eritrea’s land borders, with the exceptions of: the towns of Senafe and Tessenei; the border crossings at Debay Sima – Burre, Serha – Zalambessa and Kesadika (Adi Kuala) – Rama, plus the main paved roads leading to those crossings (as displayed on the map). All border crossings between Ethiopia and Eritrea are currently closed. See Local travel
Cases of coronavirus (COVID-19) have been confirmed in Eritrea. The Eritrean authorities have introduced a number of measures to limit the spread of the virus, including closure of Asmara International Airport for a minimum of two weeks from 25 March. See Coronavirus
Given the rapidly changing situation in Eritrea we are temporarily withdrawing dependents of UK staff from our Embassy. The Embassy will continue to carry out essential work including providing 24/7 consular assistance and support to British nationals in Eritrea.
All foreign nationals, including diplomats, must apply in advance for a travel permit to leave the Asmara region. See Travel permits and Consular assistance
The Eritrean authorities consider all British nationals holding either Eritrean or PFDJ identity documents (including out of date documents) as Eritrean nationals.
Consular support is severely limited in parts of Eritrea. Constraints on travel within Eritrea means the British Embassy in Asmara is unable to offer consular assistance to British nationals outside the greater Asmara area. The British Embassy is unable to offer consular assistance to dual nationals in Eritrea. See Dual nationals.
Although there’s no recent history of terrorism in Eritrea, attacks can’t be ruled out. See Terrorism
There may be some shortages of drinking in more remote areas of Eritrea due to the closure by the Eritrean Government of many of the water purification and bottling plants, but imported water from Ethiopia and Sudan is available.
If you’re abroad and you need emergency help from the UK government, contact the nearest British embassy, consulate or high commission.
Take out comprehensive travel and medical insurance before you travel.
