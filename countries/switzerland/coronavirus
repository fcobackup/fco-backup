Travel in Switzerland
Switzerland has put measures in place to limit the spread of COVID-19.
You should follow the rules on hygiene and social distancing. These include:
Washing your hands regularly and thoroughly
Keeping a distance of at least 1.5 metres from other people
If it is not possible to maintain that distance, wear a face mask.
Wearing a face mask is compulsory when travelling on public transport, on platforms and in waiting areas, as well as at airports. Failure to do so is punishable by a fine. Children under the age of 12 are exempt from this requirement, as are individuals who are unable to wear a mask for medical reasons.
Cantons have imposed further restrictions, and you should check cantonal websites for further details.
Public spaces and services
Wearing face masks in enclosed public spaces is compulsory.
Switzerland has relaxed some coronavirus restrictions. Groups of up to 15 people are able to gather outdoors, shops selling non-essential goods have reopened, sports and cultural activities are able to take place outdoors. Outdoor terraces of restaurants and bars have reopened.
From Monday 31 May, further relaxations will come in to effect. Private gatherings of up to 50 people outdoors and up to 30 people indoors will be permitted. Indoor restaurant service will resume, with no more than four people per table. Public events of up to 100 people indoors and up to 300 people outdoors will be able to take place. Thermal baths and spa facilities will reopen.
