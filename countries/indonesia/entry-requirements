This advice reflects the UK government’s understanding of current rules for people travelling on a full ‘British citizen’ passport from the UK, for the most common types of travel.
The authorities in Indonesia set and enforce entry rules. If you’re not sure how these requirements apply to you, contact Indonesia’s embassy in the UK.
Death from COVID-19 in Indonesia
If COVID-19 is given as cause of death and you would like to arrange a local cremation and repatriation of ashes, you will need to make contact with a local undertaker within 4 hours of the death registration to give your instructions. If you do not do this, it is likely that a local burial will take place.
You will also require a letter of no objection from the Embassy. This will be issued on the next working day.
Passport validity requirements
Make sure your passport is valid for at least 6 months from your date of entry into Indonesia.
Check with your travel provider or the nearest Indonesian Embassy or Consulate to make sure your passport and other travel documents meet the requirements.
Dual nationality
Indonesian law does not allow dual nationality for those aged 18 and older. If you are a British national who has retained Indonesian nationality, you could have difficulties with immigration in Indonesia. You might have to renounce your nationality or hand in your Indonesian passport.
Visa requirements
E-visas
You can apply for an e-visa before arrival on the Indonesian immigration website.
Visas on arrival
British nationals who visit Indonesia for the following reasons can also apply for a visa on arrival at a cost of 500,000 Indonesian rupiah:
tourism
official visit or government duties
business or official meeting
procurement of goods
transit
The visa is valid for 30 days. It can be extended once (for a maximum of 30 days) by making an application to an immigration office within Indonesia. Make sure you extend your visa within the initial 30 days to avoid an overstay fine of 1 million rupiah a day.
KITAS extension (stay or work permit)
KITAS holders with expiring stay permit but currently outside Indonesia can apply for an extension through a sponsor. The sponsor must submit the application to the immigration office attaching a copy of the passport and proof of leaving Indonesia. The application is submitted without biometric sampling. The sponsor must report the foreigner’s arrival within 30 days.
Visa scams
Beware of visa scams by fake visa agents who, having taken your money, may fail to provide a visa or supply the wrong visa. This could result in your overstaying and a fine of 1 million Indonesia rupiah per day, detention, deportation and possible re-entry ban. Use the Indonesian Immigration self-service portal.
Visa scams are increasing in Indonesia. Some travellers have lost significant amounts of money. Others have been deported despite paying large fees to an agent to get the correct visa or extension.
If you choose to use to use an agent check they are reputable.
Overstaying your visa
Visitors who overstay without the proper permissions can be held in detention or refused permission to leave the country until a fine of 1 million Indonesian rupiah per day is paid.
If you have overstayed your visa for less than 60 days, you must pay your fine at the airport. After 60 days, you will be detained until the fine is paid.
Proof of onward travel
Immigration officials in Indonesia may ask you for proof of onward travel (such as a return or onward air ticket). Make all reservations before leaving for Indonesia. Some airlines have refused to board passengers without evidence of onward travel.
Airport tax
Airport tax is included in the cost of all domestic flights within Indonesia. For some international flights departing Indonesia, airport tax might not be included in the price of the ticket. Check with your airline or travel agent before you travel.
Vaccination requirements (other than COVID-19)
At least 8 weeks before your trip, check the vaccinations and vaccination certificates you may need on TravelHealthPro.
Depending on your circumstances, these may include:
polio
yellow fever
Zika virus
Accommodation
Registering
If you stay in private accommodation in Indonesia (not a hotel) you must register your presence with the local police at the nearest police station. You could be fined 5 million Indonesia rupiah if you do not register. If you stay in a hotel you will be registered automatically.
