Demonstrations
Demonstrations and strike action often take place in transport hubs and cities, and around the Schuman area in Brussels. While the vast majority of demonstrations are peaceful, there is a risk of isolated incidents of unrest or violence. There have also been violent incidents following major sporting fixtures. If you’re in and around areas where demonstrations or large gatherings are taking place, remain vigilant and move away quickly if there are signs of disorder.
Demonstrations in the Schuman area of Brussels can affect access to the British Embassy and the British Consulate General.
Strike action can cause travel disruption across the country. International travel can also be affected. For regular updates on any disruption, you should check local news and follow advice given by your travel provider.
Information can be found on the Belgian Railways website (train and metro travel), the Brussels, Walloon and Flemish regional public transport websites, and the HERE map website (road travel). For international travel, refer to the Brussels Airport Zaventem, Charleroi Airport, and Antwerp Airport websites.
Crime
Petty crime rates are similar to the UK, but on the increase. You should take sensible precautions to protect yourself and your belongings.
In the event of theft, contact the nearest police station and get a police report. If you lose your passport, you can also contact the British Embassy in Brussels. If you have difficulty reporting the theft of your cards to your UK card issuer, you can ask the Belgian group ‘Card Stop’ (telephone: +32 (0) 70 344 344) to send a fax to your UK card company to block your card. Alternatively, if you have Belgian issued bank/credit cards, Card Stop will be able to block them.
Be vigilant and take extra care in major railway stations, and on public transport, particularly late at night. Thieves and muggers operate in busy areas, particularly around the Brussels Gare du Midi/Zuidstation (Eurostar terminal), Gare du Nord and Schuman (the EU quarter). Pickpockets also operate on international trains, mainly Paris-Brussels and Amsterdam-Brussels.
Incidents of violent crime among organised criminal gangs involved in drug trafficking have increased recently, particularly in Antwerp. The risk primarily concerns those involved in drug crime, but you should be vigilant if you suspect illegal activity is underway.
Never leave luggage unattended. There have been reports of luggage being stolen from the racks at the end of carriages in high-speed trains (TGV and Thalys), usually just before the doors close.
If you travel by taxi, use official, licensed taxis or a pre-booked minicab. We recommend that youdo not use taxis that you have not specifically hailed. Overcharging by taxi drivers has been known to occur. We recommend that you use official, licenced taxis.
It is increasingly common for thieves, usually on motorbikes, to break a window and snatch valuables from the front or back passenger seat when the vehicle is stationary at traffic lights. If you see anything suspicious you can report it to local police authorities.
Regional travel
When visiting former WW1 battlefields in North West Belgium, stay on the footpath and exercise caution if you see anything that looks like shells or munitions. Unexploded shells have recently been uncovered. Move away from the site and call the police emergency number 112 to report any incidents.
Road travel
Traffic is fast and Belgium’s accident rate is high mainly due to speeding. In 2021, there were 516 road deaths and 34,640 road accidents in Belgium (as reported by the Belgian Government).

Low emission zones

Driving regulations
Speed traps, cameras and unmarked vehicles are in operation throughout the country.
Driving regulations differ from those in the UK:
Drivers must give absolute priority to vehicles joining a road from the right, even if they have stopped at a road junction or stopped for pedestrians or cyclists. Exemptions to this rule include motorways, roundabouts, roads sign-posted with an orange diamond within a white background, and drivers who are attempting to join a road after having driven down a street in the wrong direction. Trams have priority over other traffic. If a tram or bus stops in the middle of the road to allow passengers on or off, you must stop.
There is a speed restriction of 20km/h in residential areas and 30 km/h in school areas, which is operational 24 hours (even when schools are closed), unless indicated otherwise. The start and finish of these zones are not always clearly marked.
Fines have increased and are ranked from 1 to 4 depending on the severity of the offence (1 being the lowest severity and 4 being the highest). Exceeding the speed limit by 30km/h or 40km/h always leads to a court case, a potential fine of up to €4,000, and a possible prison sentence If you are unable to pay an on the spot fine, your vehicle may be impounded.
Using a mobile phone while driving is illegal; the use of ‘hands free’ equipment is allowed.
Drink driving is taken very seriously and frequent alcohol checks are made. Less than 0.05% alcohol in the bloodstream is allowed, measured in Belgium as 0.5 promilles of alcohol. This is a lower level than in the UK. A blood sample will be taken if you refuse to be breathalysed. Fines are heavy, depending on the degree of intoxication, and range from €200 to €16,000. In certain cases, driving licences have been confiscated immediately.
See the European Commission, AA and RAC guides on driving in Belgium.
