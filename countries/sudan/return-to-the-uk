UK special flight
The UK Government is facilitating a special flight from Khartoum to the UK departing on 21 May.
Seats cost Â£600 per person. All passengers must pay for their tickets.
Eligibility
This flight is for:
British nationals, normally resident in the UK
dependants and travelling with a British national
Vulnerable British nationals will be prioritised.
Vulnerable non-British UK residents with Indefinite Leave to Remain, and other foreign nationals, may be accommodated if there is sufficient capacity. Your eligibility, including your UK address, will be checked before your tickets are issued.
How to book
CTM are working on behalf of the Foreign and Commonwealth Office (FCO) to manage special flight bookings.
If you wish to travel, you must book tickets on the CTM website.
To book a seat for the flight on the CTM website, you will need:
full passport and contact details for each traveller you are registering
your UK home address and postcode
your means of payment, such as credit or debit card details
Please note that payment does not guarantee you a place on a flight. You will receive a refund if you are not given a seat on the flight.
The CTM booking website is only available to British nationals. If you have difficulty registering or making payment online, you are a vulnerable non-British UK resident with Indefinite Leave to Remain, or another foreign national, you will need to contact the CTM team. To do so, send an SMS text message containing only your full name to +44(0)753 745 3866. A member of the CTM team will then be in touch. Some international phone charges may apply.

Financial support for the UK special flight
If you have exhausted all other options available to you for getting funds, you may be eligible to apply for an emergency loan from the government to cover the cost of the ticket. You would need to repay the loan when you are back in the UK.
Our partner CTM is also authorised to administer such loans on behalf of the FCO and details will be available when you are asked to pay.
Tickets will not be on sale at the airport. Do not travel to the airport without a confirmed ticket.
Booking confirmation and travel to the airport
After your booking is confirmed CTM will send you an email with all the details you need including what time to be at the airport.
You should print and take your confirmed itinerary from CTM with you to the airport. A copy on a smart phone or similar is also sufficient.
You are responsible for your travel to the airport. The timing of the flight is planned to allow travel to the airport during the morning. The Embassy will issue a standard letter the day before the flight which can be shown if you are stopped at checkpoints. The letter will provide confirmation of your seat on the flight and requests the authorities to allow you to travel to the airport. Further details will be provided once your booking is confirmed.
You will be notified if you have not been allocated a seat, and will need to request a refund from CTM, which you should receive within 14 days.
