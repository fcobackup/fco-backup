The information on this page covers the most common types of travel and reflects the UK government’s understanding of the rules currently in place. Unless otherwise stated, this information is for travellers using a full ‘British Citizen’ passport.
The authorities in the country or territory you’re travelling to are responsible for setting and enforcing the rules for entry. If you’re unclear about any aspect of the entry requirements, or you need further reassurance, you’ll need to contact the embassy, high commission or consulate of the country or territory you’re travelling to.
You should also consider checking with your transport provider or travel company to make sure your passport and other travel documents meet their requirements.
We recommend you have a valid travel insurance policy as you may be asked to provide evidence of this by your airline at check-in or by the immigration authorities upon arrival in Georgia. You may face difficulties if you cannot provide evidence of valid travel insurance.
Visas
Georgian visa rules changed with effect from June 2015. British nationals don’t need a visa to enter Georgia. You can visit for up to a year, visa-free. Contact the Embassy of Georgia in London or visit the Georgian Ministry of Foreign Affairs website for more details on entry requirements and how the new rules might affect you.
If you wish to stay for longer than 1 year, you’ll need to apply for a long term visa. If you’re living in Georgia you should contact the Justice House or Ministry of Foreign Affairs of Georgia for advice.
Passport validity
Your passport should be valid for the proposed duration of your stay. No additional period of validity beyond this is required.
Travelling with medicines
Georgia has a very strict anti-drugs policy, which can also cover prescription and non-prescription drugs or medicines, otherwise available in Europe. This can cause serious problems for travellers and in some cases lead to administrative and criminal proceedings.
You should carry a doctor’s prescription if you intend to travel with prescription medicine and declare the items on arrival, by filling in a customs declaration form. You can also check Georgia’s medication importation regulations on the Ministry of Health website.
UK Emergency Travel Documents
UK Emergency Travel Documents are accepted for entry, airside transit and exit from Georgia.
Travelling with children
If you’re travelling with a child other than your own, you must be able to be able to demonstrate that you have the consent of the child’s parents or guardians.
