Be prepared for your plans to change
No travel is risk-free during COVID. Countries may further restrict travel or bring in new rules at short notice, for example due to a new COVID-19 variant. Check with your travel company or airline for any transport changes which may delay your journey home.
If you test positive for COVID-19, you may need to stay where you are until you test negative. You may also need to seek treatment there.
Plan ahead and make sure you:
can access money
understand what your insurance will cover
can make arrangements to extend your stay and be away for longer than planned
Travel in El Salvador
Most businesses and services are operating. However some COVID-19 restrictions and other measures remain in force.
Anyone leaving their accommodation must wear a face covering. Other measures could be introduced with little or no notice. You should familiarise yourself with any local measures or restrictions, and comply with these and any other emergency measures.
Accommodation
Please check that your planned accommodation is available and whether any COVID-19 restrictions are being applied before travelling.
Public spaces and services
Most businesses and services are open; entry controls, temperature checks, social distancing measures and limits on customer numbers are common. Schools, universities and some museums are subject to restrictions, and some forms of larger gatherings are discouraged.
Proof of a negative COVID-19 test, or evidence that you are fully vaccinated and have received two doses of the COVID-19 vaccine (or one dose if vaccinated with the Johnson & Johnson vaccine) is required for entry to public sports events and may be required for other public events.
Health
British-issued prescriptions cannot be used locally. To find a pharmacy (“farmacia”) look for one of the big national chains such as Farmacia San Nicolas, Farmacias UNO or Farmacias Economicas, among others; a quick search online should help you to identify the nearest open one. For contact details for English speaking doctors visit our list of healthcare providers.
Your emotional and mental wellbeing is important. Read guidance on how to look after your mental wellbeing and mental health.
