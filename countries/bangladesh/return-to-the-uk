If you’re in Bangladesh and wish to leave, you should make arrangements as soon as possible.
For the time being, Biman Airlines are flying to London and Manchester. The British High Commission understands that flights to Hong Kong, China and Thailand will continue (although Thai authorities require a medical certificate to enter or transit through Thailand).
If you’re travelling via a third country, check the latest travel advice for each country.
Bangladesh authorities have also suspended train services to and from India until further notice.
