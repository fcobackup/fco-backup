Earthquakes
Western Slovenia is on an earthquake fault line and is subject to occasional tremors. You can find information about preparedness on the website of Sloveniaâ€™s Administration for Civil Protection and Disaster Relief.
Forest fires
There is an increased risk of forest fires. Take care when visiting or driving through woodland and forest areas. Make sure cigarette ends are properly extinguished, do not light barbecues outside of designated areas and do not leave any rubbish, particularly empty bottles behind, as these are known to start fires.
