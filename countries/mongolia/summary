Before you travel, check the ‘Entry requirements’ section for Mongolia’s current entry restrictions and requirements. These may change with little warning. Monitor this advice for the latest updates and stay in contact with your travel provider.
If you plan to pass through another country to return to the UK, check the travel advice for the country you’re transiting.
Restrictions around Sukhbaatar Square in central Ulaanbaatar in response to demonstrations on 5 December have been lifted. You should avoid any demonstrations and follow the advice of local authorities.
It is more important than ever to get travel insurance and check it provides sufficient cover. See the FCDO guidance on foreign travel insurance.
Flights are now leaving Mongolia on a more regular basis. See Return to the UK.
Around 6,500 British nationals visit Mongolia annually. Most visits are trouble-free.
Mongolia takes border security very seriously and foreign nationals aren’t routinely permitted access to border areas. The authorities can regard zones of up to 100km inside the border as a border area. If you wish to travel in these areas, you must get permission from the State Frontier Guard Authority. Only a few specified land border crossings are open to foreigners. See Border crossings
Although there’s no recent history of terrorism in Mongolia, attacks cannot be ruled out. See Terrorism
Avoid going out on foot alone at night. Foreigners stand out and can be targeted for attack because of their comparative wealth. See Crime.
If you’re abroad and you need emergency help from the UK government, contact the nearest British embassy, consulate or high commission.
