Credit cards are accepted at most major establishments. However, a number of shops and restaurants will only accept cash and will not have a credit card facility.
ATMs are available. Payment apps such as Pocket are becoming more popular and can be linked to an international credit card. Travellersâ€™ cheques can be cashed at banks or major hotels. Singapore dollars may be used in Brunei and are of the same value as the Brunei Dollar (Brunei dollars can also be used in Singapore although retailers may not be keen to accept them). Most other major currencies are convertible at banks, hotels or official moneychangers.
