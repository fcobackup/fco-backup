Honduras is particularly susceptible to hurricanes, flooding and earthquakes. Drought and forest fires are also common.
Hurricanes
The hurricane season in Honduras normally runs from June to November. Roads throughout the country can be affected by landslides and flooding. You should monitor weather updates from the National Hurricane Centre. For information in Spanish, see the Honduran national civil protection website (COPECO). See our Tropical Cyclones page for advice about what to do if you’re caught up in a storm.
Earthquakes
Make sure you know what action to take if an earthquake occurs. Read the hotel earthquake instructions. The US Federal Emergency Management Agency website has advice about what to do before, during and after an earthquake or tsunami.
