There are currently no commercial options available to return to the UK from Serbia. This is due to the Serbian Government closing all airports in Serbia to international passenger flights until further notice. All border crossings for road, rail and river transport are closed except for freight traffic.
We know this is concerning for British people trying to leave Serbia. The UK government is working closely with airlines, the Serbian authorities and other governments to make sure options are available to return to the UK as soon as possible.
What to do
If you cannot leave Serbia at this time, you should:
follow the advice of local authorities, including local measures to help minimise your risk of exposure to coronavirus
find accommodation that’s suitable for your needs
keep in regular contact with family and friends at home, so they know you are safe and well
Future travel options
The UK government is working closely with airlines, the Serbian authorities and other governments to make sure options are available to return to the UK as soon as possible.
