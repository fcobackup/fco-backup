Coronavirus travel health
Check the latest information on risk from COVID-19 for mainland Portugal, Madeira and the Azores on the TravelHealthPro website.
See the TravelHealthPro website for further advice on travel abroad and reducing spread of respiratory viruses during the COVID-19 pandemic.
Entry and borders
Mainland Portugal has introduced quarantine for travellers from the UK who are not fully vaccinated. See Entry requirements to find out what you will need to do when you enter Portugal.
Returning to the UK
When you return, you must follow the rules for entering the UK.
You are responsible for organising your own COVID-19 test, in line with UK government testing requirements. Check when you book that the testing service can provide the appropriate COVID-19 test. You will not need a prescription, but you will have to show your passport and confirmed travel bookings.
In Portugal, tests have to be booked in advance and paid for in full. It can take up to 24 hours for the results to be returned.
You can schedule a test at any private testing clinic in Portugal. Find one near you from this list of approved facilities.
If you are staying in the Algarve, look out for information on testing facilities at the airport on arrival, or find a testing clinic near you on the Algarve tourist authority’s website. Your hotel may also be able to help you arrange a test in time for your departure.
If you are travelling to Madeira, you can book your return COVID-19 test after you have uploaded your RT-PCR test for arrival on the Madeira Traveller Registration platform. This test is free of charge and carried out at the hospital in Funchal and health centre in Porto Santo. Alternatively, schedule your own COVID-19 test at one of the clinics listed on the Madeira Tourist Authority website.
If you are travelling to the Azores, book your return COVID-19 test at a private testing centre on the island where you are staying. Ask your hotel or local tourist office for help in finding the centre closest to you.
Be prepared for your plans to change
No travel is risk-free during COVID. Countries may further restrict travel or bring in new rules at short notice, for example due to a new COVID-19 variant. Check with your travel company or airline for any transport changes which may delay your journey home.
If you test positive for COVID-19, you will have to self-isolate for 10 days. If you continue to test positive, you may not be able to get a fitness-to-fly certificate. You may also need to seek treatment.
Plan ahead and make sure you:
can access money
understand what your insurance will cover
can make arrangements to extend your stay and be away for longer than planned
Travel in Portugal
Measures are in place throughout Portugal to control the spread of the virus. You are required to observe the rules on social distancing when in public:
Keep a social distance of 2 metres
Use a face covering in enclosed spaces, and outdoors where a distance of 2m cannot be maintained
Wash your hands regularly
Your temperature can be taken on access to enclosed spaces, as determined by the health authorities.
Public spaces and services
Mainland Portugal
The Portuguese government has introduced a new 3-phased plan to lift restrictions in line with vaccination rates. The first phase came into force on 1 August and included:
an end to curfew
a return to normal trading hours for shops and other commercial premises
longer opening hours for restaurants and cafés – last orders are at 1am, closing time is at 2am
an increase in the number of people who may eat together in a restaurant - 6 indoors and 10 outdoors
the reopening of bars and similar premises, subject to rules on capacity and trading hours – last orders are at 1am, closing time is at 2am – and providing no dancing or other entertainment takes place.
the return of open air training events and sporting activities, as well as outdoor and indoor exercise
Drinking alcohol outdoors in public is only allowed while seated in restaurants and cafés. Nightclubs remain closed for the purpose of dancing. Taxis can only carry passengers in the rear and may limit capacity to 2. Do not use the front seat.
Use of EU digital COVID certificates and negative test results
The Portuguese government has expanded the use of EU digital COVID certificates and negative test results to access services and activities, including:
to eat inside restaurants on public holidays and weekends from 7pm on Fridays
to use gyms and spas
to enter casinos and bingo halls
to attend cultural, sporting, corporate and family events
To check into a hotel and other tourist accommodation, an EU digital COVID certificate or NHS vaccination certificate is required. Check FAQ 4 on the Portuguese government’s website (in Portuguese).
The EU digital COVID certificate includes the vaccination certificate, recovery certificate and negative test certificate.
If you do not have an EU digital COVID certificate, you may show a negative COVID test result, obtained by one of the following means:
Certified PCR test taken within the previous 72 hours
Certified antigen test taken within the previous 48 hours
Rapid antigen self-test done within the previous 24 hours and certified by a health or pharmaceutical professional
Rapid antigen self-test, verified by the management on entry to your accommodation, restaurant or event venue
This requirement does not apply to children under the age of 12 (i.e. up to and including 11), provided they are accompanied by an adult.
You can be fined if you breach these regulations.
Check the rules for using the EU digital COVID certificate on the Portuguese government’s website (in Portuguese).
Check the 3-phased plan on the Portuguese government’s website (in Portuguese)
Using the beach
At the beach, follow the one-way entry and exit signs and use a mask until you reach your spot on the sand. Use a mask and footwear while using sanitary facilities. Place your sunshade and towel 3m from the next group and keep a social distance of 1.5m when walking along the sand. Before you set off, check the occupancy levels of the beaches near you and avoid the ones that are marked “red” and “amber”.
You can be fined up to €100 if you breach the regulations.
Madeira and Porto Santo
Measures are in place to limit the spread of the virus.
Check the rules on curfew and access to shops, services, entertainment and cultural facilities on the Madeira Tourist Office website under “other information”.
The Azores
Measures are in place to limit the spread of the virus.
There are 5 levels of risk in the Azores – very low, low, medium, medium high and high. Each level has its own restrictions.
Check these restrictions on the Regional Government’s website.
Inter-island travel in the Azores
There are restrictions in place. Check the requirements on the Regional government’s website (use Google Chrome and change the language to English).
Face coverings
You must wear a face mask in all enclosed spaces. You should wear your face covering when you enter the building and keep it on until you leave. In cafes and restaurants, keep your mask on until you are seated.
You must also wear a face mask while walking along promenades and in other outdoor spaces where it is not possible to maintain a 2m social distance from people outside your family group.
These measures apply to everyone over the age of 10 on mainland Portugal and in the Azores, and over the age of 5 in Madeira and Porto Santo.
You can be fined if you breach the regulations.
Exemptions from wearing a face covering differ in Portugal compared to the UK. You may be exempt from using a face mask both indoors and out on medical grounds. You will have to show a declaration from your doctor as evidence that you have a health condition that prevents you from wearing a face covering. You should observe strict social distancing and limit the time you spend in common areas in enclosed spaces. For further information (in Portuguese) on exemptions, see decree-law 62-A/2020 (Article 3(2).
Accommodation
You need to show an EU digital COVID certificate or an NHS vaccination certificate when checking in to a hotel or other tourist accommodation. See FAQ 4 on the Portuguese government’s website.
If you do not have an EU digital COVID certificate or NHS vaccination certificate, you may show a negative COVID test result obtained by one of the following means:
A PCR test taken within the previous 72 hours
An antigen test taken within the previous 48 hours
A rapid antigen self-test done within the previous 24 hours and certified by a health or pharmaceutical professional
A rapid antigen self-test, verified by management on arrival at your accommodation
This does not apply to children under the age of 12 (i.e up to and including 11), provided they are accompanied by an adult.
Check any accommodation you book meets the required hygiene and cleaning standards and look out for the Portuguese Tourist Board’s “clean and safe” certification.

COVID-19 vaccines if you live in Portugal
Wherever possible British nationals should aim to be vaccinated in the country where they live. We will update this page when the Government of Portugal announces new information on the national vaccination programme. You can sign up to get email notifications when this page is updated.
The Portuguese national vaccination programme started in December 2020 and is using the Pfizer-BioNTech vaccine. British nationals resident in Portugal are eligible for vaccination.
The Portuguese authorities have published their vaccination plan (only available in Portuguese). If you live in mainland Portugal or in the autonomous region of Madeira, visit the Portuguese health authority’s website to check whether there is action you can take now to ensure you get the vaccine (use Google Chrome to access the page in English).
If you have registered for the vaccine and have not yet been contacted, call Saude 24 on 808 24 24 24 (press 9 for English) and ask for assistance in booking an appointment.
If you live in the Azores, use this form to register for the vaccine.
If you live in Portugal but do not have a healthcare user’s number, you may find it more difficult to be vaccinated. The Portuguese authorities are working on a solution to this issue. This page will be updated when there are any developments.
Find out more, including about vaccines that are authorised in the UK or approved by the World Health Organisation, on the COVID-19 vaccines if you live abroad.
If you’re a British national living in Portugal, you should seek medical advice from your local healthcare provider. Information about COVID-19 vaccines used in the national programme where you live, including regulatory status, should be available from local authorities.
If you receive your COVID-19 vaccination in Portugal and have a (non-temporary) healthcare user’s number, you can get an EU Digital COVID Certificate from the health authorities. It will help facilitate your travel within the EU and to the UK and, in some countries, you can use it to demonstrate your COVID-19 status to businesses and other organisations. For further information visit the European Commission’s EU Digital COVID Certificate page.
