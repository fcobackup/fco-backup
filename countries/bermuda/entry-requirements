Vaccine and testing requirements for travellers depend on mode of entry to Bermuda. You can find more information on travel requirements specific to you on the Government of Bermuda’s website.
You must wear face masks when travelling to the departure airport and practice social distancing at the departure airport.
Upon arrival, you must show a copy of your Travel Authorisation and present a copy of the pre-departure COVID-19 negative test result if taken to health officers on request.

Check your passport and travel documents before you travel
Check with your travel provider to make sure your passport and other travel documents meet their requirements.
Passport Validity
You must hold a valid passport to enter Bermuda. Your passport should be valid for the proposed duration of your stay from the date you arrive. No additional period of validity beyond this is required.
Visas
British passport holders don’t need a visa to enter Bermuda as a visitor, but you must book accommodation before you arrive. Visitors are usually granted entry for up to 90 days. For further enquiries about visas, visit the website of the nearest British Embassy or High Commission, or the Government of Bermuda website.
If you wish to extend your stay while in Bermuda, you must get permission from the Bermuda Department of Immigration before your initial 21 day stay ends. While an extension of stay is not automatic, extensions are normally granted.  
Work permits
If you wish to work in Bermuda, you must secure a job before coming to the island. Your employer will then apply to the Department of Immigration for a work permit, and once this is received you may enter the country to work. You may not seek employment while visiting Bermuda.
