In light of the ongoing coronavirus (COVID-19) pandemic, the authorities in Bosnia and Herzegovina have introduced some restrictions on entry. See below
This page reflects the UK government’s understanding of current rules for people travelling on a full ‘British Citizen’ passport, for the most common types of travel.
The authorities in Bosnia and Herzegovina set and enforce entry rules. For further information contact the embassy, high commission or consulate of the country or territory you’re travelling to. You should also consider checking with your transport provider or travel company to make sure your passport and other travel documents meet their requirements.
Entry rules in response to coronavirus (COVID-19)
Entry to Bosnia and Herzegovina
British nationals, including those with residence in Bosnia and Herzegovina, can enter Bosnia and Herzegovina with any of the following:
a negative COVID-19 (PCR) test result that is not older than 48 hours
confirmation of full vaccination at least 14 days before your arrival in Bosnia and Herzegovina. See ‘Demonstrating your COVID-19 vaccination status’
a certificate from a doctor showing you have recovered from COVID-19, 14 to 180 days before your arrival in Bosnia and Herzegovina
Some groups are exempt from this rule, including: diplomats travelling to Bosnia and Herzegovina on official duties, EUFOR/NATO staff, freight drivers and crew, and foreigners in transit to their country of residence. Changes to restrictions may be introduced at short notice. You should comply with any screening measures put in place by the authorities. You should not use the NHS testing service to get a test in order to facilitate your travel to another country. You should arrange to take a private test.
A number of restrictions are in place at border crossing points into and out of Bosnia and Herzegovina. The Border Police of Bosnia and Herzegovina are publishing regular updates. Countries neighbouring Bosnia and Herzegovina have also introduced restrictions. Please check FCDO Travel Advice for Croatia, Serbia and Montenegro for details.
Demonstrating your COVID-19 vaccination status
Bosnia and Herzegovina will only accept the UK’s letter version of proof of COVID-19 recovery and vaccination record. They will not accept digital proof. Your NHS appointment card from vaccination centres is not designed to be used as proof of vaccination and should not be used to demonstrate your vaccine status.
Transiting Bosnia and Herzegovina
Transit through Bosnia and Herzegovina is possible without the need for a negative test result for British nationals returning to the UK or their country of residence, or travelling from one place in Croatia to another via Neum in Bosnia and Herzegovina. Freight drivers are also allowed to transit.
Visas
The Bosnian authorities have advised that where individuals’ visas or residence permits have expired due to current restrictions on travel meaning they were unable to leave the country, the Bosnian authorities will adopt a case by case approach. If your visa or residence permit has expired, you should contact your nearest Field Office of the Service for Foreigners’ Affairs.

Children under 18 years of age who are not Bosnian nationals and who are travelling unaccompanied or accompanied by an adult person other than their parents must carry a notarised letter from their parents giving permission for the child to travel. The name of the accompanying adult must be clearly stated. If the child is accompanied by one parent, particularly if the parent has a different surname to the child’s, the accompanying parent should carry a notarised letter from the other parent giving permission to travel.
