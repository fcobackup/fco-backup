Crime
There’s been a steady increase of crime reported in Brazzaville and Pointe Noire. Foreigners in particular may be targeted by criminals. You should take sensible precautions to safeguard yourself and your belongings, particularly in Brazzaville and Pointe Noire. Do not walk in the streets after dark, or carry large amounts of money or valuables. The chance of being targeted by criminals is higher in rural areas.
Criminals have been known to target the beaches at Pointe Noire. Stay on main beaches, secure valuables, and avoid all beaches at night.
Local travel
While tensions have cooled following a peace agreement between Government and rebel groups in late 2017, there continue to be reports of sporadic rebel group activity and military operations against them, large numbers of displaced people, and continued instances of crime and armed banditry in the Pool region. Any attempt to travel by night may be prevented, and a permit from the Congolese army plus a military escort may be needed for travel by day.
There are no rail services running between Brazzaville and Pointe Noire. When rail services were running there were several instances of criminal gangs targeting trains on this route.
Avoid travelling anywhere around the country at night.
Boat travel
The river crossing/border with Kinshasa is subject to closure without warning. The ferry stops running in late afternoon, and there’s no service on Sundays. Check the situation locally before travelling.
Road travel
Road conditions are generally poor and deteriorate during the wet season (November to May). Overland travel off the main roads needs a four-wheel drive vehicle. Lock vehicle doors and keep windows closed when driving; watch out for armed gangs who may target your car. Do not drive off the main routes or park in unsupervised areas.
There are frequent vehicle checkpoints throughout the Republic of the Congo, which can be poorly marked. If you are asked to produce documents for inspection at a checkpoint, remain in your vehicle and show them documents through closed windows.
Air travel
The UK Air Safety List (ASL) lists all known airlines in the Republic of the Congo that do not meet international safety standards and are banned from operating commercial air services to, from, and within the UK. Check the UK Air Safety List when considering which airlines to fly with. The list is maintained by the Department for Transport, based on advice from the UK Civil Aviation Authority.
