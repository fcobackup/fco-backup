This advice reflects the UK government’s understanding of current rules for people travelling on a full ‘British citizen’ passport from the UK, for the most common types of travel.
The authorities in Qatar set and enforce entry rules. If you’re not sure how these requirements apply to you, contact Qatar’s embassy in the UK.
COVID-19 rules
Countries may restrict travel or bring in rules at short notice. Check with your travel company or airline for changes.
If you test positive for COVID-19, you may need to stay where you are until you test negative. You may also need to seek treatment there.
Visit TravelHealthPro (from the UK’s National Travel Health Network and Centre) for general COVID-19 advice for travellers.
Travel to Qatar
There is information about Qatar’s COVID-19 travel and return policy on Qatar’s Ministry of Public Health website.
You may need to have thermal screening or temperature checks when you arrive in Qatar at air, land or sea ports.
Insurance
You must get health insurance to visit Qatar. Before travelling, you must buy an insurance policy from a registered Ministry of Public Health insurance provider.
The standard insurance premium is 50 Qatari riyals per person, per month.
Public spaces and travel within Qatar
Qatar’s Ministry of Public Health has published advice on how to limit the spread of coronavirus.
You must wear face masks on public transport, and to enter healthcare facilities.
To enter any public and private healthcare facility, you must present your COVID-19 healthcare status via the Ehteraz app, available from the apple app store or the google playstore.
If you break the rules, punishments could include a fine of up to 200,000 Qatari riyal or a prison sentence of up to 3 years.
Passport validity requirements
If you are visiting Qatar, your passport should be valid for at least 6 months from the date you arrive.
If you are a resident of Qatar, your passport must be valid when you arrive.
Visa requirements
You can get a tourist visa on arrival if you’re travelling on a full British Citizen passport.
You must still get a visa if:
you’re travelling for any purpose other than tourism
you hold another type of British passport
If you need to stay longer than 30 days, you must extend your visa waiver before it expires through the Qatar Ministry of Interior. If you do not do this, you may be fined. The fine must be paid before leaving Qatar.
There is more information on visa requirements and extensions on the Qatar Ministry of Interior website.
Vaccination requirements (other than COVID-19)
At least 8 weeks before your trip, check the vaccinations and vaccination certificates you may need on TravelHealthPro.
Customs rules
There are strict rules about what goods you can take in and out of Qatar. You must declare anything that may be prohibited or subject to tax or duty.
Importing drugs, alcohol, pornography, pork products and religious books and material into Qatar is illegal. All luggage is scanned as you enter the country. DVDs and videos may be examined, censored and confiscated.
Qatar law also prohibits the importation, sale and purchase of electronic cigarettes, liquids and other similar products (e.g. electronic shisha pipes). The law applies regardless of quantity and intended use. Customs officials may seize and confiscate any such items found entering the country by any means, including in passengers’ luggage or sent by post.
If you are taking money, precious metals and stones into or out of Qatar which are worth more than 50,000 Qatari riyals, you must complete a declaration form. This includes:
currency – Qatari riyal or foreign currencies
financial bearer negotiable instruments – such as travellers cheques, money orders, cheques, promissory notes (including those endorsed without restriction, incomplete, payable to a fictitious payee or signed but without the payee’s name)
precious metals – such as gold, silver, platinum
precious stones – such as diamonds, emeralds, rubies, sapphires, pearls
You must also give customs officials any other information they request.
If you break these rules, you could be fined or imprisoned, as well as the funds being seized.
Transiting through Qatar
At the airport, all bags are scanned. Transiting passengers carrying even residual amounts of drugs may be arrested. This includes medication which may be legal in other countries, but not in Qatar. See bringing medication into Qatar
Travellers cannot stay in the transit area for more than 24 hours between flights, even if you are using the transit hotel in the airport.
There is more information about transiting through Qatar on the Hamad International Airport website.
