If you think you have COVID-19 symptoms, you should call a doctor or lab. They will ask a series of questions to assess whether it is likely that you have COVID-19. If COVID-19 is suspected, then they may arrange for someone to come to your home or hotel to conduct a test and they will advise you to self-isolate. You can pay for a test, if required for travel purposes, at the Institut Pasteur.
