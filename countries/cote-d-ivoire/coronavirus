Be prepared for your plans to change

If you test positive for COVID-19, you may need to stay where you are until you test negative. You may also need to seek treatment there.
Plan ahead and make sure you:
can access money
understand what your insurance will cover
can make arrangements to extend your stay and be away for longer than planned

Unlike in the UK, you will need to go to a pharmacy to obtain most over-the-counter medicines as these are not generally available in supermarkets. Many items that would require a prescription in the UK do not require one in Côte d’Ivoire. For items that do require a prescription in Côte d’Ivoire, UK prescriptions will be accepted but the duty doctor at the pharmacy may need to authorise the purchase. Pharmacies are usually identified by a green cross outside and will display a list showing which pharmacies are on duty (‘de garde’) out of hours.
The Government of Côte d’Ivoire is encouraging those seeking any information or who have concerns about coronavirus to call these local free hotline numbers: 143 or 101.
