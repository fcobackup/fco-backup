Coronavirus guidance is being updated.
Read the Prime Minister’s statement for the latest information.

The British Embassy Kuwait has been working to find options for British nationals to leave Kuwait, if they wish to return to the UK. There is currently one commercial option to the UK via Doha on Qatar Airways.
Flights
Qatar Airways operates daily commercial flights from Kuwait to UK via Doha. Check the Qatar Airways website.
Further travel restrictions and flight suspensions, including of currently scheduled flights, may be introduced at short notice. For the latest updates you should monitor the Kuwait Directorate General of Civil Aviation on Twitter and the Kuwait News Agency.
You will need to pay for your return travel to the UK. If departure options are available but you cannot afford the travel costs and have exhausted all other options for getting funds, you may be eligible to apply for an emergency loan from the government. This is a last resort option and you would need to repay the loan when you are back in the UK.
For more information, contact Corporate Travel Management (CTM). CTM are a commercial partner of the FCO and are authorised to administer such loans on behalf of the FCO.
Your journey home: re-entering the UK
When you return, you must follow the rules for entering the UK. You:
need to provide your journey and contact details up to 48 hours before you’re due to arrive in the UK
are not allowed to leave the place you’re staying for the first 14 days you’re in the UK except in very limited situations (known as ‘self-isolating’)
See also the list of people who are exempt from the border rules.
The National Travel Health Network and Centre (NaTHNaC) also provides advice on how to stay safe as you travel by air.
If you cannot leave Kuwait
