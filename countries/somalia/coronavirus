COVID-19 vaccines if you live in Somalia
The Medicines and Healthcare Products Regulatory Agency (MHRA) is the UK authority responsible for assessing the safety, quality and efficacy of vaccines. It has authorised the Pfizer/BioNTech, Oxford/AstraZeneca and Moderna vaccines for temporary supply and use in the UK. Find out more about MHRA approval for these vaccines.
British nationals living overseas should seek medical advice from their local healthcare provider in the country where they reside. Information about vaccines used in other national programmes, including regulatory status, should be available from the local authorities. This list of Stringent Regulatory Authorities recognised by the World Health Organisation may also be a useful source of additional information.

Returning to the UK
When you return, you must follow the rules for entering the UK including quarantine and testing requirements.
If your return journey to the UK transits another country, you should check whether it is subject to a travel ban or any other additional requirements. If so, contact your travel provider. Ethiopia was added to the UK’s COVID-19 “red list” from 19 March 2021 and Kenya from 9 April 2021.
You are responsible for organising your own COVID-19 test, in line with UK government testing requirements. You should contact the Somali Ministry of Health and the Immigration and Naturalisation Directorate of Somalia for information on testing facilities.
