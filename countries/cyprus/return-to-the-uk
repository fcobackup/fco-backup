For updates on future options for returning to the UK please monitor this page and our social media channels (UKinCyprus on Facebook and Twitter).
There are currently extremely limited, indirect commercial options available to return to the UK from Cyprus due to the near complete ban on flights to and from Cyprus until at least 17 May. Although a very limited number of commercial flights are still able to leave Cyprus, only humanitarian and cargo flights may arrive.
There are currently no flights between Turkey and the north of Cyprus until at least 28 May.
If you have a reservation for a commercial flight from Cyprus to the UK before 17 May, you should be aware that there is no guarantee that the current international flight ban will be lifted, enabling those flights to operate..
We recommend that you contact your airline for the latest information, however please bear in mind that some airlines are cancelling flights at short notice.
What to do
If you cannot leave Cyprus at this time, you should:
follow the advice of local authorities, including local measures to help minimise your risk of exposure to coronavirus.
find accommodation that’s suitable for your needs. Although hotel accommodation is closed, many private villas remain open. Consult the usual booking websites.
keep in regular contact with family and friends at home, so they know you are safe and well

You will need to pay for your return travel to the UK. If departure options are available but you cannot afford the travel costs and have exhausted all other options for getting funds, you may be eligible to apply for an emergency loan from the government. This is a last resort option and you would need to repay the loan when you are back in the UK. For more information, you should contact Corporate Travel Management (CTM). CTM are a commercial partner of the FCO and are authorised to administer such loans on behalf of the FCO.
Your journey home
The National Travel Health Network and Centre (NaTHNaC) provides advice on how to stay safe as you travel by air.
When you arrive back in the UK, follow the guidance for when you return to the UK on steps you should take to protect yourself and others.
