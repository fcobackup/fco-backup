Entry and travel
Border controls
On 20 March 2020, the French Government announced reinforced border controls with the UK.
You can still cross the border to return to the UK via France. If you live in France, the French Government has confirmed that you can continue to enter France to return to your principal residence.
Border checks are also in place on the borders with Italy, Spain and Germany.
Certificate requirements to enter France
On 8 April, French authorities introduced a requirement to complete a Certificate for international travel from abroad to mainland France in order to enter France.
Make sure you complete the travel certificate before you travel, so you can show it to French border authorities on entry and, where appropriate, travel companies prior to boarding. You are able to produce a handwritten copy of the text if you do not have access to a printed form.
Certificate requirements for travel within France
To be able to travel within or transit through France, you will need to complete a travel declaration to certify your reason for travel.
This should be completed before starting your journey. This does not replace the requirement for an “International travel from abroad to mainland France” certificate, if entering France. You can produce a handwritten copy of the text in the attestation if you are unable to access a printer.
Travel between the EU and non-European countries
On 16 March, the French Government announced that the EU would suspend travel between the EU and non-European countries for an initial period of 30 days from midday 17 March. On 13 April, the government announced that travel between the EU and non-European countries is suspended until further notice.
Permanent residents of EU countries, including France, will be able to cross the UK/France border into France if they have proof of residence. The French Government confirmed that UK nationals can enter France if returning to their principal residence. You must, however complete the necessary “attestation” to enter France, confirming that your travel is an absolutely necessary journey.
Some countries are imposing a compulsory period of quarantine for all travellers from France. If you are travelling from or through France, check the situation at your destination before you travel.
Travel between metropolitan France and French overseas territories
Regular flights between metropolitan France and its overseas territories - including Martinique, Mayotte, Guadeloupe, Guyana, La Reunion, French Polynesia, Saint Martin and Saint-Barthelemy - have been suspended since 23 March. Journeys between the islands are also prohibited, except in exceptional circumstances.
Local measures
The French Government outlined new measures on 16 March to stem the spread of coronavirus. This includes limiting travel to journeys that are absolutely necessary, effective until at least 11 May 2020.
Necessary journeys include:
to buy food
to seek medical care
urgent family reasons, including childcare or assisting vulnerable people
journeys to work where working from home is not possible
to exercise
If making a necessary, you will need to download and complete a declaration certifying your reason for travel. You can carry a physical copy or an electronic version of the declaration
These restrictions were tightened on 23 March. Some cities and towns have implemented night time curfews – check advice locally.
The French Government has said it will enforce these measures and fine those who are not compliant. Fines are becoming increasingly severe, especially for repeat offenders. For more information, read the guidance issued by the French Government on their website (in French) or (In English) and on the French Ministry of the Interior website. You should follow instructions of the French authorities.
These measures are in addition to those already announced by the French Government, including the closure of all non-essential establishments open to the public (i.e. restaurants, cafes, cinemas) from midnight on 14 March until further notice. Food shops, pharmacies, petrol stations, and banks will stay open.
Ski resorts
On 15 March, the National Union for Ski Regions and the National Association for Mayors in Regions with Ski Resorts announced that all ski resorts in France are closed with immediate effect until further notice. Consult your relevant tour, travel operator and insurance provider as to your immediate next steps.
