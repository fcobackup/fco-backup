The FCO strongly encourages non-resident British nationals in Colombia to consider leaving to avoid difficulties they will face if flights out of the country and the region are further restricted and they are unable to get home.
Airports will close to international traffic from midnight on Monday 23 March. Flights are still departing from Colombia, but disruption and cancellations are highly likely. You should urgently contact your travel provider or airline to confirm any existing reservations and be prepared to make alternative plans in order to leave. Airlines are facing very high call volumes, but most allow you to check flight status and make new bookings online.
For additional updates in English on potential travel options, see the British Embassy Twitter page.
Ecuador has closed its border to arrivals from Colombia though is currently allowing people to leave. You should monitor local authority statements on social media.
If you arrived before 16 March (from anywhere other than France, China, Italy and Spain) and want to catch an international flight you may be asked to demonstrate you can do so in a bio-secure way (that you have a clean bill of health, and are not going to take public transport for example), and pay the associated costs. If you arrived from France, China, Italy or Spain you will need to complete your 14-day isolation period before being able to continue travel.
