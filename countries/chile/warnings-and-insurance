Wildfires warning
Chile is currently experiencing severe wildfires in the central and southern regions of La Araucanía, Ñuble and Biobío. There are also wildfires in the O’Higgins and Maule regions. Chilean authorities are advising people to avoid the affected areas, follow official channels for up-to-date information and, in the case of an evacuation order, follow the evacuation process swiftly and calmly.
On 8 February, the Chilean government declared a State of Emergency in Maule and Ñuble regions because of the wildfires.
If you are in the affected areas, or in an area at risk of wildfires, keep up to date with and follow the advice of local authorities and emergency services.
For further guidance on wildfires, visit the website of Chile’s National Disaster Prevention and Response Service Servicio Nacional de Prevención y Respuesta ante Desastres (SERNAPRED) (in Spanish).
