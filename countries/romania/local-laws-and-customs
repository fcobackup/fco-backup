The Romanian authorities treat all drug-related and sex offences very seriously. The age of consent is 18. If you are convicted, you can expect a prison sentence.
Although homosexuality is not prohibited by law, public attitudes are less tolerant than in the UK and the LGBT community generally keeps a low profile. There are a few gay bars and clubs and there is an annual LGBT parade â€“ the Bucharest Pride - which has been held since 2004. The Bucharest Pride is usually accompanied by a LGBT film fest and art week, which features a number of art performances. In 2017, a Pride event was also held in the city of Cluj. Although still attracting some negative attention from religious and conservative groups and held with heightened security measures, attendances at Pride are rising every year and the event is gaining the support of more public figures. You can find local information on LGBT issues in Romania on the website of ACCEPT. See our information and advice page for the LGBT community before you travel.
Most airports and military bases will have signs prohibiting photography. Ask permission before photographing anything potentially sensitive (eg official buildings, police cars).
