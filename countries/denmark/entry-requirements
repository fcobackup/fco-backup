The information on this page covers the most common types of travel and reflects the UK government’s understanding of the rules currently in place. Unless otherwise stated, this information is for travellers using a full ‘British Citizen’ passport.
The authorities in the country or territory you’re travelling to are responsible for setting and enforcing the rules for entry. If you’re unclear about any aspect of the entry requirements, or you need further reassurance, you’ll need to contact the embassy, high commission or consulate of the country or territory you’re travelling to.
You should also consider checking with your transport provider or travel company to make sure your passport and other travel documents meet their requirements.
Border controls
On 4 January 2016, the Danish authorities increased border controls at the land border with Germany. If you’re travelling to Denmark from Germany using the land border, you should make sure you have your passport with you.
The Swedish authorities have announced additional immigration controls when entering Sweden, including when travelling from Denmark to Sweden. This may cause delays to your journey and you should make sure you carry a passport or other valid identity document with you if you plan to travel from Denmark to Sweden.
Passport validity
Your passport should be valid for the proposed duration of your stay; you don’t need any additional period of validity on your passport beyond this.
However, if the UK leaves the European Union with no deal, the passport validity rules for travel to most countries in Europe will change from 29 March 2019. Before booking travel, you should check that your passport will meet these new rules and find out whether you need to renew it.
Visas
If your passport describes you as a British Citizen, you don’t need a visa to enter Denmark. As a British passport holder you can stay as a visitor for up to 3 months. For longer stays, you should apply for a residence permit. If you have another type of British nationality, check the current entry requirements with the Danish Embassy. Greenland and the Faroes aren’t members of the European Union. You don’t need a visa to enter for tourism, but you should get a work and residence permit before entry if you intend to live and work there.
If you’re planning a stay of longer than 3 months, see our Living in Denmark guide and contact the Danish Embassy if you have further questions.
The UK and EU have agreed the full legal text of the draft Withdrawal Agreement in principle. This sets out that there will be no change to entry requirements for British citizens travelling to the EU or for EU citizens travelling to the UK during the Implementation Period (30 March 2019 to 31 December 2020).
In the event of changes to entry requirements after the UK leaves the EU on 29 March 2019, this page will be updated as soon as information is available.
UK Emergency Travel Documents
UK Emergency Travel Documents (ETDs) are accepted for entry, airside transit and exit from Denmark. Your ETD must be valid for the proposed duration of your stay.
