Entry and borders
The New Zealand border is currently closed to almost all travellers.
New Zealand citizens and residents returning to New Zealand may travel to New Zealand and do not need any formal exemption. There are a small number of additional, limited exceptions to the ban on travelling to and entering New Zealand. The following people should seek approval from Immigration New Zealand (INZ) using the limited exceptions process:
Partners, dependent children (aged 24 years and under) and legal guardians of New Zealand citizens and residents, who are travelling together on the same flight to New Zealand with the New Zealand citizen or resident family member.
Australian citizens and permanent residents who normally live in New Zealand
People with one of the following critical purposes in New Zealand:
Essential health workers
Other essential workers who are specifically agreed to by the New Zealand Government
Samoan and Tongan citizens making essential travel
New Zealand-based partners and dependent children (aged 19 years and under) of a work or student visa holder who is in New Zealand
Critical humanitarian travel.
Full details on current border closures and exceptions and be found on the INZ website. The website includes information on how to submit a request for travel to New Zealand. A request for approval to travel to New Zealand can take up to two days to process.
On 9 April 2020, the Government announced that anyone entering the country will be required to undergo quarantine or managed isolation in an approved facility for a minimum of 14 days. You should visit the New Zealand Ministry of Health website for more information.
You should contact your insurance company and airline for the latest travel information, and contact i-SITE if accommodation is needed.
Transit via New Zealand
There is a general suspension on transit through New Zealand. However, on 9 April 2020, the UK and New Zealand governments agreed a reciprocal transit arrangement. This permits British citizens and residents to transit through New Zealand airports within a 24-hour window. Conditions apply.
There are limits to which countries passengers can transit through after leaving New Zealand in order to reach their final destination. These are countries with which the New Zealand government has received a written undertaking that transits are permitted. This includes the United States of America, Canada, the United Kingdom, Switzerland, and Chile. The New Zealand government is working on establishing similar arrangements with other major transit hubs.
Given the current general suspension on transit through New Zealand, some travellers may find when checking in at point of departure that there is an initial ‘denial of boarding’. Should this happen, the check-in staff will be instructed to contact New Zealand Border Authorities. British nationals, so long as there is no other reason why boarding should be denied, will see this initial denial overridden and check-in should be able to be completed.
Visas
If you hold a work, student, or visitor visa with an expiry date of 1 April 2020 or earlier, and are unable to leave New Zealand, you must apply online for a new visa. An interim visa will be issued.
If you hold a work, student, visitor, limited or interim visa with an expiry date of 2 April to 9 July 2020 inclusive, and were in New Zealand on 2 April 2020, your visa will be automatically extended to 25 September 2020. Confirmation of extensions will be emailed to all visa holders.
Given the fast-changing situation, you should check the latest entry requirements for your destination on the New Zealand Immigration website or check with your airline before you travel.
Local measures
The New Zealand Government has introduced a four-level national COVID-19 alert system.
New Zealand will stay at Alert Level 3 before a further review and Alert Level decision on 11 May 2020.
Level 3 response measures still require people to remain at home, other than for essential personal movement. Some educational facilities and non-essential businesses are permitted to open. Level 3 does not allow increased social activity – bubbles can be expanded to close family, isolated people or care givers, but should be kept small.
Full details on the New Zealand Government’s coronavirus national response alert system and the requirements for each level can be found on the New Zealand Government COVID-19 website.
On 25 March, Prime Minister Ardern declared a State of National Emergency to fight coronavirus. The declaration allows the Director Civil Defence Emergency Management to direct and coordinate personnel, material, and other resources, and provides access to other extra-ordinary powers that will support delivery of an effective and timely response to coronavirus. The status of the State of National Emergency can be found on the New Zealand Government COVID-19 website.
Follow the advice of New Zealand authorities. Be ready to comply with isolation and testing or quarantine requirements.
The Cook Islands
On 16 March 2020, the Cook Islands introduced a requirement for any national wishing to enter the Cook Islands to self-isolate for 14 days in New Zealand prior to travel to the Cook Islands.
There have been no confirmed cases of coronavirus (COVID-19) in the Cook Islands, Tokelau, or Niue.
