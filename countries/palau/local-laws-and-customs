On 1 January 2020, a new act by the Palauan Senate prohibited reef-toxic sunscreens from Palau. Reef-toxic sunscreen is no longer allowed to be brought into Palau, and will be confiscated on arrival.

The act defines reef-toxic sunscreens as ‘skin-care products, sold for topical application, which contain oxybenzone (BP3), octyl methoxycinnamate (EHMC), octocrylene (OC), 4-methyl-benzylidene camphor (4MBC), triclosan, methyl paraben, ethyl paraben, butyl paraben, benzyl paraben, or phenoxyethanol, or other chemical ingredients prohibited by the Minister pursuant to regulation.’
