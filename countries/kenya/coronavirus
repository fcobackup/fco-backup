International travel
The Government of Kenya has confirmed that all persons departing Kenya for a country requiring a negative COVID-19 test as a condition of entry must obtain an RT PCR COVID-19 test and an associated Trusted Travel code, which airlines and Kenya’s Port Health authorities will verify at the airport. Travellers are encouraged to check their destination country’s entry requirements.
For those concerned, after visiting an authorised laboratory to undertake an RT PCR COVID-19 test, travellers will receive a text message from PanaBIOS and an email from the laboratory itself and/or admin@panabios.org with a link to generate a Travel Code at trustedtravel.panabios.org. If the test result meets Kenya’s exit requirements, and the destination country’s entry requirements, a Travel Code will be issued to the traveller.
All Kenyan RT PCR COVID-19 testing laboratories are party to the Trusted Travel system.
Commercial flights are operating to and from Kenya. Check with your travel company for the latest information.
The Kenya-Uganda, Kenya-Somalia and Kenya-Tanzania borders re-opened on 1 August.

The Government of Kenya has advised that passengers departing the airport during curfew must retain their boarding pass as proof of their arrival time, which will allow for movement to their accommodation.

You do not need a COVID-19 negative test to board domestic flights within Kenya.
The Government of Kenya has directed that, in addition to public transport systems, social distancing rules – in the form of capacity restrictions – will also apply when using private vehicles, including taxis.

Healthcare in Kenya
The Government of Kenya has indicated that anyone testing positive for COVID-19, but presenting as asymptomatic or with only mild symptoms, can expect to be directed to self-isolate at home if able to do so. Vulnerable persons will be prioritised for hospital care. Ministry of Health guidance is available.
Pharmacies and other shops selling essential products remain open, though business hours may be affected by the nationwide curfew.
