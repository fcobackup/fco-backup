This page has information on travelling to Equatorial Guinea.
This page reflects the UK government’s understanding of current rules for people travelling on a full ‘British Citizen’ passport, for the most common types of travel.
The authorities in Equatorial Guinea set and enforce entry rules. If you’re unsure how Equatorial Guinea’s entry requirements apply to you, contact its UK embassy, high commission or consulate.
You should also consider checking with your transport provider or travel company to make sure your passport and other travel documents meet their requirements.
All travellers
The Government of Equatorial Guinea have eased restrictions to allow a limited number of commercial flights to and from Equatorial Guinea.
The authorities in Equatorial Guinea require travellers to show proof of vaccination in order to enter the country.
Children aged 17 and under are also required to demonstrate proof of vaccination before entering the country.
Demonstrating your COVID-19 status
The authorities in Equatorial Guinea have announced that you must now also show proof of vaccination in order to enter the country.
Equatorial Guinea will accept the UK’s proof of COVID-19 recovery and vaccination record. Your NHS appointment card from vaccination centres is not designed to be used as proof of vaccination and should not be used to demonstrate your vaccine status.
If you’re not fully vaccinated
The authorities in Equatorial Guinea require all travelers to the country to show proof of vaccination in order to enter the country. You will not be permitted to enter the country if you cannot show proof of vaccination.
Testing and quarantine requirements
On arrival, passengers are required to undergo a rapid COVID-19 test. You will also be required to provide proof of a negative coronavirus (COVID-19) test result, using a polymerase chain reaction (PRC) test, taken within the last 48 hours.
All passengers are then required to quarantine and take a second test on day 3. Those who test negative after the second test will be free to leave quarantine on day 4. Those who test positive will be required to isolate immediately. Oil company employees will be able to isolate in oil company isolation facilities, whilst other individuals will have to go to one of the hotels which the government of Equatorial Guinea has nominated for isolation until a negative test is returned. This applies to all, including those under 18. Authorities may withdraw passports from passengers if an invalid PCR test is presented.
You should not use the NHS testing service to get a test in order to facilitate your travel to another country. You should arrange to take a private test.
Screening on arrival
Your temperature will be taken at arrival at airports and ports.
Visas
You will need a visa to visit Equatorial Guinea. Equatorial Guinea diplomatic missions abroad may issue diplomatic and business entry visas to Equatorial Guinea, however this is kept under review.
The Government of Equatorial Guinea has confirmed it will not penalise British nationals whose visas have expired while they are unable to leave the country due to coronavirus restrictions. If this is your situation, you should write a letter to the Ministry of Foreign Affairs (Visa Section) informing them, and keep a copy for future visa applications. You will be allowed to leave the country freely when able to, and this will not affect your chances of being granted a visa in the future.
