Terrorism
There is a high threat of terrorist attack globally affecting UK interests and British nationals, including from groups and individuals who view the UK and British nationals as targets. You should remain vigilant at all times.
UK Counter Terrorism Policing has information and advice on staying safe abroad and what to do in the event of a terrorist attack. Find out how to reduce your risk from terrorism while abroad.
Terrorism in Bosnia and Herzegovina
Terrorist attacks in Bosnia and Herzegovina cannot be ruled out.
Previous attacks have included firearms attacks on government, law enforcement interests and the public. Attacks could be indiscriminate, including in places visited by foreigners.
Political situation
Public protests occur from time to time and can cause traffic disruption. Protests are normally peaceful. Keep up to date with developments through the media, be vigilant and avoid all protests.
There is a small risk of violent incidents linked to locally controversial issues, usually from the conflict of the 1990s.
There has been an increase in anti-UK rhetoric from some politicians in the Republika Srpska (one of the entities that makes up the State of Bosnia and Herzegovina). This could translate into wider anti-UK sentiment. You should avoid political demonstrations.
Crime
You can report all incidents of crime to the local police station and get a written report. Local police do not always have English language skills and you may need the services of a translator .
Protecting your belongings
Be aware of pickpockets on public transport and in the tourist and pedestrian areas of Sarajevo and other cities. Make sure personal belongings, including your passport, are secure. Obvious displays of wealth, including large quantities of cash or jewellery and luxury vehicles can make you a target for opportunist thieves.
There has been an increase in thefts from cars in popular tourist areas in and around Sarajevo, particularly on Mount Trebevic. Make sure your vehicle is locked and your belongings are out of sight. Take particular care in areas popular with foreign tourists and in crowded public venues.
Old landmines and unexploded weapons
Landmines and other unexploded weapons remain from the 1992 to 1995 war. Whilst highly populated areas and major routes are largely clear, risks remain in less populated and rural areas. Do not stray from roads and paved areas without an experienced guide. Take care near:
the former lines of conflict
the edge of roads
the open countryside
destroyed or abandoned buildings (including in towns)
neglected land
untarred roads
woods and orchards
For further information, see Mine Action Centre.
Laws and cultural differences
English language
English is not always widely spoken.
Personal ID
Carry your passport or official photo ID with you at all times. You must be able to show some form of identification if required, including when checking into hotels. For more information, see the Ministry of Security of Bosnia and Herzegovina.
Ramadan
Ramadan is a holy month for Muslims in Bosnia and Herzegovina. The dates vary by year and country.
You should:
check opening hours of shops and restaurants
be aware that if hotels and restaurants are providing food or drink in fasting hours, they may separate you from other guests
follow local dress codes – clothing that does not meet local dress codes may cause more offence at this time
Get more advice when you arrive from your tour guide, hotel or business contacts.
LGBT+ travellers
There are no laws against same-sex relations in Bosnia and Herzegovina, but LGBT+ communities continue to report incidents of discrimination and even violence. Showing affection in public is likely to be frowned upon and may receive unwelcome attention.
Read more advice for LGBT+ travellers.
Outdoor activities and adventure tourism
Check that your travel and medical insurance cover you for any adventure activities and sports.
Diving
Diving off Mostar bridge is dangerous and has resulted in serious injuries and fatalities.
Rafting
Take care when white water rafting in rivers or close to waterfalls. Currents can be extremely strong.
Transport risks
Road travel
If you are planning to drive in Bosnia and Herzegovina, see information on driving abroad and read the RAC guide.
Take care when travelling outside the main towns and cities, especially in winter when road conditions can worsen quickly.
If you are involved in an accident, stay at the scene and do not move your vehicle until the police arrive. Traffic police can impose on-the-spot fines for any traffic offence.
Licences and permits
For visits of up to 6 months, you need either a 1968 international driving permit (IDP) or a valid UK driving licence to drive in Bosnia and Herzegovina. The 1949 IDP is not accepted anymore. You cannot buy an IDP outside the UK, so get one before you travel. You can buy an IDP in person from some UK post offices – find your nearest post office branch that offers this service.
If you’re staying longer than 6 months, you will need to get a local driving licence. Bosnian authorities will keep your UK licence (or any other foreign licence) when applying for a Bosnian one. You cannot exchange an international driving permit for a Bosnian licence.
Contact the Bosnia and Herzegovina Embassy in London if you have more detailed questions about bringing a vehicle to the country. The British Embassy will not be able to help if you do not have the correct documentation when you arrive at the border.
Border insurance
Border insurance is required for all vehicles crossing into Bosnia and Herzegovina. It is not always possible to buy border insurance at all border crossings. The Border Police advise travellers to use the recently upgraded crossings at:
Bijaca
Crveni Grm (south)
Izacici (west)
Kamensko
Karakaj and Raca (east)
Samac (north-east)
Zubci (south-east)
Doljani
Winter equipment requirements
Between November and April you are legally required to use winter equipment on your vehicle. This means:
all tyres must have an MS, M+S or M&S mark and a stylised symbol of a snowflake – the tread should be at least 4 millimetres deep
snow chains should be carried as their use is compulsory in winter conditions if the sign is displayed
Taxis
Official taxis in Sarajevo and the major towns are well-regulated and metered. Taxi drivers from the Republika Srpska might refuse to drive to a destination in the Federation of Bosnia and Herzegovina, and the same from the Federation to the Republika Srpska.
Do not use unlicensed taxis.
Air travel
Sarajevo (Butmir) International airport is prone to fog, causing flights to be delayed or cancelled during the winter months, particularly in December and January. Many airlines will not take responsibility for accommodation due to delays caused by adverse weather. If you are travelling into or out of Sarajevo during winter, make sure you have enough money if you are forced to extend your stay.
Extreme weather and natural disasters
Forest fires
Forest fires are common in Herzegovina (the southern part of the country) during summer heat waves, mostly happening in inaccessible areas. Fires are normally kept under control, but if they get close to populated areas, road closures are possible.
Flooding
Flash floods and landslides remain a risk in all parts of Bosnia and Herzegovina after heavy rain. Follow the instructions and guidance provided by local officials and traffic police.
Earthquakes
Earthquakes and small tremors are recorded throughout the year, usually without consequences. To learn more about what to do before, during and after an earthquake, see advice from the US Federal Emergency Management Agency.
