Warning
FCDO advises against all but essential travel to parts of Ukraine.

This information is for people travelling on a full ‘British citizen’ passport from the UK who choose to travel despite FCDO advice. It is based on the UK government’s understanding of Ukraine’s current rules for the most common types of travel.
The authorities in Ukraine set and enforce entry rules. If you’re not sure how these requirements apply to you, contact the Ukrainian Embassy in the UK. The Ukrainian State Border Guard Service has the final decision on whether a person is eligible to enter Ukraine.
Permanent residents
If you are a permanent resident of Ukraine, you do not need to show proof of insurance.
Passport validity requirements
If you’re travelling without a visa, your passport should be valid for the proposed duration of your stay. No additional period of validity beyond this is required. If you’re applying for a visa, your passport may need to have an additional period of validity. Check with the Ukrainian Embassy in the UK for further details.
Additional requirements at the border
At the border you will need to:
complete an immigration card
scan your fingerprints as part of biometric data collection at border crossing points if requested by the immigration officer
have evidence of sufficient funds. You can show:
cash
bank cards with bank statements
accommodation bookings
tourist vouchers
a letter of financial support from your sponsor
return or onward travel tickets

Visa requirements
British Citizen passport holders can enter Ukraine without a visa for visits of up to 90 days within a 180-day period. Ukraine has confirmed that this policy will continue to apply to British citizens until 30 January 2026.
If you’re planning to stay in Ukraine for longer than 90 days in a 180 day period, you need to get a visa. For more advice contact the Ukrainian Embassy in London or Consulate General in Edinburgh.
Expired residence cards
If you have a temporary or permanent residence card that’s expired, you are still allowed to return to Ukraine. The expired document will remain valid while martial law remains in place and for 30 days afterwards. For more information see the Visit Ukraine website or contact the State Migration Service of Ukraine.
Visa overstays
If you need to extend your stay in Ukraine, check with the State Migration Service. If you overstay the 90 day allowance, you will be fined and may not be able to return to Ukraine for 90 days after leaving the country.
Non-government controlled areas
If you intend to go to any of the areas not controlled by the Ukrainian authorities, you must apply to the State Migration Service.
Vaccine requirements
For details about medical entry requirements and recommended vaccinations, see TravelHealthPro’s Ukraine guide.
Accommodation
The ongoing invasion has severely affected the availability of accommodation. You should book and confirm accommodation in advance. Find further information at Visit Ukraine.
Customs rules
There are strict rules about goods you can take into and out of Ukraine (in Ukrainian), including antiques and items of historical interest. You must declare anything that may be prohibited or subject to tax or duty. If in doubt seek prior permission from the customs authorities.
Bringing your car to Ukraine
Non-residents are allowed to bring a vehicle for personal use into Ukraine for up to one year. There’s no need to complete a customs declaration form. The vehicle can only be used in Ukraine by the person that brought it into the country. An undeclared vehicle cannot be: 
used for commercial purposes 
dismantled 
sold  
rented to other people 
used to travel through Ukraine
If you want to do any of these things, you’ll need to register the vehicle in Ukraine and pay the appropriate customs duty.
You must take the vehicle out of Ukraine within the required timeframe, or place it into the customs regime of the State.
If your vehicle breaks down and cannot be fixed, you should inform the State Customs Service and provide them with evidence that it cannot be repaired. You may then dispose of the vehicle through the official channels of the State Customs Service.
For further information on bringing your car to Ukraine, contact the State Customs Service of Ukraine.
Crossing international borders
It is illegal to enter internationally recognised Ukrainian territory through a border point that is not currently controlled by the Ukrainian authorities. If you do, you risk arrest or a fine, and a travel ban.
International border crossings that are not currently under the control of the Ukrainian authorities include:
all land border crossings into Donetsk region
all land border crossings and seaports in Luhansk region
all seaports in Kherson region east of the Dnipro river
all airports and seaports in Crimea and the Kerch Bridge road and rail crossing into Crimea
