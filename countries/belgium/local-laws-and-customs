According to Belgian law, you must have some form of identification with you at all times.
Possession of drugs and trafficking in drugs are serious offences.
It is illegal to wear in public places (parks, buildings, public transport, on the street etc.) clothing that hides a person’s face largely or completely. People wearing such clothing (e.g. the burka and niqab) risk a fine of up to €137.50 and/or detention for up to 7 days. There is no exemption for tourists.
Taking food and drink into Belgium
You cannot take meat, milk or products containing them into EU countries. There are some exceptions for medical reasons, for example certain amounts of powdered infant milk, infant food, or pet food required for medical reasons. Check the rules about taking food and drink into the EU on the European Commission website.
