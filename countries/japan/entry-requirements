This page has information on travelling to Japan.
This page reflects the UK government’s understanding of current rules for people travelling on a full ‘British Citizen’ passport from the UK, for the most common types of travel.
The authorities in Japan set and enforce entry rules. If you’re unsure how Japan’s entry requirements apply to you, contact its UK embassy, high commission or consulate.
All travellers
The Japanese Ministry of Health, Labour and Welfare, and Ministry of Foreign Affairs websites have further details on the entry requirements for all travellers to Japan (including on ‘Fast Track’ procedures). Rules may be subject to change at short notice. Since 11 October 2022.
As part of travelling to Japan, you must complete information on the MySoS app or website, including signing a written pledge to abide by the Japanese rules on self-isolation and other COVID measures.
Further details can be found in the section on vaccination status below, in the Ministry of Health, Labour and Welfare Q&A and on the Ministry of Foreign Affairs website.
Failure to comply with the regulations could lead to detention under the Quarantine Act, the publication of your name and information related to reducing the spread of infection, and possible revocation of your Status of Residence or deportation.
It is illegal to work in Japan without the correct visa, however informal or temporary the work. You shouldn’t overstay your permission to remain in the country, as you risk arrest, detention and a heavy fine.
You should note that bookings on some flight routes have been restricted or suspended. Flight length and routing may also be impacted by the current situation in Ukraine.
The visa waiver system has been reactivated from 11 October, which means that short-term visitors with British citizen passports no longer need to obtain a visa prior to travelling. This includes those coming for tourism and to visit family and friends. Visas will still be required for long-term stays; please consult your nearest Japanese Consulate for guidance and how to apply. The online EFRS visa system used earlier this year is no longer required.
For arrivals who are triple-vaccinated, there is no longer a requirement to have a COVID-19 test before you fly. Valid certificates must be shown to prove vaccination with three doses of any of the COVID-19 vaccines on the Emergency Use List of the World Health Organization (WHO). Some airlines may require these documents to be shown before boarding as part of their internal rules.
Vaccination requirements
If you are triple vaccinated
If you are triple vaccinated with two doses of AstraZeneca, Pfizer or Moderna vaccines (or one of Johnson & Johnson) and an additional booster shot from Pfizer or Moderna then you do not require a negative PCR test before flying. Note that AstraZeneca is not accepted as a valid booster. Valid certificates must be shown to prove vaccination with three doses of any of the COVID-19 vaccines on the Emergency Use List of the World Health Organization (WHO).
If you are not triple vaccinated
There is no requirement to be vaccinated in order to enter Japan, however if you cannot prove you are triple-vaccinated with two doses of AstraZeneca, Pfizer or Moderna vaccines (or one of Johnson & Johnson) and an additional booster shot from Pfizer or Moderna, then you must take a PCR test within 72 hours before your flight and show a negative certificate in the approved format. You will be unable to use the ‘fast track’ MySos system in this case. Note that AstraZeneca is not accepted as a valid booster.
Proof of vaccination status
You can use the UK COVID Pass to demonstrate your vaccination record to the Japanese authorities. Your NHS appointment card from vaccination centres is not designed to be used as proof of vaccination and should not be used to demonstrate your vaccination status. Residents in Japan should obtain a letter from the city or ward office before travelling.
If you’ve had COVID-19 in the past year
Proof of prior infection does not afford exemptions. You must follow the rules and regulations outlined above.
Children and young people
Children under 18, provided they are accompanied by a triple-vaccinated parent who supervises their activities, may follow the same rules as their parent even if the child is not fully-vaccinated.
If you’re transiting through Japan
Transiting is when you pass through one country on the way to your final destination.
The COVID-19 regulations and requirements outlined above do not apply to passengers who are transiting through one Japanese airport and do not go through immigration. However, transit may be precluded by airport closures, movement between terminals and delays between arriving and departing flights. Check with your airline whether your connection is feasible before boarding a flight to Japan.
When transiting through Japan, you should comply with any additional screening measures put in place by the authorities. You should also check the latest entry requirements for your final destination.
Exemptions
You should contact your nearest Japanese Embassy for more information on exemptions.
Check your passport and travel documents before you travel
If you are visiting Japan, your passport should be valid for the duration of your stay. No additional period of validity beyond this is required.
Check with your travel provider to make sure your passport and other travel documents meet their requirements.
UK Emergency Travel Documents
UK Emergency Travel Documents are accepted for entry, airside transit and exit from Japan.
Medication
The use or possession of some common prescription and over-the-counter medicines is banned under Japan’s strictly enforced anti-stimulant drugs law. This includes Vicks inhalers, medicines for allergies and sinus problems, cold and flu medication containing Pseudoephedrine and even some over-the-counter painkillers like those containing codeine. Foreign nationals have been detained and deported for offences. You should check the status of your medication with the nearest Japanese Embassy or Consulate before you travel.
If you are travelling with prescription medication that is permitted under Japanese law, you are normally allowed to bring in up to one month’s supply. You are advised to bring a copy of your prescription and a letter from your doctor stating the medical condition that the medication has been prescribed to treat. For more guidance on travelling with medication, check information pages from NHS Choices and the National Travel Health Network and Centre (NaTHNaC) in our foreign travel checklist.
If you need prescription medicine for long-term use, you may need to provide extra paperwork, such as an import licence. The Japanese Ministry of Health, Labour and Welfare website provides information about bringing medication for personal use.
