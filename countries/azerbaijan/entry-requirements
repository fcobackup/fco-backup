The information on this page covers the most common types of travel and reflects the UK government’s understanding of the rules currently in place. Unless otherwise stated, this information is for travellers using a full ‘British Citizen’ passport.
The authorities in the country or territory you’re travelling to are responsible for setting and enforcing the rules for entry. If you’re unclear about any aspect of the entry requirements, or you need further reassurance, you’ll need to contact the embassy, high commission or consulate of the country or territory you’re travelling to.
You should also consider checking with your transport provider or travel company to make sure your passport and other travel documents meet their requirements.
Coronavirus
The Azerbaijani authorities have stated that any British Nationals who have visited Spain, France, Germany, Italy, the Republic of Korea, China, Iran or Japan in the last 14 days will be subject to quarantine, potentially lasting 21 days. This list of countries could change at short notice, check this travel advice regularly.
Options for leaving Azerbaijan are becoming increasingly limited and if you wish to leave Azerbaijan you should make arrangements to do so as soon as possible. AZAL flights between London and Baku continue, check regularly with the airline for the latest updates.
Visas
British nationals travelling to Azerbaijan usually need to get a visa in advance.
In response to the coronavirus (COVID-19) pandemic the Azerbaijani authorities announced the temporary suspension of the Asan Visa (e-Visa) service starting from 13 March 2020 for 45 days. On 19 March the Embassy of Azerbaijan in the UK and ASAN notified that e-visas issued before the suspension of the e-visa service, which have not been used yet for entry in to Azerbaijan, have also been annulled and that email notifications are being sent to applicants.
You can still apply for a visa through the Azerbaijan Embassy-affiliated Visa Service Centre in the UK. You should apply for a visa at least one month ahead of your intended travel date. All applicants must provide confirmation they have tested negative for COVID-19. Visit the official Visa Centre website for more information.
Make sure you check the duration of your visa immediately to avoid overstaying unintentionally. Your visa should be valid when departing Azerbaijan.
Electronic visas are normally valid for 30 days and are single entry. The Azerbaijani authorities have agreed that e-visas can be extended in some circumstances if an individual has had their flight out of Azerbaijan cancelled. There is also an option for those without a return flight to have their visa extended, but if the visa has expired a fine will be incurred. For more information contact the State Migration Service email: info@migration.info.az
In exceptional circumstances other visas (non e-visas) can be extended by the State Migration Service of the Republic of Azerbaijan for up to 60 days. Their address is 202 Binagadi Highway, 3123 Block, Binagadi district, Baku city, AZ1114, Azerbaijan Republic; telephone +994 (0)12 562 56 23 or +994 (0)12 562 57 73; e-mail info@migration.gov.az. Alternatively, try the Migration Information Centre: telephone: 919 (in country calls only).
If you overstay you can obtain an ‘Exit Permit’ letter (an official letter giving permission to leave Azerbaijan within 48 hours) from the State Migration Service before you depart. You will be liable to a fine of between AZN300 to AZN400. You should get a receipt.
Passport validity
Your passport should be valid for a minimum period of 6 months when you enter Azerbaijan.
UK Emergency Travel Documents
UK Emergency Travel Documents (ETDs) are accepted for entry, airside transit and exit from Azerbaijan.
Registration
If you’re staying in Azerbaijan for longer than 15 days you must register with the State Migration Service within 15 days of arrival by either visiting the State Migration Service in person or online. Hotels may provide this service for their guests, but visitors staying in apartments or private residences will have to register by themselves. Each traveller is responsible for ensuring that the registration has been completed.
If you’re staying longer than 30 days, you will need to obtain a temporary residence card unless applying to extend your visa on compassionate grounds. For more information refer to the State Migration Service.
Dual nationals
Azerbaijan doesn’t allow adults (18 years or older) to hold dual nationality. You may be refused entry, denied departure or even face criminal liability if you’re 18 years or older and are found to be holding both an Azerbaijani passport and a passport of a different nationality. If you’re a British passport holder with links to Azerbaijan (through birth or otherwise) and wish to check your nationality status contact the State Migration Service before you travel. Children under 18 years old holding a second nationality shouldn’t face any difficulties.
