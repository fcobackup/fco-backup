Borkou, Ennedi Ouest, Ennedi Est and Tibesti provinces
FCDO advises against all travel to the northern provinces of Chad:
Borkou Province
Ennedi Ouest Province
Ennedi Est Province
Tibesti Province
There are many landmines near the Chad-Libya border in these provinces. The northern provinces are also unsafe due to the presence of rebel groups and contested gold mines.   
Kanem Province, including Nokou
FCDO advises against all travel to the western part of Kanem Province, including the town of Nokou due to the risk of terrorism. See Terrorism in Chad.
Lake Chad region
FCDO advises against all travel to the Lake Chad region. There is a high risk of terrorist kidnapping in the Lake Chad region. See Terrorism in Chad.
Within 30km of all Chad’s other borders
FCDO advises against all travel to within 30km of all of Chad’s other borders.
The Chad-Sudan border is closed to travellers.
The Chad-Central African Republic border is closed. The Central African Republic is unstable. In 2021, armed groups reportedly entered south-western Chad from the Central African Republic before Chadian forces repelled them. Chadian rebel groups remain active and could launch attacks in Chad without warning. 
The rest of Chad
FCDO advises against all but essential travel to the rest of Chad, including the capital, N’Djamena.
In 2021 and 2022 protesters and security forces clashed violently in N’Djamena and southern Chad. A number of people were killed.
The Sahel region  
There is a high risk of terrorist kidnapping in the Sahel region, which includes Chad, Mauritania, Mali, Burkina Faso and Niger. See Terrorism in Chad.
