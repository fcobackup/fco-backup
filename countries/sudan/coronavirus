Travel in Sudan
Internal flights and all public transport services between States have been suspended until further notice.
The Sudanese authorities have imposed curfews throughout the country, enforced by the police and armed forces. You should check and observe the curfew times and conditions for the state in which you are located. An Emergency Order has been signed permitting police and armed forces to fine and imprison people who break curfew.
In Khartoum State this means that:
curfew hours are from 6pm to 5am
public and private events, including weddings, parties and other gatherings are banned
the bridges across the Nile are closed during curfew hours
universities, schools and kindergartens will remain closed
some public departments and institutions will begin a gradual return to work in line with health precautions. Core institutions including security agencies, hospitals and pharmacies, remain operational
private companies, shops and stores may begin a gradual return to work in line with health precautions. Bakeries, supermarkets and haulage companies remain operational
The Sudanese authorities are strict in enforcing restrictions on movement within Khartoum state. You should comply with all local restrictions introduced by the Sudanese authorities.
You should comply with any additional screening measures put in place by the authorities.
Accommodation
Some hotels remain open but may offer limited services.
Public places and services
Many cafes, restaurants and markets continue to operate during the break in the curfew for shopping.
Mosques and other places of worship may be open to the public with social distancing and other preventive measures in place.
