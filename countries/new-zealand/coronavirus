Travel in New Zealand
The whole of New Zealand is at Alert Level 1. You can find detailed information on the alert levels and the measures introduced from the New Zealand government.
From 11:59pm on Wednesday 18 November, you legally must wear a face covering when you’re travelling to, from or through Auckland on public transport. This includes on long-distance bus and train journeys.
You also legally must wear a face covering when you’re travelling on a domestic flight anywhere in New Zealand. This does not include private flights.
Drivers of taxis and ride-shares in Auckland legally must wear a face covering from Thursday. If you’re a passenger in a taxi or ride-share, you’re strongly encouraged to wear a face covering.
While not mandatory at Alert Level 1, government advice for everyone outside of Auckland, encourages the use of face coverings on public transport and where it is not possible to maintain physical distance from people who you do not know, for example in supermarkets. The government also encourages people to keep track of their movements and who they have seen to help with contact tracing. The NZ COVID Tracer app is available to download for this purpose with all shops and businesses displaying their QR codes for scanning. Detailed information on face coverings is available from the New Zealand government.
Travellers may continue to undertake domestic travel by plane or road in order to connect with international flight departures from Auckland or Christchurch.
New Zealand’s border restrictions remain in place and public health measures remain unchanged (wash hands and high-touch surfaces regularly, stay home if sick, and get tested if symptomatic).

Returning to the UK
As of 8 January 2021, all international arrivals, including UK nationals, must present a negative pre-departure COVID-19 test result taken up to 72 hours prior to your flight out of New Zealand for entry to England. The Devolved Administrations are expected to introduce similar measures shortly.
You will need to present proof of your negative COVID-19 test result to all carriers. Passengers will be subject to an immediate fine of £500 if they fail to comply with the new regulations on pre-departure testing.
You should contact a GP or visit the Healthpoint website for further information on accessing PCR pre departure COVID-19 tests in New Zealand. More details can be found here.
Private testing facilities are also available.
The British High Commission in Wellington and Consulate General in Auckland are unable to offer certification or a negative test result.
You are still required to complete a passenger locator form before you arrive in the UK. See GOV.UK, entering or returning to the UK for full details on the current regulations.
Other specific country and airline restrictions
Travel restrictions imposed by Hong Kong, Singapore and other transit hubs apply to travellers who have been in the UK for at least 14 days before their flight. These restrictions do not affect British Nationals leaving New Zealand. We advise you to check with your airline before travelling in case of any related disruption to airline schedules caused by the new restrictions.
Some airlines, including Etihad, have mandatory pre-departure PCR COVID-19 testing requirements, even for transit passengers. You should contact your individual airline for further information. The British High Commission in Wellington and Consulate General in Auckland are unable to offer certification or a negative test result. Those requiring testing should contact their GP or visit the Healthpoint website for further information on accessing medical services.
Air New Zealand now requires all passengers to wear a face-covering on international flights. Face-coverings are already required by local legislation on all New Zealand domestic flights. This requirement comes into effect from 26 January.
