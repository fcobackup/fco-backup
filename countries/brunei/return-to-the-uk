Flights
There are currently no commercial options available to return to the UK from Brunei.
We know this is concerning for British people trying to leave Brunei. The UK government is working closely with airlines, the Brunei authorities and other governments to make sure that you are aware of options for you to return to the UK when they become available.
Details of Royal Brunei’s schedule can be found on the Royal Brunei Airlines website.
Brunei has introduced an exit travel ban, including for permanent residents, and expatriate workers (green identity card holders), and their dependents. Exceptions will be considered by the Prime Minister’s Office on a case by case basis, through email applications to travelapplication@jpm.gov.bn giving 14 days’ notice of the intention to travel, and setting out reasons why they need to leave the country. Full details are available on the Prime Minister’s Office website.
If you cannot leave Brunei
If you cannot leave Brunei at this time, see advice on staying in Brunei during coronavirus.
Future travel options
The UK government is working closely with airlines, the Brunei authorities and other governments to make sure that you are aware of options for you to return to the UK when they become available.
We are aware that Royal Brunei Airlines have announced an April/May 2020 flight schedule.
Before booking seats on any of these flights, you must check the entry and transit restrictions in place for countries on your proposed flight route.
You should also check onward flight availability, as the number of flights operating globally is reducing and continuing to change at short notice.
You will need to pay for your return travel to the UK. If departure options are available but you cannot afford the travel costs and have exhausted all other options for getting funds, you may be eligible to apply for an emergency loan from the government. This is a last resort option and you would need to repay the loan when you are back in the UK. For more information, you should contact Corporate Travel Management (CTM). CTM are a commercial partner of the FCO and are authorised to administer such loans on behalf of the FCO.
