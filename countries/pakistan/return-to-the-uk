There are currently very limited commercial options available to return to the UK from Pakistan. The Government has suspended normal scheduled international flights to and from Pakistan until at least 21 April.
We know this is concerning for British people trying to leave Pakistan. The UK government is working closely with airlines, the Pakistan authorities and other governments to make sure options are available for you to return to the UK as soon as possible.
What to do
If you cannot leave Pakistan at this time, you should:
follow the advice of local authorities, including local measures to help minimise your risk of exposure to coronavirus
find accommodation that’s suitable for your needs.
keep in regular contact with family and friends at home, so they know you are safe and well
contact your airline separately to seek refunds for any previous flight tickets that you were not able to use.
See more information and advice about staying where you are if you cannot return to the UK.
Future travel options
The UK Government is working to organise a series of special charter flights for British tourists usually resident in the UK, short term visitors and their direct dependants to return to the UK.
This travel advice will be updated when special charter flights are open for booking, with information on how to book tickets, airport locations, ticket costs and financial assistance available.
Sign up for travel advice email alerts and follow the British High Commission on Twitter, Facebook and Instagram.
Pakistan International Airlines (PIA) flights
Pakistan International Airlines (PIA) operated 22 commercial flights between 4-12 April. There was high demand for these flights. There are currently no further flights available on general sale to return to the UK from Pakistan. We understand a small number of flights have been arranged by PIA, including to Manchester, this week. You should contact PIA offices for further information.
You will need to pay for your return travel to the UK. If departure options are available but you cannot afford the travel costs and have exhausted all other options for getting funds, you may be eligible to apply for an emergency loan from the government. This is a last resort option and you would need to repay the loan when you are back in the UK. For more information, you should contact Corporate Travel Management (CTM). CTM are a commercial partner of the FCO and are authorised to administer such loans on behalf of the FCO.
Travel to the airport
If you have a confirmed flight ticket and valid travel document, provincial and federal authorities have assured us that you will be able to travel to the airport. If you have been placed into a quarantine centre, or you are in an area that has been quarantined by the authorities, you may have to wait until the quarantine is lifted before being able to travel to the airport. Follow the advice of the relevant local authorities.
Some provinces have limited the number of people that can be in a vehicle. In addition, people who do not have a flight ticket, except the driver, may not be allowed to accompany travellers to the airport.
You may have your temperature checked on entry to the airport. Those displaying COVID-19 symptoms, including a high temperature, may not be allowed into the airport to board their flight. If you have concerns about Coronavirus symptoms, please see Coronavirus.
Help and support
If you need urgent consular assistance, you can contact the British High Commission on +92 (0) 51 201 2000. Select the option for emergency assistance for British nationals.
The High Commission cannot provide further information or advice about departure options over the phone. This page will be updated when departure options become available. To get the latest information, sign up for travel advice email alerts.
If you’re trying to get back to the UK and need financial help, see the FCO’s guide on financial assistance.
Arrival in the UK
When you arrive back in the UK, follow the guidance for when you return to the UK on steps you should take to protect yourself and others.
Visas
The Ministry of Interior has confirmed that all types of visas issued to foreign nationals who are currently in Pakistan that expire between 15 March 2020 and 30 April 2020 will be deemed to be valid until 30 April 2020.
The standard UK Entry requirements still apply to all those returning to the UK.
