India’s land borders are closed and international flights are currently suspended. There is no guarantee that flights will begin straight away once the lockdown is lifted, so if you have booked a flight with a commercial airline during June 2020 you should be prepared for the possibility that the flight will not operate.

Travel to the airport
Do not travel to the airport without a confirmed ticket, as tickets will not be on sale at the airport.
Once you have a ticket for a UK government charter flight, you will receive guidance on how to travel to the airport:
The British High Commission will provide transport to the airport for passengers of UK government charter flights where possible, and submit the necessary permissions to the Indian government.
Due to ongoing restrictions in India, do not make your own way to the airport for a UK government charter flight, unless in exceptional circumstances we are not able to arrange transport for you.
You should allow plenty of time to get to the airport or your muster point as travelling may be more difficult than normal. You should make sure you are able to show authorities proof of a booked flight (a boarding pass if possible) and your passport.
It may not be possible to buy food or water on the way to the airport, so get these before you travel.
At the airport
You will not be able to travel if you are currently showing coronavirus symptoms (you will need to self-isolate and travel later). You should comply with any additional healthcare screening measures put in place by the authorities prior to your departure.
Your journey home
The National Travel Health Network and Centre (NaTHNaC) provides advice on how to stay safe as you travel by air.
If you’re returning home before 8 June, follow the guidance for when you return to the UK on steps you should take to protect yourself and others. From 8 June there will be new rules for entering the UK.
