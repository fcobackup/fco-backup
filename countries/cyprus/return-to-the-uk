There are currently extremely limited, indirect commercial options available to return to the UK from Cyprus due to the near complete ban on flights to and from Cyprus from 21 March until 17 April. Although a very limited number of commercial flights are still able to leave Cyprus, only humanitarian and cargo flights may arrive.
The Cyprus government is organising repatriation flights from European hubs. The first flight departed from Larnaca to London Heathrow on 9 April.
There may be further Cyprus-government repatriation flights, which could be announced at short notice. Please follow @UKinCyprus social media channels on Facebook and Twitter for future updates.
We know this is concerning for British people trying to leave Cyprus. The UK government is working closely with airlines, the Cypriot authorities and other governments to make sure options are available for you to return to the UK as soon as possible.
There are currently no flights between Turkey and the north of Cyprus until at least 1 May.
What to do
If you cannot leave Cyprus at this time, you should:

find accommodation that’s suitable for your needs. Although hotel accommodation is closed, many private villas remain open. Consult the usual booking websites.
keep in regular contact with family and friends at home, so they know you are safe and well
