Crossing between Gibraltar and Spain
The Gibraltar-Spain border is a busy external Schengen Border and Gibraltar is outside the customs union. In response to the COVID-19 pandemic there are some border restrictions in place. Under the Spanish COVID-19 State of Emergency measures, Spanish authorities will require you to present additional documents at the border check.
Entering Spain from Gibraltar
The Entry Requirements section of the travel advice for Spain sets out the documentation required by the Spanish authorities to cross the border into Spain. Under current border restrictions, only Spanish citizens, those who are legally resident in Spain, frontier workers or those who can prove they need to enter Spain for essential reasons will be allowed to enter.
On entering Spain, Spanish authorities require frontier workers to produce a contract of employment, Spanish green residency certificate (for non-Spanish nationals), as well as ID/Passport.
On 15 May 2020, the Spanish Government imposed COVID-19 quarantine regulations. All new international arrivals entering Spain, including those from Gibraltar, and including Spanish nationals and residents, are required to self-isolate in their residence or hotel for a period of 14 days. However cross-border/frontier workers, transport workers (lorry drivers), crew, and health workers going to work (provided they have not been in contact with anyone with COVID-19) are exempt from the quarantine regulations.
Entering Gibraltar from Spain
On leaving Spain to enter Gibraltar to work, Spanish authorities require frontier workers to produce a contract of employment, Spanish green residency certificate (for non-Spanish nationals), as well as ID/Passport.
Gibraltar Borders and Coastguard Agency have confirmed that at present the Spanish border authorities are allowing passengers with proof of onward flights from Gibraltar (including boarding passes on mobile phones) to leave Spain through the frontier.
Travellers wishing to enter Gibraltar from Spain to fly on to the UK should arrive in Gibraltar on the day of flight departure and make their way straight to the airport terminal. They will need to present evidence of a confirmed flight booking, together with valid travel documents to both the Spanish and Gibraltarian immigration officers. Please note that the Gibraltar airport terminal building does not stay open overnight and it is NOT permitted to spend the night there.
