The information on this page covers the most common types of travel and reflects the UK government’s understanding of the rules currently in place. Unless otherwise stated, this information is for travellers using a full ‘British Citizen’ passport.
The authorities in the country or territory you’re travelling to are responsible for setting and enforcing the rules for entry. If you’re unclear about any aspect of the entry requirements, or you need further reassurance, you’ll need to contact the embassy, high commission or consulate of the country you’re travelling to.
You should also consider checking with your transport provider or travel company to make sure your passport and other travel documents meet their requirements.
Coronavirus
The Thai authorities have introduced new measures in relation to coronavirus.
It is unlikely you will be able to renew a visa by leaving Thailand and returning as Thailand has introduced further measures at its borders. Stay informed and plan accordingly.
The Thai government has announced that they will grant a further automatic extension to visas of all types expiring on or after 26 March 2020. There is no requirement for a supporting letter from your Embassy. The extension will last until 31 July. Interpretation may vary in different areas so please check with your local immigration office. For further information visit the Thai Immigration website](https://immigration.go.th/content/visa_auto_extension) or call the Immigration Bureau hotline 1178. See Coronavirus
Passport validity
Your passport must have at least 6 months’ validity remaining from your date of entry into Thailand. Entry to Thailand is normally refused if you have a passport which is damaged or has pages missing.
If you’re a dual national, you must depart Thailand on the same nationality passport you used to enter. If not, you may experience difficulties as you pass through immigration.
Visas
Under the current Emergency Decree all foreign nationals are barred from entering or transiting Thailand except in certain limited circumstances. See Coronavirus.
On 8 April 2020 the Thai authorities approved changes to the immigration rules meaning that:
If you have a Thai resident visa and normally reside in Thailand but are now overseas and cannot return to Thailand within the required year of departure you will be granted an extension to your compulsory return deadline. However, you are required to return to Thailand as soon as the situation improves.
If you are visiting Thailand and your visa expired after 26 March 2020 you will be granted an automatic extension until 31 July 2020. This applies to all types of visa including tourist, on arrival, marriage, retirement, expat/work, and business.
If you are required to provide notification of staying in Thailand and your stay permit expires between 26 March and 31 July 2020 it will be automatically extended. However, when the situation improves or returns to normal, you will need to follow normal processes under the instruction of the Immigration Bureau.
If you have any queries about visas or entry requirements, check with the Royal Thai Embassy or Thai Immigration Authority.
Under normal circumstances, British passport holders arriving by air or land can enter Thailand for 30 days without a visa (a ‘visa exemption’). If you need to stay longer, it’s possible to extend your stay once for up to 30 days. You must apply for the extension before your visa exemption period ends.
You can only enter Thailand through a land border using the 30 day visa exemption twice per calendar year. To cross more frequently, you’ll need to get the appropriate visa in advance of travelling. This doesn’t apply if arriving by air. For more information, contact the nearest Thai embassy or consulate.
If you plan to stay in Thailand for longer than 30 days, are going to work, or use land borders regularly you must get the appropriate visa before you travel.
The only legal way of getting a new visa, entry permit or extension of stay is from a Thai Embassy or Consulate, an Immigration Officer at a point of entry into Thailand, or one of the Immigration Offices around the country. Visas issued by visa shops, travel agents or by any other means are likely to be illegal and lead to criminal proceedings.
If you stay beyond the period of your visa (‘overstay’), you’ll be fined 500 baht per day up to a maximum of 20,000 baht. You also risk being held in detention, fined, deported at your own expense and banned from re-entering Thailand. The enforcement of penalties for overstaying is strict and conditions in detention centres can be harsh. Deportation by the Thai authorities can be a lengthy process and you will also be banned from re-entering Thailand for up to 10 years.
If you’re living or staying in Thailand on a long-term visa, immigration rules can be complex and are subject to change. At present, if you stay in Thailand long-term, you must report to immigration authorities every 90 days. If you change your address, you must notify your local police station within 24 hours. If you travel to another province for more than 24 hours, you must report to the local immigration office or police station within 24 hours, and again report to your local immigration office within 48 hours of returning to your home address. It is your responsibility to ensure you meet the requirements of your visa. Stay informed and contact your local immigration office for more information.
If you have any queries about visas or entry requirements, check with the Royal Thai Embassy or Thai Immigration Authority.
Proof of onward travel and funds
Immigration officials in Thailand may ask you for proof of onward travel (e.g. a return or onward air ticket). You should make all reservations before travelling to Thailand. Some airlines have refused to board passengers without evidence of onward travel.
Immigration officials may also ask for evidence of adequate finances and have refused entry to people who could not show this. This is not defined in law and can be interpreted in a number of ways.
Employment
To work in Thailand you will need a work permit or business visa. Failure to observe this rule can lead to arrest and deportation.
Yellow fever certificate requirements
Check whether you need a yellow fever certificate by visiting the National Travel Health Network and Centre’s TravelHealthPro website.
UK Emergency Travel Documents
UK Emergency Travel Documents (ETDs) are accepted for entry, airside transit and exit from Thailand. If you’re planning to enter Thailand using a UK ETD, you should contact the nearest Thai Embassy or Consulate before you travel to seek advice about whether a visa is required. If you’re requesting a two-way ETD from Thailand, you must provide proof that you have a non-immigrant visa.
