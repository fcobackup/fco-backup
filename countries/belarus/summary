The FCDO advise against all travel to Belarus.
Russian military operations are taking place in Belarus. There is some risk that direct conflict may take place within Belarus. In the event of conflict, our ability to offer consular assistance will be severely limited. Routes out of the country are limited, particularly by air. The FCDO advises against all travel to Ukraine. You should not attempt to cross into Ukraine from Belarus. See Safety and security

In May 2021 a Ryanair flight from Athens to Vilnius was diverted while in Belarusian airspace and made an emergency landing at Minsk International Airport. In response, the UK government issued an advisory notice to strongly advise all UK airlines to cease overflights of Belarusian airspace. The operating permit of the Belarusian airline Belavia to fly between the UK and Belarus has been suspended. See Safety and security
Although there is no recent history of terrorism in Belarus, attacks cannot be ruled out. Attacks could happen anywhere and could affect western interests and places visited by foreigners. See Terrorism
Most visits by British nationals to Belarus are trouble-free. However, we currently recommend against all travel to Belarus due to the increased threat of military action within the country.
If you’re abroad and you need emergency help from the UK government, contact the nearest British embassy, consulate or high commission. The Minsk embassy can be contacted on +375 17 229-82-00.
