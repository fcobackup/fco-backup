Severe flooding and landslides have been reported in some regions, especially Cauca and Nariño. Heavy showers are expected to continue through the end of June.

The security situation can change very quickly in many areas of the country. You should pay close attention to warnings issued by the Colombian authorities. In general, the more remote the area, the greater the potential threat to your safety. Terrorists are very likely to try to carry out attacks in Colombia. See Terrorism
