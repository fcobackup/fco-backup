See the TravelHealthPro website for further advice on travel abroad and reducing spread of respiratory viruses during the COVID-19 pandemic.
Everyone should comply with the measures put in place in Cuba to limit the spread of coronavirus (COVID-19). On 11 June, the Government set out three recovery phases that will gradually lift the measures in place. Havana is in phase one from 3 July; Matanzas is in phase one; all other Provinces are into phase two.
International travel
There are no scheduled commercial flight options available to return to the UK from Cuba. Flights are suspended until 31 July 2020. Check with your travel company for the latest information.
Entry and borders
See Entry requirements to find out what you will need to do when you arrive in Cuba.
There have been special commercial repatriation flights available since April. Whenever there is one, the information is shared on the Embassy Facebook page and Embassy Twitter account
During the period of Cuban government coronavirus measures, visa extension requirements have been suspended while immigration offices have had limited services. If you are still in Cuba and your visa has expired or will expire while flights are suspended, you should keep in touch with the local immigration office; there is one in each municipality.
Havana airport is open for humanitarian and repatriation flights. Only Cuban nationals and foreign residents can enter on those flights. Commercial flights are suspended until 31 July (subject to review).
From 1 July, Tourists can enter Cuba on international charter flights arriving directly into these destinations: Cayo Coco, Cayo Cruz or Cayo Guillermo (served by Jardines del Rey airport); Cayo Santa Maria (flying into Santa Clara airport), or Cayo Largo del Sur. Passengers may only bring one check-in bag each, up to a maximum of 32kgs.
Foreign boats (yachts, etc) are not allowed in Cuban waters yet.
If you have dual British and Cuban nationality, you are subject to Cuban measures and should check your immigration status to clarify if you can leave Cuba while current travel restrictions are in place (and when flights resume). If you need permission to leave, you should get this from the immigration office in Havana; permission cannot be given at the airport.
Travel in Cuba
There is a difference in a travel and transport for Provinces in Phase 1 (Havana and Matanzas) and the rest in phase 2 of the national recovery plan.
Transport services are starting to resume in Havana and Matanzas, with limited numbers of passengers allowed on buses and in taxis. There are no transport services allowed between Havana and Matanzas or with other Provinces. Car rental is not allowed. There are taxis running to and from the airport. There will not be any train services until Havana is in phase 2.
For all other Provinces, the transport services within the Provinces have been resuming, with limited numbers of passengers, as has inter-provincial travel between Provinces in phase two of the recovery plan. Only passengers with tickets are allowed to enter the bus stations.
Face masks must be worn at all times when travelling on buses and in taxis. Tourists arriving on charter flights to the Cayos (see Entry and Borders above) will be transported to their resort by bus and must wear a mask during the transfer. Tourists in the five Cayos can rent cars but they cannot leave the Cayo.
Accommodation
Hotels and guest houses are starting to reopen for Cubans and foreign residents of Cuba (known as ‘national tourism’) but to a limited occupancy (between 30 and 50%). Guests may have to wear face masks in some hotel facilities. Medical teams may visit to check on health of guests, including taking their temperature.
Campsites are also starting to reopen to a limited capacity.
International tourists are only allowed into the Hotels in the five Cayos, arriving on international charter flights (see Entry and Borders above).
Hotels must limit the numbers of people using facilities at any one time, especially swimming pools and elevators.
Public spaces and services
Wearing a face mask in public is compulsory as is social distancing of a minimum of one metre.
Shops in all Provinces can open but must limit the number of customers within the shop. This means there are queues to enter shops.
Cafés, bars and restaurants are re-opening but must limit the number of customers (around 30% capacity) and separate tables by 1.5 metres. No dancing is allowed during phase one or phase two of the recovery plan.
Social clubs, gyms, museums, etc are also re-opening to a limited capacity and visitors must observe social distancing.
Swimming pools can open to a limited capacity and to restricted visit times, to allow cleaning for the next opening times.
Beaches are open but limited numbers of people are allowed during phase one and phase two. There will be personnel at the beaches to manage access. Churches are also able to re-open for services.
Provinces in phase two of the recovery plan (currently all except Havana and Matanzas), can start to re-open theatres and cinemas and hold some sporting events.
Healthcare in Cuba
If you think you have COVID-19 symptoms, you should contact a local clinic straight away. If you are staying in a hotel, the hotel reception will be able to contact them for you.
If you are staying in private home or a hotel, you are likely to receive regular home checks by medical representatives (known as “pesquisia”). The Hotels in the Cayos for International tourists have medical teams 24/7.
