Entry rules in response to coronavirus
Entry to Timor-Leste
The Government of Timor-Leste has stopped the implementation of State of Emergency. The latest one ended on 28 November 2021. Entry to national territory continues to be subject to medical screening. If a passenger is found infected with COVID-19, he or she will be taken to quarantine for further consultation and treatment. All passengers travelling to Timor-Leste should always present to the airport competent authorities the following: vaccination certificate and a negative COVID-19 PCR test result done within the last 72 hours before the time of departure. The test needs to be in one of these language: Indonesian, Portuguese or English. Failure to present the two documents, will be subjected to 14 days of quarantine.
You should not use the NHS testing service to get a test in order to facilitate your travel to another country. You should arrange to take a private test.
Quarantine requirements
To enter Timor-Leste you will need to be in possession of a vaccination certificate and negative COVID-19 PCR test result done within the last 72 hours before the time of departure. The test needs to be in one of these languages: Indonesian, Portuguese or English. For passengers who fail to present the two documents will be subjected to 14 days of quarantine.
Those who have been fully vaccinated and hold a valid vaccination certificate will be exempt from mandatory quarantine.
Those who present symptoms of COVID-19, including a fever greater than 37.5°C, cough and/or breathing difficulties will be prevented from travelling, and taken to a health facility for a COVID-19 test.
For someone returning a positive result, they will be contacted by the authorities and isolated in either a health establishment (e.g the national hospital), an isolation centre, such as those at Tasi Tolu, Vera Cruz and Lahane or at home. Where the positive patient isolates is at the discretion of the Ministry of Health.
Testing on departure
Those wishing to leave Timor-Leste will be subject to health control measures including body temperature checks. Passengers are screened before entering the check-in area at Dili Airport. Those with symptoms of COVID-19 will not be allowed to board the aircraft and will be required to undergo a COVID-19 test, regardless of having a negative test result from within 48 or 72 hours of the flight. The situation in Timor-Leste can change quickly. In exceptional cases, the Government may introduce temporary border closures.
Regular entry requirements
Visas
A tourist visa costs US$30 and can normally be issued to the holder of a valid British passport on arrival at Dili International airport or Dili seaport, provided entry into Timor-Leste is regarded as being for a legitimate purpose. The visa will be valid for a single entry and will allow you to stay for up to 30 days.
British Citizens intending to enter the country via the Indonesia (West Timor) land border crossing at Atambua/Batugade need to apply in Kupang for a tourism visa in advance. This visa will generally be valid for a single entry and a duration of up to 30 days.
In Dili, tourism visas can be extended to a total of 90 days, for a fee.
If you plan to travel overland (rather than by the ferry) to the exclave of Oecussi you’ll need to apply for an additional visa. You must present your round trip ticket and complete the required forms at your nearest Timor-Leste embassy or consulate, or in Dili, prior to travel. For information on other types of visa see the Immigration Department of Timor-Leste.
