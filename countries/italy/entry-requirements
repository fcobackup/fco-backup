The information on this page covers the most common types of travel and reflects the UK government’s understanding of the rules currently in place. Unless otherwise stated, this information is for travellers using a full ‘British Citizen’ passport.
The authorities in the country or territory you’re travelling to are responsible for setting and enforcing the rules for entry. If you’re unclear about any aspect of the entry requirements, or you need further reassurance, you’ll need to contact the embassy, high commission or consulate of the country or territory you’re travelling to.
You should also consider checking with your transport provider or travel company to make sure your passport and other travel documents meet their requirements.
Entry rules in response to coronavirus (COVID-19)
Entry to Italy from the UK
A negative COVID-19 test result is required when you arrive in Italy from the UK.
The test needs to have been carried out in the 72 hours prior to your travel and should be a molecular (PCR) or an antigenic test. You’ll be asked to show proof of your test date and result at the border.
You should not use the NHS testing service to get a test in order to facilitate your travel to another country. You should arrange to take a private test.
Alternatively, you can take a free COVID-19 test at the airport when you arrive in Italy. You will have to self-isolate at your hotel or accommodation until you get the results back from your test.
At some airports, fast testing is available, and you will be able to get your results within an hour. At these airports, you usually won’t be allowed to leave until your results are available. Check the website of the airport you are flying to for more information on their process and operating times.
Remember that if you test positive, you will be quarantined until two consecutive negative tests have been recorded. The time spent in quarantine can vary greatly from a few days to several weeks. Travellers should be prepared for this eventuality.
Some airports in Italy do not have COVID-19 testing facilities. If you are flying to one of these airports (or if the facility is closed when you arrive) then you will be required to self-isolate and take a test at an alternative facility within 48 hours of your arrival instead. You should call the COVID-19 helpline for the region you are in to arrange this. You can be fined if you do not comply with this requirement.
Even if you don’t need to book a test, you still need to call the COVID-19 helpline for the region you are travelling within 48 hours of your arrival to inform them of your visit.
You can read more about the requirement to get a COVID-19 test (including when you might be exempt) on the website of the Italian Embassy in London.
Entry to Italy from outside the UK
Travellers arriving into Italy from Spain, the Netherlands, Belgium, The Czech Republic and France must also undertake the compulsory COVID-19 test.
Measures for all travellers
In addition to the above measures, all travellers to Italy must;
download and complete a self-declaration form from the Ministry of Foreign Affairs before travel. You must provide this to your airline/transport provider, or to the border police if you are stopped for checks.
self-isolate on arrival for 14 days if, in the 14 days prior to your arrival in Italy, you have stayed in or transited through a country where Italy continues to require self-isolation. If these conditions apply to you, then you must report promptly to the local health authorities. If you cannot self-isolate for 14 days for any reason, then entry to Italy may be refused.
More information on these requirements is available on the Ministry of Foreign Affairs frequently asked questions page and online questionnaire.
Many airlines and airports serving Italy are resuming service, but may not be operating to their usual schedules. You are strongly advised to check your airline’s website, as well as the website for the airport you are intending to fly to for the latest information. You should also expect to be asked to wear a face mask throughout your flight and within the airport terminal.
Travel to Sardinia
If you are travelling to the island of Sardinia, you need to register your trip in advance. More information on this requirement is available on the regional website of Sardinia.
Travel via neighbouring countries
You should check travel advice for any countries you plan to travel through ahead of your journey.
Regular entry requirements
Visas
If you hold a British Citizen passport, you don’t need a visa to enter Italy. If you’re planning a stay of longer than 3 months, see our Living in Italy guide and contact the Italian Embassy if you have further questions.
The rules on travel will stay the same until 31 December 2020.
Visas from 1 January 2021
The rules for travelling or working in Europe will change from 1 January 2021:
You will be able to travel to countries in the Schengen area for up to 90 days in any 180-day period without a visa for purposes such as tourism. This is a rolling 180-day period.
Therefore, if you’re travelling to Italy, previous visits to the Schengen area within the 180 days before your date of travel would count against the 90-day limit.
If you are travelling visa-free to Italy and to other countries in the Schengen area, make sure your whole visit is within the limit.
To stay for longer, to work or study, or for business travel you will need to meet the entry requirements set out by Italy. This could mean applying for a visa or work permit. You should check with the Italian Embassy what type of visa, if any, you will need.
Periods of stay authorised under a visa or permit will not count against the 90-day limit.
The European Commission has not yet set out how the limit of 90 days in any 180-day period for visa-free travel will be implemented for those who are already travelling in the EU or Schengen Area on 31 December 2020.
If you are travelling to Italy before 31 December 2020 and will stay until 1 January 2021 or later, you should check with the Italian Embassy for information on how the 90-day visa-free limit will apply to you. This also applies if your stay includes travel to other Schengen area countries.
At border control for Italy, you may need to:
show a return or onward ticket
show you have enough money for your stay
use separate lanes from EU, EEA and Swiss citizens when queuing
Your passport may be stamped on entry and exit.
Passport validity
The rules on travel will stay the same until 31 December 2020.
Your passport should be valid for the proposed duration of your stay; you don’t need any additional period of validity on your passport beyond this.
Passport validity from 1 January 2021
From 1 January 2021, you must have at least 6 months left on an adult or child passport to travel to most countries in Europe (not including Ireland).
If you renewed your current passport before the previous one expired, extra months may have been added to its expiry date. Any extra months on your passport over 10 years may not count towards the 6 months needed.
Check your passport is valid for travel before you book your trip. You will need to renew your passport before travelling if you do not have enough time left on your passport.
UK Emergency Travel Documents
UK Emergency Travel Documents (ETDs) are accepted for entry, airside transit and exit from Italy.
