There are currently extremely limited commercial options available to return to the UK from Senegal. The Government of Senegal has closed land borders and airspace has been closed to commercial airlines except for flights with ‘special authorisation’.
We know this is concerning for British people trying to leave Senegal. The UK government is working closely with airlines, the Senegal authorities and other governments to make sure options are available for you to return to the UK as soon as possible.
Future travel options
The UK government is working closely with airlines, the Senegal authorities and other governments to make sure options are available for you to return to the UK as soon as possible.
This travel advice will be updated when departure options become available. Sign up for travel advice email alerts.
The British Embassy in Dakar is also asking all British nationals currently in Senegal to make themselves known to the Embassy by emailing UKinSenegal@fco.gov.uk.
Travelling to the airport
If you’re travelling to the airport, you should plan to arrive in time to respect the curfew and for your driver to also be able to return in time.
The British Embassy understands that you should be able to travel to the airport for a flight that has ‘special authorisation’, but you should expect to show your travel documents (passport and plane ticket) to any officials that may stop you during your journey. Make sure that your driver has photocopies of these documents to justify travel during their return journey.
Carte d’etranger
It is not currently possible to obtain a “carte d’etranger” due to coronavirus restrictions.
If you have been in Senegal for over 3 months, Senegalese authorities have advised this should not present a problem when leaving Senegal, provided that the 3 month period expired after the State of Emergency was put in place (23 March).
Your journey home
The National Travel Health Network and Centre (NaTHNaC) provides advice on how to stay safe as you travel by air.
When you arrive back in the UK, follow the guidance for when you return to the UK on steps you should take to protect yourself and others.
