Zambia’s borders remain open, but under tight screening, and there remain commercial options to return to the UK from Zambia. Anyone entering Zambia, including returning residents, will undergo COVID-19 testing by nasal swab on arrival and mandatory quarantine for a period of no less than 14 days at a government designated facility at their own cost. Travellers to Zambia are not allowed to leave Zambia until they have completed the quarantine period. All tourist visas to Zambia have been cancelled. See Coronavirus, Return to the UK
Given the rapidly changing situation in the region, we have temporarily withdrawn a limited number of UK staff and their dependants from our High Commission in Lusaka. The High Commission is continuing to carry out essential work including providing 24/7 consular assistance and support to British people in Zambia.
