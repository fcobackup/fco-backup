This page has information on travelling to Cambodia.
This page reflects the UK government’s understanding of current rules for people travelling on a full ‘British Citizen’ passport from the UK, for the most common types of travel.
The authorities in Cambodia set and enforce entry rules. If you’re unsure how Cambodia’s entry requirements apply to you, contact its UK embassy, high commission or consulate
All travellers
You will need a visa to enter or travel through Cambodia as a visitor. Tourist visas can be applied for online or obtained on arrival.
You no longer need to show a pre-arrival COVID-19 test, full COVID-19 vaccination card or certificate, or a passenger’s health declaration on arrival in Cambodia. This applies at all land, sea or air entry points.
Remote temperature checkers will still be in use at entry and exit gates.
If you’re fully vaccinated
Entry requirements for Cambodia are the same for all travellers, regardless of COVID-19 vaccination status.
If you’re not fully vaccinated
Entry requirements for Cambodia are the same for all travellers, regardless of COVID-19 vaccination status.
Children and young people
There are no specific requirements for children and young people.
If you’re transiting through Cambodia
Transiting through Cambodia and staying in the airport (airside) is not currently permitted.
If you are transiting through Cambodia on your way to another country and will be passing through immigration (sometimes known as a layover), for example to stay in a hotel for a flight the next day, you need to meet the entry requirements applicable to your vaccination status.
Check your passport and travel documents before you travel
Check with your travel provider to make sure your passport and other travel documents meet their requirements.
Passport validity
Your passport should be valid for a minimum period of 6 months from the date of entry into Cambodia. Entry is normally refused if you have a damaged passport or pages missing.
Your passport should also be valid for a minimum period of 6 months for any subsequent renewal or extension of your visa that you apply for from within Cambodia.
Visas
Visa fees, conditions and photograph requirements are subject to change. Check the Ministry of Foreign Affairs & International Co-operation website for the latest information on fees, conditions and photograph requirements and on how to apply for an e-visa.
Tourist visas issued by a Royal Cambodian Embassy abroad may appear to have a longer validity than 1 month. The validity of the visa refers to the time you have to enter Cambodia. The visa is valid for 30 days from the actual date of entry into Cambodia. Make sure your passport is stamped on arrival, and keep the departure form. If you lose your departure form, you’ll need to contact immigration officials before you leave the country to make alternative arrangements.
You can be fined, detained and deported if you overstay your visa. There is a fine of $10 per day for overstaying the validity of your visa. There is no limit to this fine. Those who overstay more than 30 days will need to leave Cambodia in addition to paying the fine.
If you lose your passport and need to leave Cambodia on a UK Emergency Travel Document, you will need to get an exit visa. See UK Emergency Travel Documents
Foreigner registration
The Cambodian Department of Immigration has launched an online registration system for foreigners living in, or visiting Cambodia. The Foreigners Present in Cambodia System (FPCS) will be used to record arrival and exit data. Its main objective is to protect foreigner safety and security in case of an emergency during their stay in Cambodia.
All foreign visitors or residents, living or travelling in Cambodia, regardless of length of stay or purpose of visit, should register on the FPCS app. It is recommended to register on the FPCS prior to arrival. Foreign visitors or residents who fail to register on the FCPS app may be unable to extend their visa should they subsequently need to.
If you are renting accommodation in Cambodia, your landlord is responsible for registering you on the FCPS app. You should provide them with the information required, but you should check with your landlord to confirm that they have registered you on the app, and if not, then to ask them to do so.
If you have no landlord or own your own home in Cambodia, you will need to register yourself.
You can download the app for Android or iOS. Once downloaded, there are 6 steps to enable registration:
create an account (phone number, password)
upload a copy of your passport
verify information
enter a valid phone number and password
verify
add information about your accommodation
registration is completed
The Royal Government of Cambodia has announced, with immediate effect, an end to the automatic extension of tourist visas and the exemption of tourist visa overstay fines for foreigners.
UK Visa Application Centre (VAC) and services
the UK-VFS Visa Application Centre in Cambodia is open and accepting visa application appointments
applications for new passports must also be processed through the VAC. New passports may take longer to be issued, due to restrictions imposed on workplaces during the pandemic
for consular related enquiries, you can submit your enquiry via the contact form on our website
If you lose your passport and need to leave Cambodia on a UK Emergency Travel Document, you will need to get an exit visa. See UK Emergency Travel Documents
Regional travel
All land border crossing between Cambodia and Laos, Cambodia and Thailand, and Cambodia and Vietnam are now open.
Recent changes to visa requirements for Thailand may affect travellers wishing to make regular crossings at the land border between Cambodia and Thailand. See travel advice for Thailand for further information.
For further information about regional travel, see the travel advice for the specific country.
More general information on land border crossings from Laos and Vietnam is available at the Ministry of Foreign Affairs & International Co-operation website.
Work permits
To work in Cambodia, you’ll need a valid business visa and a valid work permit. Business visas are issued by the Immigration Department and are usually available on arrival in Phnom Penh airport, or at the Immigration Department. You may be able to apply for a Business visa in advance at your nearest Cambodian Embassy. Your employer will need to apply for your work permit from the Department of Labour and Social Affairs.
The Cambodian government is now enforcing these rules more strictly than in previous years. There is some uncertainty about whether the government will impose charges retroactively on individuals who did not have valid work permits previously. Procedures are subject to change and you should always consult the relevant Cambodian government department for the latest advice.
