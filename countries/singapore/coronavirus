Cases of coronavirus (COVID-19) have been confirmed in Singapore. The Singapore authorities have introduced a number of measures to limit the spread of the virus.
Visitors
From 23 March at 23:59 local time, no short-term visitors from anywhere in the world will be able to enter or transit through Singapore.
Work pass holders and Permanent Residents
All work pass holders must comply with all Singapore government regulations or face their passes being revoked and fines/jail.
From 23 March at 23:59 local time, the Singaporean Ministry of Manpower will only allow work pass holders and/or their dependents to enter/return to Singapore if they work in essential services eg. healthcare and transport. These work pass holders are required to obtain approval from the Ministry of Manpower before they start their journey.
All other work pass holders will be refused entry or risk deportation if they do not comply.
Permanent Residents will be permitted to return to Singapore but will be issued with a 14-day Stay at Home Notice (SHN). From 11:59 local time Wednesday 25 March all visitors entering Singapore from the UK or the US will be required to serve their 14 days SHN isolated in a hotel room or similar accommodation provided by the Singapore government. If you are issued with a SHN you must serve the whole of your SHN period and must remain at your designated location at all times, or face a fine and a jail term of up to six months. No one with an extant SHN will be allowed to board a plane to leave Singapore.
From 27 March at 09:00 local time, Permanent Residents and approved work pass holders arriving in Singapore must submit an online health declaration in advance of their arrival into Singapore. Otherwise it will need to be completed upon entry and may result in delays to immigration clearance.
Transit
From 23 March at 23:59 local time, no short-term visitors will be permitted to transit through Singapore.
If your planned journey requires you to transit through Singapore, you should contact your airline immediately.
Leaving Singapore
This significant tightening of restrictions on those who can enter or transit via Singapore is likely to have an impact on the availability of flight options to leave Singapore. British nationals in Singapore who wish to leave, including visitors, should make arrangements to do so as soon as possible. You may otherwise find you are not able to leave Singapore when you had planned to.
