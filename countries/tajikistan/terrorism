On 29 July 2018, 7 tourists from western countries were cycling near Dangara in southern Tajikistan when a local man drove into them. This was a deliberate attack. Four of the 7 cyclists were killed by the vehicle’s impact and wounds sustained in a subsequent knife attack carried out by the occupants of the car. This is the first incident of its kind in Tajikistan. While the motives are not clear, the terrorist group Daesh (formerly referred to as ISIL) claimed responsibility. In light of this incident, you should exercise extreme caution and vigilance, particularly if hiking or cycling in the countryside.
