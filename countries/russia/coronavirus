Cases of coronavirus (COVID-19) have been confirmed in Russia. The Russian authorities have introduced measures to limit the spread of the virus.
Entry and borders
On 30 March, temporary restrictions on entry and exit via Russia’s land borders, including with Belarus, were enforced as part of wider coronavirus-related measures. Duration of these remains unspecified. The restrictions do not apply to certain groups including members of diplomatic missions.
On 18 March the Russian government introduced restrictions on entry into the whole country for almost all foreign citizens until 1 May 2020. These restrictions do not apply to certain groups including those with permanent residency in Russia and members of diplomatic missions.
On 19 March, the Russian government announced that all arrivals to the country should self-isolate at home for a period of 14 days, regardless of whether they show symptoms. You should comply with any additional screening measures put in place by the authorities.
The Russian Prime Minister also announced that anyone arriving into the airports will be tested for COVID-19 at the airport on arrival.
Visas
Visa extensions of up to 90 days will be granted for those nationals who are in Russia at present but cannot travel back to the UK, regardless of the purpose of entry. However, while the self-quarantine measures imposed by the Moscow City Government from 30 March are in place, the Moscow Migration Service will not be providing services to foreign nationals. If you need to extend your visa, once these self-quarantine measures are lifted you should go to the nearest migration office of the Russian Ministry of Internal Affairs, or contact your visa facilitation company, if you have one. This applies for both those with valid visas and those with visas which have, or will have, expired by the end of the self-quarantine measures. Commercial flight options from Moscow to the UK are no longer available. If you want to travel back to the UK or have a return ticket to do so, please contact your airline to discuss your options.

(i) undertake essential employment
(ii) go to hospital and

From 28 March all restaurants, cafes, bars, canteens/eateries, shops, parks and hairdressers in Moscow were closed. Food shops, pharmacies, medical/rehabilitation services, social services, transport services, banks and insurers will remain open.
From 30 March all Moscow inhabitants must self-isolate, except for those seeking urgent medical assistance, travelling to essential work, visiting the nearest food shop or pharmacy, walking pets within 100m of their property and taking out rubbish. Social distancing of 1.5m is to be followed everywhere except in taxis. The measures do not restrict the use of private cars and taxis, nor entry and exit to the city.
On 30 March the Russian Prime Minister instructed all Russian regions to prepare similar measures.
