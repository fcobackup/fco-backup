Travel in Pakistan
Public transport has restarted across Pakistan with some restrictions.
Domestic flight operations have restarted at all airports in Pakistan.
Rail and bus travel has also restarted, including inter-city and inter-province travel. However, there are mandatory standard operating procedures for public transport including social distancing and restrictions on numbers of passengers. You must wear a face covering when in public across Pakistan including on public transport, punishable by fine.
Authorities can impose local restrictions on travel to prevent the spread of coronavirus. You should follow the federal and relevant provincial guidance, and monitor local media for updates.
Travel to the airport
If you’re in an area that is under coronavirus lock-down by the authorities, you may have to wait until the lock-down is lifted before you can travel to the airport. Follow the advice of the relevant local authorities. If you are not allowed to travel across a checkpoint whilst travelling to an airport for your flight, call the British High Commission on 051 201 2000.
You’re strongly advised not to travel to the airport if you’re displaying any COVID-19 symptoms, including a high temperature. When you enter the airport, you will be thermal scanned by the Pakistani authorities. If you have a high temperature or other COVID-19 symptoms, you will not be permitted to fly and may be asked to self-isolate for 14 days before you can travel. You may also be referred to a medical facility. Call us on 051 201 2000 if you’re moved to a medical facility.
Public places and services
Pakistani authorities have lifted restrictions on some public activities. Public facilities like restaurants, cafes, cinemas, theatres, gyms, and religious institutions have been allowed to re-open. The tourism sector has also been allowed to re-open. However, restrictions may be re-imposed based on the levels of COVID-19 in the country.
There are mandatory standard operating procedures which must be followed in public spaces, including the use of face masks, temperature screening and social distancing. Across Pakistan, it is now mandatory to wear a face mask in public and not wearing one is punishable by a fine.
There are additional varying measures in force in each province including compulsory self-isolation for people who have COVID-19 symptoms, or people who have come into contact with others with COVID-19 symptoms. In some cases, authorities are locking down specific areas. Some provinces have introduced powers to fine or arrest anyone breaking the rules.
You should follow the federal and relevant provincial guidance, and monitor local media for updates. Plan any movements accordingly.
At the airport
You must wear a face mask at the airport. You will need to bring your own mask with you. Airlines and airport authorities will not provide masks.
You’re advised to bring sufficient food for your wait at the airport and a refillable water bottle.
The Pakistan Civil Aviation Authority (CAA) require the plane to be disinfected prior to departing for Pakistan. Luggage will also be disinfected before it is loaded onto the plane. Cabin Crew will be required to wear personal protective equipment (PPE).
Healthcare in Pakistan
There is a risk that the healthcare system will come under significant strain as the number of COVID-19 cases increases. Access to routine and emergency healthcare may be limited.
The Pakistani authorities have announced a helpline (on phone number 1166) for people who have COVID-19 symptoms like fever, cough and difficulty breathing. If you’re worried about the virus, or suspect you may have contracted it, call the helpline and follow the guidance given by the authorities. You can also check the official government of Pakistan website on COVID-19.
If you’re running out of medication or have medical needs, you should speak to your travel insurance company for advice and seek local medical assistance, including from pharmacies. Pharmacies remain open in Pakistan and many medicines can be purchased over the counter. If your usual medication is not available, speak to your travel insurer, ask a local doctor or request advice from your UK doctor.
Pharmacies have remained open during COVID-19 lockdowns as they are exempted from lockdown closure. Major hospitals have pharmacies which operate 24 hours a day and there have been no restrictions in accessing hospitals during COVID-19 lockdowns.
If planning to travel to Pakistan with your medicine, please consult NHS advice before travel.
