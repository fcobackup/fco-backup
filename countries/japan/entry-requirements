This page has information on travelling to Japan. Check what you must do to return to the UK.
This page reflects the UK government’s understanding of current rules for people travelling on a full ‘British Citizen’ passport from the UK, for the most common types of travel.
The authorities in Japan set and enforce entry rules.
All travellers
Foreign nationals (including British nationals) who do not have Status of Residence are not currently permitted to enter Japan for any purpose, other than in exceptional circumstances.
Foreign nationals with Status of Residence who leave or have left Japan with a valid re-entry permit are in principle allowed to re-enter the country. Please note that bookings on some flight routes have been restricted or suspended, and that those without a valid re-entry permit will be denied re-entry.
As part of travelling to Japan, you must:
Take a COVID-19 test within 72 hours before your flight departure time, and obtain proof of a negative result in an approved format.
(Before disembarkation) Sign a written pledge that commits you to the quarantine and self-isolation rules and to a number of other requirements.
(Before disembarkation) Complete an online health questionnaire and obtain a QR code.
At immigration, you will be asked to submit the above documentation, to take another COVID-19 test (and await the results at the airport), and to install COVID-19 tracing applications on your smartphone or other device.
If you are travelling from a country – such as the UK – where the Omicron variant is dominant, you will then be required to undertake 7 days of quarantine and self-isolation. If you are coming from the UK, you must spend the first 6 days in quarantine in a government-provided hotel. You will need to take a COVID-19 test on Day 3 and Day 6 (the day of arrival counts as Day 0). If the tests are negative, you will be permitted to move into self-isolation at home or in a self-arranged hotel for the remainder of the 7-day period. You will be asked to report your location and health condition on a daily basis.
Further information on these requirements is available on the Japanese Ministry of Health, Labour and Welfare website, and on the Ministry of Foreign Affairs website. Please note that the rules may be subject to change at short notice.
Failure to comply with the regulations could lead to detention under the Quarantine Act, to the release of your name and information related to reducing the spread of infection, and/or to possible revocation of your Status of Residence and subsequent deportation.
Under normal circumstances, if you have a ‘British Citizen’ or ‘British National (Overseas)’ passport, you can enter Japan as a visitor for up to 90 days without a visa. You may need to provide evidence of a return or onward ticket. However, due to the COVID-19 pandemic Japan has suspended its visa waiver system. Japan has also suspended entry visas issued by Japanese Embassies and Consulates-General in the UK prior to 20 March 2020. Anyone arriving in the country without a valid visa will not be able to enter.
Please also note that it is illegal to work in Japan without the correct visa, however informal or temporary the work. Don’t overstay your permission to remain in the country, otherwise you risk arrest, detention and a heavy fine.
If you’re fully vaccinated
You can use the NHS COVID Pass to demonstrate your vaccination record in Japan. Your NHS appointment card from vaccination centres is not designed to be used as proof of vaccination and should not be used to demonstrate your vaccination status.
Proof of vaccination does not exempt you from any of the rules and regulations outlined above.
If you’re not fully vaccinated
You must follow the rules and regulations outlined above.
If you’ve had COVID-19 in the past year
Proof of prior infection does not afford exemptions. You must follow the rules and regulations outlined above.
Children and young people
Minors are not exempt from the above requirements. There may be some flexibility on pre-flight testing requirements for children aged 5 and under, but this cannot be guaranteed.
If you’re transiting through Japan
Transiting is when you pass through one country on the way to your final destination.
The COVID-19 regulations and requirements outlined above do not apply to passengers who are transiting through one Japanese airport and do not go through immigration. However, transit may be precluded by airport closures, movement between terminals and delays between arriving and departing flights. Check with your airline whether your connection is feasible before boarding a flight to Japan.
When transiting through Japan, you should comply with any additional screening measures put in place by the authorities. You should also check the latest entry requirements for your final destination.
Exemptions
Foreign nationals (including British nationals) who do not have Status of Residence may be allowed to enter Japan in exceptional circumstances. Such exceptional circumstances may include:
If you departed Japan with a re-entry permit before 31 August 2020 and were not permitted to re-enter Japan before the permit expired.
If you are a spouse or child of a Japanese national or permanent resident.
If you hold diplomatic or official status.
You can find a fuller description of exceptional circumstances on the Ministry of Foreign Affairs website. If you believe you may qualify, contact your nearest Japanese Embassy for more information.
Check your passport and travel documents before you travel
If you are visiting Japan, your passport should be valid for the duration of your stay. No additional period of validity beyond this is required.
UK Emergency Travel Documents are accepted for entry, airside transit and exit from Japan.
Check with your travel provider to make sure your passport and other travel documents meet their requirements.
Medication
The use or possession of some common prescription and over-the-counter medicines is banned under Japan’s strictly enforced anti-stimulant drugs law. This includes Vicks inhalers, medicines for allergies and sinus problems, cold and flu medication containing Pseudoephedrine and even some over-the-counter painkillers like those containing codeine. Foreign nationals have been detained and deported for offences. You should check the status of your medication with the nearest Japanese Embassy or Consulate before you travel.
If you are travelling with prescription medication that is permitted under Japanese law, you are normally allowed to bring in up to one month’s supply. You are advised to bring a copy of your prescription and a letter from your doctor stating the medical condition that the medication has been prescribed to treat. For more guidance on travelling with medication, check information pages from NHS Choices and the National Travel Health Network and Centre (NaTHNaC) in our foreign travel checklist.
If you need prescription medicine for long-term use, you may need to provide extra paperwork, such as an import licence. The Japanese Ministry of Health, Labour and Welfare website provides information about bringing medication for personal use.
