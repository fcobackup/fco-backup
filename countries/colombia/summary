A temporary ceasefire between the government and the ELN ended on 9 January 2018. The ELN has renewed its campaign against the Colombian state including three bomb attacks on police stations in the north of Colombia on 27 and 28 January. You should be vigilant at all times, especially in the vicinity of police stations. Further attacks are very likely, particularly in areas of ELN presence including Arauca, Norte de Santander, the southern half of Bolívar state, Chocó, Cauca and Nariño.

Social protests are common in Colombia and can become violent and lead to disruption to road and transport networks. You should avoid protests and follow the advice of local authorities if you’re in an area where a protest is taking place.
Monitor local media and seek information from local authorities before travelling outside of or between major cities. Dial #767 for the Colombian highway police’s up to date information (in Spanish) on any road closures.
Terrorists are very likely to try to carry out attacks in Colombia. See Terrorism
The security situation can change very quickly in many areas of the country. You should pay close attention to warnings issued by the Colombian authorities. In general, the more remote the area, the greater the potential threat to your safety. You should be particularly cautious and vigilant during any major events and in crowded places.
Despite the high levels of crime, most visits to Colombia are trouble-free. See Crime
