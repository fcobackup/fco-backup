In September 2023, in Gihanga commune, Bubanza province, Red-Tabara rebels killed two individuals on the RN5 road and reportedly damaged a guidance antenna for Melchior Ndadaye International Airport in Bujumbura.
Contact your destination before you set off and make sure you allow enough time to complete your journey during daylight hours.
