Around 30,210 British nationals visited Ecuador in 2018. Most visits are trouble free.
There were nationwide protests across Ecuador between 3 and 13 October 2019 which caused extensive disruption. Some of these protests became violent, especially in Quito, and led to a number of fatalities. A state of emergency was declared on 3 October, which will remain in place until 3 November.
The Ecuadorean government has announced that a dialogue process is underway to review the economic measures that triggered the protests. However, tensions remain heightened and there is a risk of further protests. If you’re travelling in Ecuador, you should remain vigilant, avoid any protests or demonstrations and keep up to date with developments via official local sources (ECU 911 emergency services) and this travel advice. You may wish to sign up to receive email alerts to be notified of any updates.
