International travel
Passengers at the airport will need to follow strict regulations, including the mandatory use of masks and facial protectors (usually a clear plastic full-face covering) and social distancing.
Commercial airlines are operating to and from Peru. If travelling via another country, it is essential you check the travel advice for that country, as some currently do not permit transit to/from the UK.
Some airlines are flying to some destinations in Europe from Lima on a weekly basis.

Travel in Peru
On 15 March 2020, Peru announced a national State of Emergency, which has now been extended until at least 30 June 2021. The latest tier-based regulations will also be in effect until at least 20 June.
Peru has been placed under a four-tier system of restrictions (Extreme, Very High, High and Moderate). Measures to contain the virus include curfews, restricted opening hours and reduced capacity limits in shops and other enclosed spaces. There is a requirement to wear masks in all public places (including outdoors) and two masks and/or a face shield in some indoor venues and on public transport.
For information on the tiers and restrictions in each area, you should visit the El Peruano website. Restrictions may change at short notice – you should follow official guidance and the local media for updates. Fines may be imposed for those breaking the rules.
If you are leaving Peru and your approved period of stay in Peru has expired during the state of emergency, your visa fine should be waived by the Immigration authorities.
Public places and services
Public places and services may be open or closed, depending on the tier level of the region.

COVID-19 vaccines if you live in Peru
Wherever possible British nationals should aim to be vaccinated in the country where they live. As further information is available about the national vaccination programme, this page will be updated. Sign up to get email notifications.
The Peruvian Ministry of Foreign Affairs has confirmed that non-Peruvian residents in Peru will be included in the national vaccination programme following the same prioritisation scheme as Peruvian nationals.
The Peruvian Immigration Office is requesting all foreign nationals with non-residential status in Peru to register or update their details in their database. They have requested this because they will use the information to inform the national vaccination programme.
On 16 April the Ministry of Health launched a new national vaccine strategy aimed at vaccinating populations by district and province by age group. The vaccines registry (where people can check their vaccine date once available) is available on the government’s website.
The Medicines and Healthcare Products Regulatory Agency (MHRA) is the UK authority responsible for assessing the safety, quality and efficacy of vaccines. It has authorised the Pfizer/BioNTech, Oxford/AstraZeneca and Moderna vaccines for temporary supply and use in the UK. Find out more about MHRA approval for these vaccines.
British nationals living overseas should seek medical advice from their local healthcare provider in the country where they reside. Information about vaccines used in other national programmes, including regulatory status, should be available from the local authorities. This list of Stringent Regulatory Authorities recognised by the World Health Organisation may also be a useful source of additional information. Find out more about COVID-19 vaccines on the World Health Organization COVID-19 vaccines page.
Finance

Returning to the UK
When you return, you must follow the rules for entering the UK.
You are responsible for organising your own COVID-19 test, in line with UK government testing requirements. The Peruvian authorities provide guidance on public health centres in Lima and laboratories that process tests in the country (only available in Spanish). COVID-19 PCR tests are widely available in both public clinics and private labs in Peru. Some regions in Peru, outside Lima, do not have private lab facilities and rely entirely on public facilities.
