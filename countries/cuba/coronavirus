If coming to Cuba, you should pack masks, sanitary hand gel, handkerchiefs and other essential items that may prevent transmission, as these items are not always available in Cuba.
You may face a long queue to shop in a pharmacy. Over-the-counter medicines and pharmacy products are not always available. You should bring anything you might need with you.
You should also bring your prescription medicines with you and think about bringing extra in case you have to stay longer than planned.
You should also bring your prescription medicines and any other pharmacy-type products you need with you and bring extra in case you have to stay longer than planned.
International travel
All airports in Cuba are open again for commercial and charter flights. Havana Airport re-opened on 15 November 2020. You should contact airlines directly to know if and when they will have scheduled flights to and from Cuba.
At the beginning of 2021, the only direct flights between UK and Cuba were holiday charter flights to Varadero, although these are being suspended during the UK measures (advising against non essential international travel) announced on 4 January 2020. Commercial airlines may insist you have a ticket for your onward connection to return to the UK to board the plane in Havana, and evidence of a negative test for COVID-19 taken within 3 days before your travel to the UK. See ‘Returning to the UK’ section.
You should check the FCDO Travel Advice for any country you have to transit on your journey to/from Cuba, to keep up to date with current entry and transit rules.
See Entry requirements and check with the airline or your travel company for the latest information.
Entry and borders
See Entry requirements to find out about entry requirements and what you will need to do when you arrive in Cuba.
Visa extensions and departure
During the period of Cuban government coronavirus measures, visa extension requirements were suspended while immigration offices have had limited services. If you were unable to renew your visa until now, all types of visas that expired during Coronavirus measures will remain valid for 90 days after the suspension on commercial flights is lifted, i.e. 90 days from 15 November 2020.
If you have dual British and Cuban nationality, you are subject to Cuban measures. From 1 April 2020, dual nationals required permission (from Cuban Immigration offices) to leave Cuba on the special repatriation and humanitarian flights. That is no longer a requirement but could be re-introduced if the Cuban authorities implement any new measures.
Travel in Cuba
Travel and transport within and between Provinces varies according to the measures in place. Any change in the situation in a province or municipality may mean inter-provincial or municipal transport links also change. Travel in and out Havana is restricted from 12 January 2021 through specific check points with sanitary controls, and transport services are suspended
Face masks must be worn at all times when travelling on buses, in taxis, and private hire vehicles.
Visitors are allowed to hire cars (see important information in Road Travel section) but should check with the hire companies if they are open, have cars available, and check where you can drive to under current COVID-19 measures, before making plans.
Check with your tour operator and seek local advice if you have questions about excursions to other parts of Cuba.
Accommodation
Hotels and guest houses are open for Cubans and foreign residents of Cuba (known as ‘national tourism’) and for international tourists but to a limited occupancy. Guests may have to wear face masks in some hotel areas and facilities.
Campsites are open also to a limited capacity.
Medical teams in hotels will check on health of guests, including taking their temperature, and will be available to guests who feel unwell in between those visits. Local medical representatives will visit campsites and “casas particulares”. Anyone with respiratory symptoms may be moved to a clinic or isolation centre and will have to pay for PCR test(s) and the medical services by credit card. Any travelling companion may be required to self-isolate in their accommodation pending a negative PCR test result, or be tested themselves.
Hotels may limit the numbers of people using facilities at any one time, especially swimming pools (if open) and elevators.
Public spaces and services
Wearing a face mask in public is compulsory as is social distancing of a minimum of 1.5 metres.
Shops in all Provinces can open but must limit the number of customers within the shop. This means there are queues to enter shops.
Cafés, bars and restaurants are allowed to open but must limit the opening hours, the number of customers and separate tables by 1.5 metres.
In addition:
Public parks can open, but currently only until 7pm in Havana
Social clubs, gyms, museums, etc can open (except in Havana) to a limited capacity and visitors must observe social distancing.
Swimming pools can open to a limited capacity and to restricted visit times, to allow cleaning for the next opening times. From 10 January 2021, public pools in Havana will have to close.
Beaches are open, but limited numbers of people may be allowed, and there may be personnel at the beaches to manage access.
Churches can open for services, following government sanitary and distancing advice.
Healthcare in Cuba
If you think you have COVID-19 symptoms, you should contact a local clinic straight away. If you are staying in a hotel, the hotel reception will be able to contact medical personnel for you. Owners of casas particulares will be able to help you to contact the local medical services.
If your PCR test is positive (even if you arrived with a certificate of a negative PCR test taken within 72 hours of your departure to Cuba) you will have to go into hospital or a centre being run by the Ministry of Health. You may not have any or much internet access. Your mobile phone roaming may not work in Cuba.
If you need to stay in hospital or under medical care, you must pay the bill by credit card when being discharged, or arrange payment directly by your travel insurance company. Cash payment (GBP, US Dollars, or Euros) is permitted too if credit cards do not work so you are advised to make contingency plans to bring cash with you.
If your PCR test is positive, any travelling companions with you will have to self-isolate in the accommodation and be tested again.
Cuban authorities aim to have PCR test results within 48 hours but that is not always achievable given the high volume of testing.
If you are staying in private home or a hotel, you are likely to receive regular home checks by medical representatives (known as “pesquisia”).

Your emotional and mental wellbeing is important. Read guidance on how to look after your mental wellbeing and mental health. You are advised to pack items to help you to pass the time in a medical facility or self-isolation.

Returning to the UK
When you return, you must follow the rules for entering the UK.
You are responsible for organising your own COVID-19 test, in line with UK government testing requirements.
If you are travelling with a tour operator on a package holiday, you should speak to the representative about how to comply with this requirement. If you are travelling independently in Cuba, you can use the list of medical facilities to find the nearest test centre that can give you the result in time for your travel. You will have to pay for your COVID-19 test by credit card or with GBP or US Dollars (may be between $30 and $50).
If your pre-departure test is positive, you will not be allowed to travel and will have to follow the Cuban protocols that include being admitted to hospital or health centre.
