Warning
FCDO advises against all travel to Niger.

You should also read FCDO’s overall travel advice and safety advice for regions of Niger.
Terrorism
There is a high threat of terrorist attacks globally affecting UK interests and British nationals, including from groups and individuals who view the UK and British nationals as targets. Stay aware of your surroundings at all times.    
UK Counter Terrorism Policing has information and advice on staying safe abroad and what to do in the event of a terrorist attack. Find out how to reduce your risk from terrorism while abroad.
Terrorism in Niger
Terrorists are very likely to try and carry out attacks in Niger.
There is a heightened risk of attack in Niamey. Attacks could be indiscriminate and occur without warning, including in places visited by foreigners. You should be especially vigilant and where possible avoid places frequented by foreigners, such as: 
diplomatic premises
conference centres
locations popular with tourists and foreigners
sporting and cultural events
shopping centres
transport hubs
religious sites and places of worship, particularly churches
national parks and nature reserves; including the Parc du W
foreign, national or local government buildings
large crowds
There may be a heightened risk of attack during election periods and religious festivals including the month of Ramadan.
You should be vigilant, monitor announcements and local media, and follow the advice of local authorities.
There have been multiple recent attacks in Niger, particularly in the Diffa and Tillabéri regions. Notable recent attacks include:
on 2 October 2023, terrorists killed around 30 soldiers in Takanamat, Tahoua
on 30 September 2023, terrorists killed 33 soldiers in Imbalagan, Tillaberi
on 16 August 2023, terrorists killed 30 civilians in the Kandadji region, Tillaberi
on 1 February 2023, terrorists killed 18 people in an attack on a refugee camp in Tillia, Tahoua
in 2022, an IED explosion took place in Bougoum (approximately 5km from Niamey city limits) killing 2 civilians
in 2022, a Gendarme Post in Bougoum was attacked by armed individuals on motorbikes
Terrorist kidnap
British nationals are seen as legitimate targets, including tourists, humanitarian aid workers, journalists and business travellers. If you are kidnapped, the reason for your presence is unlikely to protect you or secure your safe release. 
The long-standing policy of the British government is not to make substantive concessions to hostage takers. The British government considers that paying ransoms and releasing prisoners builds the capability of terrorist groups and finances their activities. This can, in turn, increase the risk of further hostage-taking. The Terrorism Act (2000) makes payments to terrorists illegal. 
There’s a very high threat of kidnapping by AQ-affiliated and other regional Islamist groups. These include Jamaat Nusrat al-Islam wal Muslimeen (JNIM) and Islamic State Greater Sahara (ISGS), who operate throughout Mali, Niger and Burkina Faso; and Islamic State West Africa (ISWA) and Boko Haram who operate in the Lake Chad Basin. Criminal groups also carry out kidnaps.
Westerners have been kidnapped in Niger and the wider Sahel region, including in Niamey and the north and west of Niger. In October 2020 an American was kidnapped (and rescued shortly after) in Massalata near the border with Nigeria. In September 2018, a Catholic priest was kidnapped in Makolondi, 125km south-west of Niamey. An aid worker was kidnapped in the Tillabéri region of Niger in April 2018.
If you’re working or travelling in Niger, you should be aware of the risk of terrorist kidnapping. You should maintain a high level of vigilance at all times, including when travelling. You should be particularly vigilant when walking (in Niamey, you should not cross the bridges over the River Niger on foot at any time), in crowded public places, including camps for displaced people, religious gatherings and insecure spaces like places of worship, markets, shopping malls, hotels, bars, night clubs, restaurants, nature reserves and national parks, and transport hubs. You should make sure you have carefully considered the threat and have reasonable, proportionate mitigation measures in place.
Political situation
There has been a military takeover in Niger, which has led to protests and unrest.
These protests may be violent and the security situation could change quickly without warning.
On 26 July, the Conseil National pour la Sauvegarde de la Patrie (CNSP) launched a military coup which has led to protests and unrest.
The President of Niger, His Excellency Mohamed Bazoum of the PNDS political party, has been detained since 26 July.
Protests, marches and demonstrations can occur with little prior notice and can be violent. If you become aware of any protests, marches or demonstrations, you should move away from the area immediately, as the atmosphere can change quickly and without warning.
Crime
Levels of crime, especially in the capital Niamey, are high. Thefts, robberies and residential break-ins can occur at any time. Take sensible precautions to keep important items like money, passports, jewellery and mobile phones safe.
The areas around the Gaweye Hotel, National Museum and Petit Marché in Niamey are particularly prone to muggings. Avoid walking alone there, and do not cross the bridges over the River Niger on foot at any time. Be vigilant when walking anywhere in the city. Walking at night is more dangerous as there’s a lack of street lighting.
There have been attacks on people, including westerners, as they are leaving banks and ATMs. Be careful when using ATMs on the street, never do this at night-time, and if possible use the ATMs available in most large hotels. 
Car thieves often target 4-wheel-drive vehicles. Make sure car doors are locked at all times.
Banditry, smuggling and other criminal activity is common in border areas (particularly Maradi, Tillabéri and Diffa). You should take special care and avoid crossing borders after dark.
There have also been hold-ups and robberies on public buses between Tahoua and Agadez and between Agadez and Arlit. In some cases people have been killed.
Scams
British nationals are increasingly being targeted by internet and other scams. The scams come in many forms – romance and friendship, business ventures, or work and employment opportunities. Victims are at great financial risk.
Laws and cultural differences
Niger is a Muslim country. Respect local traditions, customs, laws and religions at all times. Be aware of your actions and dress in case they offend, especially during the month of Ramadan or if you visit religious areas.
If you commit a crime you will be subject to local law. Local prison conditions are harsh.
Personal ID
You should carry identification at all times. This would normally be your passport or residence permit. If you drive outside the main towns, authorities are very likely to ask you to produce identification.
Ramadan
Ramadan is a holy month for Muslims. The dates vary by year and country. In 2024 Ramadan in Niger is expected to be from 11 March to 9 April. During this time, do not:
eat, drink, smoke or chew gum in public in the daytime
play loud music or dance
swear in public
Get more advice when you arrive from your tour guide, hotel or business contacts.    
Using cameras in secure areas
Do not photograph military or government installations.
LGBT+ travellers
There is no law criminalising same-sex sexual activity in Niger. However, there are laws under the Penal Code of 1993 covering ‘public outrage against modesty’ and ‘immodest or unnatural acts’. An ‘unnatural act’ with a person of the same sex who is under the age of 21 can be punishable by a fine of up to 100,000 francs and up to 3 years imprisonment. Although we are not aware of any prosecutions under this legislation, attitudes within society towards LGBT+ people can be discriminatory.
There are no laws prohibiting discrimination on the basis of sexual orientation, and no legal recognition of same-sex couples.

Transport risks
FCDO continues to advise against all travel to Niger. Travel within or out of Niger is at your own risk. The FCDO cannot offer advice on the safety of travelling to any departure point within Niger.
Road travel
If you are planning to drive in Niger, see information on driving abroad.
You can drive in Niger using a 1968 International Driving Permit (IDP) for up to 3 months. If you’re staying longer than 3 months, you will need to get a Nigerien licence.
You cannot buy an IDP outside the UK, so get one before you travel. You can buy an IDP in person from some UK post offices – find your nearest post office branch that offers this service.
Carry your UK driving licence and car registration documents with you at all times.
Road safety
The main roads between Niamey and other large towns are generally satisfactory by African standards, but some roads are pot-holed, conditions are often worse during and just after rainy season. Driving standards are poor. Vehicles often drive without lights at night and there is little street lighting.
Travel around Niger can be difficult, and conditions are poor for overland travel. Avoid travelling between towns at night.
Aim to use local travel agents and guides when travelling outside main towns and in desert areas. An approved local travel agent can arrange all the necessary permits for your journey and give details of your itinerary to the local authorities. Travel in convoy and carry an independent satellite phone. Make sure you have a supply of drinking water and food.
There have been reports of landmines being used in Burkina Faso on the road between Ouagadougou and Niamey. Seek local advice before making this journey.
In the case of an accident, you should go immediately to the nearest police station to file a report. Crowds can gather quickly and you may be vulnerable if you remain at the scene. Medical help in the event of an accident is likely to be limited.
Public transport
Avoid using buses or taxis where possible.
Buses operate on routes between Niamey and other large towns, but distances are long and buses are prone to mechanical failure. There have also been hold-ups and robberies on public buses. See ‘Crime’.
Taxis are available, but are often in poor mechanical condition. Driving standards are poor.
Air travel
Air space has now re-opened, although flight options may be more limited and could change at short notice. Check with your travel company or airline for the latest information. 
Flights within Niger remain limited.
Extreme weather and natural disasters
Find out what you can do to prepare for and respond to extreme weather and natural hazards. 
Floods and landslides
The rainy season in Niger is from June to October. Torrential rains can cause floods and landslides. Monitor local weather reports and expect difficulties when travelling to affected areas.
