Cases of coronavirus (COVID-19) have been confirmed in Kyrgyzstan. The Kyrgyzstan authorities have introduced a number of precautionary measures.
Borders and travel restrictions
All foreign nationals are banned from entering the country. All Kyrgyz nationals entering the country will be subject to a 14 day quarantine period. Foreign nationals already in Kyrgyzstan will be allowed to leave, flights are now limited to one Moscow – Bishkek flight, one Moscow-Osh flight and one Novosibirsk – Bishkek flight per week.
All land borders have now been closed. You should also check with your airline or travel company for the latest information.
Options for leaving Kyrgyzstan are becoming increasingly limited and if you wish to leave Kyrgyzstan you should make arrangements to do so immediately. You should follow local government announcements and media reporting.
You should monitor the Kyrgyz Government Ministry of Health website and the Kyrgyz Government website for updates.
Other measures
You should comply with any additional screening measures put in place by the authorities. The government of Kyrgyzstan have also announced that from the 16 March schools, universities, nightclubs, cinemas, computer clubs, food areas and playgrounds for children in shopping and entertainment centers will be closed for a three week period.
Entertainment facilities, cultural and educational institutions (including universities, schools and kindergartens), restaurants with more than 50 seats, sports centers, and swimming pools have all been suspended until the situation improves. Organizations are required to install sanitizers and air purifiers, and to provide staff and visitors with disinfectant.
Large events have been suspended including family, cultural, sporting, scientific and other commemorative events. Citizens are being encouraged to remain at home as far as possible and limit contact with other people.
You should consider making arrangements for provisions if you are unable or unwilling to leave your home for an extended period of time. You should also consider any medical arrangements that you will need to have in place including access to medicines. Medical facilities in Kyrgyzstan are not as developed as those in the UK.
If you are required to enter a state quarantine center facilities are likely to be basic. There are centers in hospitals, including surgery centers for those with additional medical needs. However some people are also reportedly being held for observation in a former US airbase.
If you need further information about entry requirements or visa issues, contact the local immigration authorities or the nearest embassy of the Kyrgyz Republic. You should also check with your airline or travel company for the latest information.
