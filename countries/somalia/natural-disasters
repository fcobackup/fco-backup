Flooding
The main rainy season in Somalia takes place between April and June, followed by lesser rains in October and November. During these periods travellers should be aware of the seasonal risk of localised flooding. As well as travel disruptions, flooding increases internal displacement and humanitarian need in local populations.
Currently, due to the ongoing rains, there has been flooding in some areas, most notably Beledweyne in the Hiran region.
