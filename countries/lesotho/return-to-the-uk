British Government special flights from South Africa
South Africa has announced the closure of its airspace from midnight on 26 March until at least 16 April. From 9 April the British Government in partnership with Virgin Atlantic will operate special flights from Johannesburg and Cape Town for British travellers in South Africa to return to the UK.
Further details of eligibility, and how to book are in our travel advice for South Africa.
British travellers in Lesotho should be aware that it is not yet certain that the South African authorities will issue visas to British passport holders to enable them to access these flights.
Eligible British travellers should contact the British High Commission in Maseru on BHC.Maseru@fco.gov.uk in advance of booking.
You will need to pay for your return travel to the UK. If departure options are available but you cannot afford the travel costs and have exhausted all other options for getting funds, you may be eligible to apply for an emergency loan from the government. This is a last resort option and you would need to repay the loan when you are back in the UK. For more information, you should contact Corporate Travel Management (CTM). CTM are a commercial partner of the FCO and are authorised to administer such loans on behalf of the FCO.
