Terrorism in Zambia
Terrorist attacks in Zambia cannot be ruled out. Attacks could be indiscriminate, including in places visited by foreigners.  
Political situation
There are occasionally demonstrations and protests in Lusaka and other urban areas. They can disrupt local transport and become violent. Avoid them and leave the scene as soon as possible if a crowd develops. Do not cross protester roadblocks as this is likely to provoke a violent reaction from demonstrators.
Crime
Travel in larger cities and the major game parks is generally safe during daylight hours. However, serious crimes can happen. Pre-arrange transport to avoid walking at night and stay aware of your surroundings, especially after dark. Stay alert and take precautions against vehicle crime by:
keeping windows closed and doors locked when travelling
ignoring hitchhikers or anyone trying to flag you down
watching out for potential carjackers when approaching locked gateways at night, or if an object has been placed to block the road
only using cars arranged for you by a hotel or tour operator
Keep valuables and originals of important documents in a safe place and carry a copy of your passport’s photo page and entry stamp.

Wildlife, animal products and souvenirs
It is illegal to buy, sell, kill or capture any protected wild animal or trade its parts without a licence. Anyone caught purchasing or trafficking such goods will be prosecuted and get a fine or a prison sentence.  
Outdoor activities and adventure tourism
Wild animals in the bush, including venomous snakes, are unpredictable and do kill. Whether you are travelling on land or water, you are at risk of potentially fatal animal attacks.
Adventure sports, including in the Victoria Falls area, carry risks. There have been serious accidents and deaths. The quality of medical care varies greatly. Follow safety instructions closely. Make sure you have appropriate travel insurance and accessible funds to cover the cost of any medical treatment or potential repatriation.
Transport risks
Road travel
If you are planning to drive in Zambia, see information on driving abroad.
You can use a UK photocard driving licence to drive in Zambia for up to 90 days. If you still have a paper driving licence, you may need to update it to a photocard licence. If you plan to stay in Zambia for more than 90 days, you’ll need to have the correct version of the international driving permit (IDP) or a Zambian driving licence.
Hire car companies often have stricter requirements for their customers, such as a year of driving experience, a higher minimum age and holding an IDP.  
Road conditions and driving standards
Many roads are severely potholed. During the rainy season from November to April, sudden floods can wash away bridges and roads.
Vehicles in Zambia are often inadequately maintained and badly driven. There are frequent fatal crashes. Drink-driving and driving while on a mobile are illegal but commonplace. Zambia’s Road Traffic and Safety Agency prosecutes traffic offenders through a fast-track court system.
It is dangerous to drive outside the main towns after dark due to abandoned vehicles, pedestrians and stray animals on the road, and vehicles being driven without lights.
Buses and minibuses
Travel by long-distance public transport can be dangerous due to poor standards of driving, lack of rest periods for drivers, the poor quality of vehicles and poor road conditions. Minibuses in urban areas are usually severely overcrowded, poorly maintained and badly driven.
