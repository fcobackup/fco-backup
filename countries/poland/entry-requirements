The information on this page covers the most common types of travel and is the UK government’s understanding of the current rules. Unless otherwise stated, this information is for travellers using a full ‘British Citizen’ passport.
The authorities in the country or territory you’re travelling to are responsible for setting and enforcing the entry rules. If you’re unclear about any of the entry requirements, or you need further reassurance, you’ll need to contact the embassy, high commission or consulate of the country or territory you’re travelling to.
You should also consider checking with your transport provider or travel company to make sure your passport and other travel documents meet their requirements.
Entry rules in response to coronavirus (COVID-19)
Quarantine requirements
You are not required to self-isolate on arrival in Poland, if you arrive in Poland from the UK or any European Union/EFTA country (by air, sea or land).
If you arrive in Poland from any other country, you may be required to self-isolate for 14 days, unless you are transiting to your place of residence. There are exceptions, including for freight drivers, airline cabin crew, train workers, agriculture workers, students and school pupils studying in Poland and members of diplomatic missions, Consulates or International Organisations and their families.
Entry to Poland
Land border controls with Germany, the Czech Republic, Lithuania and Slovakia have now been lifted and there are no border checks and no quarantine requirements for those entering Poland from these countries by land. Checks remain in place on land borders with Russia, Ukraine and Belarus.
If you travel to Poland from a non-Schengen EU country by air (Republic of Ireland, Romania, Bulgaria, Croatia or Cyprus), or from the UK until the end of the transition period, you will need to go through passport control but will not need to go into quarantine. British nationals do not need a visa to enter Poland or any other EU/EFTA country.
You will only be allowed to enter Poland coming directly from any non-EU / EFTA country if you are:
a Polish national;
a spouse, child or individual under the permanent care of a Polish national;
a holder of a Pole’s Card;
a holder of the right to permanent or temporary stay in Poland or a work permit holder;
a foreign national driving a means of transport used for transporting goods or people;
a freight driver driving to or from a rest break in a vehicle not used for transporting goods;
a diplomat, consular staff member, representative of an international organisation or a member of their family;
a school pupil or student studying in Poland;
a national of an EU member state, EFTA member state or EEA country (or a spouse or child of one of these nationals);
a foreigner with a permanent residence permit or a long term resident European Union/EFTA residence permit (or a spouse or child of the permit holder) transiting Poland to your permanent residence.
Poland now allows direct flights into its territory from a select number of non-EU/EFTA countries. This list could change at short notice and is updated on the Polish Government website (in Polish).
If you are travelling to Poland by air from a country on this list you may need to demonstrate to check-in staff that you meet one of the above requirements and meet the normal Schengen rules of entry where applicable. You might wish to arrive at check-in in good time as there may be delays while airline staff verify your right to travel with Polish authorities. If you cannot demonstrate that you meet one of these requirements the airline might not allow you to fly.
Regular entry requirements
Passport validity
Your passport should be valid for the length of time you plan to stay; you do not need any additional period of validity on your passport beyond this.
The travel rules will stay the same until 31 December 2020.
Visas 
If you hold a British Citizen passport, you don’t need a visa to enter Poland. If you’re planning a stay of longer than 3 months, see our Living in Poland guide and contact the Polish Embassy if you have further questions.
The travel rules will stay the same until 31 December 2020.
UK Emergency Travel Documents
You can use a UK Emergency Travel Document to enter, airside transit and exit from Poland.
Dual nationals 
If you are a Polish passport holder you will be treated as a Polish national while in Poland, even if you hold a passport from another country. If you are a dual Polish-British national you must enter and exit Poland with a Polish passport or Polish national identity card. Check with the Polish Embassy in London if in doubt.
