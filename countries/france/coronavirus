Travel in France
France has put measures in place to limit the spread of COVID-19.
France began progressive deconfinement from 11 May. Each départment was categorised ‘red’, ‘orange’ or ‘green’, dictating the extent to which measures could be relaxed. Currently all départments in mainland France are categorised as ‘green’. Certain confinement measures may still apply, however, depending on the department you are in. For more information see the government website.
