The Cuban Government has taken measures to counter the spread of coronavirus in Cuba. There have been significant implications for tourists and foreign residents including restrictions of movement. On 11 June, the Government started to set out what the recovery phases would be and how restrictions would be lifted gradually. However, no timetable has been announced for the recovery phases yet and it is likely to differ between Provinces. Commercial and charter flights are suspended until 31 July. There are plans to open holiday resorts in the Cayos in later phases to welcome international tourists but no dates have been set. See Staying during coronavirus
