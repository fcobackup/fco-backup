Moving around in Belgium
For information on entering Belgium, see Entry Requirements
The Belgian Government has been gradually relaxing domestic measures to combat coronavirus, with all activities permitted except where expressly prohibited, and subject to certain protocols. The Belgian Government publish updates on their website. Relaxation of measures is subject to their ongoing assessment of local conditions and it is possible that measures may be reintroduced. You should check Belgian Government advice regularly for the latest detailed information.
You must respect the rules on social distancing requirements at all times, including on public transport.
The wearing of masks is mandatory on public transport and in other public locations where it is not possible to maintain a 1.5 metre distance from others. Further details have been published by the Belgian Government (in English).
Travel operators are restricting their services. British nationals who wish to leave Belgium are advised to contact their travel operator to make arrangements to do so as soon as possible. Find out how to return to the UK from Belgium.

Finance
There is a range of financial support from the government that you can access while you are unable to return due to coronavirus restrictions.
If you’re in Belgium, and have exhausted all other options to cover essential living costs while you wait to return home, you could apply for an emergency loan for your living costs from the UK government. You can only apply if you normally live in the UK and you cannot return home. This last-resort option is for those most in need, and you would need to repay the loan when you are back in the UK. Apply for an emergency loan.
