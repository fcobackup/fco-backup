Hurricanes
The hurricane season in the Caribbean normally runs from June to November. Because of Tropical Storm Gonzalo, a Tropical Storm Warning is now in place for Grenada, Carriacou and Petit Martinique. This means that tropical storm conditions are possible within the next 36 hours. You should monitor local and international weather updates from the US National Hurricane Centre and follow the advice of the local authorities.
See our Tropical Cyclones page for advice about how to prepare effectively and what to do if you’re likely to be affected by a hurricane or tropical cyclone.
Earthquakes
Earthquakes are a potential threat and tremors are felt occasionally in the Caribbean. In the event of an earthquake, you should follow the advice of the local authorities. To learn more about what to do before, during and after an earthquake, visit the website of the US Federal Emergency Management Agency.
Volcanoes
You should monitor the alert level of the underwater volcano ‘Kick’em Jenny’, located 5 miles off the coast of Grenada. Observe any maritime exclusion zones and follow the advice of the local authorities in the event of increased activity or eruption.
