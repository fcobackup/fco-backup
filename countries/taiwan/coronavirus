Travel in Taiwan
There are no domestic travel restrictions in Taiwan.
Travelling to and from the airport
On arrival in Taiwan, you will be required to take an allocated taxi to your self-isolation destination. For more information about self-isolation see Entry requirements.
Taxis and public transport systems are operating normally in Taiwan. The wearing of face masks is mandatory on all public transport. If you use public transport and are not wearing a face mask, you may be fined up to NT$15,000. Be aware that some taxi drivers may refuse to take a passenger who is not wearing a face mask.
Accommodation
Only a limited number of designated quarantine hotels may host self-isolating travellers. If you are planning to stay in a hotel to complete the self-isolation period, you should confirm that a room is available and that it meets your requirements prior to travelling.
Due to an increased number of travellers now entering Taiwan, demand for the limited number of hotels permitted to host self-isolating travellers has increased, and you may find it difficult to find accommodation at short notice.
For a list of designated quarantine hotels in Taipei, please visit Taipei City Government’s FAQ page. If you are planning to stay in a hotel outside of Taipei, you may need to contact the local authority in that area prior to booking or making final arrangements. For more information and contact details, please visit the Taiwan Tourism Bureau’s ‘Taiwan Stay’ website.
If you have access to private accommodation in Taiwan, you may choose to self-isolate there rather than in a hotel. You should confirm that you will be permitted to self-isolate in your preferred accommodation before travelling.
Public spaces and services
Face masks must be worn on public transportation. There is no general requirement to wear a face mask in public. Some shops and locations may restrict entry to those wearing face masks. Temperature checks are in operation in many locations.
