The Foreign and Commonwealth Office (FCO) advise against all travel to:

British nationals, in particular dual British/Iranian nationals, face greater risks in Iran than nationals of many other countries, including the risk of arbitrary detention. The Iranian authorities don’t recognise dual nationality for Iranian citizens and therefore don’t grant consular access for FCO officials to visit them in detention. You should consider carefully the risks of travelling to Iran. See Safety and Security
There may be a heightened risk of politicised demonstrations targeting Western interests in the run up to, on, and immediately after, 12 May 2018.
There were widespread protests across Iran in late December 2017 and early January 2018, which have largely ceased. However, the risk that these protests re-occur or new demonstrations begin on other grounds, remains. You should avoid any demonstrations and follow the instructions of the local police.
As of 15 April 2018 bureaux de change are not licensed to trade currency. It is illegal to change money on the street. You should be clear before travelling how you will obtain enough rials for your visit legally and, if unsure, you may need to reconsider your travel plans. See Money
