Death from COVID-19 in Indonesia
If COVID-19 is given as cause of death and you would like to arrange a local cremation and repatriation of ashes, you will need to make contact with a local undertaker within 4 hours of the death registration to give your instructions. If you do not do this, it is likely that a local burial will take place.
You will also require a letter of no objection from the Embassy. This will be issued on the next working day.
Travel
With immediate effect, passengers travelling on domestic flights will need:
If fully vaccinated and boosted: Proof of vaccination status in hard copy and via the Peduli Lindungi App.
If vaccinated with full course but no booster: you must present a negative Rapid Antigen Test result issued less than 24 hours or a negative PCR test result issued 72 hours before departure.
If only in receipt of first vaccination: A negative PCR test result issued within 72 hours of departure.
Travellers with special health conditions that prevent vaccination must show a negative PCR test result issued within 72 hours of departure and a letter from their doctor explaining why they cannot be vaccinated.
Children under 6 years old are not required to produce any test results, but must be travelling with an adult who meets one of the above requirements.
The test certificate should have a readable barcode or QR code and must be issued by a Ministry of Health approved health facility, a list of which can be found here
If the test certificate does not have a QR code an additional PCR test may be required
A completed airline travel declaration form where required
A completed electronic health alert card (e-HAC) which can be found on the Peduli Lindungi app here
Travellers who are 12 and above are required to show proof of full vaccination in the form of a certificate on the Peduli Lindungi app. Proof of vaccination for children between the ages of 12 and 16 can be integrated within their parents app
Children under 12 must take a PCR test within 72 hours of departure
We recommend all passengers check with their airline for the latest information before travelling
For international air passengers
Passengers who are leaving Indonesia via Jakarta are exempt from showing proof of COVID-19 vaccination if they have no previous travel connection and are leaving directly from Jakarta. Any other passenger must show evidence of COVID-19 vaccination if they have received the vaccine.
Any passengers who have not received a vaccine, intend to leave Indonesia and need to travel domestically to do so, are exempt from showing vaccine certification subject to the following conditions:
they do not leave the airport area during transit
they obtain clearance from the Port Health Office at the point of first departure
they show a full and valid flight itinerary showing all departure and arrival points
Travel requirements change frequently, sometimes at short notice. Please consult the Garuda Indonesia website for up to date information on testing requirements.
If you arrive in Bali by sea, a PCR test or negative rapid test with 48 hour validity is required.
Travellers are required to install the Peduli Lindungi app.

Returning to the UK
Travelling from and returning to the UK
Check what you must do to travel abroad and return to England, Scotland, Wales or Northern Ireland.
If you plan to pass through another country to return to the UK, check the travel advice for the country you’re transiting.
Be prepared for your plans to change
No travel is risk-free during COVID. Countries may further restrict travel or bring in new rules at short notice, for example due to a new COVID-19 variant. Check with your travel company or airline for any transport changes which may delay your journey home.
If you test positive for COVID-19 before or after you travel you will be expected to self-isolate at home for 5 days along with all family members. If you do not have a home in Indonesia, you may be required to isolate in a Government-approved hotel or other quarantine facility where you will need to undergo further testing. You will be expected to bear all costs. These rules are likely to apply equally to minors travelling without parents.
Plan ahead and make sure you:
can access money
understand what your insurance will cover
can make arrangements to extend your stay and be away for longer than planned

Partial reopening of essential businesses (50% capacity) is now allowed.
Public health measures by the Indonesian authorities include restrictions on in-country air travel.
Accommodation
Some hotels and private rental options continue to be open for business but will be more limited than usual and social distancing measures will be in force.
Public places and services
Emergency mobility restrictions have been introduced on travel and non-essential services until at least 20 September. Essential services remain accessible
Healthcare in Indonesia
For contact details for English speaking doctors, visit our list of healthcare providers.
The standard of local medical care in Indonesia can be poor and some medical tests cannot be done reliably. As the government of Indonesia announces rising numbers of COVID-19 cases, there is an increasing risk that the healthcare system will come under significant further strain. Access to routine and emergency healthcare may be limited.
View Health for further details on healthcare in Indonesia.
If you think you have COVID-19 symptoms, you should contact your nearest doctor or hospital. Detailed information about how patients with COVID-19 symptoms are handled can be found in our ‘living in Indonesia’ guide.
COVID-19 vaccines if you live in Indonesia
We will update this page when the Government of Indonesia announces new information on the national vaccination programme. You can sign up to get email notifications when this page is updated.
The Indonesian national vaccination programme started in January 2021 and is using the Sinovac, Sinopharm and AstraZeneca vaccines. The programme is currently focused on priority groups and areas. The Government of Indonesia has stated that British nationals falling within priority groups and areas, who are resident in Indonesia are eligible for vaccination if they choose to join the programme.
Residents in possession of the correct documentation (KITAP/KTP permanent stay permit/Indonesia Identity card) may be eligible for vaccination.
If you are in a priority group or area, in order to obtain a vaccination you will need: your Passport; KITAS/KITAP (permanent stay permit/residence permit card); proof of address; and the SKTT (Surat Keterangan Tempat Tinggal – certificate of residence) from the Kelurahan. You should contact the local RT/RW (local Government Office) to get the information on your nearest location for vaccination, or go to the nearest primary health care (called PUSKESMAS in Bahasa) to get the vaccine. You are also advised to check with your local health provider as to the status of your local rollout and eligibility.
The Government of Indonesia is planning to begin their vaccine booster program in January 2021.
Find out more, including about vaccines that are authorised in the UK or approved by the World Health Organisation, on the COVID-19 vaccines if you live abroad.
If you’re a British national living in Indonesia, you should seek medical advice from your local healthcare provider. Information about COVID-19 vaccines used in the national programme where you live, including regulatory status, should be available from local authorities.
