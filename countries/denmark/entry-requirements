Entry rules in response to coronavirus (COVID-19)
Entry to Denmark
Border checks are in place at all entry points. If you are not a Danish national and/or resident in Denmark, the rules on entry into Denmark depend on whether you are arriving from an ‘open’ country or a ‘restricted’ country, or if you have a ‘worthy purpose’ to enter. A country’s status can change dependent on its infection rate for COVID-19. The status is updated weekly on Thursdays. You can check whether the UK is ‘open’ or ‘restricted’ on the Danish government’s Coronavirus website.
Open country status
The UK is an ‘open’ country. This means that you can enter Denmark without having to go into a two-week quarantine if you are arriving into Denmark from the UK. If you enter as a tourist, you need to document a holiday stay for at least six nights. It could be a stay in a rented summerhouse, at a campsite, at a hotel or at a private home or privately-let summerhouse .
The requirement of at least six nights does not apply to the Faroe Islands and Greenland. See their specific guidelines below.
Worthy’ purpose to enter
You can also enter Denmark if you have a ‘worthy purpose’ to enter without having to go into a two-week quarantine. The list has been expanded to include UK residents in certain situations. Proof will be required to demonstrate a ‘worthy purpose’ to enter. You will not be required to document a stay of at least six nights if you enter Denmark with a ‘worthy purpose’.
You can check with the Danish authorities on their helpline (+45 7020 6044) for advice on the conditions of entry for foreign nationals. You should read their online Q&A for further information.
Use of face masks at Danish airports
It is now compulsory to wear face masks on flights with several airlines. You should check with your airline before travel. Passengers are responsible for providing their own face masks. It is compulsory to wear a mask throughout terminals in Danish airports. You should wear a medical mask from the moment you enter the terminals, on board the plane, and until you leave again upon arrival. It is recommended by the Danish health authorities to change the mask every 3 to 4 hours.
Guidelines for the Faroe Islands
The Faroe Islands now allows visitors from the UK.
All travellers to the Faroe Islands must be tested for COVID-19 at arrival. Children younger than 12 do not need to be tested. From 27 June to 10 July, testing will be free of charge upon arrival in the Faroe Islands. From 11 July, travellers will have to pay for their own tests, which will cost DKK 390 (approximately £50).
Travellers should expect long waiting times upon arrival.

Regular entry requirements
The Danish authorities increased border controls at the land border with Germany in January 2016. Border controls were also introduced in November 2019 for travellers from Rønne, Helsingør, Frederikshavn, Grenaa and those using the Øresund Bridge, including all train traffic from Sweden. These checks are temporary but will be in place for an unspecified period of time.
If you’re travelling using the land border, or by rail, road, or ferry you should make sure you have your passport with you. Allow additional time, be vigilant and follow the instructions of local authorities. Check with local media, your carrier, ferry operator or Danish State Railways (DSB) for more information.

Children under 18 accompanied by an adult with the appropriate ID are not required to carry ID themselves.
