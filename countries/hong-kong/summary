New national security legislation passed by the National People’s Congress Standing Committee meeting in Beijing entered into force in Hong Kong on 1 July 2020. It introduces offences on secession, subversion, organisation and perpetration of terrorist activities, and collusion with a foreign country with a maximum penalty of life imprisonment. These offences can be applied to activities conducted outside Hong Kong. China’s mainland authorities could under certain circumstances detain and try individuals under the terms of this law.
There is therefore a risk for those who commit an offence under the law of being detained and removed to mainland China. Due to ongoing heightened political sensitivity, there could be an increase in protests and violence. These could occur without warning, throughout Hong Kong. You should avoid protests and demonstrations. See Political situation.
Throughout 2019, large-scale political demonstrations took place all over the Hong Kong SAR, including in areas popular with tourists. While a number of peaceful activities took place, many other protests led to clashes between police and protesters involving significant violence. You should keep up to date with developments across Hong Kong. You can sign up for email alerts to be notified when this travel advice is updated.
There are reports of greater scrutiny from mainland authorities at border crossings between the mainland and Hong Kong at this time, including checks on travellers’ electronic devices. See Visits to mainland China

The British Consulate-General has been informed that Hong Kong, like other parts of China, does not recognise dual nationality. If you have both British and Chinese nationality you may be treated as a Chinese citizen by local authorities, even if you enter Hong Kong on your British passport. If this is the case, the British Consulate-General may not be able to offer you consular assistance. The FCDO has published guidance on nationality in China. If you have formally renounced Chinese citizenship, you should carry evidence that you have done so. See Local laws and customs
