There are currently only occasional charter flights which allow a return to the UK, via third countries. The UK government is working closely with airlines to make sure options are available for you to return to the UK.
Flights
The Embassy is not aware of any further international flights with seats available to the general public at present. The Embassy will continue to post updates about new commercial routes as soon as they become known to us.
A number of commercial flight options are appearing on airline sites. You should consider existing entry / transit regulations carefully before booking flights, including restrictions on foreigners entering or transiting. You should consult FCDO Travel Advice in the first instance.
You MUST inform us if you are departing on any flights by emailing BritishEmbassy.Vientiane@fcdo.gov.uk. Due to new regulations issued by the Lao government it is now a legal requirement for the Embassy to inform the Lao Ministry of Foreign Affairs of departing British Nationals.
Further information
The British Embassy Vientiane is issuing updates on the UKinLaos Facebook page with the latest available information on departure options for British nationals wishing to leave Laos.
