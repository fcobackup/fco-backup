The Foreign and Commonwealth Office (FCO) is advising British nationals against all non-essential international travel at this time. Existing advice for Azerbaijan remains in place:
The FCO advise against all travel to:
Nagorno-Karabakh and the military occupied area surrounding it
within 5km of the Line of Contact
within 5km of the border with Armenia.
The Azerbaijani Government has introduced a number of measures to limit the spread of the virus. This includes the mandatory quarantining of all arrivals from abroad for 14 days.
Restrictive measures are in place until at least 15 June to combat the spread of COVID-19. Many previously introduced restrictions have been relaxed or lifted, however the wearing of face masks is now mandatory in a number of circumstances. For further details see Staying during coronavirus
The Azerbaijani authorities have extended the suspension of all commercial passenger flights in to and out of Azerbaijan until at least 15 June. If you are booked on to an AZAL flight which has been cancelled you should speak with the airline or your travel agent. See Return to the UK
Around 30,000 British nationals visit Azerbaijan every year, mainly on business. Most visits are trouble free.
All British nationals travelling to Azerbaijan must get a visa in advance. The Azerbaijani authorities have announced from 13 March the ASAN Visa service (e-visas) are temporarily suspended. E-visas issued before the suspension of the service but which have not yet been used for entry in to Azerbaijan have been annulled. See Safety and Security
Consular support is not available in the Nagorno-Karabakh region. Tensions between Azerbaijan and Armenia over Nagorno-Karabakh continue. Several ceasefire violations along the Line of Contact separating the opposing forces and elsewhere on the inter-state border between Azerbaijan and Armenia took place in 2018, resulting in a number of deaths and casualties. Anyone who has visited Nagorno-Karabakh without the permission of the Azerbaijani authorities will be refused entry to Azerbaijan. See Local travel
Terrorists are likely to try to carry out attacks in Azerbaijan. See Terrorism
If youâ€™re abroad and you need emergency help from the UK government, contact the nearest British embassy, consulate or high commission.
Given the rapidly changing situation, we have temporarily withdrawn a limited number of UK staff and dependants from our Embassy. The Embassy continues to carry out essential work, including providing 24/7 consular assistance and support to British people in Azerbaijan.
Take out comprehensive travel and medical insurance, including cover for medical evacuation, before you travel.
