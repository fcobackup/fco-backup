This page has information on travelling to Trinidad and Tobago. Check what you must do to return to the UK.
This page reflects the UK government’s understanding of current rules for people travelling on a full ‘British Citizen’ passport from the UK, for the most common types of travel.
The authorities in Trinidad and Tobago set and enforce entry rules.
All travellers
All travelers from the UK must present on arrival a valid negative NASOPHARYNGEAL (nasal swab) RT-PCR test result OR a negative Lab Acquired Antigen Test result (home Antigen tests will not be accepted) taken no more than 48 hours (2 days) in advance of your flight’s arrival. The COVID-19 test result must be presented in English.
Effective 1 June the TTravel Pass for entry into Trinidad and Tobago was discontinued.
All travellers including vaccinated and unvaccinated non-nationals entering Trinidad and Tobago without a negative test will be placed in state quarantine at their own cost.
Quarantine for arrivals without a negative test
Travellers entering Trinidad and Tobago without a negative test will be placed in state quarantine at their own cost. A negative PCR or antigen test can be provided at any time during the quarantine period as a condition of release.
Facemasks are mandatory, and it is a legal requirement for all individuals aged 8 years and over to wear a mask in public spaces. Failure to do so attracts a fine. You should adhere to all precautionary measures put in place by the local authorities including the mandatory wearing of facemasks in vehicles unless occupants are family members who live under the same roof.
During travel, all passengers arriving into Trinidad and Tobago must wear properly fitting face masks and are encouraged to adhere to existing public health and social measures. Visit the Ministry of Health website for full detail.

Children aged 18 and under must present on arrival a valid negative NASOPHARYNGEAL (nasal swab) RT-PCR test result OR a negative Lab Acquired Antigen Test result (home Antigen tests will not be accepted) taken no more than 48 hours (2 days) in advance of your flight’s arrival.

If you’re transiting through Trinidad and Tobago
Transiting is when you pass through one country on the way to your final destination.
Travellers transiting through Trinidad and Tobago on their way to another country and who are staying in the airport (airside) are not subject to any vaccination requirement.
However, if you need to pass through immigration, for example to stay in a hotel for a flight the next day (sometimes known as a layover) or in order to board a connecting flight at a different airport Terminal, you will need to follow vaccination and testing requirements (and show proof at immigration).
Further information about transiting through Trinidad and Tobago can be found on the TTravel Pass website.
Sailing travel restrictions
You can sail into and transit out of the marinas or Chaguaramas Bay. You are required to wear a mask (unless you are a family group). Failure to follow government regulations could result in being intercepted by the Coast Guard and being handed over to the Trinidad and Tobago Police Service. If you are entering Trinidad & Tobago by boat for the first time you will be required to clear Immigration and Customs first in Trinidad, not Tobago.
Check your passport and travel documents before you travel
