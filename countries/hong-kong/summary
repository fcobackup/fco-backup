There is an ongoing outbreak of coronavirus in China and elsewhere in the region, including Hong Kong. On 28 January Hong Kong SAR Government announced a series of measures designed to prevent the spread of the virus. These measures, that will come into effect at midnight (local time) on 30 January, include the suspension or scaling back of flights, trains, ferries and buses between Hong Kong and mainland China. Visitors to Hong Kong may be asked to provide details of their travel 14 days prior to arrival. Non-Hong Kong residents who may have been exposed to the coronavirus may not be allowed to enter Hong Kong. Hong Kong residents who are currently in areas affected by the virus are asked to go into 14 days of self-imposed isolation upon return to Hong Kong to prevent the spread of infection. The Hong Kong Government website provides further information. See Health
Since June 2019, large-scale political demonstrations have taken place throughout the Hong Kong Special Administrative Region (SAR), including in areas popular with tourists. While a number of peaceful activities have taken place, many other protests have led to clashes between police and protesters involving significant violence.
The situation around protests and public gatherings can change quickly, with the potential for violence, especially during unauthorised protests. If you’re in an area where demonstrations are taking place, you should remain vigilant, follow the advice of local authorities and move away quickly to a safe place. Previous demonstrations have led to sections of the city being closed off and temporary suspension of public transport without warning.
