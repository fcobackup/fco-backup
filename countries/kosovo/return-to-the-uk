Following measures taken by the authorities in Kosovo, there are currently no commercial means of leaving Kosovo to return to the UK.
Following the special commercial flight to London on 6 April, the British Embassy currently has no plans to facilitate further flights. For British nationals still in Kosovo, you should follow the advice of the Kosovan authorities. You should follow the British Embassy in Pristina’s social media accounts for updates on any flights that may become available. See further general advice.
A number of border crossings with neighbouring countries are closed for passenger traffic, and neighbouring countries have also placed restrictions on international travel. You should check FCO travel advice for the relevant country before attempting to cross a border.
You will need to pay for your return travel to the UK. If departure options are available but you cannot afford the travel costs and have exhausted all other options for getting funds, you may be eligible to apply for an emergency loan from the government. This is a last resort option and you would need to repay the loan when you are back in the UK. For more information, you should contact Corporate Travel Management (CTM). CTM are a commercial partner of the FCO and are authorised to administer such loans on behalf of the FCO.
See more information and advice about staying where you are if you cannot return to the UK.
