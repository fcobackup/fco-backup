Be prepared for your plans to change
No travel is risk-free during COVID-19. Countries may further restrict travel or bring in new rules at short notice, for example due to a new COVID-19 variant. Check with your travel company or airline for any transport changes which may delay your journey home.
If you test positive for COVID-19, you may need to stay where you are until you test negative. You may also need to seek treatment there.
Plan ahead and make sure you:
can access money
understand what your insurance will cover
can make arrangements to extend your stay and be away for longer than planned
Travel in Malaysia
Check local government websites, social media channels, and media reporting for up to date information on any travel restrictions.
For further clarification, you may refer to the Royal Malaysia Police directory and contact the police department near you.
You can get to and from the airport by taxi, or using the KLIA express train to/from Kuala Lumpur Sentral station. A bus service does operate from Kuala Lumpur Sentral, but infrequently.
You must wear a face mask on public transport and in taxis.
Public spaces and services
Mask wearing is a voluntary practice. However, the Ministry of Health continues to recommend that you must wear a mask in a crowded or badly ventilated area such as public transportation, medical facilities and elderly care homes. You may also be asked to still wear a face mask in some indoor areas.
You must carry your passport at all times. As of 1 July 2022, you are required to submit your current passport to HMPO when making a renewal passport application. Ensure you obtain a photocopy of the data page and any relevant visas before submitting your current passport.
You should follow local news for updates.
If you are found to be in breach of any of the operating procedures in place you may be detained and fined. This has happened to foreign nationals.
Immigration
On 12 April 2021, the Malaysian Immigration Department announced that those who have overstayed on a social visit pass that has expired since 1 January 2020 must leave the country by 21 April 2021. To date we have not received any official notification of this policy, or that this deadline has been extended.
If you have not been able to leave the country and have overstayed your social visit pass, the Immigration Department recommends informing the enforcement division at the local immigration office urgently. You will have to provide a flight ticket dated within 30 days of doing so, and pay a fine based on the number of days from 22 April 2021 to your departure date. The Immigration Department will then issue the special pass. Please note the British High Commission is unable to provide any assistance for you to remain in Malaysia, including issuing any document to support your overstay.
