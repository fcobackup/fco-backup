The currency in Russia is the Russian rouble (RUB).
The value of the Ruble has fallen considerably in recent days, and there are reports of large numbers of people attempting to withdraw their savings from Russian banks. You should be aware that any amounts of Russian currency you hold may reduce in value over the coming days.
MasterCard and Visa have announced they are suspending operations in Russia. This means that MasterCard and Visa cards issued outside of Russia will not work at Russian merchants or ATMs. Cards issued inside Russia may continue to work in Russia but they will not work outside of Russia. You should be aware that it may not be possible for you to access your funds through Russian banks or to make payments to Russian businesses with non-Russian credit/debit cards.
As the economy continues to be highly volatile, this may lead to broader disruption and difficulties. You should be aware that access to goods and services may become unreliable.
Credit/debit cards are widely used in major Russian cities, including most hotels, restaurants, tourist attractions, supermarkets and other shops. ATMs are easy to find; predominantly in bank outlets.
Let your credit/debit card provider know where you’re going to avoid your card being blocked for anti-fraud reasons. You should report the loss of your credit/debit card to your provider as soon as possible.
It is no longer easy to obtain roubles through high street banks or currency providers in the UK.
If you plan to buy roubles in Russia, you should take US dollars or euros to exchange, and only change money at banks, hotels and exchange bureaux. It is an offence to change money from street traders.
It’s illegal to pay directly for general transactions with dollars or euros.
