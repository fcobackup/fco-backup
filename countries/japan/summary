There is an ongoing outbreak of coronavirus (COVID-19), including in Japan.
From 21 March, all passengers arriving in Japan from the UK, are required to self-isolate for 14 days on arrival. In addition, Japan will suspend the validity of single and multiple entry visas. We understand Japan will also imminently announce suspension of the visa waiver system for anyone travelling on a British Citizen or British National (Overseas) passport, meaning that you would not be able to enter Japan as a visitor for up to 90 days without a visa. British nationals currently in Japan as a ‘Temporary Visitor’ can remain in Japan until the end of the 90 day period granted. British nationals who are living in Japan and who are currently outside of Japan will be able to return unless they have travelled to any of the countries to which an entry ban currently applies within 14 days prior to their return (see Health section for list of countries where an entry ban to Japan is in place): See Entry Requirements and Health
You are advised to contact your airline or tour operator before you travel. Those who want to return to the UK soon should take account of the fast moving situation and plan accordingly.
