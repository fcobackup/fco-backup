The Kyrgyzstan authorities have declared a state of emergency and introduced a number of precautionary measures, including a ban on foreign nationals entering the country and movement restrictions in major cities. See Staying during coronavirus and Entry requirements.
Terrorist attacks in Kyrgyzstan can’t be ruled out. You should be vigilant in public places and follow security advice from the local authorities. See Terrorism.
Take care if you travel to the Oblasts (Provinces) of Osh, Batken and Jalal-Abad. See Local travel
All land borders are currently closed in response to the outbreak of coronavirus (COVID-19), except for transit of key goods. You should follow local government announcements and media reporting for updates on opening and additional security procedures.
Skirmishes can occur along the disputed Kyrgyz-Tajik border. Previous incidents have involved both civilians and border guards and several have involved firearms. There are also occasional security incidents on the Kyrgyz/Uzbek and Kyrgyz/Kazakh borders. There’s a risk of further localised violence and border closures at any time. You should remain vigilant in border areas and check local media reports before you travel. See Local travel
The Kazakh / Kyrgyz border is currently closed. You should also be aware that Kazakhstan has introduced new visa requirements. See the Visas Section of Travel Advice for Kazakhstan for more information.
There is a high risk of earthquakes. See Natural Disasters
You must carry your passport, or a notarised copy of it, at all times. See Local laws and customs
Dual nationality isn’t recognised in Kyrgyzstan. If you enter Kyrgyzstan on a Kyrgyz passport and also hold British nationality the British Embassy can only provide very limited consular assistance. In cases of arrest or detention, consular access is unlikely to be granted.
If you’re abroad and you need emergency help from the UK government, contact the nearest British embassy, consulate or high commission.
Take out comprehensive travel and medical insurance before you travel.
