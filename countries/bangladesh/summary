Terrorists are very likely to try to carry out attacks in Bangladesh. The threat extends across the country. There were several IED attacks targeting police and security forces in Dhaka and Khulna in 2019, and an attack in Chittagong in February 2020. There is a risk that future attacks could target public gatherings, including religious gatherings and political rallies, crowded areas, places with a police or security presence and locations where foreign nationals are known to gather. You should minimise your exposure to these areas, consider your movements carefully and follow any specific advice of the local authorities. See Terrorism
Political rallies with the potential for disorder or clashes between groups and with law enforcement agencies may take place. Across Bangladesh you are advised to avoid large gatherings, including those for religious gatherings, festivals and political rallies. See Political violence
