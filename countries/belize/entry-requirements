This page has information on travelling to Belize. Check what you must do to return to the UK.
This page reflects the UK government’s understanding of current rules for people travelling on a full ‘British Citizen’ passport from the UK, for the most common types of travel.
The authorities in Belize set and enforce entry rules.
All travellers
British nationals do not need a visa to enter Belize. On arrival, you’ll be allowed to enter for one month. Any extension to remain in the country will incur a fee of BZD$200 for each month’s extension.
There are no direct flights between the UK and Belize. The regulations of countries that you may pass through and / or UK requirements on travel from transit countries may affect your travel. For more information see FCDO Travel Advice on the countries through which you may travel or transit.
Foreign tourists are required to pay BZ$36 (US$18) for Belize Travel Health Insurance – this is mandatory even if you already have personal travel insurance and helps protect against incurred medical and non-medical expenses should you test positive for COVID during your stay in Belize. It covers up to a 21 day stay; an extended coverage can be purchased if you are staying longer. It is recommended to buy this in advance via Belize Travel Insurance though it can be bought upon arrival at the Philip Goldson International Airport, Santa Elena Border (Northern border) or the Belize Western border. Foreign nationals with long stay status, airline crew and personnel, cruise ship passengers and crew, travellers staying in Belize for 1 day or less and foreign government officials and diplomats are exempt.
Protocols and procedures are subject to change at short notice. Further information is available from the Belize Tourism Board, Travel Belize or Belize Port Authority.
If you’re fully vaccinated
Fully vaccinated visitors no longer require a negative COVID test but must show proof of immunisation for entry at Belize’s airport, land borders or sea ports.
Proof of vaccination status
You must present proof that you have been fully vaccinated to enter Belize.
Belize will accept the UK’s proof of COVID-19 recovery and vaccination record and proof of COVID-19 vaccination issued in the Crown Dependencies. A digital or hard copy of an up to date NHS COVID pass showing two doses of an approved vaccine (or one for Johnson and Johnson) is accepted as proof of immunisation / full vaccination.
Your NHS appointment card from vaccination centres is not designed to be used as proof of vaccination and should not be used to demonstrate your vaccine status.
If you’re not fully vaccinated
If unable to show proof of being fully vaccinated or if unvaccinated, you must present a negative result from a PCR test taken within the 72 hours prior to arrival or an approved rapid antigen test (home testing kits are not accepted) taken within the 48 hours prior to arrival, or a test can be administered at the airport for a fee of BZ$100 or US$50 (which must be paid in cash).
If you receive a positive result on arrival, you will be required to undertake a mandatory quarantine at an approved quarantine hotel at your own expense. The Ministry of Health will monitor each case. A negative test is required as proof of recovery.
If you’ve had COVID-19 in the past year
If you’re not fully vaccinated but have tested positive for COVID-19 in the last year you can enter Belize. You’ll need to show evidence of a positive PCR test (taken more than 14 days and less than a year ago). You will not need to take an additional COVID-19 test.
You can use the UK COVID Pass to demonstrate proof of COVID-19 recovery when entering Belize.
Children and young people
Children aged 12 and above can follow the rules for fully vaccinated travellers to enter Belize.
Children under the age of 12 shall not be subjected to testing for COVID-19 upon entry into Belize through airport, land or sea port and do not need to show proof of vaccination to enter Belize.
If you’re transiting through Belize
Transiting is when you pass through one country on the way to your final destination.
All transiting passengers, regardless of vaccination status, are required to provide either a negative COVID test or documentation of recovery to enter Belize.
