This page gives you guidance on how to stay safely in Canada as a visitor, if you are unable to return to the UK.
Everyone should comply with the measures put in place in Canada to limit the spread of coronavirus (COVID-19).
Moving around in Canada
To help curb the spread of coronavirus, provincial governments have introduced a number of measures. There are some regional variations, but they generally include:
a ban on social gatherings
closure of schools, colleges and many public facilities, museums, cinemas and theatres
closure of bars, restaurants and non-essential stores in many cities and regions
some public transport offering only a limited service
The authorities are urging people to stay at home where possible, and many businesses are closed.
Anyone showing symptoms associated with coronavirus will be barred from domestic flights and some inter-city train services. From 20 April, non-medical face masks or face coverings are required for all flights to and from Canadian airports. The Canadian authorities strongly encourage the use of non-medical face masks or face coverings for marine, rail and bus transportation.
Both the federal and provincial governments may introduce further restrictions at short notice, including closing provincial borders, internal travel restrictions, a provisional ban on temporary foreign workers, or mandatory self-isolation for people arriving from other provinces. You should comply with the rules and advice of local authorities in relation to coronavirus. Check guidance for each province.
