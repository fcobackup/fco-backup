Cases of coronavirus (COVID-19) have been confirmed in Chile. The Chilean authorities have introduced a number of measures to limit the spread of the virus.
Since 25 March, the government of Chile has announced quarantine and curfews within communes in Santiago and around the country more generally. Please see the Embassy’s Twitter@ukinchile and Facebook accounts British Embassy Santiago for updates on current restrictions. You can also monitor local authority websites. In those areas affected, you may leave your residence under certain circumstances, including for medical reasons, basic services, and public services, with an online permission from the local police.
There are now no commercial flights out of Chile to the UK. See Coronavirus and Return to the UK
If you have an urgent consular issue – such as a request for an Emergency Travel Document – you will need to pre-book an appointment online. We are not able to respond to British Nationals who visit the Embassy without a pre-booked appointment.
There still remains the potential for protests and violence across Chile. Following civil unrest in October and November 2019 across Chile you may see a police presence in major cities. There is potential for further demonstrations with a risk of violence in Santiago, Valparaiso, Viña del Mar, Antofagasta, Concepcion and other major cities.
In Santiago, protests largely took place in Plaza Baquedano/Plaza Italia and in Las Condes, Providencia and Vitacura districts. In Valparaiso, protests have frequently taken place on a Friday. If protests take place, you should follow the instructions and advice of the local authorities, remain vigilant, monitor local media for updates and avoid protests and demonstrations. Under Chilean law, foreign nationals visiting or living in Chile could be deported for involvement in protests and demonstrations. See Local laws and customs
Public transport is largely running as normal, however, some Santiago Metro stations remain closed. For updated information about public transport, roads and others, you should monitor Chile Reports.
Around 80,000 British nationals visit Chile each year. Most visits to Chile are trouble-free.
Opportunistic street crime can be a problem in towns and cities, and in areas popular with tourists including airports, bus stations and ports. Take care of your personal belongings at all times and be aware of your surroundings. Carry a photocopy of your passport and keep the original document in a safe place.
There have been incidents involving people being followed from Santiago International Airport to their destinations and then robbed, sometimes at gunpoint. Be aware of your surroundings in and around the airport, when driving away and on arrival at your destination. In case of an incident, do not offer resistance. See Crime
