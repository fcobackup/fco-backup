Coronavirus guidance is being updated.
Read the Prime Minister’s statement for the latest information.

The information on this page covers the most common types of travel and reflects the UK government’s understanding of the rules currently in place. Unless otherwise stated, this information is for travellers using a full ‘British Citizen’ passport.
The authorities in the country or territory you’re travelling to are responsible for setting and enforcing the rules for entry. If you’re unclear about any aspect of the entry requirements, or you need further reassurance, you’ll need to contact the embassy, high commission or consulate of the country or territory you’re travelling to.
You should also consider checking with your transport provider or travel company to make sure your passport and other travel documents meet their requirements.
Restrictions in response to coronavirus
Entry restrictions and heightened checks on Germany’s borders for those arriving by land or air from within the EU, Norway, Liechtenstein, Iceland or the UK expired at 00.01 on 15 June. Since 15 June there are no general COVID-19-related restrictions on entry into Germany from these countries. The only exception is for Spain, where the restrictions on entry (by air) will not be lifted until 21 June. The German Interior Ministry has confirmed that since 15 June travellers from the UK are no longer required to demonstrate a valid reason in order to obtain entry into Germany. Instead UK nationals remain subject to the standard German rules on entry and immigration in place before the COVID-19 outbreak.
The German Interior Ministry has encouraged federal states to revise their quarantine regulations for arriving and returning travellers. Persons entering from other EU countries, the Schengen area and the UK will only have to go into quarantine if they are entering from an area where there is a high rate of infection. Travellers should consult local federal state and health authority guidance for specific arrangements (see Federal Interior Ministry FAQs)
It remains possible for British citizens (and all EU/EEA citizens) to transit via Germany in order to go home or to their place of habitual residence.
You should ensure you are aware of your airline’s policy on protective measures on board flights; some carriers have made the wearing of face masks compulsory, for example.
The Federal Ministry of the Interior has detailed information on its website, including in English, regarding the rules on entry and exit from Germany.
