UK government support
UK government support is limited in Libya. If you are in Libya and need urgent help from the UK government (for example, if you’ve been attacked, arrested or someone has died) contact the British Embassy in Tunis, Tunisia who provide assistance for British nationals in Libya. In-person support is not available in Libya. If you are a British national already in, or planning to travel to Tripoli, you should have robust security arrangements and contingency plans in place.
