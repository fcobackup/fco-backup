Iceland is volcanically and seismically active.
A fissure eruption occurred in March 2021 at Geldingadalur on the Reykjanes Penninsula and is still active. Larger volcanic eruptions took place in the area around the Bárðarbunga volcano on the Vatnajökull glacier in the east of Iceland in August 2014, and Eyjafjallajokull volcano in the south of Iceland in 2010 and Grimsvötn volcanoes erupted in 2010 and 2011 respectively causing disruption to Icelandic and European airspace.
Further volcanic eruptions are possible and there is the potential for sulphur dioxide and other volcanic gases to be emitted during eruptions as well as causing glacial floods. An ORANGE warning has been issued for Grímsvötn volcano in South East Iceland. The likelihood of an eruption is increased, you should continue to monitor alerts from the Icelandic Met Office.
If you have existing respiratory conditions, take particular care, monitor emissions and follow the advice of the Icelandic authorities.
If you plan to visit the Geldingadalur eruption site please note its remote location. You can only reach the site via a hiking trail over rugged terrain that can take several hours. Good hiking shoes, warm clothing and wind and waterproof outerwear is essential. Beware gas emissions levels and follow advice of emergency services on site.
There has been seismic activity in the South West and North of Iceland. Tremors can be numerous but usually don’t cause damage. However, they can cause rock falls and avalanches in the mountain areas. You should take care when driving and hiking in these areas. Follow the safety advice of the Icelandic authorities.
