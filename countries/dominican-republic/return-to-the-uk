The Dominican Republic’s air borders have reopened and some international flights have restarted. Commercial options are departing to the US and some other countries, although these are still limited. Although direct onward flights from the USA to the UK are still operating, these are also becoming limited both in frequency and availability.
British Nationals may be able to travel to the UK via the United States from the Dominican Republic, providing they hold a valid ESTA. You should consult the ESTA pages to check individual eligibility. Passengers must have an onward ticket to the UK in order to transit and be able to prove that they have not been in Europe, China or Iran in the past 14 days. Otherwise you may be denied boarding or entry on arrival at a US port.
Alternative routes from the USA, transiting via a third country such as the Republic of Ireland or the Netherlands to reach the UK, may be possible. Read the FCO travel advice for the USA and any other country you may be transiting, to check entry/transit requirements.
You will need to pay for your return travel to the UK. If departure options are available but you cannot afford the travel costs and have exhausted all other options for getting funds, you may be eligible to apply for an emergency loan from the government. This is a last resort option and you would need to repay the loan when you are back in the UK. For more information, you should contact Corporate Travel Management (CTM). CTM are a commercial partner of the FCO and are authorised to administer such loans on behalf of the FCO.
If you cannot leave the Dominican Republic at this time, see advice on staying in Dominican Republic during coronavirus.
