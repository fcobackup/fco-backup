Crime
Levels of crime in the Turks and Caicos Islands are relatively low. However, the level of crime on Providenciales, the first point of arrival into the Turks and Caicos Islands for most visitors and the territory’s economic hub, is higher than on the other islands where incidences of serious crime are less frequent. Most crime tends to be as a result of opportunistic burglary and theft, although an increase in more serious robberies against individuals has been reported. Victims of robberies may suffer injuries if they resist.
Safeguard your possessions and take normal precautions to ensure your personal safety, including when using ATM machines, especially at night. Avoid carrying large amounts of cash and valuables. Take particular care of your passport as this can’t be replaced locally. Use hotel safety deposit facilities where possible.
See the Turks and Caicos crime-stoppers website for more crime prevention tips.
Local travel
If you go to isolated spots or remote islands, or go diving/snorkelling, leave details of your trip and an expected time of return with a friend, relative, or hotel receptionist. Avoid isolated spots and unlit roads at night.
Standard taxi fares exist for most destinations on the principal islands. Charges may be applied per person. Clarify the fare with the driver before beginning a journey.
Road travel
You can drive using a British Driving Licence or an International Driving Permit for a period of one month. After this you should get a local licence from the Department of Road Safety.
Most hire cars and jeeps are imported from the US and so are left-hand drive even though driving is on the left (as in the UK). Remember to drive on the left. Observe speed limits (20mph in town, and 40mph elsewhere). Don’t drink and drive. Use seat belts on all journeys. Accidents, sometimes serious, are on the increase on the Leeward Highway (Providenciales), especially at night. Be aware of cyclists and, even, cars driving at night without lights.
Emergency assistance
The Turks and Caicos Islands is a British Overseas Territory so does not have formal British consular representation. All emergency assistance needed by British nationals is delivered by the Turks and Caicos Islands government.
If you’re a victim of crime, contact the Royal Turks and Caicos Islands Police on 911.
