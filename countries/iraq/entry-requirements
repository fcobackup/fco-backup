Warning
FCDO advises against all but essential travel to parts of Iraq.

This information is for people travelling on a full ‘British citizen’ passport from the UK who choose to travel despite FCDO advice. It is based on the UK government’s understanding of Iraq’s current rules for the most common types of travel.
The authorities in Iraq set and enforce entry rules. If you’re not sure how these requirements apply to you, contact the Iraqi Embassy in the UK.
Passport validity requirements
To enter Iraq, your passport must have an ‘expiry date’ at least 6 months after the date you arrive and have at least one blank page.
Check with your travel provider that your passport and other travel documents meet requirements. Renew your passport if you need to.
You will be denied entry if you do not have a valid travel document or try to use a passport that has been reported lost or stolen.
Visa requirements
You must have a visa to visit Iraq.
You may be eligible to get a visit visa on arrival in Iraq. Check with the Iraqi Embassy in London or the Iraqi Consulate in Manchester before you travel. You must pay any fees for visas on arrival in Iraq, including the Kurdistan Region of Iraq, in US dollars. You must pay by credit card, as cash payments are no longer accepted.
e-visa for Kurdistan Region
The government of the Kurdistan Region of Iraq (KRI) has introduced a new e-visa process. You can find the details and apply on the e-visa portal of the Kurdistan Region Government. It is also possible to obtain a visa on arrival. Both types of visas are valid for travel in KRI only. 
Weapon Authority Cards
Make sure you have the right documents when you arrive in Iraq, including Weapon Authority Cards (WAC) if you are carrying weapons.
Foreign nationals have been arrested for failing to provide the correct documentation when requested.
HIV and hepatitis test
You must have a blood test for HIV and hepatitis unless you’re travelling on a visit visa. You must take the test within 10 days of arrival and repeat it every 90 days while you’re in Iraq. Guidance on where to go for the blood test is available at the airport when you arrive.
Customs rules
There are strict rules about goods you can take into or out of Iraq. You must declare anything that may be prohibited or subject to tax or duty.
Taking money into or out of Iraq
On entering or exiting Iraq you must declare all currency or items valued over 200,000 Iraqi dinars (10,000 US dollars), or the same value in other foreign currencies.
