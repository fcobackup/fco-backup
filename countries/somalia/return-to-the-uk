Flights from Somaliland
There are still commercial options to return to the UK from Somaliland. If you live in the UK and are currently visiting Somaliland, you are strongly advised to return now by commercial means. Don’t risk getting stranded.

You will need to pay for your return travel to the UK. If departure options are available but you cannot afford the travel costs and have exhausted all other options for getting funds, you may be eligible to apply for an emergency loan from the government. This is a last resort option and you would need to repay the loan when you are back in the UK. For more information, contact Corporate Travel Management (CTM). CTM are a commercial partner of the FCO and are authorised to administer such loans on behalf of the FCO.
