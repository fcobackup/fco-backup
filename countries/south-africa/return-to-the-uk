South African airspace is closed to commercial airlines as part of efforts to contain the spread of coronavirus. International commercial passenger flights are unlikely to resume for some time.
Land borders
Land borders to neighbouring countries are closed except for essential trade.
Flights
The British government has finished operating charter flights between South Africa and the UK. We are not planning any more of these flights.
Some other countries are still organising a limited number of repatriation flights, which British nationals may use to get connecting flights to the UK. All repatriation flights are subject to approval from the South African authorities. It is not uncommon for such approval to be granted after flights have been advertised. You should therefore check with all airlines offering flights whether their published schedules are confirmed or subject to change before booking tickets and travelling. If the flight is subject to change, you should check with your airline 48 hours before you travel to ensure the flight is still going ahead.
The British High Commission is not responsible for the organisation or approval of the flights listed below. Sign up for travel advice email alerts and follow the British High Commission on Twitter.

These are flights with onward connections to the UK. If you wish to travel on one of these flights you should book through the respective airline directly. You will need to book your onward journey to the UK yourself.
If you have a flight ticket to go to the UK, the South African authorities have said you will need a permission letter from the British High Commission to enable you to travel to the assembly point for your flight. If you need such a letter, please email your name, passport number and flight ticket details no earlier than five days prior to your flight date to SouthAfricaBritishNationalReturns@fco.gov.uk. We can only issues letters if the flight is due to depart within five days, and letters are normally issued 24 hours before travel. We cannot provide these letters for those who obtain short term visit visas other than in exceptional (e.g. compassionate) circumstances as short term visitors do not qualify for repatriation flights under current South African government regulations.
Private planes and boats
If you wish to leave South Africa on a private plane or a boat, you may need permission from the South African authorities. You should make your request via the British High Commission. Email details of your planned journey and your passenger details to SouthAfricaBritishNationalReturns@fco.gov.uk at least 10 working days before you need to travel.
