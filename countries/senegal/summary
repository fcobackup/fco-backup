Before you travel, check the ‘Entry requirements’ section for Senegal’s current entry restrictions and requirements. These may change with little warning. Monitor this advice for the latest updates and stay in contact with your travel provider.
If you plan to pass through another country to return to the UK, check the travel advice for the country you’re transiting.
If you are travelling between the UK and Senegal and transiting via a third country, check our travel advice for that country.
It is more important than ever to get travel insurance and check it provides sufficient cover. See the FCDO’s guidance on foreign travel insurance.
Masks must be worn at all times in public areas and when travelling, including in a private car if there are two or more people in the car. See Coronavirus
Political demonstrations
Demonstrations about political issues occur frequently and are likely to increase in the build up to presidential elections in February 2024.
These demonstrations usually take place in Dakar and other cities. They can turn violent.
Protestors sometimes block major roads, including the road between Blaise Diagne International Airport (DSS) and the city of Dakar.
On 31 July, the principal opposition leader Ousmane Sonko was taken to prison. We expect clashes between police and protestors in the coming days. In previous riots, key roads have been blocked by protestors, property damaged and many shops and restaurants closed. Protests have generally been most intense in the afternoons and evenings.
Those living in Dakar or other major cities should consider stocking up on food, water and fuel. Once protests have begun, you should:
monitor the local media for information about forthcoming protests
follow the instructions of local authorities
avoid areas where demonstrations and large gatherings are taking place and exercise cautio
If you are in doubt about where protests are taking place, or the level of safety of an area, remain at home or in your hotel. Pickpocketing and street crime are common in parts of Dakar, particularly around Place de l’Indépendance, the central area of the Plateau and the Western Corniche, as well as Gorée Island.
There is a heightened risk of criminality in the run up to religious festivals. Be cautious when changing cash given the risk of false money circulating. See Safety and security
Terrorist attacks in Senegal can’t be ruled out. Attacks could be indiscriminate, including in places visited by foreigners. See Terrorism
You should be vigilant when travelling in Casamance, the region south of The Gambia. For more information see Local travel
