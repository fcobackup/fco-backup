This page has information on travelling to Malawi. Check what you must do to return to the UK.
This page reflects the UK government’s understanding of current rules for people travelling on a full ‘British Citizen’ passport from the UK, for the most common types of travel.
The authorities in Malawi set and enforce entry rules.
All travellers
You need a visa to enter Malawi as a visitor. See Visas for more information.
If you’re fully vaccinated, you must still present proof of a negative COVID-19 PCR test not older than 72 hours from your time of departure from your country of origin in order to enter Malawi. You may also be tested for COVID-19 on arrival at your own expense. Passengers may be required to remain at the airport or a testing centre until their COVID-19 test results are known, usually within 24 hours. Individuals testing positive for coronavirus on arrival may be taken for treatment at a government facility. All other individuals will be required to self-monitor for COVID-19 signs and symptoms for 14 days after arrival. This allows the traveller to interact with others but they will be required to strictly observe physical distancing and hand hygiene, and must always use a mask in public.
You should not use the NHS testing service to get a test in order to facilitate your travel to another country.
COVID-19 entry and exit requirements may be announced and altered at little notice. You should monitor the Malawi Ministry of Health Facebook page for the latest developments.
Flights in to and out of Malawi from South Africa, Kenya or Ethiopia may also be affected by their own coronavirus (COVID-19) response. Follow our travel advice for South Africa, Kenya and Ethiopia for information on entry and transit requirements.
