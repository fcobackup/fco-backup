Around 90,000 British nationals visit Ghana every year. While most visits are trouble-free, crime does occur. In recent years, reported crime has increased, particularly over the Christmas period. Criminal activity ranging from petty street crime, to violent crime can occur at any time. Take sensible precautions. Be particularly vigilant in public areas, and take care when travelling by road.

It’s mandatory for all foreign nationals resident in Ghana to register with the National Identification Authority (NIA) of Ghana and get a non-citizen Ghana card. See Local laws and customs
Localised outbreaks of civil unrest can occur at short notice, and can become violent (sometimes involving weapons). You should remain vigilant, avoid any large public gatherings and demonstrations, monitor local media for up-to-date information, and follow the advice of local authorities. See Local travel
Terrorists are likely to try to carry out attacks in Ghana. Attacks could be indiscriminate, including in places visited by foreigners. See Terrorism
