Cases of coronavirus (COVID-19) have been confirmed in Kosovo. The authorities in Kosovo have introduced a number of strict measures to limit the spread of the virus, which you should follow.
Entry and borders
Land borders are closed to entry by non-Kosovo citizens. It is possible to leave the country by land, but a number of border crossings with neighbouring countries are closed for passenger traffic, and neighbouring countries have also placed restrictions on international travel. You should check FCO travel advice for the relevant country before attempting to cross a border.
Local measures
All schools, cafes, bars, restaurants and shopping centres have been closed. Food stores and pharmacies remain open. Public transport has been restricted. There are restrictions on public gatherings. A number of events in Kosovo in the coming weeks and months have been cancelled.
Residents are required to stay in their homes for all but essential journeys, especially those over 65 years old. From 15 April until at least 3 May, people over the age of 16 are only allowed out for a single 90 minute period during the day, dependent on the penultimate digit of their ID or Passport number. Check the Minister of Health’s announcement for more details, with English translation at the bottom of the page. The times people are permitted to be out can be found on the Ministry of Health’s Facebook page.
A number of municipalities have been placed under quarantine, meaning transport in and out of the municipality is restricted. These include Pristina, Prizren, Ferizaj, Viti/Vitina, Klina, Malishevo, Mitrovica North, Zvečan and Suharekea/Suva Reka.
Further information
The authorities in Kosovo have set up an online platform with basic information and advice available in English. There is a local Emergency Hotline for people who think they may have coronavirus. The number is 038 200 80 800.
Further information on coronavirus, including advice on preparing for foreign travel and helping reduce the spread of the virus, is available from Public Health England and on the TravelHealthPro website.
