Terrorists are very likely to try to carry out attacks in Chad. Attacks could be indiscriminate, including in places frequented by foreigners like restaurants, bars, markets, hotels, shopping centres and places of worship.
Following the terrorist attacks on hotels in Bamako (Mali) and Ouagadougou (Burkina Faso) in November 2015 and January 2016, in which a number of people were killed, it’s possible that terrorist groups including Boko Haram and Ansaru will try to carry out similar attacks in Chad.
There have been numerous attacks by armed elements in the Lake Chad region throughout 2016 and 2017, where the terrorist group Boko Haram remains active. Military operations are ongoing and a state of emergency remains in place.
In 2015, there were a number of terrorist attacks in the capital, N’Djamena:
on 11 July 2015, a suicide bomb attack at N’Djamena’s main market (Grand Marché) killed 15 people
on 29 June 2015, a suicide bomb in the North-Eastern Diguel district of N’Djamena caused 11 fatalities
on 15 June 2015, at least 27 people were killed and over 100 injured following a number of explosions in central N’Djamena
Security in the capital has been reinforced and police check points and vehicle checks are routine. There have been no subsequent terrorist attacks in N’Djamena.
