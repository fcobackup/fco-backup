Be prepared for your plans to change
No travel is risk-free during COVID. Countries may further restrict travel or bring in new rules at short notice, for example due to a new COVID-19 variant. Check with your travel company or airline for any transport changes which may delay your journey home.
If you test positive for COVID-19, you may need to stay where you are until you test negative. You may also need to seek treatment there.
Plan ahead and make sure you:
can access money
understand what your insurance will cover
can make arrangements to extend your stay and be away for longer than planned
Travel in Fiji
Travel restrictions are in place in Fiji following a COVID-19 outbreak. A targeted lockdown continues in areas where clusters of COVID-19 exist and there are restrictions to travel between Viti Levu and other islands. Ensure you check the latest rules carefully when making travel plans.
Mask wearing on public transport is mandatory and people can be fined for non-compliance.
A nationwide curfew is in effect from 11pm to 4am each night. More information on the latest restrictions are available on the Fiji government website.
Accommodation
Some hotels and rental accommodation are open with COVID-19 protocols including social distancing measures in place.
Public places and services
Following the lifting of the majority of COVID-19 restrictions in October, many businesses and public places have reopened. Schools have begun a staggered reopening. Everyone is required to follow COVID-19 safety protocols and must use the contact tracing careFiji app to check in and out of businesses and public spaces.
The Fijian Government has introduced regulations that require all workers in both the public and private sector to obtain a COVID-19 vaccination. You may be asked for proof of vaccination when entering businesses including restaurants, bars and hotels.
There is a nationwide curfew and everyone is required to remain at home or in their accommodation between 11pm and 4am.
COVID-19 vaccines if you live in Fiji
Wherever possible British nationals should aim to be vaccinated in the country where they live. We will update this page when the Government of Fiji announces new information on the national vaccination programme. You can sign up to get email notifications when this page is updated.
The Fiji government has a nationwide vaccination programme including some drive-thru sites. Details of vaccination locations are posted on a daily basis on Fiji’s Ministry of Health website as well as their Facebook and Twitter accounts.
The Fiji national vaccination programme started in March 2021 and is using the AstraZeneca and Moderna vaccines. You will need your residence Permit Number and a valid photo ID (Passport, Voter ID Card, FNPF Card, Driver’s License, Student ID, TIN Joint Card) to register. Further information can be found on Fiji’s Ministry of Health website.
Find out more, including about vaccines that are authorised in the UK or approved by the World Health Organisation, on the COVID-19 vaccines if you live abroad page.
If you’re a British national living in Fiji, you should seek medical advice from your local healthcare provider. Information about COVID-19 vaccines used in the national programme where you live, including regulatory status, should be available from local authorities.
