Anyone not complying with this request risks legal action.
Entry and borders
Foreign nationals who have visited the EU region or Iran since 1 March cannot enter Bangladesh until 15 April.
Bangladeshi authorities have indicated passengers arriving from coronavirus-affected countries, including the UK, should complete Health Declaration Forms and Passenger Locator Forms provided by cabin crew. You may be subjected to additional health screening measures at the airport.
On arrival in Bangladesh, all foreign nationals are required to produce a medical certificate issued within 72 hours of travel indicating the passenger is symptom free. Passengers arriving from coronavirus affected countries, including the UK, are also required to quarantine for 14 days. Health officials at the point of entry to Bangladesh will assess whether passengers are able to self-quarantine or need to be taken to a government facility.
On 26 March the Bangladeshi authorities announced particular measures for passengers arriving with a No Visa Required certificate (an arrangement for foreign nationals of Bangladeshi heritage). Such passengers arriving in Bangladesh without a medical certificate indicating the passenger is symptom–free from coronavirus, or such passengers who display symptoms, will be placed into quarantine in a government facility for 14 days. Such passengers who arrive with a medical certificate indicating they are symptom-free are required to self-isolate at home for 14 days.
