This page has information on travelling to Nepal.
This page reflects the UK government’s understanding of current rules for people travelling on a full ‘British Citizen’ passport from the UK, for the most common types of travel.
The authorities in Nepal set and enforce entry rules. If you’re unsure how Nepal’s entry requirements apply to you, contact its UK embassy, high commission or consulate.
All travellers
Visas
You should be able to get a visa on arrival if you can prove your vaccination status.
People who have completed COVID-19 vaccination at least 14 days prior to entry to Nepal can get visas on arrival (you should bring proof of vaccination). Non-vaccinated people can also obtain visas on arrival, but – if unvaccinated, and aged over five years old – must be able to show a negative PCR test completed no more than 72 hours before the flight of first departure. Requirements are updated by Nepal’s Department of Immigration, sometimes at short notice.
Overstaying your visa in Nepal is a serious crime, and can lead to significant fines or potentially imprisonment. For the latest information on visa fees/fines please check the Nepal Immigration website.
Passport validity
Your passport must be valid for at least 6 months when you submit your application for a visa.

The Government of Nepal defines people who are fully vaccinated as those who have received full doses of an approved vaccine more than 14 days previously. If you’re not fully vaccinated, you must obtain a negative PCR test not more than 72 hours before your flight of first departure to enter Nepal, and should then be able to obtain a visa on arrival.
