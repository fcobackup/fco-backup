This information is for people travelling on a full ‘British citizen’ passport from the UK. It is based on the UK government’s understanding of Namibia’s current rules for the most common types of travel.
The authorities in Namibia set and enforce entry rules. If you’re not sure how these requirements apply to you, contact the Namibian High Commission in the UK.
COVID-19 rules
There are no COVID-19 testing or vaccination requirements for travellers entering Namibia.
Passport validity requirements
To enter Namibia, your passport must have an ‘expiry date’ at least 6 months after the date you arrive. It must also have at least one blank page. If you’re travelling to South Africa, you will need an additional 2 blank pages. 
Check with your travel provider that your passport and other travel documents meet requirements. Renew your passport if you need to.
You will be denied entry if you do not have a valid travel document or try to use a passport that has been reported lost or stolen.
Visa requirements
You can visit Namibia for up to 90 days without a visa. If you plan to work or volunteer, or if you want to stay longer, you must get a visa.
Applying for a visa
Apply through the Namibian High Commission in the UK. 
Make sure you get your passport stamped. 
Make sure the date on your entry stamp and the amount of time you have been given to stay is correct. Immigration officials will check these details when you leave Namibia.  
The Namibian authorities could detain, arrest or fine you if you overstay or have an incorrect or missing entry stamp in your passport. 
Travelling with children aged 17 and under
If you’re a parent travelling with children aged 17 and under, you must carry their:
valid passport
full birth certificate with both parents’ details (original or certified copy)
Namibian immigration officials will not accept an abridged (short) birth certificate. If your child was born in the UK, you can order a full unabridged birth certificate online.
If you’re a legal guardian and your name is not on the birth certificate, you will need to have documentation to prove it.
If you’re not a parent or legal guardian of children you’re travelling with, you must have an affidavit from their parents or guardians giving consent.
If a child is travelling with one parent or legal guardian, the other parent or legal guardian should give consent for travel in an affidavit.
Unaccompanied children must carry:
a valid passport
proof of consent from a parent or legal guardian in an affidavit
a letter from their host giving the address where they’ll be staying
Contact the Namibian High Commission in the UK for more information.
Travelling with children through a South African airport
If you’re travelling with children through a South African airport, see South Africa travel advice for information about the documents you must carry.
Vaccine requirements
To enter Namibia, you must have a certificate to prove you’ve had a yellow fever vaccination if you’re coming from a country listed as a transmission risk.
For full details about medical entry requirements and recommended vaccinations, see TravelHealthPro’s Namibia guide.   
Customs rules
There are strict rules about goods you can take into or out of Namibia. You must declare anything that may be prohibited or subject to tax or duty.
