Terrorists are very likely to try to carry out attacks in Mozambique. There has been an increasing intensity of attacks in areas of Cabo Delgado province dating back to January 2019. There was a large-scale attack on Palma in March/April 2021 in which dozens of people were killed. Since May/June 2022 there has been a series of attacks in the Ancuabe and Metuge districts of Cabo Delgado. Although there have been no recent reports of attacks in the Mecula, Mavago and Marrupa districts of Niassa Province, you should remain vigilant in these areas, as the situation may change with no prior warning. Militants have used explosives, machetes and firearms to conduct lethal attacks, as well as burning vehicles and homes. Attacks have been carried out on the mainland and on islands off the coast, including in areas frequented by foreigners. There is an increased security presence in the province, including road blocks, and there are regular clashes between militants, armed vigilante groups and Mozambican security forces. There is also a threat of kidnap in Mozambique, which is particularly acute in northern districts of Cabo Delgado province. See Terrorism
Coastal areas are at risk from tropical cyclones during the rainy season (November to April). Widespread flooding can also occur around river basins, especially the Zambezi, Licungo, Pungue, Buzi, Limpopo and Save. The rainy season (November to April) will also make roads harder to pass, and make some areas impassable.
There continues to be a risk of cyclone and tropical storm weather systems for the remainder of the rainy season (November to April). These may lead to widespread damage to infrastructure as well as disruption to basic services including communications, power and water supplies.
You should monitor the National Meterological Institute (in portuguese) for the latest information and follow instructions from the local authorities. See Natural disasters.
Most visits to Mozambique are trouble-free, but violent crime does occur and there have been cases of criminal kidnappings. You should take extra care. See Crime
Traffic accidents are common due to the condition of the roads, poor driving and vehicle standards. Always drive carefully and be aware of pedestrians using the roads. If you’re travelling by road make sure you have relevant documents with you at all times and monitor local media for traffic updates. See Road travel
Piracy remains a significant threat in the Gulf of Aden and Indian Ocean. See Sea travel
Consular support is limited in parts of Mozambique where the FCDO has existing advice against all but essential travel (see above). If you’re abroad and you need emergency help from the UK government, contact the nearest British embassy, consulate or high commission.
