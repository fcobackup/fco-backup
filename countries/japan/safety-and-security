Terrorism
There is a high threat of terrorist attack globally affecting UK interests and British nationals, including from groups and individuals who view the UK and British nationals as targets. You should remain vigilant at all times.
UK Counter Terrorism Policing has information and advice on staying safe abroad and what to do in the event of a terrorist attack. Find out how to reduce your risk from terrorism while abroad.
Terrorism in Japan
Terrorist attacks in Japan cannot be ruled out.   
Political situation
Japan is a stable democracy. Civil disturbance and violent demonstrations are rare. Occasionally, pro-nationalist demonstrations take place involving hostility towards foreign countries. If you become aware of protests, leave the area immediately.
Japan and the Korean Peninsula
The level of tension and security situation in the Korean Peninsula can change with little notice. Tensions may affect Japan following missile tests by North Korea (DPRK) and during South Korean-US military exercises, which take place throughout the year.
DPRK frequently launches missiles towards Japan and is likely to continue doing so. Follow any instructions given by local authorities and check NHK World for the latest information. See advice on missile alerts from the Japanese government.

Crime
Crime levels are low across Japan. It is generally safe to walk at night and travel on public transport. You should take the same precautions you would at home, be aware of your surroundings and take local advice on where higher risk areas are. Tokyo entertainment districts are considered higher risk, particularly at night. Foreign nationals have been targeted for extortion, robbery, assault and sexual assault in clubs and bars.
Protecting your belongings
Be aware of your surroundings and never leave your belongings unattended. Use hotel safes where possible. If your passport is lost or stolen, get a police report at a police station.
Drink spiking and credit card fraud
There is a risk of drink spiking and credit card fraud. Victims have described waking up with no memory of what happened and discovering large amounts of money billed to their credit card. Make sure your drinks cannot be tampered with by:
not accepting drinks from strangers
asking a trusted friend to keep an eye your unfinished drink
It can be difficult to get a police report if you’re a victim of this crime. You may need a report before your credit card company will consider processing a claim.
Rape and sexual assault
Rape and sexual assault are rare but can happen. Japanese law places a high burden of proof on victims to demonstrate sexual relations were not consensual and committed through assault, intimidation or force.
Female passengers on commuter trains have experienced inappropriate touching. Police advise you should shout at the perpetrator to attract attention and ask a fellow passenger to call train staff.
See advice for women travelling abroad.
Disputes over bar bills
British nationals have been arrested following disputes with bar staff and doormen, including refusing to pay excessive bar bills. This can occur in the late-night areas. Ensure you are shown a menu before you enter a bar or restaurant. Do not follow street touts as this is illegal. Keep a track of what you order at bars and restaurants and confirm the price of admission to clubs on entry.
Prostitution and street touts
Prostitution and street touts are illegal but commonplace. Do not accompany street touts to bars or clubs. Street touts try to encourage people into an establishment by misrepresenting the services on offer or wrongly suggesting you can leave if you want to.
Laws and cultural differences
Personal ID
You must always carry your passport or residence card with you. The police can arrest you if you cannot show your legal status in Japan – whether you are a tourist or resident.
Alcohol laws
In general, alcohol consumption in public places is not illegal. However, there are legal restrictions on alcohol consumption in specific areas on certain days, for example New Year’s Eve.
Smoking in public places    
Smoking is illegal on the streets of Tokyo and some other cities. Smoke only in designated areas.
Illegal drugs and prison sentences
There is zero tolerance towards drug crime and severe penalties. British nationals have been arrested and detained for receiving small quantities through the post or when testing positive during police intervention on bars. British nationals have received sentences ranging from 6 to 17 years and fines of 3 to 4 million yen for drug trafficking. Prisoners in Japan are expected to work as part of their sentences and are assigned labour or factory work.
LGBT+ travellers   
Same-sex relationships are not illegal, although Japanese law does not guarantee freedom from discrimination on the grounds of sexual orientation. While same-sex marriages are not recognised in Japan, some areas of the country have begun issuing equivalent certificates. These can be used for civil issues, such as hospital visitation rights. Nichome in Tokyo and Doyamacho in Osaka are well known LGBT+ areas. It is generally safe for LGBT+ travellers in Japan.
Read more advice for LGBT+ travellers.
Medication bans
It is illegal to possess or use some common prescription and over-the-counter medicines under Japan’s strictly enforced law on anti-stimulant drugs. Ignorance of the law may not be considered a defence.
Family law
Japanese family law is very different from UK law. Joint custody of a child after divorce is not a legal option, and access for a non-custodial parent can be challenging. Legal custody disputes can also be lengthy, and enforcement of rulings returning a child has proven difficult. Read about child abduction, custody and parental rights in Japan.
Behaviour in public
Most Japanese people are welcoming and friendly but can be reserved. Loud boisterous behaviour is not acceptable. Showing affection in public is less common than in the UK.
Tattoos
Tattoos have a historical association with organised crime in Japan. While attitudes towards them are increasingly accepting, some public facilities do not admit anyone with tattoos – for example, public swimming pools, hot springs, beaches and some gyms. Other establishments request you cover tattoos while using the facilities.
Transport risks
Road travel
If you are planning to drive a hire car or a UK vehicle, see information on driving abroad and the Japan Automobile Federation driving guide.
You’ll need to have the 1949 version of the international driving permit (IDP), your UK driving licence and insurance documents with you in the car. You cannot buy an IDP outside the UK, so get one before you travel. You can only use an IDP for one year, regardless of its expiry date. See information on driving and the IDP from the Tokyo police.
If you plan to stay longer than one year, you should apply for a Japanese driving licence. See living in Japan.
There are 2 types of driving insurance available in Japan: compulsory insurance (‘jibaisekihoken’) and voluntary insurance (‘nin’i no jidoshahoken’). The compulsory insurance on its own may be insufficient in cases of personal liability.
There are penalties for driving without the correct documents. You could be arrested and receive a fine or a request to provide the documents to the police later.  
Drink-driving is a serious offence in Japan, and the legal limit of alcohol in your system is much lower than in UK. If you are found to be over the limit, you may get a fine and possible imprisonment. There are also penalties for allowing someone to drink and drive (for example, if you’re a passenger in a vehicle being driven by a drunk driver). The passenger could face arrest if the police suspect they were aware of the driver’s alcohol consumption.
Hire car companies often have stricter requirements for their customers, such as a year of driving experience and a minimum age.
Driving standards
Roads are well maintained, and driving is on the left. Road rules are mostly the same as in the UK, but drivers should pay particular attention to:
pedestrians crossing roads at green lights, especially at junctions
cyclists travelling on the pavements or on the wrong side of the road and without lights at night
taxi drivers stopping suddenly
Extreme weather and natural disasters
Find out what you can do to prepare for and respond to extreme weather and natural hazards. 
Tropical cyclones
In Japan the tropical cyclone (typhoon) season is between June and December with most activity between July and September. The highest risk is in southern parts of the country. Monitor approaching storms with Japan Meteorological Agency forecasts. Follow the advice of the local authorities and emergency services, including any evacuation orders.
Tropical cyclones in Japan often come with damaging high tides, increasing the risk of landslides and flooding. The dangers increase when an earthquake occurs shortly after a tropical cyclone has saturated an area.
See weather safety tips from the Japan National Tourism Agency.
Earthquakes and tsunamis
Japan is in a major earthquake zone. Familiarise yourself with safety procedures in the event of an earthquake or tsunami. Take note of instructions in hotel rooms, at train stations and on your local prefectural website.
Check tsunami warnings and earthquake information from the Japan Meteorological Agency.
See earthquake safety tips from the Japan National Tourism Agency. 
Volcanic eruptions
There are several active volcanoes in Japan. You should monitor local media reports and follow the advice of local authorities. Check for volcano warnings from the Japanese Meteorological Agency.
