This page gives you guidance on how to stay safely in Lebanon as a visitor, if you are unable to return to the UK.
Everyone should comply with the measures put in place in Lebanon to limit the spread of coronavirus (COVID-19).
Public measures
The Lebanese authorities have put in place a number of measures to limit the spread of coronavirus (COVID-19). The detailed measures are changing on a regular basis. The latest Lebanese Government decisions and guidance can be found here (in Arabic):
According to current measures:
Public and larger gatherings are banned.
Some facilities remain closed, including schools, playgrounds, theatres and cinemas.
Fabric masks covering the mouth and nose must be worn when outside the home and in vehicles (unless travelling alone, or exercising)
Individuals must maintain a safe distance from one another and avoid crowded areas.
Those over the age of 65 years old are advised to stay home and not go out unless absolutely necessary.
Private cars should have no more than three people in them (including the driver), unless they are all from the same household.
Other vehicles should limit passenger numbers to a third of total capacity.
Some public markets, banks, pharmacies, hotels, restaurants, beaches, swimming pools, nurseries, gyms, public parks and gardens, pubs and nightclubs, summer camps and other facilities are starting to re-open but you should check in advance.
Lebanese authorities may issue fines, impose road blocks, or imprison those violating these measures for up to three years. You should comply with all local measures introduced by the Lebanese authorities and obey the instructions of the security forces. These measures may be changed at short notice.
Keep up to date with information from your tour operator, transport or accommodation provider on the impact on any existing travel plans. For information on entering Lebanon, see Entry Requirements. If you need further information about entry requirements, contact the local immigration authorities or the nearest Lebanese embassy.

You can call the Lebanese Ministry of Health Coronavirus Hotline on +961 1 5494459. British nationals in Lebanon should comply with local restrictions and monitor local media for updates.
Finance
There is a range of financial support from the government that you can access while you are unable to return due to coronavirus restrictions.
If you’re in Lebanon, and have exhausted all other options to cover essential living costs while you wait to return home, you could apply for an emergency loan for your living costs from the UK government. You can only apply if you normally live in the UK and you cannot return home. This last-resort option is for those most in need, and you would need to repay the loan when you are back in the UK. Apply for an emergency loan.

If you need urgent consular assistance, you should contact your local British embassy, high commission or consulate. All telephones numbers are available 24/7.
