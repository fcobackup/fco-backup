Travelling from and returning to the UK
Zimbabwe is on the red list for entering England. Check what you must do to travel abroad and return to England, Scotland, Wales or Northern Ireland.

Be prepared for your plans to change
No travel is risk-free during COVID. Countries may further restrict travel or bring in new rules at short notice, for example due to a new COVID-19 variant. Check with your travel company or airline for any transport changes which may delay your journey home.
Plan ahead and make sure you:
can access money
understand what your insurance will cover
can make arrangements to extend your stay and be away for longer than planned
Travel in Zimbabwe
Zimbabwe currently has a number of exceptional measures in place to respond to the COVID-19 pandemic. You are encouraged to defer any unnecessary travel. There is a curfew between 9pm and 6am, which is being enforced by the security services. You should comply with these requirements wherever you are staying in Zimbabwe.
It is compulsory to wear a face mask covering the nose and mouth whenever you are outside of your home.
Public transport is limited. Intercity travel is permitted. All journeys operate under current COVID-19 restrictions.
Tourists are authorised to travel between airports and designated tourist facilities. Be sure to take confirmation of your bookings with you when travelling.
Accommodation
You should ensure you have accommodation for the period of your stay, as some hotels may close at short notice.
Public spaces and services
Gatherings are limited to 100 people.
Everyone in a public place must observe social distancing (i.e. keep at least one metre apart) and wear a face mask.
Non-essential businesses can only open between 7am and 7pm.
Restaurants, bars and nightclubs can open to fully vaccinated customers, subject to strict adherence to COVID-19 protocols, until 7pm.

Healthcare in Zimbabwe
If you take regular medication, you should ensure you have a sufficient supply and make sure you can access a repeat prescription in the event of travel delays. Most medicines that require a prescription from a doctor in the UK will require one in Zimbabwe. Zimbabwe pharmacies do not accept prescriptions issued in the UK. There is no reciprocal healthcare agreement between Zimbabwe and the UK. For contact details of English speaking doctors visit our list of healthcare providers.
If you think you have COVID-19 symptoms, you should contact your medical practitioner for advice.
