If you live in the UK and are currently visiting Belarus, you’re strongly advised to return now by commercial means. Don’t run the risk of getting stranded.
There remain commercial options to return to the UK from Belarus. Belavia, the national airline, continues to operate direct flights to and from the UK four times a week. The situation in Belarus could quickly change. You should check with your airline or travel company for the latest information before you travel.
