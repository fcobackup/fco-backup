Before you travel check that: 
your destination can provide the healthcare you may need 
you have appropriate travel insurance for local treatment or unexpected medical evacuation 
This is particularly important if you have a health condition or are pregnant.
Emergency medical number 
Call 911 and ask for an ambulance. 
Contact your insurance company promptly if you’re referred to a medical facility for treatment.
Vaccinations and health risks 
At least 8 weeks before your trip check: 
the latest information on vaccinations and health risks in TravelHealthPro’s Costa Rica guide 
where to get vaccines and whether you have to pay on the NHS travel vaccinations page
Medication 
Prescriptions from the UK cannot be used locally. To find a pharmacy (‘farmacia’) look for one of the big national chains such as Farmacia Fischel, Farmacia Sucre, FarmaValue, Farmacia Saba, or Farmacia Santa Lucia, among others; a quick search online should help you to identify the nearest one open.

Healthcare facilities in Costa Rica  
Medical care in Costa Rica is of a generally high standard. Ambulance services in remote areas may vary. Only initial emergency medical treatment is available without charge for visitors.
