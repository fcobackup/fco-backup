This page has information on travelling to Mongolia.
This page reflects the UK government’s understanding of current rules for people travelling on a full ‘British Citizen’ passport from the UK, for the most common types of travel.
The authorities in Mongolia set and enforce entry rules. If you’re unsure how Mongolia’s entry requirements apply to you, contact its UK embassy, high commission or consulate.
All travellers
Visitors wanting to stay for less than 30 days no longer need a visa to enter Mongolia.
For stays longer than 30 days you will need a visa to enter or travel through Mongolia as a visitor. You should contact the nearest Mongolian Embassy for the most up-to-date advice on entry requirements and visas. Arriving passengers should follow instructions given by the authorities on arrival. Arrival requirements into Mongolia are subject to change. Borders between China and Mongolia are closed except for freight traffic.
COVID-19 related restrictions for entry to Mongolia have been lifted for all UK travellers. Negative COVID-19 PCR tests before and after arrival are no longer required.
If you’re fully vaccinated
If you’re fully vaccinated, you can enter Mongolia without needing to test or quarantine. All passengers are required to fill out medical declaration forms upon arrival at border checkpoints.
Proof of vaccination status
You do not need to present proof that you have been fully vaccinated to enter Mongolia. However, you can use the UK COVID Pass to demonstrate your vaccination record if asked. Passengers are required to fill out medical declaration forms upon arrival at border checkpoints.
If you’re not fully vaccinated
If you’re not fully vaccinated, you can still enter Mongolia and will have to fill out medical declaration forms upon arrival at border checkpoints. Travellers who wish to be vaccinated in Mongolia are permitted to do so.
Children and young people
Children aged 17 and under follow the same rules as adults and do not need to show proof of vaccination to enter Mongolia.
If you’re transiting through Mongolia
Transiting is when you pass through one country on the way to your final destination.
Transiting through Mongolia is permitted for travellers irrespective of their vaccination status.
If you are transiting through Mongolia on your way to another country and staying in the airport (airside) or are transiting through Mongolia on your way to another country and will be passing through immigration (sometimes known as a layover), for example to stay in a hotel for a flight the next day, you should check with your travel operator and the authorities at your final destination what the entry requirements might be.
Onward travel
For onward travel from Mongolia to third countries, please check the UK’s Travel Advice for those countries.
Please note that it can be difficult to get visas for China and Russia in Mongolia. If you’re planning to travel to China or Russia from Mongolia, seek advice from Chinese and Russian Embassies in London for the latest visa requirements before you travel to Mongolia. Foreigners who are not residents of Mongolia have not always been able to get Chinese visas from the Chinese embassy in Ulaanbaatar. If you plan to travel to Mongolia and then onward to China, you should get your Chinese visa before the start of your trip.
HGV drivers
HGV drivers from the UK entering Mongolia do not have to show a negative COVID-19 test, proof of vaccination or proof of recovery and do not have to quarantine.
Check your passport and travel documents before you travel
Passport validity
If you are visiting Mongolia, your passport should be valid for six months from the date you arrive.
If you are a resident in Mongolia, your passport must be valid for at least six months from the date you arrive.
Check with your travel provider to make sure your passport and other travel documents meet their requirements.
Visas
You will need a visa to enter or travel through Mongolia as a visitor. A Mongolian visit visa is usually valid for a stay of up to 30 days within six months from the date of issue. You can extend your visa up to 30 days once within six months. Full details can be found at Immigration of Mongolia.
If you arrive in Mongolia with the wrong visa, the Mongolian Immigration Agency may ask you to pay for the correct visa or deny you entry.
The Mongolian Border Agency will collect biometric data (scanned fingerprints) on your arrival.
Online visa
From November 2021, British citizens can apply for the following 3 types of visas online
Visa for Tourist (K2) valid for 30 days
Visa for participants in sports, cultural, film/content and art events (K4) valid for 30 days
Visa for transit (K6) valid for 10 days
You no longer need to visit your nearest Mongolian Embassy if applying for visas under the above categories. E-visas will normally be issued within 72 hours of application. Applicants should carry a digital or printed version of the visa to present to airlines and the Mongolian Authorities on arrival.
Companies and individuals can invite British citizens to Mongolia from the UK. Invited persons would need to request entry permissions online for visa on arrival - single or multiple entry visas for tourism (J) or business visit (B) categories only.
Individuals need to login to the immigration website and upload the invitation letter, application etc as per instructions. If all the required documents are provided, the immigration authority will inform the individual via email or text message. Once permission is granted, the foreign citizen can get a Mongolian visa on arrival. You should make sure you have the confirmation before travelling to Mongolia.
You should remember that at the entry point, the immigration authority might interview you and they can refuse your entry to Mongolia. It is important for the inviting individual or company to provide full and true information about the person.
Other visas
If you are unsure of the type of visa required, or require another type of visa, contact the nearest Mongolian Embassy.
Travelling with children
Adults accompanying children other than their own should have a notarised letter from the legal guardians of the child confirming the arrangement. For further information contact the Embassy of Mongolia in London.
Registration
If you intend to remain in Mongolia for more than 30 days or if you do not have an entry/exit visa, you must register your stay with the Mongolian Immigration Agency in Ulaanbaatar within a week of arriving. Once registered you will be issued with a residence permit. The permit will include your date of birth, passport number, address, photograph and fingerprints. You should carry it with you at all times when you’re in Mongolia.
UK Emergency Travel Documents
You can only use a UK Emergency Travel Document (ETD) to enter Mongolia if you’re a permanent resident or for airside transit. ETDs can be used to exit Mongolia. If your ETD has been issued in Mongolia and you are a permanent resident in Mongolia, you’ll need an exit visa from the Immigration Authority. If you do not have a residence permit you won’t need an exit permit to exit Mongolia on an ETD.
Border crossings
There are normally 8 border points open to British passport holders. They are at Chinggis Khaan International Airport in Ulaanbaatar, the road/train crossing to China at Zamin Uud, the road crossing to China at Bulgan in the west, the road crossing to China at Bichigt in the south east, the road crossing to Russia at Tsagaannuur in the far west, the train crossing to Russia at Sukhbaatar and the road crossings to Russia at Altanbulag and Ereen-Tsav. You may not cross into China or Russia at any of the other border points as they are either seasonal or are open only to Mongolians, Chinese or Russians.
If you’re planning to bring a vehicle into Mongolia at any of the border crossings you should inform the tax authorities and border troops in advance.
If you’re travelling by train across the China/Mongolia border expect a delay of a few hours as the railways use different gauges.
You may encounter problems when entering Mongolia by train from Russia, particularly with Russian border or customs officials who scrutinise documentation (in particular customs declarations) very carefully. If you’re crossing overland to or from Russia, pay scrupulous attention when completing all the necessary paperwork.
Entering Mongolia by car
If you’re entering Mongolia by car you should familiarise yourself with Mongolian Customs law.
If you’re entering Mongolia in a private vehicle you should complete the customs declaration form and make sure you have all valid vehicle documents, including driving licence, ownership records and insurance. You can complete the customs declaration forms on entry at the border, as well as at the Ulaanbaatar City Customs Office situated next to the train station in Ulaanbaatar.
If you enter Mongolia in a private vehicle you must leave in the same vehicle, or otherwise pay customs tax. The amount of tax depends on the size of the engine and the value of your vehicle. You can find more details on Mongolian Customs’ webpage.
If your vehicle breaks down in Mongolia, you won’t be able to leave it there without paying customs tax. If your vehicle breaks down and cannot be fixed you must either pay for it to be transported out of Mongolia, or sell it on to a local mechanic, but you’ll still need to pay customs tax. You mustn’t under any circumstance leave your vehicle unattended or abandon it.
If you’re leaving your vehicle in Mongolia you must leave it in a secure place, either with a mechanic or at an official Customs warehouse, for which you will need to submit a completed customs declaration form and pay a monthly fee for storage. If you leave your vehicle with a mechanic in Mongolia because it cannot be fixed, you must provide proof (photos and a letter from a mechanic and a police report) of this to the Customs Office. If you choose to sell your vehicle, you’ll need to show proof of sale.
Customs tax is payable in local currency (MNT) only and must be paid directly to the Customs Office. If you wish to leave your vehicle and then return to collect it at a later date you should still pay the tax up front, which can then be reimbursed to you when you return to take your vehicle out of Mongolia. If you aren’t able to return in person, ask a third party to make the initial tax payment, and then collect the refund on your behalf.
