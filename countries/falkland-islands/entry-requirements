All travellers to the Falkland Islands aged two years and over need to provide proof of a negative PCR test for COVID-19 no more than five days before arrival in Senegal and the Falkland Islands. This is a requirement of the Republic of Senegal and the Falkland Islands Government and it applies to those travelling to the Falkland Islands.
Quarantine requirements
Currently the Falkland Islands Government has a mandatory 10 days of quarantine, however, there is a “test to release” option under which you may be able to complete quarantine early, on day 5 or day 8 of your quarantine period, depending on your vaccination status.
In order to opt for the 5-day “test to release” you must provide proof you have completed the full course of a vaccination approved by the Medicines and Healthcare products Regulatory Agency (MHRA) at least two weeks before your arrival in the Falkland Islands. These are currently: Oxford-AstraZeneca (two doses), Pfizer (two doses), Moderna (two doses), Janssen (single dose) or treatment with Ronapreve vaccines.
If you were fully vaccinated with an MHRA approved vaccine more than two weeks before arrival, you can opt for “5-day test to release” and leave quarantine on day 5 of quarantine (if you test negative twice). On the first swab visit, the clinician will review your vaccine evidence, so please ensure you have this ready. The clinician must be satisfied with all vaccination documentation provided, whether that be the NHS app, a vaccination card, a vaccination letter or a doctor’s note, otherwise you will only be eligible for the “8 day test to release” option.
If you are partially vaccinated or not vaccinated, you can opt for “8 day test to release” and leave quarantine on day 8 (if you test negative twice). If you are quarantining with unvaccinated children who you travelled with, you may only opt for “8 day test to release”. If you are quarantining with other arrivals into the Islands that are only partially vaccinated, or not vaccinated at all, even if you are fully vaccinated yourself, you may only opt for “8 day test to release”.
You will be offered a test within 48 hours of arrival, and again on either day 5 or day 8 (depending on your vaccination status and that of anyone who travelled with you and is quarantining with you). If both tests are negative, you will be informed that you may leave quarantine; you must wait for the KEMH to contact you on day 5 or 8 (as appropriate) before leaving quarantine.
If you or anyone you are sharing quarantine accommodation with test positive on either occasion you must remain in quarantine for the full 10 days. In this case you will be offered an additional swab on day 9 (prior to the end of the quarantine period on day 10) and you may be asked to continue to self-isolate after the end of the quarantine period, especially if you develop symptoms of coronavirus.
If you do not want to be tested while in quarantine you must remain in quarantine for the full 10 days as must everyone who is in quarantine with you.
