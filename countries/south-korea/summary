The level of tension on the Korean Peninsula rose considerably in 2017 due to a series of North Korean nuclear and missile tests. On 21 April 2018, North Korea announced a halt to nuclear and intercontinental ballistic missile testing.
Since 2018 there has been renewed direct contact between the North and South Korean governments, and between North Korea and the United States. In the past, periods of diplomatic engagement have failed to be sustained. This has led to further missile or nuclear tests by North Korea and a return to instability in the region. The level of tension and the security situation can therefore still change with little notice. Tensions have usually arisen around the time of South Korean-US military exercises. In the past, heightened tensions haven’t affected daily life. See Political situation
