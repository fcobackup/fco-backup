This page reflects the UK government’s understanding of current rules for people travelling on a full ‘British Citizen’ passport, for the most common types of travel.
The authorities in the Western Sahara set and enforce entry rules. For further information contact the embassy, high commission or consulate of the country or territory you’re travelling to. You should also consider checking with your transport provider or travel company to make sure your passport and other travel documents meet their requirements.
Visas
Travel is restricted and while organised groups are generally permitted, independent travellers should be aware that they could be turned back at the border.
British nationals visiting as tourists for up to three months do not need a visa. Make sure your passport is stamped when you enter the territory. Some tourists have experienced difficulties leaving the country because their passports had no entry stamp.  
Passport validity
Your passport should be valid for the proposed duration of your stay in Western Sahara.
UK Emergency Travel Documents
UK Emergency Travel Documents are accepted for entry to, airside transit, and exit from, Western Sahara.
