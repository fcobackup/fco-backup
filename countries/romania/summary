the whole of Romania based on the current assessment of COVID-19 risks.
Check our advice on things to consider, and be prepared to stay overseas longer than planned.
Travel to Romania may be subject to entry restrictions
On 25 March 2021, the Romanian Government announced that travellers arriving from the UK no longer need to have had a negative PCR test before flying, or present evidence of vaccination, or to self-isolate on arrival to Romania.
Otherwise, restrictions implemented since 1 January 2021 continue to remain in place; UK nationals and non-EU/EEA nationals resident in the UK are not permitted to enter Romania for non-essential purposes.
Essential travel is still permitted and exemptions are in place for family members of Romanian, EU, EEA and Swiss citizens, business travellers, film crews, hauliers, students and diplomatic and consular staff, who will need to show proof of the applicable exemption, with a visa, residence permit or an equivalent document issued either by the Romanian authorities or by the authorities of other states, in accordance with EU law.
These restrictions do not apply to UK nationals who are legally resident in Romania, who will need to show proof of residency to re-enter Romania.
Preparing for your return journey to the UK
If you’re returning to the UK from overseas, you will need to:
provide your journey and contact details before you travel
check if you need to self-isolate on your return
If your return journey to the UK transits another country, you should check whether it is subject to a travel ban or any other additional requirements. If so, contact your travel provider.
See Entry requirements for more information before you plan to travel.
