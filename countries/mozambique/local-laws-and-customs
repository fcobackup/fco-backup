You must by law carry original identity documents at all times and present them on request to the authorities. Police patrols and checkpoints are common. Don’t hand over your passport to anyone other than an official. Ask to see their ID if in doubt.
Photographing government offices, airports, military establishments, residences and the police or officials is illegal without special permission from the Mozambique Information Office (Gabinete de Informação – GABINFO). If in doubt, don’t take pictures.
Drug use, possession and trafficking are serious offences. Punishments can include long jail terms and heavy fines.
Homosexuality is legal. Attitudes in Maputo tend to be more liberal than in more remote rural or religious areas of the country. See our information and advice page for the LGBT+ community before you travel.
