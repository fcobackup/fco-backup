Restrictions in response to coronavirus
Entry and borders
The Macao government has announced that all travellers arriving in Macao, who are not residents of Macao, Hong Kong, Taiwan or mainland China, will be denied entry.
Residents of Hong Kong, Taiwan or mainland China who have travelled overseas in the 14 days prior to their arrival will also be denied entry.
Residents of Hong Kong, Taiwan or mainland China who have visited Hong Kong or Taiwan in the 14 days prior to entry will be subject to 14 days of medical surveillance in a designated centre.
Macao residents who have been overseas or to Hong Kong or Taiwan in the 14 days prior to entry will be subject to 14 days of medical surveillance in a designated centre.
All air passengers, including Macao residents, must obtain a certificate confirming that they have tested negative for coronavirus within the last 7 days before they are allowed to board their flight to Macao. All air passengers will also have their temperature checked before boarding flights, and will be refused boarding if they have a fever.
All ferry crossings between Hong Kong and Macao have ceased until further notice.
The bus service between Hong Kong and Macao, using the Hong Kong-Zhuhai-Macao Bridge, recommenced a limited service on 8 May. Please contact the service provider for the latest schedule.
As of 3 May, two of Macao’s mainland border crossing points have resumed normal service. Macao’s Barrier Gate checkpoint at the Zhuhai land border is operating between 6 am and 1 am daily. The Macao-Zhuhai checkpoint on the Hong Kong-Zhuhai-Macao Bridge is also operating between 8 am and 10 pm. Private cars are allowed to access these two border crossings.
Transit
Transit services are suspended at Macao International Airport.
Regular entry requirements
Visas
Although Macao is now part of the People’s Republic of China, it remains a Special Administrative Region with its own immigration controls. You can stay in Macao for up to 6 months without a visa. If you intend to work in Macao you must get a visa before arrival. Contact the Macao Immigration Department.
Passport validity
Your passport should be valid for a minimum period of one month from the date of entry into Macao. If you are staying longer than one month your passport must be valid for the duration of your visit.
Visits to mainland China
China is suspending the entry of foreign nationals into China from 28 March, including those with existing visas. The only exemptions will be diplomatic, service, courtesy or C visas. Only those with a visa issued on or after 27 March will be allowed to enter China. For full information, see China travel advice.
If you intend to travel to mainland China via Macao using a British passport you must get a Chinese visa before arrival at the border. Failure to do so could result in a fine and possible detention by the mainland Chinese authorities. If you’re entering Macao via mainland China and leaving again via the mainland you’ll need to have a double or multiple entry visa to re-enter mainland China.
There are reports of greater scrutiny from mainland authorities at border crossings into Macao at this time, including checks on travellers’ electronic devices.
UK Emergency Travel Documents
UK Emergency Travel Documents (ETDs) are accepted for entry, airside transit and exit from Macao.
