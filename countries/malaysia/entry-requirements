This page has information on travelling to Malaysia.
This page reflects the UK government’s understanding of current rules for people travelling on a full ‘British Citizen’ passport from the UK, for the most common types of travel.
The authorities in Malaysia set and enforce entry rules. If you’re unsure how Malaysia’s entry requirements apply to you, contact its UK embassy, high commission or consulate.
All travellers
Further information on entry requirements for Malaysia is available from the Malaysian authorities. As of 1 August 2022 all entry requirements related to COVID-19 travel to Malaysia have now been removed, regardless of vaccination status.
If you are fully vaccinated
Entry requirements for Malaysia are the same for all travellers, regardless of COVID-19 vaccination status. See ‘All Travellers’
Proof of vaccination status
You do not need to provide proof of your vaccination status for entry to Malaysia.
If you are not fully vaccinated
Entry requirements for Malaysia are the same for all travellers, regardless of COVID-19 vaccination status.
If you are transiting through Malaysia
You can transit (up to 24 hours only) via Kuala Lumpur International Airport (KLIA) as long as you remain airside.
If transiting between the two Kuala Lumpur terminals - KLIA and KLIA2 be aware these are separate airports and will require you to go through immigration.
Check your passport and travel documents before you travel
Check with your travel provider to make sure your passport and other travel documents meet their requirements.
Passport validity
If you are visiting Malaysia, your passport should be valid for 6 months from the date you arrive. If it is not, you may be refused entry and detained. You may also be refused entry and detained if your passport has any damage or has pages missing.
Visas
British nationals do not need a visa to visit Malaysia. You will normally be given permission to stay for 3 months on arrival. Visas for longer stays or for non-tourist purposes must be obtained from the nearest Malaysian diplomatic mission before you travel.
The Malaysian authorities are running a vigorous campaign against illegal immigration. Do not overstay your visa, or violate the terms of entry. Even if you overstay for just a few days, you can be fined, detained, deported to the UK and blacklisted. Flight costs will be the responsibility of the individual. Conditions in prisons and immigration detention facilities can be poor with limited healthcare services.
Please note the British High Commission is unable to provide any assistance for you to remain in Malaysia, including issuing any document to support your overstay.
If you’re travelling between Peninsular Malaysia and East Malaysia (sometimes known as Malaysian Borneo and comprising the states of Sabah and Sarawak) you will need to carry your passport. You must get an entry stamp in East Malaysia at your initial port of entry.
You should make and keep safe a copy of your passport and visa in case your passport is lost. It may take time to obtain a replacement visa. If you cannot present your original valid visa on exit you may be treated as an overstayer, fined and blacklisted.
Yellow fever certificate requirements
Check whether you need a yellow fever certificate by visiting the National Travel Health Network and Centre’s TravelHealthPro website.
UK Emergency Travel Documents
UK Emergency Travel Documents (ETDs) are accepted for exit from Malaysia. You will need to get a special exit pass from Malaysian Immigration before leaving and there will be a cost for this. This cannot be obtained at the airport, information on where a pass can be attained will be provided once an ETD application has been made.
If travelling to another country, other than the UK, you will need to check with the relevant Embassy if a visa is needed in the ETD. If you plan to use an ETD to enter or transit through Malaysia, check entry requirements with the nearest Malaysian Embassy or High Commission before you travel.
Dual nationals
Malaysia doesn’t recognise dual nationality. You can be refused entry if you’re found to be holding a Malaysian passport and one of a different nationality. For those people with dual nationality (not including Malaysian), we advise entering and exiting with the same passport.
Customs and Exchange control rules
Check the website of the Malaysian Customs Service for information on restricted or prohibited items that may not be brought into the country. If you are in any doubt about the legality of any items - including medications - you should declare them on entry.
You can import or export up to 10,000 Malaysian Ringgit without prior approval. There are no limits on the amount of foreign currency you can import or export, but you must declare any amount in excess of US$ 10,000. Penalties include a fine of up to RM 1 million and up to 3 years’ imprisonment. Further information can be found on the Royal Malaysian Customs Department website.
