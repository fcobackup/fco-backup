Conflict affecting Lebanon
FCDO advises against all travel to Lebanon due to risks associated with the ongoing conflict between Israel, Lebanese Hizballah and other non-state actors in Lebanon. There are ongoing mortar and artillery exchanges and airstrikes in Lebanon, primarily on the boundary with Israel but also in parts of the Beqaa Valley and some other locations north of the Litani river. There was also a strike on 30 July in southern Beirut, the second strike in Beirut in 2024. The Washington Institute’ provides an online map which may be helpful to understand recently affected areas.
Following the start of the conflict in Israel and the Occupied Palestinian Territories, large protests took place in major cities and near the British and other Western embassies. Further protests cannot be ruled out. Exercise caution and avoid demonstrations.
Tensions are high and events could escalate with little warning, which could affect or limit exit routes out of Lebanon. In the event of deterioration in the political or security situation, commercial routes out of Lebanon could be severely disrupted or cancelled at short notice, and roads across the country could be closed. The British embassy may be increasingly limited in the assistance that it can provide. If you are currently in Lebanon, you should leave now. On 30 July the Foreign Secretary reiterated that British Nationals should leave Lebanon while commercial flights are still running.
Check with airlines and travel companies for updates on flight availability. Ensure your travel documents and those of your family’s are current. If the situation deteriorates, it might not be possible to issue a passport in time for any journey you might plan.
Do not rely on FCDO being able to evacuate you in an emergency.
The British Embassy has temporarily withdrawn families of members of staff. It continues with essential work, including providing services to British nationals. FCDO continues to advise against all travel to Lebanon. Those already in Lebanon should leave now by commercial means.
British Nationals should keep up to date with local and international media including TV and radio stations such as Virgin Radio Lebanon (FM 89.5) and Voice of Lebanon / Sawt Lubnan (FM 100.3 - 100.5) which may be useful sources of information on any developments.
You should have a personal emergency plan that does not rely on the UK government. This may include the ability to leave quickly or to shelter in place if you judge it necessary and safe to do so.
