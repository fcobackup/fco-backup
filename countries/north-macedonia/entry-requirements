The information on this page covers the most common types of travel and reflects the UK government’s understanding of the rules currently in place. Unless otherwise stated, this information is for travellers using a full ‘British Citizen’ passport.
The authorities in the country or territory you’re travelling to are responsible for setting and enforcing the rules for entry. If you’re unclear about any aspect of the entry requirements, or you need further reassurance, you’ll need to contact the embassy, high commission or consulate of the country or territory you’re travelling to.
You should also consider checking with your transport provider or travel company to make sure your passport and other travel documents meet their requirements.
Entry rules in response to coronavirus (COVID-19)
Entry to North Macedonia
There is no requirement for passengers arriving from the UK to self-isolate on the basis of their travel history. No PCR test is required. You may still need to self-isolate for health reasons (if you have coronavirus, if you have had contact with someone with coronavirus, of if you are waiting for the outcome of a PCR test).
All land border crossings in North Macedonia are open for movement of passengers and vehicles. However neighbouring countries may have different entry and exit restrictions on their side of the border. Please check before travelling.
Skopje International Airport and Ohrid Airport “St. Apostle Paul” are open and commercial flights have resumed, but with reduced schedules.
Some border crossings in neighbouring countries are still closed or subject to entry requirements. It is your responsibility to ensure that you can enter the next country on your journey. Check country-specific FCDO Travel Advice for details.

If you plan to stay for longer than 3 months, contact the Embassy of North Macedonia in London.
Unaccompanied minors (children under 18) must have a letter of consent from their parents or guardian. Failure to do so may result into refusal of entry and deportation.

You should retain the registration document as proof of registration until your departure from North Macedonia.
If you don’t register you may receive a fine of between 600 and 1,000 Euros, and be detained or face a court appearance (which may include a restriction on your ability to return to North Macedonia).
