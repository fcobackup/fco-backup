Hospitals in Guatemala are reluctant to give medical treatment unless they can be satisfied that you have medical insurance. It’s therefore essential that you carry evidence of your insurance cover at all times. Make sure you get confirmation from the hospital administration that your insurance coverage is accepted. In some hospitals the administration may ask you to pay upfront and you may have to claim on your insurance later. State-funded hospitals are on the whole under-staffed, under-funded, ill-equipped, and often unhygienic. Make sure you have adequate travel health insurance and accessible funds to cover the cost of any medical treatment abroad and repatriation.
Water isn’t generally safe to drink unless filtered, but bottled water is cheap and widely available.
Cases of Chikungunya virus have been confirmed in Guatemala. Dengue fever is common to Latin America and the Caribbean and can occur throughout the year. You should take steps to avoid being bitten by mosquitoes.
The water in Lake Atitlan is not safe for drinking, or for swimming in certain areas. Check with local authorities before swimming in the lake, and seek medical advice if you fall ill during or immediately after a trip there.
In the 2013 Report on the Global AIDS Epidemic the UNAIDS/WHO Working Group estimated that around 53,000 adults aged 15 or over in Guatemala were living with HIV; the prevalence was estimated at around 0.7% of the adult population compared to the prevalence percentage in adults in the UK of around 0.2%. Exercise precautions to avoid exposure to HIV and AIDS.
If you need emergency medical assistance during your trip, dial 122 and ask for an ambulance. You should contact your insurance/medical assistance company promptly if you are referred to a medical facility for treatment.
