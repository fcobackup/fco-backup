Following civil unrest across Chile you should expect to see a police presence in major cities. Large demonstrations are expected in Santiago and other cities on a daily basis. Protests are expected to take place in Las Condes, Providencia and Vitacura where the British Embassy and many international hotels are located. Under Chilean law, foreign nationals visiting or living in Chile could be deported for involvement in protests and demonstrations. You should follow the instructions and advice of the local authorities, remain vigilant, monitor local media for updates and avoid protests and demonstrations. See Local laws and customs
All of Santiago’s public transport – including the metro and buses – is running a limited service at this time. Public transport in other cities may be affected. Some banks, shopping malls, pharmacies and supermarkets are operating reduced hours.

Some roads around Santiago have been affected by barricades including some routes to the airport. If you’re travelling to the airport, you should check with your transport company before travelling and allow extra time for your journey.
Some land border crossing points between Chile and the neighbouring countries of Argentina, Bolivia and Peru are currently being closed overnight. If you plan to cross any land border point, check with authorities for exact closure times prior to travel.
