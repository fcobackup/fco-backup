The Foreign and Commonwealth Office (FCO) advise against all travel to Hubei Province due to the ongoing novel coronavirus outbreak. The British Consulate General in Wuhan city is currently closed. If you’re in Hubei Province and able to leave, you should do so.
The FCO advise against all but essential travel to the rest of mainland China (not including Hong Kong and Macao). As of 31 January, some staff and dependants from the British Embassy and Consulates are being withdrawn from China. Essential staff needed to continue critical work will remain. In the event that the situation deteriorates further, the ability of the British Embassy and Consulates to provide assistance to British nationals from within China may be limited.
The Chinese government continues to impose further restrictions on movement within China in response to the coronavirus outbreak. Some airlines, including British Airways and Virgin Atlantic, have announced a suspension of flights to and from mainland China. Other commercial airlines are still operating, but it may become harder to access departure options over the coming weeks. If you feel that you may want to leave China soon, you should consider making plans to do so before any further restrictions may be imposed, taking into account your personal circumstances and the information available to you. The elderly and those with pre-existing medical conditions may be at heightened risk.

Terrorists are likely to try to carry out attacks in China. Although foreigners haven’t been specifically targeted, attacks may occur in places visited by foreigners. You should take particular care during national holidays or when transiting public transport hubs, and always follow the advice of the local authorities. Previous attacks have targeted public places including on one occasion at a railway station and an open air market in 2014. There have been no recent attacks in the main tourist areas.

If you’ve formally renounced Chinese citizenship, you should carry evidence that you have done so. See Local laws and customs
