Entry rules in response to coronavirus (COVID-19)
Entry requirements to Gibraltar depend on whether you are fully vaccinated or not, the countries you have visited in the 10 days prior to your arrival, and whether they are on the green, amber or red lists.

The website also gives information for travellers entering by sea, and crossing the land border into Gibraltar.
If you have only been in countries or territories on the green list in the 10 days preceding your arrival in Gibraltar by air and are fully vaccinated, then you must upload your vaccination certificate on the Passenger Locator Form. You must book a COVID-19 lateral flow test before arriving in Gibraltar. This test must take place within 24 hours of arrival. If you are remaining for more than 7 days, you must also take a second test on day 5.

If you are remaining in Gibraltar for more than 7 days, you must also take a third test on day 5.
