There remain commercial options to return to the UK from Slovakia, but these are reducing.
If you live in the UK and are currently visiting Slovakia, you are strongly advised to return now by commercial means. Don’t run the risk of getting stranded.
UK special charter flights will only operate for priority countries where commercial flights are not possible. You should not assume that these flights will become available in countries where commercial routes are operating. Please do not contact the contracted travel management company if no special charter flight is advertised here.

Flights
British travellers in Slovakia are allowed to leave, but international airports at Bratislava, Kosice and Poprad are closed to regular scheduled passenger flights.
Road and rail
International rail and bus services have also ceased. Taxis are no longer permitted to carry passengers.
Travel via bordering countries
On 10 April, the Austrian government introduced controls at the border with Slovakia. With effect from 14 April, it will also introduce new requirements for those UK nationals transiting Austria and those ending their journey in Austria. If you plan to transit Austria, you will need to provide evidence that you are transiting and complete a declaration of transit. For those ending their journey in Austria, the Austrian government may require non-residents to show a medical certificate. For other requirements, check the FCO travel advice for Austria.
There are restrictions on entry for most British nationals at the borders with Poland, Hungary, Czech Republic and Ukraine. To plan your route by road, check the FCO travel advice for all the countries you plan to travel through, including for any special documentation required.
There are indirect scheduled commercial routes to the UK from Vienna and Prague Airports, but these are reducing and may be subject to cancellation at short notice. You should contact the airlines directly.
Help and support
You will need to pay for your return travel to the UK. If departure options are available but you cannot afford the travel costs and have exhausted all other options for getting funds, you may be eligible to apply for an emergency loan from the government. This is a last resort option and you would need to repay the loan when you are back in the UK. For more information, you should contact Corporate Travel Management (CTM). CTM are a commercial partner of the FCO and are authorised to administer such loans on behalf of the FCO.
Arrival in the UK
When you arrive back in the UK, follow the guidance for when you return to the UK on steps you should take to protect yourself and others.
