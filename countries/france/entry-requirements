Travel between the UK and France
France announced they would be restricting travel from the UK from 20 December. Travel restrictions apply to all air, car, ferry and train passengers. Only the following categories of people are authorised to travel to France from the UK:
French nationals and nationals of the European Area and their spouses and children.
British and/or third country nationals who are either habitually resident in France, the European Union or the European Area, or who must travel for certain essential reasons (as set out in the criteria for exemptions listed on the exempted international travel certificate). For travel to France from the UK, this can be found under the tab ‘Travel to/from a country outside the European Area’. In exceptional circumstances, the French Consulate in London may be able to assist with travel for an essential reason not listed on the international travel certificate. For further details, please see the French Embassy London’s website
Arrivals from the UK will need to complete both a ‘sworn statement’ (déclaration sur l’honneur) form self-certifying they are not suffering from symptoms associated with coronavirus and have not been in contact with confirmed cases in the preceding fortnight, and a signed ‘travel certificate’ (attestation), confirming their reason for travel. These can be found on the French government’s website
All travellers from the UK, including children aged 11 and above, will need to present a negative COVID-19 test result, carried out less than 72 hours before departure. From 18 January, only PCR tests will be accepted for passengers. For hauliers, current testing measures at the border remain unchanged. You should not use the NHS testing service to get a test in order to facilitate your travel to another country. You should arrange to take a private test. A list of private providers of coronavirus testing is available here.
Passengers arriving in France from the UK will also be required to self-isolate for seven days on arrival, before taking another PCR test. Exit from this self-isolation period is subject to a negative test result. Please find more information on how to obtain a PCR test in France here.
If you were due to travel to France, contact your travel operator. Further updates will be published when they are available. Check our COVID-19 advice on things to consider, and be prepared to stay overseas longer than planned.
Travel within the EU
From 31 January, all air, car, ferry and train passengers arriving from the European area (defined by the French Ministry of the Interior as EU Member States, Andorra, Holy See, Iceland, Liechtenstein, Monaco, Norway, San Marino and Switzerland) will need to present a negative COVID-19 PCR test result, carried out less than 72 hours before departure. Arrivals will also need to present a completed ‘sworn statement’ (déclaration sur l’honneur) form, self-certifying they are not suffering from symptoms associated with coronavirus and have not been in contact with confirmed cases in the preceding fortnight. This form can be found on the French government’s website. Travellers should then self-isolate for seven days on arrival, before taking another PCR test. Cross-border workers and hauliers from within the European area are exempt from this requirement, as are people travelling within a 30km radius of their home.
You should consult the French government’s advice for foreign nationals in France page for further information.
Travel between the EU and non-European countries
From 31 January, any international travel – to or from France – from a country outside of the European Union will be prohibited, with the exception of certain essential reasons, including airside transit stops of less than 24 hours.
The French government has put in place COVID-19 travel restrictions on international arrivals. UK travellers/non-EU and EEA nationals resident in the UK will not be permitted entry to France for non-essential purposes due to EU-wide COVID-19 restrictions on arrivals from the UK. Essential travel is still permitted and a list of exemptions for entering France can be found on the French government’s advice for foreign nationals in France page. These restrictions do not apply to persons (including UK nationals) who are legally resident in France. You will be allowed to re-enter the country, but may need to show proof of residence. These restrictions also do not apply to hauliers. Testing measures for hauliers remain unchanged. You should not use the NHS testing service to get a test in order to facilitate your travel to another country. You should arrange to take a private test. A list of private providers of coronavirus testing is available here.
If you wish to travel from France to a country outside the European area, including the UK, you must also complete a ‘Certificate to leave Metropolitan France’, which specifies exemptions for travel outside the European
Further information on French COVID-19 travel restrictions can be found on the French government’s website.
If you are travelling from a country which is not exempt from French COVID-19 travel restrictions you may only enter France if your journey is essential and meets the criteria for exceptions. You will also need to complete both an exempted international movement certificate and a sworn declaration that you do not have COVID-19 symptoms, which can be found on the French government’s website. You will also be required to present a negative test result, carried out less than 72 hours before departure, upon your arrival in France. If you do not have this result, you could be asked to take this test at your airport of arrival in France. Arrivals will also be required to self-isolate for 7 days on arrival, before taking another PCR test. Further information is available from the French Government’s advice for foreign nationals in France.
Travellers should equip themselves with the necessary attestation whilst travelling to their point of international departure if travel takes place during the daily curfew. Some countries are imposing a compulsory period of quarantine for travellers from France. If you are travelling from or through France, check the situation at your destination before you travel.
Travel between France and the UK
All travellers from France to the UK must complete a ‘Certificate to leave Metropolitan France’, which can be found on the French government’s website. This will be requested by the French Border Police on departure.
From 4am on 18 January, if you intend to travel to England, Scotland, or Wales, including UK nationals returning home from travel abroad, you must provide evidence of a negative COVID-19 test result taken up to 3 days before departure. If you do not comply (and you do not have a valid exemption) your airline or carrier may refuse you boarding and/or you may be fined on arrival. You can access tests in France via the French government’s website. Travellers will then be subject to quarantine measures in place in the UK upon entry.
Travel to French overseas territories
Regular flights between metropolitan France and its overseas territories resumed in late June. Travellers need to provide a negative RT-PCR test taken in the 72 hours preceding arrival, and complete a self-declaration of absence of COVID-19 symptoms and contact with confirmed cases in the 14 days preceding arrival for entry into all French overseas territories. This is available in English on the French Embassy London’s travel and quarantine page.
For travel to certain French Overseas Territories, you must present an international travel certificate confirming that your journey is essential and that you have not been suffering from a set of listed symptoms associated with COVID-19 or in contact with confirmed cases in the 14 days prior to travel. This international travel certificate and further information on travel requirements for the French Overseas Territories is available on the French Ministry of Interior website. The certificate is to be presented to transportation companies before boarding, as well as to border control authorities.
See travel advice pages for the French overseas territory you are visiting.
