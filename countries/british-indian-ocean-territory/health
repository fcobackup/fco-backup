If you are granted a permit, at least 8 weeks before your trip, check the latest specific health advice from the National Travel Health Network and Centre (NaTHNaC) on the TravelHealthPro website. Each page has information on vaccine recommendations, any current health risks or outbreaks, and factsheets with information on staying healthy abroad. Guidance is also available from NHS (Scotland) on the FitForTravel website. The British Indian Ocean Territory may not be listed on these websites and you should refer to the health information for the Seychelles instead.
General information on travel vaccinations and a travel health checklist is available on the NHS website. You may then wish to contact your health adviser or pharmacy for advice on other preventive measures and managing any pre-existing medical conditions while youâ€™re abroad.
While travel can be enjoyable, it can sometimes be challenging. There are clear links between mental and physical health, so looking after yourself during travel and when abroad is important. Information on travelling with mental health conditions is available in our guidance page. Further information is also available from the National Travel Health Network and Centre (NaTHNaC).
There are no medical facilities in the territory. Search and rescue facilities are limited. Permits will only be granted to those with adequate travel health insurance and accessible funds to cover the cost of any medical treatment abroad and repatriation.
