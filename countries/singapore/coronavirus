Coronavirus travel health
See the TravelHealthPro website for further advice on travel abroad and reducing spread of respiratory viruses during the COVID-19 pandemic.
Travel in Singapore
See the Singapore Government website for the latest on the COVID-19 situation and measures in place to curb its spread.
Those who do not comply with these measures will be fined and foreign nationals could face deportation. Repeat offenders will face further fines and/or prosecution. Be aware that restrictions and penalties are subject to change at short notice.
Public spaces and services
The wearing of face masks is compulsory for everyone when outside of their place of residence, except children under 6 years old, when eating or when engaged in strenuous exercise.
Most shops and services are open with social distancing measures in place. Until 21 June, eateries are open only for take away service. Working from home is the mandated default and those who need to go to work must wear facemasks and maintain social distancing measures at all times.
You must record visits to any shops or services through use of the ‘TraceTogether’ phone app or a ‘TraceTogether’ token. It is mandatory to use ‘Trace Together’ to enter nearly all public buildings, including shopping centres, schools, workplaces and places of worship. Please see the Singapore Ministry of Health website for more information.
Outside of the home groups cannot exceed two people, and will rise to a maximum of five people from 14 June onwards. Households are able to receive up to two visitors in one day. This number will rise to a maximum of five people per day from 14 June. A distance of 1 metre should be maintained between people, unless this is not possible due to space constraints. Speaking is discouraged on public transport.
Healthcare in Singapore
For contact details for English speaking doctors see our list of healthcare providers. English is almost universally spoken in Singapore, so all hospitals – whether private or public – will have English-speaking medical staff.
For a complete list of healthcare institutions in Singapore, see the HCI directory.
Anyone requiring a COVID-19 polymerase chain reaction (PCR) test can get it from one of the clinics approved by the Ministry of Health.
These clinics issue digital test result certificates. You should have these digital certificates notarised before you travel. Anyone looking to have their digital certificates notarised can use the services provided by the Government of Singapore.

COVID-19 vaccines if you live in Singapore
Wherever possible British nationals should aim to be vaccinated in the country where they live. As further information is available about the national vaccination programme, this page will be updated. Sign up to get email notifications.
The Singapore government has stated that it will vaccinate all residents and long-term visitors (including Permanent Residents, Employment Pass, S-Pass and Work Permit holders, foreign domestic workers, Dependent Pass, Long-Term Visit Pass and Student Pass holders). More information, including on registration, can be found at Singapore’s COVID-19 vaccination website. A Vaccine Injury Financial Assistance Programme exists to cover any vaccine related impacts on health.
All Permanent Residents and citizens may appeal for early vaccination if they have an urgent need to travel overseas for formal education or to move overseas for work, to travel to visit or care for a critically ill immediate family member, or for their own medical treatment if it cannot be accessed in Singapore. Applications can be made on the Singapore Ministry of Health website.
The local authorities have warned that vaccine-related scams exist. If in doubt, check the Ministry of Health website or call their hotline on 1800-333-9999.
The Medicines and Healthcare products Regulatory Agency (MHRA) is the UK authority responsible for assessing the safety, quality and efficacy of vaccines. It has authorised the Pfizer/BioNTech, Oxford/AstraZeneca and Moderna vaccines for temporary supply and use in the UK. Find out more about MHRA approval for these vaccines.
British nationals living overseas should seek medical advice from their local healthcare provider in the country where they reside. Information about vaccines used in other national programmes, including regulatory status, should be available from the local authorities. This list of Stringent Regulatory Authorities recognised by the World Health Organisation may also be a useful source of additional information. Find out more about COVID-19 vaccines on the World Health Organisation COVID-19 vaccines page.
