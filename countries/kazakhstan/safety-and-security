Protests took place on 2 January 2022 in Atyrau and the wider Mangystau region, spreading from 3 January 2022 to other cities across Kazakhstan including Aktobe, Karaganda, Almaty, Astana, Shymkent, and Kyzylorda. Some cities, including Almaty, saw violent clashes between protestors and police with deaths, injuries and arrests reported. The situation is now calm.
Crime
Most visits are trouble-free. However, mugging and theft occur in cities and rural areas. Foreigners can be targeted.
There have been a number of violent attacks and muggings on the expatriate community in Atyrau and Aktau in western Kazakhstan, and in Astana and Almaty. Attacks have largely taken place at night, in and around local nightclubs and bars or when arriving at home late at night, as the majority of apartment buildings have dark stairwells and no lifts. Avoid walking alone and where possible pre-arrange transport. Keep valuables in a safe place and out of public view. Avoid travelling in unofficial taxis, particularly at night and alone, or if there is another passenger already in the car.
Robberies have occurred on trains, so always lock railway compartments on overnight trains.
Passenger lists on aircraft are not always kept confidential. There have been instances of people being met from an aircraft by someone using their name and then being robbed.
Local travel
Closed areas
The following areas of Kazakhstan are closed to visitors unless prior permission has been received from the Foreign Ministry and the Interior Ministry, with the agreement of the Kazakh National Security Committee:
the Gvardeyskiy urban-type village in Almaty region (south eastern Kazakhstan) 
the town of Baykonur - see the Baikonuradm website (only in Russian) for further details
the districts of Karmakchi and Kazalinsk in southern Kyzylorda region
Borders
Do not cross the border into or out of Kazakhstan illegally.
Some land borders remain closed to foreign nationals due to Coronavirus restrictions. Check in advance which border posts are open. Border crossing points are also subject to closure without notice.
Road travel
If you wish to drive in Kazakhstan, you should apply for a 1968 International Driving Permit (IDP). 1949 IDPs previously issued by the UK may no longer be accepted in Kazakhstan. You can get IDPs over the counter from most UK Post Offices. You will not be able to buy an IDP outside the UK, so get one before you travel.
Russia, Kazakhstan and Belarus are a single Customs Union so if you’re planning to travel overland in your own vehicle make sure your customs declaration and temporary import licence are valid for the entire period of stay in all three countries. Your import licence can be extended for up to a year if necessary by contacting the customs authorities in any of the three countries.
Service stations are limited outside the main cities. Make sure you take all you need for your journey including water. Make sure your vehicle is properly maintained and in good condition for lengthy journeys.
Many roads are poorly maintained and road works or damaged roads are often not clearly signposted. Driving standards can be erratic. In some remote areas there are often stray animals on the roads. These are especially difficult to see in the dark. In winter, roads can become hazardous due to snow and ice.
Local traffic police only have the right to stop vehicles if an offence has been committed, but you should obey any request from the police to stop. The police officer should complete official papers relating to any alleged offence.
Many cars are not safely maintained and do not have rear seatbelts.
Take care when crossing roads as pedestrian crossings are rarely respected.
Air travel
On 19 May 2022, the UK sanctioned Aeroflot, Rossiya Airlines and Ural Airlines. It is now illegal under UK law for any British national or British company to do business with these airlines. This includes the purchasing of flight tickets.
The FCDO cannot offer advice on the safety of individual airlines. However, the International Air Transport Association publishes a list of registered airlines that have been audited and found to meet a number of operational safety standards and recommended practices. This list is not exhaustive and the absence of an airline from this list does not necessarily mean that it is unsafe.
You are advised to check the UK Air Safety List when flying with foreign air carriers.  The Civil Aviation Authority UK Air Safety List (ASL) identifies foreign airlines which do not meet international safety standards. These airlines are banned from operating commercial air services to, from, and within the UK. You should:
use the list to inform your decisions on which air carriers to use when flying overseas.
consult local travel providers to find alternative air routes or other means of travel, e.g. road or rail.
The International Civil Aviation Organisation has carried out an audit of the level of implementation of the critical elements of safety oversight in Kazakhstan.
The UK government advises its employees in Kazakhstan against using Petropavlovsk airport due to safety concerns.
On 27 December 2019, an internal flight operated by the carrier ‘Bek Air’ crashed in Almaty, killing a number of people. Kazakhstan’s civil aviation authority has suspended the company’s licence. A list of further incidents and accidents in Kazakhstan can be found on the website of the Aviation Safety network.
Local airlines do not always run to flight schedule. Check your actual departure or arrival time in advance. Keep hold of your baggage tags, as you will need to show them when you leave the airport.
Political situation
Public demonstrations are only permitted when authorised in advance. Unauthorised small-scale public protests do take place occasionally, in contravention of local law, putting participants at risk of arrest. You should avoid any demonstrations or political gatherings. If you become aware of any nearby violence you should leave the area immediately.
