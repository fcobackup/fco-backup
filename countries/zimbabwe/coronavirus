Travel in Zimbabwe
Zimbabwe is currently in indefinite lockdown. During this time, you are required to stay at home except to buy essential food or medicine, or seek essential healthcare within a 5km radius of where you are staying. Only certain categories of key workers are exempt. There is a curfew between 8pm to 5:30am, which is being enforced by the security services. You should comply with these requirements, wherever you are staying in Zimbabwe.
You should avoid any political gatherings or demonstrations. These can be unpredictable, can turn violent without notice and the response from the security forces may be disproportionate. You should exercise a high degree of caution and monitor local media and this travel advice for updates. It is compulsory to wear a face mask covering the nose and mouth whenever you are outside of your home.
Public transport is limited. Intercity travel remains restricted. Tourists are authorised to travel between airports and designated tourist facilities. Be sure to take confirmation of your bookings with you when travelling.
Accommodation
You should ensure you have accommodation for the period of your stay, as some hotels may close at short notice.
Public spaces and services
All gatherings, including at weddings, churches, bars, off-licences gyms and restaurants, are banned. The only exception is for funerals, which are limited to 30 individuals.
Essential services such as hospitals, pharmacies and supermarkets remain open between 8am and 5pm only.
Restaurants, bars and off-licences are closed, except for bars and restaurants serving hotel residents.
Healthcare in Zimbabwe
If you take regular medication, you should ensure you have a sufficient supply and make sure you can access a repeat prescription in the event of travel delays. Most medicines that require a prescription from a doctor in the UK will require one in Zimbabwe. Zimbabwe pharmacies do not accept prescriptions issued in the UK. There is no reciprocal healthcare agreement between Zimbabwe and the UK. For contact details of English speaking doctors visit our list of healthcare providers.
If you think you have COVID-19 symptoms, you should contact your medical practitioner for advice.
The government of Zimbabwe has said that anyone who tests positive for COVID-19 will be detained at a place of isolation for 14 days.

COVID-19 vaccines if you live in Zimbabwe
We will share information on local vaccines rollouts on our travel advice pages as they are announced.
The Medicines and Healthcare Products Regulatory Agency (MHRA) is the UK authority responsible for assessing the safety, quality and efficacy of vaccines. It has authorised the Pfizer/BioNTech, Oxford/AstraZeneca and Moderna vaccines for temporary supply and use in the UK. Find out more about MHRA approval for these vaccines.
British nationals living overseas should seek medical advice from their local healthcare provider in the country where they reside. Information about vaccines used in other national programmes, including regulatory status, should be available from the local authorities. This list of Stringent Regulatory Authorities recognised by the World Health Organisation may also be a useful source of additional information.
