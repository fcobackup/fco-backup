The information on this page covers the most common types of travel and reflects the UK government’s understanding of the rules currently in place. Unless otherwise stated, this information is for travellers using a full ‘British Citizen’ passport.
The authorities in the country or territory you’re travelling to are responsible for setting and enforcing the rules for entry. If you’re unclear about any aspect of the entry requirements, or you need further reassurance, you’ll need to contact the embassy, high commission or consulate of the country or territory you’re travelling to.
You should also consider checking with your transport provider or travel company to make sure your passport and other travel documents meet their requirements.
Entry rules in response to coronavirus (COVID-19)
Entry to Equatorial Guinea
Equatorial Guinea closed its land, sea and air borders in response to coronavirus and has only partly reopened them, to nationals, residents, diplomats and professionals.
You must have proof of a negative coronavirus test taken within 48 hours prior to arrival. If you do not have this, you will be tested in the airport by a doctor at a cost of approximately £200 Diplomatic missions and international organisations must communicate to the Ministry of Foreign Affairs and Cooperation within a reasonable time the list of their personnel and family members, indicating the date of arrival, the flight number and the place of origin.
You should not use the NHS testing service to get a test in order to facilitate your travel to another country. You should arrange to take a private test.
Screening on arrival
Your temperature will be taken at arrival at airports and ports.
If you do not have proof of a negative coronavirus test no older than 48 hours before travel, you will be tested in the airport by a doctor at a cost of approximately £200.
Quarantine requirements
If you are tested at the airport on arrival, you must go to a nominated isolation hotel or agreed isolation area for three to five days until results are given. If your test result is positive, you must self-isolate for a further 14 days.
Visas
You will need a visa to visit Equatorial Guinea. Equatorial Guinea diplomatic missions abroad may issue diplomatic and business entry visas to Equatorial Guinea, however this is kept under review.
The Government of Equatorial Guinea has confirmed it will not penalise British nationals whose visas have expired while they are unable to leave the country due to coronavirus restrictions. If this is your situation, you should write a letter to the Ministry of Foreign Affairs (Visa Section) informing them, and keep a copy for future visa applications. You will be allowed to leave the country freely when able to, and this will not affect your chances of being granted a visa in the future.
Regular entry requirements
Passport validity
Your passport should be valid for a minimum period of 6 months from the date of entry.
Visas
British nationals need a visa to visit Equatorial Guinea. For further information on entry requirements, contact the Embassy of Equatorial Guinea in London: 13 Park Place, St James’, London SW1A 1LP; telephone: 020 7499 6867.
Check that your passport is properly stamped at the airport, on arrival and departure, before leaving the immigration desk. There have been reports of travellers being delayed or threatened with detention because their passports have not been properly stamped.
If you replace your passport the Equatorial Guinea authorities will require the old passport prior to issuing a replacement visa in your new passport. The authorities will not admit travellers on visas entered into old passports, even if the visa is still valid.
Long term visitors are required to obtain a residence permit of 1 year validity from the Ministry of National Security. Holders of a residence permit no longer require a visa to exit or enter Equatorial Guinea during the validity of their residence permit.
If you’re arriving by air you may be required to fill in a health questionnaire related to recent travel to Ebola-affected countries (Liberia/Guinea/Sierra Leone).
Yellow fever certificate requirements
Check whether you need a yellow fever certificate by visiting the National Travel Health Network and Centre’s TravelHealthPro website.
Emergency travel documents
Emergency travel documents (ETDs) aren’t valid for entry into Equatorial Guinea but ETDs are accepted for exit from Equatorial Guinea.
