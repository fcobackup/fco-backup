This advice reflects the UK government’s understanding of current rules for people travelling on a full ‘British citizen’ passport from the UK, for the most common types of travel.
The authorities in Vietnam set and enforce entry rules. If you’re not sure how these requirements apply to you, contact the Vietnamese Embassy in the UK.
COVID-19 rules
There are no COVID-19 testing or vaccination requirements for travellers entering Vietnam.
If you show symptoms of COVID-19 on arrival, you must notify the health agency at the border gates.
Passport validity requirements
If you’re visiting Vietnam, your passport must have:
an ‘expiry date’ at least 6 months after the day you arrive
at least 2 blank pages
no damage – British nationals have been denied entry and exit due to passport damage
Check with your travel provider that your passport and other travel documents meet requirements. Renew your passport if you need to.
You will be denied entry if you do not have a valid travel document or try to use a passport that has been reported lost or stolen.
Checks at border control
Make sure you get your passport stamped.
Check the visa expiry date written in your passport is correct before leaving border control.
Visa requirements
If you plan to stay in Vietnam for 45 days or fewer, you do not need a visa for:
tourism
transit
business travel – but not paid or voluntary work
You must have a visa for longer stays or if you’re entering Vietnam for other reasons.
Applying for a visa or e-visa
Tourists staying more than 45 days can:
book with a travel agent in Vietnam and ask them to apply for a visa preapproval letter – your agent will tell you when to collect your visa from the embassy
apply for an e-visa that allows a 90-day stay and multiple entries – e-visas restrict you to entry and exit points you select when you apply
apply for other visa types from the Vietnamese Embassy in the UK
The British Embassy will not assist with visa extensions or sponsor visa applications.
If you get an e-visa while in Vietnam, you must exit the country and re-enter to start your e-visa.
To stay longer (to work or study, for business travel or for other reasons), you must meet the Vietnam government’s entry requirements. Check which type of visa or work permit you need with the Vietnam Immigration Department.
Read about visas and work permits if you live in Vietnam.
If you overstay your visa or work illegally, you may be delayed from travel until you pay a fine, and you could be deported and prevented from visiting Vietnam in the future.
Extend a non-tourist visa through the Vietnam Immigration Department.
Travelling through Vietnam
If you transfer from an international flight to a domestic one in Hanoi or Ho Chi Minh City, you must go through immigration and enter Vietnam. You must do this even if your final destination is outside Vietnam.
Check with your airline before departing.
Vaccination requirements
At least 8 weeks before your trip, check the vaccinations and certificates you need in TravelHealthPro’s Vietnam guide.
Customs rules
There are strict rules about goods you can take into or out of Vietnam. You must declare anything that may be prohibited or subject to tax or duty.
If you’re taking prescription medication into Vietnam, carry it in your hand luggage with a copy of the prescription. If it has a total import value greater than 100 US dollars, you must declare it at customs. For information about restrictions on medication, see Health.
Taking money into or out of Vietnam
If you’re taking cash into or out of Vietnam, you must declare amounts over:
15 million Vietnamese dong
5,000 US dollars (or the same amount in other currencies)
If you’re leaving the country with more than these amounts, declare the money at customs and show either:
confirmation you’re carrying cash abroad, issued by an authorised credit institution
written approval to carry cash, issued by the State Bank of Vietnam
