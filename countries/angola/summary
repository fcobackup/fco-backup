The FCDO advises against all but essential travel to:
the province of Cabinda (but not including Cabinda city)
within 1km of the border with the Democratic Republic of Congo in Lunda Norte province, except at official border crossings and their access roads.
the remainder of Angola based on the current assessment of COVID-19 risks
Travel to Angola is subject to entry restrictions
Entry to Angola is prohibited except for Angolan nationals, resident foreign nationals and visitors travelling for essential reasons
Angola has banned entry to arrivals from Brazil and India, with exceptions for Angolan nationals and those with residence permits who must go into mandatory quarantine on arrival at a government facility
All passengers are required to show evidence of a negative Coronavirus (COVID-19) test completed 72 hours before travel to Angola. All passengers are required to complete an Advance Passenger Information form (FRV form) 72 hours before travel to Angola. Several travel documents must be uploaded in PDF format to be accepted
All passengers are required to take a rapid COVID-19 test immediately on disembarking the plane. This test is currently free of charge. Those receiving a negative result will be allowed entry but will need to undertake compulsory self-quarantine for 10 days before undergoing a further COVID-19 test
On arrival, passengers with short-term and visitor visas will have their passports retained by the Angolan authorities at the Immigration desk. Passports can be recovered at the end of the 10 day quarantine period, on presentation of a negative COVID-19 test certificate (test to be taken on day 11) at the SME Department in the Departures lounge. Those testing positive on arrival can isolate at home if asymptomatic, but those showing symptoms may be required to go into mandatory quarantine at a government facility
