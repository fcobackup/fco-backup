International travel
There are extremely limited commercial options available to return to the UK from DRC. Current government of DRC restrictions mean that no scheduled passenger flights are permitted to enter or leave DRC, with the exception of specially arranged flights.
Borders and airports are anticipated to start reopening from 15 August.
If you wish to leave DRC, you should register your interest to leave by email to Kinshasa.Consular@fco.gov.uk.
This travel advice will be updated with further information on any future special flights and other options to leave DRC as soon as this is available. Sign up for travel advice email alerts and follow the British Embassy on Twitter and Facebook.
You will need to pay for your return travel to the UK. If departure options are available but you cannot afford the travel costs and have exhausted all other options for getting funds, you may be eligible to apply for an emergency loan from the government. This is a last resort option and you would need to repay the loan when you are back in the UK. For more information, contact Corporate Travel Management (CTM). CTM is a commercial partner of the FCO and authorised to administer such loans on behalf of the FCO.
The National Travel Health Network and Centre (NaTHNaC) also provides advice on how to stay safe as you travel by air.
