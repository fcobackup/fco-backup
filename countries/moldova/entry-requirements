The information on this page covers the most common types of travel and reflects the UK government’s understanding of the rules currently in place. Unless otherwise stated, this information is for travellers using a full ‘British Citizen’ passport.
The authorities in the country or territory you’re travelling to are responsible for setting and enforcing the rules for entry. If you’re unclear about any aspect of the entry requirements, or you need further reassurance, you’ll need to contact the embassy, high commission or consulate of the country or territory you’re travelling to.
You should also consider checking with your transport provider or travel company to make sure your passport and other travel documents meet their requirements.
Visas
Visas are no longer required to enter Moldova if your stay is under 90 days. For all other types of travel, contact the Embassy of the Republic of Moldova in London. See below for information on entry into Moldova.
The Moldovan authorities strictly enforce penalties (including deportation) against foreign visitors who overstay the terms of their visas. As a visitor you are allowed to spend no more than 90 days in any six months period in Moldova. At any official point of entry, your arrival date will be registered automatically. Please see below for details of entry through Transnistria. Residence and/or work permits are required for stays over 90 days. Immigration, residence, and work permits usually need to be extended annually, but can be issued for up to five years. Alternatively, you must regularise your stay by applying for a residence or work visa.
Entry into Moldova via Transnistria
If you’re entering into Transnistria overland from Ukraine (for example by bus or rail) be aware that the Transnistrian border guard will not place entry stamps into passports.
If you cross the border by car or bus, there are 6 check points with immigration controls, where you can receive a registration document. If you cross the border by train, there are no ‘immigration controls’. In this case, within 3 days, you should go to the Bureau for Migration and Asylum in Chisinau (124 Stefan cel Mare Boulevard). Alternatively, you could go to the local offices of the Bureau for Migration and Asylum within 3 days. These are located in: Hîrbovăț in Anenii Noi; Hajumus in Căușeni; Pîrîta in Dubăsari, Criuleni in Criuleni, Rezina in Rezina and Sărătăuac în Florești.
Your passport won’t be stamped but you’ll receive a registration document. Keep this document until your departure and present it at the border. The service is free of charge.
To register your stay you must present the following documents:
your passport
proof of travel (for example a Green Card if you drive a vehicle into Moldova; airfare, bus/train ticket)
Failure to register may result in fines and difficulties when leaving Moldova.
Entry into Moldova via Ukraine
If you enter Moldova overland from Ukraine do so at one of the internationally recognised border crossing points between Moldova (excluding the Transnistria segment) and Ukraine in the north and south of the country.
Entry into Transnistria
There are no ‘immigration controls’ in place on the internal boundary between Transnistria and Moldova proper and entry stamps won’t be placed into passports.
The authorities in Transnistria have announced that they intend to implement an entry permit and vehicle insurance requirement for foreign nationals. The implementation date for entry permits is not yet known. The vehicle insurance requirement is expected to come in to effect on 1 January 2016 for UK registered vehicles (and those of all other countries except for the rest of Moldova and Romania for which earlier implementation dates are expected to apply) and will apply to travellers intending to visit or transit the region.
The scheme is expected to be similar to the European Green Card system, but details have not yet been published.
Passport validity
Your passport should be valid for at least six months and have at least one unused page.
UK Emergency Travel Documents
UK ETDs are accepted for entry, airside transit and exit from Moldova.
