The information on this page covers the most common types of travel and reflects the UK government’s understanding of the rules currently in place. Unless otherwise stated, this information is for travellers using a full ‘British Citizen’ passport.
The authorities in the country or territory you’re travelling to are responsible for setting and enforcing the rules for entry. If you’re unclear about any aspect of the entry requirements, or you need further reassurance, you’ll need to contact the embassy, high commission or consulate of the country or territory you’re travelling to.
You should also consider checking with your transport provider or travel company to make sure your passport and other travel documents meet their requirements.
Visas
You’ll need a visa before travel to enter South Sudan. The South Sudanese Embassy in London (telephone: 020 7339 3100) issue single entry visas at a cost of £50. Even if you have a visa you should double check entry requirements before you leave.
Visas are valid for 1 month. If you wish to stay in South Sudan for longer than 1 month you’ll need to apply for an extension at the Ministry of Interior in Juba. You should also consider whether you require a work permit while in South Sudan. If in doubt you should contact the Ministry of Labour in Juba. You must register with the local police station if you’re in South Sudan for longer than 4 days.
If you’re travelling by land to neighbouring countries check the visa requirements for entry at border crossings. These may be different to when entering via an international airport.
Passport validity
Your passport should be valid for a minimum period of six months from the date of entry into South Sudan.
Yellow fever certificate requirements
Although the World Health Organisation doesn’t specify a certificate requirement, you’re required to provide a certificate of vaccination against yellow fever when you apply for your visa and in May 2016 the Minister of Information announced that no-one would be allowed to enter South Sudan without presenting a yellow fever certificate at the border.
UK Emergency Travel Documents
UK Emergency Travel Documents (ETDs) are accepted for exit from South Sudan.
