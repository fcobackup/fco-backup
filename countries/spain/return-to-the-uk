There remain commercial options to return to the UK from Spain.
If you live in the UK and are currently visiting Spain, you’re strongly advised to return now by commercial means. Don’t run the risk of getting stranded.
UK special charter flights will only operate for priority countries where commercial flights are not possible. You should not assume that these flights will become available in countries where commercial routes are operating. Please do not contact the contracted travel management company if no flight is advertised here.
Flights
Airports across Spain remain open, but airlines are operating heavily reduced services.
Find information on the latest flight availability here. This is intended as a guide to help travellers, not a definitive statement of availability and in many cases includes indirect flights. Check airline websites, including comparison websites for the latest times and information.
Travel to airports to leave Spain is still permitted, but you may be asked to provide evidence that you are departing Spain (i.e. plane ticket).
Road travel
Land borders remain open to leave Spain.
Although driving restrictions are in force in Spain and inter-regional travel is not permitted, the Spanish Interior Ministry and Policia Local have confirmed that cars and minivans carrying families/groups of passengers is permitted, as long as the purpose of the journey is to return to your country of residence. All passengers should carry their passports, proof of onward travel (ie ferry or Eurotunnel tickets) and country of residency. You may also find this letter useful should you be required to explain your reason for travel.
Travel via France
You can still drive through France to return to the UK. The French government have implemented their own measures, including required documents for travel into, and transit through, France. Check the latest FCO travel advice for France ahead of your journey.
Travel via Gibraltar
British travellers wishing to enter Gibraltar from Spain to fly on to the UK should arrive in Gibraltar on the day of flight departure and make their way straight to the airport terminal. You will need to present evidence of a confirmed flight booking to both the Spanish and Gibraltarian immigration officers.
The Gibraltar airport terminal building does not stay open overnight and it is NOT permitted to spend the night there. Check the latest FCO travel advice for Gibraltar ahead of your journey.
Ferry travel
There are currently no scheduled passenger ferries operating between Spain and the UK. We are working closely with Brittany Ferries who may be able to assist repatriating a small number of people on their freight services. If your ferry has been cancelled and you wish to return to the UK, please contact the British Embassy online stating your name and booking reference number.
Future travel options
You will need to pay for your return travel to the UK. If departure options are available but you cannot afford the travel costs and have exhausted all other options for getting funds, you may be eligible to apply for an emergency loan from the government. This is a last resort option and you would need to repay the loan when you are back in the UK.
For more information, you should contact Corporate Travel Management (CTM). CTM are a commercial partner of the FCO and are authorised to administer such loans on behalf of the FCO.
