Most airlines have suspended or reduced flight operations to Tel Aviv Ben Gurion Airport. From 29th March 2020, there will be no routine direct flights between Israel and the UK until further notice.
Israir Airlines is taking bookings for two flights from Tel Aviv Ben Gurion to the UK on Sunday 5 April and Tuesday 7 April. Details (in Hebrew only) can be found and tickets can be purchased on their website.
Some other airlines are still operating international flights from Tel Aviv Ben Gurion Airport, so routes to the UK may still be available through connections in other countries.
