Before you travel check that:
your destination can provide the healthcare you may need
you have appropriate travel insurance for local treatment or unexpected medical evacuation
This is particularly important if you have a health condition or are pregnant.
Emergency medical number
Dial 911 and ask for an ambulance.
Contact your insurance or medical assistance company promptly if you’re referred to a medical facility for treatment.
Vaccinations and health risks
At least 8 weeks before your trip check:
the latest information on health risks and what vaccinations you need for the USA (or the US Virgin Islands, Puerto Rico, American Samoa, Guam and Northern Mariana Islands) on TravelHealthPro (from the UK’s National Travel Health Network and Centre)
where to get vaccines and whether you have to pay on the NHS travel vaccinations page
Altitude sickness is a risk in parts of the USA. More information about altitude sickness is available from TravelHealthPro (from the UK’s National Travel Health Network and Centre).
Mosquito bites
Take steps to avoid bites from mosquitoes and ticks – read guidance on TravelHealthPro. There are occasional outbreaks of mosquito-borne diseases.
Zika virus is a risk in:
Florida
Texas (Cameron County and Hidalgo County only)
Puerto Rico
US Virgin Islands
American Samoa
For more information and advice, visit TravelHealthPro for Florida and Texas, Puerto Rico, US Virgin Islands and American Samoa.
Medication
The legal status and regulation of some medicines prescribed or bought in the UK can be different in other countries.
You cannot take some prescription drugs into the USA. The US Food and Drug Administration provides information and advice on bringing medicines into the USA.
UK prescriptions are not valid in the USA. To get pharmacy drugs, you need a prescription from a US provider (available from an urgent care facility, emergency room or a doctor).
TravelHealthPro explains best practice when travelling with medicines.
The NHS has information on whether you can take your medicine abroad.
Healthcare facilities in the USA
Medical treatment is expensive and there are no special arrangements for British visitors.
Some hospitals ask non-US residents to pay a deposit when admitted. Send any requests for funds to your travel insurance provider first; only pay the hospital if you’re advised to do so by your travel insurance company. Your medical care won’t be affected while your claim is processed.
Medical facilities in American Samoa are basic and you may need medical evacuation by air ambulance to Hawaii, New Zealand or Australia.
Make sure you have adequate travel health insurance and accessible funds to cover the cost of any medical treatment abroad and repatriation.
COVID-19 healthcare in the USA
Isolation requirements will depend on the guidance in the state where you are. The Center for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) has guidance on how to protect yourself and others.
Travel and mental health
Read FCDO guidance on travel and mental health. There is also guidance on TravelHealthPro.
