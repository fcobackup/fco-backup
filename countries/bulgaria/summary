Travel to Bulgaria is subject to entry restrictions
A temporary travel ban on all arriving passengers from the UK remains in force, with some limited exemptions. From 00:01 on 1 January a new COVID-19 testing or quarantine requirement will be in place for those exempt from the travel ban.
UK nationals and other non-Bulgarian nationals arriving from the UK continue to be denied entry to Bulgaria for non-essential purposes due to an ongoing Ordinance from the Bulgarian Ministry of Health that bans travel from the UK, and EU-wide COVID-19 restrictions. These include travel by Bulgarian Citizens and their non-Bulgarian immediate family members, and by British and third-country nationals legally resident in Bulgaria and their immediate family members who ordinarily reside with them, but you may need to show proof of residency with a visa or residency permit or equivalent document and proof of relationship status.
The temporary travel ban imposed by the Ordinance remains in place at all air, road, rail and sea border crossings into Bulgaria. In addition to Bulgarian citizens, and those British and third-country nationals who are able to demonstrate that they have valid residence status in Bulgaria, members of their families, a small number of other categories of traveller, are exempt from the ban, including hauliers and transport workers.
The ban is currently expected to remain in place until 31 January.
From 00:01 on 01 January 2021, all arrivals to Bulgaria from the UK, with some very limited exceptions, are required to provide evidence of a PCR test with a negative result undertaken up-to 72 hours before arrival or opt to undertake a 10-day official quarantine period upon arrival to Bulgaria. If you undertake a PCR test you should carry a hard-copy certificate showing your negative PCR test result when you travel as it will be required upon arrival to Bulgaria. Check the list of UK private providers of Coronavirus testing and make arrangements for your test in good time. It may not be possible to secure a test at short notice. There is no exemption to the PCR-test requirement set out in the Bulgarian Ministry of Health Ordinance for children or infants.
The 10-day quarantine period or requirement to provide evidence of a negative PCR test result does not apply to hauliers and others in transit by road through Bulgaria, and crew members of vessels and aircraft.
You may also be subject to quarantine measures if arriving from or via another country.
Many land border crossings in the region are also restricted or closed for passenger traffic.
See Entry requirements for more information before you plan to travel.

Sporadic protests occur across Bulgaria. You should avoid all protests, keep up to date with media reports and follow the advice of the local authorities. Such protests can become violent without warning and are best avoided. There are currently ongoing protests against the Government in Sofia city centre around the National Assembly and President’s buildings that should be avoided.
Be aware of pickpockets, bag thefts and street attacks on visitors in city centres and coastal resorts especially in crowded areas like buses, trains and busy streets. There has been an increase in thefts on the bus from Nessebar to Sunny Beach. Keep valuables in a safe. See Crime
There are regular reports of robberies and threatening behaviour by taxi drivers in Sunny Beach.

Terrorist attacks in Bulgaria can’t be ruled out. On 30 December 2016, the Bulgarian authorities announced heightened security measures in all cities, winter ski resorts, and places where large gatherings are expected. See Terrorism
There have been reports of holidaymakers being encouraged to submit a claim for personal injury if they have experienced gastric illness during their stay.
