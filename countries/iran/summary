British nationals, in particular dual British/Iranian nationals, face greater risks in Iran than nationals of many other countries, including the risk of arbitrary detention. The Iranian authorities don’t recognise dual nationality for Iranian citizens and therefore don’t grant consular access for FCO officials to visit them in detention. You should consider carefully the risks of travelling to Iran. See Safety and Security
On 24 and 25 June 2018, protests about the economic situation in Iran took place inside and around the Grand Bazaar in Tehran. There were also widespread protests across Iran in late December 2017 and early January 2018. The risk that these protests re-occur or new demonstrations begin on other grounds, remains. You should exercise caution and avoid any protests or rallies and follow the instructions of the local authorities.
As of 15 April 2018 bureaux de change are not licensed to trade currency. It is illegal to change money on the street. You should be clear before travelling how you will obtain enough rials for your visit legally and, if unsure, you may need to reconsider your travel plans. See Money
