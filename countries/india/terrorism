Terrorists are very likely to try to carry out attacks in India.
UK Counter Terrorism Policing has information and advice on staying safe abroad and what to do in the event of a terrorist attack. Find out more about the global threat from terrorism.
Terrorist attacks are carried out by a number of terrorist and insurgent groups including Lashkar-e-Tayyiba(LET), Jaish-e-Mohammed(JEM) and the Indian Mujahideen(IM). Media reports suggest Daesh (formerly referred to as ISIL) is looking to attack targets in India, either directly or through inspiring ‘lone wolf’ attacks. Similarly, Al Qaeda in the Indian Subcontinent (AQIS) has also targeted India. There may be an increased threat to places visited by British nationals such as religious sites, markets, festival venues and beaches and any places involving large gatherings of people.
Terrorist attacks have mainly focused on Indian government interests but terrorists have also targeted places visited by westerners including restaurants, hotels, railway stations, markets, places of worship, festivals and sporting venues. Be vigilant, especially in public places. Always monitor local media for any local travel warnings before planning your travel. If you see unattended baggage, report it promptly. Security has been strengthened, notably at major hotels and transport hubs (airports, railway and metro stations). Take particular care in the lead up to and on days of national and/or religious significance, like Republic Day (26 January), Independence Day (15 August), Diwali (usually in October/November) and Eid (usually May/June).
There have been frequent terrorist incidents in Jammu and Kashmir and less often in other parts of the north east India. A significant terrorist attack took place in Pulwama (Jammu and Kashmir) on 14 February 2019. There is a continuing threat, predominantly towards Indian government targets.
A number of insurgent groups are active in Assam. There have been random incidents of violence and killings primarily directed at the Indian government. Violent extremist groups are also active in the rural areas of Jharkand, Chhattisgarh, Odisha, and in parts of Bihar and West Bengal.
There’s a heightened threat of terrorist attack globally against UK interests and British nationals from groups or individuals motivated by the conflict in Iraq and Syria. You should remain vigilant.
