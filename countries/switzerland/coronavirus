Travelling from and returning to the UK
Check what you must do to travel abroad and return to England, Scotland, Wales or Northern Ireland.
If you plan to pass through another country to return to the UK, check the travel advice for the country you’re transiting.
Neighbouring countries may introduce restrictions at borders and conduct health checks. Check the travel advice for any country you need to travel to or through. See our Travel Advice for France and Germany for the latest rules for transiting those countries from/to Switzerland.
Be prepared for your plans to change
No travel is risk-free during COVID. Countries may further restrict travel or bring in new rules at short notice, for example due to a new COVID-19 variant. Check with your travel company or airline for any transport changes which may delay your journey home.
If you test positive for COVID-19, you may need to stay where you are until you test negative. You may also need to seek treatment there.
Plan ahead and make sure you:
can access money
understand what your insurance will cover
can make arrangements to extend your stay and be away for longer than planned
COVID-19 restrictions
Switzerland has lifted all COVID-19 pandemic restrictions – there are no social distancing or mask wearing measures in place. There is no mandatory isolation requirement if you test positive for COVID-19. Local restrictions or mandatory mask wearing and proof of vaccination may be in place in hospitals or care homes.
However, you should follow the basic principles on hygiene to protect yourself and others. If you feel unwell, it is advised to stay at home. If you have COVID-19 symptoms, it may be a good idea to get tested, especially if you are at high risk. The costs of the test are covered by the Swiss government.
Within Switzerland, there is no certificate requirement at the national level.
Further information is available from the Federal Office of Public Health.
Cantons may impose further restrictions, and you should check cantonal websites for further details.

COVID-19 vaccines if you live in Switzerland
Wherever possible British nationals should aim to be vaccinated in the country where they live. We will update this page when the Government of Switzerland announces new information on the national vaccination programme. You can sign up to get email notifications when this page is updated.
The Swiss national vaccination programme started in December 2020 and is using the Pfizer-BioNTech, Moderna and Janssen vaccines. British nationals resident in Switzerland are eligible for vaccination. The Swiss authorities have issued their vaccination strategy on how vaccinations are organised in your canton. You can register for vaccination on the website of your canton of residence.
Find out more, including about vaccines that are authorised in the UK or approved by the World Health Organisation, on the COVID-19 vaccines if you live abroad.
If you’re a British national living in Switzerland, you should seek medical advice from your local healthcare provider. Information about COVID-19 vaccines used in the national programme where you live, including regulatory status, should be available from local authorities.
If you receive your COVID-19 vaccination in Switzerland, you can get a Digital COVID Certificate from the cantonal authorities. The Certificate proves that you have been vaccinated against COVID-19, received a negative test result, or recovered from COVID-19. It will help facilitate your travel within the Schengen Area and, in some countries, you can use it to demonstrate your COVID-19 status to businesses and other organisations. For further information visit the Federal Office of Public Health’s COVID Certificate page.
