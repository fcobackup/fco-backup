Some commercial airline operators have been able, in exceptional circumstances, to negotiate flights out of Iraq.
There is currently a flight being organised by Air Mediterranean, a private charter company, scheduled to depart from Baghdad International Airport on 16 May at 18:30 local time to Stockholm Arlanda Airport. Tickets can be booked at https://book.spacetown.se/. It is also possible to book onward travel to your final destination.
Due to curfew restrictions impacting travel in Baghdad, British Nationals who have secured a ticket on this flight should contact Baghdad.Consular@fco.gov.uk with their booking details and a scan of their passport photo page, in order to be issued with a facilitation letter. Please note there is no guarantee this letter will secure your passage through checkpoints.
We cannot guarantee further flights will be scheduled until normal commercial flights resume, therefore if you wish to leave Iraq you should consider leaving on this flight.
There are currently no further commercial options available to return to the UK from Iraq. The British Embassy is in contact with airlines and local authorities on when airports will reopen.
This travel advice will be updated when departure options become available.

Future travel options
You will need to pay for your return travel to the UK. If departure options are available but you cannot afford the travel costs and have exhausted all other options for getting funds, you may be eligible to apply for an emergency loan from the government. This is a last resort option and you would need to repay the loan when you are back in the UK.
