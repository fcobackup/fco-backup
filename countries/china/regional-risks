This section has safety advice for regions of China. It only covers regions where FCDO has specific advice.  
You should also read FCDO’s overall travel advice and safety and security advice.
Tibet and the Tibet Autonomous Region (TAR) 
You must get a permit to travel to Tibet and the Tibet Autonomous Region (TAR) through a specialist travel agent in China. You must also travel on an organised tour. The Chinese authorities sometimes stop issuing travel permits without notice or restrict travel to Tibetan Autonomous Prefectures (TAP) in neighbouring provinces, even if you have a permit. Check with tour operators or travel agents and monitor this travel advice and other media for information. 
Once in Tibet, you should avoid large public gatherings. Political and ethnic tensions have historically generated violent protests and still exist. Security measures will be tight. Unauthorised gatherings may be dispersed by force. Do not film or take photographs of public security forces or any altercations. Local authorities will react negatively if you’re found carrying letters or packages from Tibetan nationals to be posted in other countries. 
You must get permission to take photographs in Buddhist monasteries. 
The ability of the British Embassy Beijing and British Consulates in China to provide consular support in the Tibet Autonomous Region is limited. 
Xinjiang Uyghur Autonomous Region 
There has been violent unrest in Xinjiang which has caused deaths and there are also allegations of the use of lethal force to disperse protests. 
The Chinese authorities have a significant security presence throughout Xinjiang, both as a visible demonstration of state control and to respond quickly and harshly to any unexpected demonstrations or outbreaks of violence. 
There have been widespread arbitrary arrests and extra-judicial detention in Xinjiang, mainly affecting the local population, particularly Uyghurs and other ethnic minorities. You may be at increased risk if: 
you’re of Turkic descent 
you have lived previously in Xinjiang 
you appear to be Muslim 
You should expect airport-style security measures, including passport and security checks, at entrances to public places such as shopping centres, markets and parks. You may need to give the security forces your phone number, have your photograph taken and explain why you are travelling. Due diligence organisations conducting independent audits of facilities in Xinjiang are at risk of harassment and detention.  
Always carry your passport, avoid all protests and large crowds, be vigilant and monitor media reports. Do not photograph or film protests, large crowds, security officials or installations, or anything of a military nature. Mosques and other religious sites are also considered ‘sensitive’ by the authorities. 
The ability of the British Embassy Beijing and British Consulates in China to provide consular support in Xinjiang Uyghur Autonomous Region is limited.
