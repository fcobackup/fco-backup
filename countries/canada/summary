The Canadian authorities have introduced a number of travel restrictions in response to the coronavirus (COVID-19) pandemic. These are likely to affect commercial flight schedules to the UK and we recommend that British travellers who wish to leave by air make appropriate arrangements to ensure their travel plans can be met. Non-resident British nationals already in Canada should consider contacting airlines and/or tour operators in order to arrange departure as soon as practicably possible.
The Canadian authorities are now barring entry to Canada to most foreign nationals, including UK Nationals. The Government of Canada has announced that it will be closing its border with the US to non-essential travel from midnight EST on 20 March.
