This information is for people travelling on a full ‘British citizen’ passport from the UK. It is based on the UK government’s understanding of Tajikistan’s current rules for the most common types of travel.
The authorities in Tajikistan set and enforce entry rules. If you’re not sure how these requirements apply to you, contact the Tajik Embassy in the UK.
COVID-19 rules
There are no COVID-19 testing or vaccination requirements for travellers entering Tajikistan.
Passport validity requirements
If you’re visiting Tajikistan, your passport must have an ‘expiry date’ at least 6 months after the date you arrive and have at least 2 blank pages.
Check with your travel provider that your passport and other travel documents meet requirements. Renew your passport if you need to.
You will be denied entry if you do not have a valid travel document or try to use a passport that has been reported lost or stolen.
Visa requirements
You must have a visa to enter or travel through Tajikistan. You may be asked to provide proof of hotel bookings and any arrangements booked through a tour operator to be issued with a tourist visa.
If you overstay your visa, you will not be allowed to leave Tajikistan until you get an exit visa. You can pay for an exit visa at the Ministry of Foreign Affairs Consular Office. You may also get a fine, depending on how long you have overstayed. Exit visas are not available at airports in Tajikistan.  
Applying for a visa
Apply online for an e-visa from the Tajikistan Ministry of Foreign Affairs.
Make sure you get the correct type of visa.  Once you’re in Tajikistan, you can apply for a visa extension at the Ministry of Foreign Affairs.
Travelling through Tajikistan
You must have a transit visa to travel through Tajikistan on your way to another country. These are usually valid for 3 days. If you need to stay longer, you must get a longer visa from the Ministry of Foreign Affairs once you arrive.
Registering with the authorities
If you are staying in Tajikistan for longer than 10 days, you must register with the Office for Registration of Foreign Citizens (OVIR) located at 5 Mirzo Tursunzoda Street, Dushanbe. Hotels are no longer permitted to complete the registration on your behalf. If you later stay at different addresses, you must register again separately.
If you do not follow the registration procedure, you may not be allowed to leave Tajikistan until your registration process is resolved. This may result in fines or detention. There have been cases where lack of registration has resulted in detention at Dushanbe airport.
Travel permit for the Gorno-Badakhshan Region
You must get a permit, in addition to a Tajik visa, to travel to the Gorno-Badakhshan Autonomous Region. If you’re in the UK, contact the Tajik Embassy to apply for a permit before you travel. If you’re in Tajikistan, contact the Consular Department of the Ministry of Foreign Affairs.  
The Tajikistan government sometimes stops issuing permits to tourists at short notice due to security concerns. The Tajik Embassy can tell you whether the government is issuing permits for travel to the Gorno-Badakhshan Autonomous Region.
Travel permit for the Khatlon Region
You must get a permit, in addition to a Tajik visa, to travel to areas within 20km of the border with bordering Afghanistan in the Khatlon Region, including Panj and Kumsangir. Apply for a permit from the Consular Department of the Ministry of Foreign Affairs in Dushanbe before you travel.
Vaccine requirements
For details about medical entry requirements and recommended vaccinations, see TravelHealthPro’s Tajikistan guide.
HIV screening
If you plan to stay for more than 90 days, you must show a medical certificate that you’re HIV-free or take a test. FCDO advises against taking the test in Tajikistan due to the poor quality of medical facilities.
Customs rules
There are strict rules about goods you can take into or out of Tajikistan. You must declare anything that may be prohibited or subject to tax or duty.
