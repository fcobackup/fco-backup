Be prepared for your plans to change
No travel is risk-free during COVID. Countries may further restrict travel or bring in new rules at short notice, for example due to a new COVID-19 variant. Check with your travel company or airline for any transport changes which may delay your journey home.
If you test positive for COVID-19, you may need to stay where you are until you test negative. You may also need to seek treatment there.
Plan ahead and make sure you:
can access money
understand what your insurance will cover
can make arrangements to extend your stay and be away for longer than planned

Healthcare in Georgia
A number of medical facilities are allocated specifically for coronavirus patients, with further facilities in reserve. Only those with the most serious symptoms are taken to hospital. Everyone else is able to self-isolate at home, or placed in a COVID-19 hotel if unable to self-isolate, and will be able to access medical advice and monitoring.
If you think you might have symptoms of coronavirus you should call the Georgian Emergency number 112 or 1505. The Georgian National Centre for Disease Control (NCDC) has published a list of laboratories carrying out COVID-19 testing, both quick and PCR tests. The list of facilities can be found here. The list is in Georgian only. You should be prepared to pay up to 200 Lari (approx. £45).
If you test positive in Georgia before returning to the UK, you should self-isolate and follow the instructions of the doctor assigned to your case. You will not be able to leave the country until the self-isolation period has ended.
