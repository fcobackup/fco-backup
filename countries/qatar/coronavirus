Travel in Qatar
Qatar’s Ministry of Public Health has published advice on how to limit the spread of coronavirus, and has introduced a number of precautionary restrictions on travel and events in response to the coronavirus pandemic.
Public transport, including the metro and bus services, began running a limited service on 1 September. No more than four people are allowed in a vehicle, if they are not part of the same family. The authorities may also stop vehicles to enquire about the reason for the journey.
It is now mandatory to wear a face mask whenever you are outside your home, unless you are alone whilst driving a vehicle or exercising. From 22 May, it is also compulsory to have Qatar’s contact tracing app, Ehteraz, downloaded and working on your smartphone whenever you leave the house. The authorities are deploying mobile patrols and setting up checkpoints to prevent social gatherings and check compliance with other measures.
Anyone violating these could incur a fine of up to QR200,000 and a prison sentence not exceeding three years, or one of those two penalties.
Accommodation
Hotels are open, and facilities (ie gyms, pool) have reopened subject to restrictions on capacity. Some hotels are being used as quarantine locations.
Public places and services
Qatar moved to phase 4 of its roadmap for re-opening on 1 September. Parks, beaches, gyms and outdoor swimming pools have reopened, as have malls, some restaurants, museums and libraries, though with varying restrictions on entry, hours and capacity. Gatherings of up to 15 people inside and up to 30 outside can now take place as long as precautionary measures are taken. Mosques and most hairdressers have also reopened, with restrictions, and restaurants have a maximum of four people per table, or up to six from the same household.
Healthcare in Qatar
If you need emergency medical assistance during your trip, dial 999 and ask for an ambulance. You should contact your insurance or medical assistance company promptly if you are referred to a medical facility for treatment.
If you have symptoms of coronavirus, you should contact the Ministry of Public Health’s helpline on 16000.
If you are confirmed to have coronavirus, you will be placed in isolation in one of the country’s medical facilities, or asked to self-isolate at home for 14 days, depending on your symptoms.
Emergency medical treatment is excellent but can be expensive. Routine treatment is available but expensive for visitors. Make sure you have adequate travel health insurance and accessible funds to cover the cost of any medical treatment abroad and repatriation.
