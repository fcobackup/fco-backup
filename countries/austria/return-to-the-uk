There remain limited, indirect commercial options to return to the UK from Austria.
If you live in the UK and are currently visiting Austria, you’re strongly advised to return now by commercial means. Don’t run the risk of getting stranded.
UK special charter flights will only operate for priority countries where commercial options are not possible. You should not assume that these flights will become available in countries where commercial routes are operating. Please do not contact the contracted travel management company if no flight is advertised here.
Flights
Indirect flights from Vienna to the UK are currently being offered by Lufthansa (via Frankfurt) and KLM (via Amsterdam).
Please also consider options from Munich Airport in Germany.
Travel via Germany
If you plan to return to the UK via Germany, it is possible to transit through Germany if:
• You have evidence of your onward journey and;
• Do not show symptoms of illness that could indicate a coronavirus infection.
An example of ‘acceptable evidence’ would include a confirmed flight, ferry or Eurotunnel booking to the UK. If you are travelling through France, you should also complete a personal travel waiver certificate.
As with other forms of transport, many cross-Channel operators are operating substantially reduced services for passenger traffic. Passengers should check with their operator before departing, and may still be subject to severe disruption.
Check travel advice for any country that you will transit on the way back to the UK.
