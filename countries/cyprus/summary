The FCDO advises against all but essential travel to:
the whole of Cyprus based on the current assessment of COVID-19 risks.
The FCDO is not advising those already travelling in Cyprus to leave at this time. Travellers should follow the advice of the local authorities on how best to protect themselves and others, including any measures that they bring in to control the virus. You should contact your tour operator or airline if you have any questions about your return journey.
If you are returning to the UK from Cyprus, you will need to self-isolate on your return (unless you are exempt). Check the latest guidance for England, Northern Ireland, Scotland and Wales.
Travel is subject to entry restrictions
On 21 December, the Cypriot authorities publicly advised against all but essential travel to the UK from Cyprus, and a mandatory authority-assigned quarantine of a minimum of 7 days for all arrivals into Cyprus from the UK. Following this announcement, the authorities have informed the British High Commission, but not yet publicly announced, that the UK is now in Cyprus’ Category C. This means that visitors from the UK are not permitted to travel to Cyprus.
See Entry requirements for more information before you plan to travel.
