This advice reflects the UK government’s understanding of current rules for people travelling on a full ‘British citizen’ passport from the UK, for the most common types of travel.
The authorities in San Marino set and enforce entry rules. If you’re not sure how these requirements apply to you, contact San Marino’s consulate in the UK.
You will need to travel through Italy to enter San Marino. Read Italy’s travel advice before you visit.
COVID-19 rules
There are no COVID-19 testing or vaccination requirements for travellers entering San Marino.
Passport validity requirements
To travel to San Marino, you must follow the Schengen area passport requirements.
To enter San Marino (and all Schengen countries) your passport must:
have a ‘date of issue’ less than 10 years before the date you arrive. Passports issued after 1 October 2018 are now valid for only 10 years, but for passports issued before 1 October 2018, extra months may have been added if you renewed a passport early
have an ‘expiry date’ at least 3 months after the day you plan to leave
Check with your travel provider that your passport and other travel documents meet requirements. Renew your passport if you need to.
You will be denied entry if you do not have a valid travel document or try to use a passport that has been reported lost or stolen.
You do not need to pass through border controls to enter San Marino, but you must be in possession of a passport containing a valid entry stamp from a Schengen state.
Visa requirements
You can travel without a visa to the Schengen area (including San Marino) for up to 90 days in any 180-day period. This applies if you travel:
as a tourist
to visit family or friends
to attend business meetings, cultural or sports events
for short-term studies or training
If you’re travelling to San Marino and other Schengen countries without a visa, make sure your whole visit is within the 90-day limit. Visits to Schengen countries in the 180 days before you travel count towards your 90 days.
To stay longer (to work or study, for business travel or for other reasons), you must meet the San Marino government’s entry requirements. Check which type of visa or work permit you need with San Marino’s consulate in the UK.
If you stay in San Marino with a residence permit or long-stay visa, this does not count towards your 90-day visa-free limit.
Registering with the police
You need to go to the Gendarmerie to register and get a permit of stay if you are visiting for more than 30 days or are planning to work. Visit the San Marino website for more information.
Vaccination requirements
At least 8 weeks before your trip, check the vaccinations and certificates you need in TravelHealthPro’s San Marino guide.
Customs rules
The rules about goods that can be brought into and taken out of San Marino are the same as for Italy. You must declare anything that may be prohibited or subject to tax or duty.
