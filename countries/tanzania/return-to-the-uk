There are currently no commercial options available to return to the UK from Tanzania, following an announcement on 12 April by the Tanzanian authorities suspending all international passenger flights.
We know this is concerning for British people trying to leave Tanzania. The UK government is working closely with airlines, the Tanzanian authorities and other governments to make sure options are available for you to return to the UK as soon as possible.
We are aware that some short-term visitors may still wish to return to the UK but have not been able to do so for a variety of reasons. If this applies to you, you should email the details listed below to our dedicated mailbox: ReturnFromTanzania@fco.gov.uk:
your full name as shown on your passport
passport number
date of birth
place of residence in UK
where exactly you are currently staying in Tanzania
date entered Tanzania
email address and telephone number (you should ensure that you are able to receive phone calls from unidentified numbers, including internationally, in case we need to reach you)
any specific medical needs/vulnerabilities
You should provide this information for any family members with you in Tanzania that are also seeking to return to the UK.
Future travel options

You will need to pay for your return travel to the UK. If departure options are available but you cannot afford the travel costs and have exhausted all other options for getting funds, you may be eligible to apply for an emergency loan from the government. This is a last resort option and you would need to repay the loan when you are back in the UK.
For more information, you should contact Corporate Travel Management (CTM). CTM are a commercial partner of the FCO and are authorised to administer such loans on behalf of the FCO.
