Cases of coronavirus (COVID-19) have been confirmed in Zambia. The Zambian authorities have introduced a number of measures to limit the spread of the coronavirus including pre-departure screening and mandatory quarantine on arrival for 14 days, in a government facility for those displaying symptoms on arrival, and self-quarantine for all others.
You should comply with any additional screening measures put in place by the authorities.
Issuance of visas for travellers from severe COVID-19 affected countries, including the UK, is being reviewed.
Entry and borders
Zambia’s borders remain open but under tight screening. Many of Zambia’s neighbouring countries have implemented coronavirus related travel restrictions and border closures so you should check travel advice for these countries before travel.
The Zambian authorities are testing individuals entering Zambia for COVID-19. There is a risk that travellers arriving by air may be quarantined in a government facility for potentially up to 72 hrs whilst waiting for the test results. If the test result is negative, travellers will be released but will have to self-quarantine until 14 days have passed since their arrival in Zambia. Travellers arriving by land will be quarantined for 14 days which may be at their own cost.
Travellers arriving with symptoms or testing positive for coronavirus will be quarantined and treated in a government facility.
Travellers to Zambia are not allowed to leave Zambia until they have completed the 14-day quarantine period.
Kenneth Kaunda International Airport (KKIA) in Lusaka remains open to international flights, but international flights are suspended from all provincial airports. International train and bus services are suspended.
Issuance of visas for travellers from severe COVID-19 affected countries, including the UK, is being reviewed.
Local measures
All schools are closed. Gatherings of 50 people of more are restricted. Restaurants are only providing take away services and cinemas, bars, gyms etc are closed.
The Zambian authorities have asked people to avoid non-essential travel, especially in and out of Lusaka.
