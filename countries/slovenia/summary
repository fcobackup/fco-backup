The FCDO advises against all but essential travel to the whole of Slovenia based on the current assessment of COVID-19 risks.
Travel to Slovenia is subject to entry restrictions
The Slovenian authorities have implemented a Dark Red list in addition to the Red list to determine the requirements for people arriving into Slovenia.
From 30 May, the UK will be on the Dark Red list. Travellers arriving into Slovenia from Red and Dark Red list countries, including from the UK, are required to quarantine on arrival for 10 days, unless they meet one of the listed exemptions. See the Entry requirements section for more details.
Slovenia only allows entry for those travelling for essential purposes. If your travel is deemed by the Slovenian authorities to be non-essential, then you may be denied entry by the Slovenian authorities.
Full details can be found on this Slovenian Government website
See Entry requirements for more information before you plan to travel.
Returning to the UK
Slovenia is on the amber list for entering England. Check what you must do to enter England, Scotland, Wales or Northern Ireland.
If your return journey to the UK transits another country, you should check whether it is subject to a travel ban or any other additional requirements. If so, contact your travel provider.

If you’re living in or moving to Slovenia, read the Living in Slovenia guide in addition to this travel advice.
Immigration controls may temporarily be in place at some road and rail border crossing points. Full immigration controls are in place at Slovenia’s border with Croatia. You must carry your passport with you at all times. You should monitor local media and check with your transport provider, the Slovenian Automobile Association (AMZS) or Slovenian Railways websites for updates.
All foreign nationals visiting Slovenia must register with the police within 3 days of arrival or risk paying a fine. Hotels and accommodation providers will usually do this as part of the check in procedures. See Local laws and customs
Although there’s no recent history of terrorism in Slovenia, attacks can’t be ruled out. See Terrorism
To drive on Slovenian motorways, you must buy and display a ‘vignette’. Vehicles over 3.5 tonnes must register for an electronic tolling system. Vehicles must be fitted with winter equipment from 15 November to 15 March. See Road travel
Seek advice on weather and safety conditions before travelling into the mountains. Off-piste skiing is highly dangerous due to the risk of avalanches. See Skiing/mountaineering
If you’re abroad and you need emergency help from the UK government, contact the nearest British embassy, consulate or high commission.
