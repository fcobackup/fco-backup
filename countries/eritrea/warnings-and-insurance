Support for British nationals in Eritrea
Consular support is severely limited in parts of Eritrea. If you’re in Eritrea and you need urgent help (for example, you’ve been attacked or arrested, or someone has died), call the British Embassy in Asmara on +291 1 202 838. If you’re in the UK and worried about a British national in Eritrea, call 020 7008 5000.
British-Eritrean dual nationals
If you are a British-Eritrean dual national, the Eritrean authorities consider you to be an Eritrean national. This applies if you hold identity documents issued by Eritrea’s Department of Immigration and Nationality, including out of date documents. The British Embassy is unable to offer consular assistance to dual nationals in Eritrea. Embassy staff will be unable to gain consular access to you if you are detained by the Eritrean authorities.
