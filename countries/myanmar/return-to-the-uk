If you have concerns for your safety in the current situation, you should consider leaving Myanmar by commercial means.
The military have suspended all scheduled international commercial passenger flights until 31 May 2021. However, some relief flights are operating. See Flights (below). Land borders are also closed.
If you cannot leave Myanmar at this time, see advice on staying in Myanmar during coronavirus.
Flights
There are limited options for British nationals looking to return to the UK.
The military have extended the suspension of normal commercial passenger flights until 31 May 2021. However, the airport is open and some ‘relief’ flights are available for those seeking to leave Myanmar. Most of these are commercially bookable.
Flights are currently available to a number of destinations, most frequently to Kuala Lumpur, Seoul, and Singapore. A number of international airlines are operating flights to these destinations, which can be booked through their websites. In addition, Myanmar National Airlines and Myanmar Airways International are also operating flights.
All travellers should check with the embassies of respective transit countries for the latest transit, entry and Covid-19 testing requirements before making ticket purchases. Please note that Kuala Lumpur does not currently require a COVID negative test for transit.
Other flight options may become available and travellers should keep in close touch with their travel agents as the situation is changeable.
Your journey home: before you leave Myanmar
Please be aware of current UK entry requirements. To enter the UK, you are required to:
complete a passenger locator form; and
provide proof of a negative coronavirus test.
You are normally required to show proof of a negative coronavirus test to your airline before being allowed to board.
However, as of 21 February, you do not need to take a test if you began your journey to the UK from Myanmar. The present situation in Myanmar means that it is not reasonable to seek to obtain a pre-departure coronavirus test in that country before departure to the UK. The guidance will be reviewed regularly. Sign up to get an email alert whenever this page is updated.
If you require urgent advice on COVID testing, please contact Yangon.Consular@fcdo.gov.uk.
If you do not have a valid British Passport, the British Embassy can issue emergency travel documents or emergency passports should you need to leave the country in the near future. Please call the Embassy for further assistance or contact Yangon.Consular@fcdo.gov.uk.

Your journey home: re-entering the UK
When you return, you must follow the rules for entering the UK. You:
need to provide your journey and contact details up to 48 hours before you’re due to arrive in the UK
are not allowed to leave the place you’re staying for the first 14 days you’re in the UK except in very limited situations (known as ‘self-isolating’) See also the list of people who are exempt from the border rules.
The National Travel Health Network and Centre (NaTHNaC) also provides advice on how to stay safe as you travel by air.
Help and support
You will need to pay for your return travel to the UK. If departure options are available but you cannot afford the travel costs and have exhausted all other options for getting funds, you may be eligible to apply for an emergency loan from the government. For information on financial support you can access whilst abroad, see our financial assistance guidance.
