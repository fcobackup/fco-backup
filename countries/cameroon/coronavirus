Cases of coronavirus (COVID-19) have been confirmed in Cameroon. The Cameroon authorities have introduced a number of measures to limit the spread of the virus.
Entry and borders
The Cameroon authorities have announced the closure of all its land, sea and air borders, effective from the 18 March. All international flights have been suspended. All entry visas have been suspended.
Local Measures
The Government of Cameroon has prohibited gatherings of over 50 people. Bars, restaurants and entertainment spots now must close from 6pm daily.
Travel within the country should be limited to essential travel only. The authorities are enforcing measures limiting the number of passengers taxis, buses and motorbikes can take.
Visits to public institutions, including government buildings, have been limited.
Additional measures, introduced from 13 April, include the requirement to wear face masks in public spaces and a systematic sanctioning of those people found to have breached restriction and confinement measures imposed on them.
Schools and other educational establishments have been shut down and all exams and competitions cancelled.
Pharmacies and health centres remain open.

Visas
The Government of Cameroon has confirmed it will not penalise British nationals whose visas have expired while they are unable to leave the country due to coronavirus restrictions. Immigration Police will not pursue you if this is your situation, you will be allowed to leave the country freely when able to, and this will not affect your chances of being granted a visa in the future.

Further information on coronavirus, including advice on preparing for foreign travel and helping reduce the spread of the virus, is available from Public Health England and on the TravelHealthPro website.
