There are currently no commercial options available to return to the UK from Algeria. As of 19 March, all international flights to and from Algeria were suspended, including flights to the UK. All land borders are now closed and ferry services are suspended.
Future options
The British Embassy in Algiers is in constant contact with airlines, the Algerian authorities and other governments to make sure commercial options for returning to the UK are available as soon as possible.
The Embassy cannot provide further information or advice about departure options over the phone. This travel advice page will be updated if departure options become available. To get the latest information, Sign up for email alerts for Algeria travel advice and follow the British Embassy on Twitter and Facebook.
You will need to pay for your return travel to the UK. If departure options are available but you cannot afford the travel costs and have exhausted all other options for getting funds, you may be eligible to apply for an emergency loan from the government.
This is a last resort option and you would need to repay the loan when you are back in the UK. For more information, please email Consular Services at the British Embassy in Algiers at algiers.consular@fco.gov.uk
