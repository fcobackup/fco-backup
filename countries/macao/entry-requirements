This page has information on travelling to Macao.
This page reflects the UK government’s understanding of current rules for people travelling on a full ‘British Citizen’ passport from the UK, for the most common types of travel.
The authorities in Macao set and enforce entry rules. If you’re unsure how Macao’s entry requirements apply to you, contact its UK embassy, high commission or consulate.
All travellers
For information on visa requirements for entry to Macao and mainland China, see Visas section.
For up-to-date advice on entry requirements and restrictions, please visit the Macao SAR Government webpage.
Macao does not require travellers to provide a negative Covid-19 test result to enter the SAR, regardless of your vaccination status.
If you wish to travel to Mainland China within seven days of your arrival into Macao and arrived from most overseas countries (including the UK), you must provide a negative nucleic acid test result for COVID-19 taken no more than 48 hours prior to departure. Further details can be found on the Macao SAR Government webpage.

Check your passport and travel documents before you travel
Passport validity
Your passport should be valid for a minimum period of 90 days beyond your stay in Macao.
Visas
Although Macao is now part of the People’s Republic of China, it remains a Special Administrative Region with its own immigration controls. You can stay in Macao for up to 6 months without a visa. If you intend to work in Macao you must get a visa before arrival. Contact the Macao Immigration Department.
Visas for mainland China
If you intend to travel to mainland China via Macao using a British passport you must get a Chinese visa before arrival at the border. Failure to do so could result in a fine and possible detention by the mainland Chinese authorities. If you’re entering Macao via mainland China and leaving again via the mainland you’ll need to have a double or multiple entry visa to re-enter mainland China.
There are reports of greater scrutiny from mainland authorities at border crossings into Macao at this time, including checks on travellers’ electronic devices.
