The Foreign, Commonwealth & Development Office (FCDO) advise against all travel to:
the breakaway regions of South Ossetia and Abkhazia

The FCDO advises against all but essential travel to:
the remainder of Georgia based on the current assessment of COVID-19 risks
Travel to Georgia is subject to entry restrictions
Entry requirements for UK nationals have been eased but anyone entering Georgia who has been in the UK within the previous 14 days will continue to face mandatory 12-day quarantine
See Entry requirements for more information before you plan to travel.
Preparing for your return journey to the UK
If you’re returning to the UK from overseas, you will need to:
provide your journey and contact details before you travel
check if you need to self-isolate on your return
If your return journey to the UK transits another country, you should check whether it is subject to a travel ban or any other additional requirements. If so, contact your travel provider.
Check our advice on foreign travel during the coronavirus (COVID-19) pandemic and sign up for email alerts for this travel advice.
If you’re planning travel to Georgia, find out what you need to know about coronavirus there in the Coronavirus section.
During the COVID-19 pandemic, it is more important than ever to get travel insurance and check it provides sufficient cover. See the FCDO’s guidance on foreign travel insurance.
For information about COVID-19 vaccines, see the Coronavirus page.
The political situation in Georgia is generally calm, but political tensions are currently high and demonstrations and rallies are likely, particularly on Rustaveli Avenue in Tbilisi. A large rally has been called for 26 February, starting at 3pm from the Philharmonic Concert Hall and along Rustaveli Avenue. You should remain vigilant, stay away from any large gatherings and demonstrations and follow the advice of local authorities. See Political situation
Foreign nationals have been detained on arrival in Georgia for possession of medicines that would not normally be problematic in the UK or other countries. See Travelling with medicines
Take care when driving and if possible avoid driving at night. See Road travel
