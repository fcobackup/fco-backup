There remain commercial options to return to the UK from Bulgaria. If you live in the UK and are currently visiting Bulgaria, you’re strongly advised to return now by commercial means. Don’t run the risk of getting stranded.
UK special charter flights will only operate for priority countries where commercial flights are not possible. You should not assume that these flights will become available in countries where commercial routes are operating. Please do not contact the contracted travel management company if no flight is advertised here.
Flights
There are still some commercial flights operating between Sofia Airport and London airports. These are operated mainly by Bulgaria Air and Wizz Air. British Airways has suspended flights between 10 and 30 April. Wizz Air is advertising a limited number of flights from Varna to London. There are currently no flights departing from Plovdiv and Burgas Airports.
You will need to pay for your return travel to the UK. If departure options are available but you cannot afford the travel costs and have exhausted all other options for getting funds, you may be eligible to apply for an emergency loan from the government. This is a last resort option and you would need to repay the loan when you are back in the UK. For more information, you should contact Corporate Travel Management (CTM). CTM are a commercial partner of the FCO and are authorised to administer such loans on behalf of the FCO.
Follow British Embassy Sofia on Facebook for daily updates on upcoming flights.
Travelling to the airport
Bulgarian authorities have established checkpoints at the entrances to and exits from regional cities for the purposes of conducting checks concerning citizens’ reasons for travelling.
Persons are allowed through the checkpoints only where travel cannot be postponed due to a person’s professional obligations, health considerations, or to return to one’s current or permanent address (including onward travel to the UK).
To pass through checkpoints, you need to present a declaration in Bulgarian stating the reason for your travel, along with any accompanying documents (such an onward travel ticket).You can find the declaration that needs to be filled out for travel between cities, including if you are travelling to Sofia to catch a flight, here.
Road
Restrictions apply at many European land borders, including with Bulgaria, which affect road and rail travel. You should check the travel advice for any countries through which you are considering travel before you depart.
Arrival in the UK
When you arrive back in the UK, follow the guidance for when you return to the UK on steps you should take to protect yourself and others.
