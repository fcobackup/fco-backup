Healthcare in Côte d’Ivoire
Medical facilities in Abidjan are of a reasonable standard but can be expensive. Emergency facilities are limited to a few major hospitals. Outside of Abidjan medical facilities are rudimentary.
Serious medical treatment could require medical evacuation back to the UK. Make sure you have adequate travel health insurance and funds to cover the cost of any medical treatment and repatriation.
