Public spaces and services
The Slovak Government has imposed restrictions on public life to counter the spread of COVID-19 and is introducing a programme of nationwide testing and restrictions on travel within Slovakia.
Facemasks must be worn outdoors in all built-up areas, such as towns and villages. The wearing of facemasks remains compulsory indoors, including on public transport and in shops. Masks are not required in the countryside if you are with others from the same household or can maintain a five-metre distance.
Local public transport is running, but face masks are compulsory.
Hotels and guest houses are permitted to remain open, but may close or have reduced or cancelled services in order to comply with nationwide travel restrictions, social distancing and hygiene requirements.
Restaurants, bars and cafés may only operate a takeaway service.
Fitness centres, wellness centres, swimming pools, water parks, saunas, cinemas and theatres are closed.
The number of people in shops is restricted and temperature checks will be carried out at the entrances. You must maintain a two metre distance when queuing.
Supermarkets and chemists have reserved shopping hours between 9am and 11am for those over 65.
From Saturday 24 October to Sunday 1 November, there will be a general ban on people’s movement outside their home or accommodation. There are a number of exemptions, including:
You may travel across Slovakia in order to return to your place of residence until Sunday 25 October. After that date, you may only travel outside your residential district under one of the exemptions below.
Travelling between the hours of 1 am and 5 am
Travelling to work
Travelling to take a coronavirus test
Buying food and toiletries at your nearest shop
Visiting a doctor or a pharmacy
Accompanying children to school
Going to the post office, bank, or taking your car for a service
For a wedding or christening ceremony, or the funeral of a close friend or relative
Travel to care for relatives or close friends that are vulnerable or unwell
Going for a recreational walk in the countryside (away from built up areas), but only within your residential district.
Dog walking is limited to within 100 metres of your home.
Over the weekends of 30 October to 1 November and again from 6 November to 8 November, the authorities are asking everyone aged 10 to 65, including foreign residents and visitors, to take part in both of two rounds of nationwide coronavirus testing. Those aged over 65 who rarely leave the house need not take part. Taking the test is voluntary, but those choosing not to take part should self-isolate. The rules beyond 1 November have yet to be published, but the expectation is that heavy fines may be imposed for those leaving their home after 1 November if they cannot show a negative test result when asked by the authorities, unless one of the exemptions applies. Stricter measures are in place for three specific districts in the Orava region (Namestovo, Dolny Kubin, Tvrdosin) and the district of Bardejov, where a pilot phase of mass testing is taking place between 23 and 25 October.
