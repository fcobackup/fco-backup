The Government of Armenia declared a State of Emergency, initially from 16 March to 14 April. This has since been extended to 14 May.
On 4 May the Government of Armenia lifted a number of the nationwide lockdown restrictions which had been in place since 24 March. Individual shops, outdoor restaurants/cafes and manufacturing industries are now able to operate, with restrictions governing social distancing. Schools, universities, shopping centres and public transport remain closed. Individuals are no longer required to carry a passport and complete a movement authority form when walking or travelling. You should follow the advice of the Armenian authorities on permitted activities.
Entry and borders
The Armenian authorities have introduced severe restrictions on people entering the country. The majority of foreign nationals are not currently able to enter Armenia. This ban on entry applies to UK citizens.
Travellers who are able to enter Armenia will be subject to health screening measures on arrival which may include self-isolation, quarantine or hospitalisation.
On 24 February the Armenian authorities announced that the Meghri border crossing with Iran would be closed and scheduled flights between Armenia and Iran would be suspended, other than for Armenian and Iranian citizens to be returned to their respective countries.
With effect from 14 March, the borders between Armenia and Georgia will be closed for the movement of people, other than for the return of the citizens of each country to their country of origin. This does not apply to the movement of goods. Both borders currently remain closed.
Local measures
The Armenian authorities have also introduced a number of other emergency measures and restrictions, including a ban on public gatherings. You should follow the advice of local authorities.
