Coronavirus travel health
Check the latest information on risk from COVID-19 for Taiwan on the TravelHealthPro website
See the TravelHealthPro website for further advice on travel abroad and reducing spread of respiratory viruses during the COVID-19 pandemic.
When COVID levels in Taiwan were very low, every positive case was hospitalised, even in asymptomatic cases. Following the recent spike in cases, the approach is to hospitalise serious cases and admit less serious, including asymptomatic cases, into central quarantine facilities.
Entry and borders
See Entry requirements to find out what you will need to do when you arrive in Taiwan.
Public spaces and services
Taiwan’s Central Epidemic Command Center (CECC) has announced that from 19 May 2021, the COVID-19 alert has been raised to Level 3 across Taiwan.
A Level 3 alert means the following measures are now in place:

Indoor gatherings limited to five people, outdoor gatherings limited to 10 people
Completing contact tracing procedures when entering restaurants, shops and some public places
Some places of business and public venues are closed, with the exception of essential services, police departments, hospitals, and government buildings. The authorities have said that work places and schools will continue to operate as long as pandemic plans are in place, and flexible working is being encouraged
Masks and social distancing required at all businesses or venues that remain open
In areas where community transmission has taken place, residents are restricted to a set perimeter and must submit to COVID-19 testing
Further information is available on Taiwan’s Centres for Diseases Control website
Those who do not wear a face mask as required in Taiwan face fines of up to NT$15,000.
Travel in Taiwan
Although there is no lockdown in place, the authorities are encouraging people to limit travel between cities and regions to reduce the risk of COVID spread.
Travelling to and from the airport
On arrival in Taiwan, you will be required to take an allocated taxi to your designated quarantine destination. For more information about self-isolation see Entry requirements.
Taxis and public transport systems are operating normally in Taiwan. The wearing of face masks is mandatory on all public transport. If you use public transport and are not wearing a face mask, you may be fined up to NT$15,000.
Accommodation
From 10 April 2021, all passengers arriving directly from the UK, or those who have been in the UK in the previous 14 days, will no longer be required to complete their mandatory 14 day quarantine at a designated quarantine centre in Taiwan. These travellers instead will be permitted to complete their 14 day quarantine at either a designated quarantine hotel, or follow the one person per residence requirement to complete the mandatory quarantine period at their residential property.
Effective from 22 June 2021, all international passengers will be required to undergo a COVID-19 PCR test one day before the end of their mandatory 14 day quarantine. The cost of this test will be covered by the local authorities.
See Entry requirements for more information.
For a list of designated quarantine hotels in Taipei, please visit Taipei City Government’s FAQ page. If you are planning to stay in a hotel outside of Taipei, you may need to contact the local authority in that area prior to booking or making final arrangements. For more information and contact details, please visit the Taiwan Tourism Bureau’s ‘Taiwan Stay’ website.
If you have access to private accommodation in Taiwan, you may choose to self-isolate there rather than in a hotel. You should confirm that you will be permitted to self-isolate in your preferred accommodation before travelling.
Healthcare in Taiwan
If you are in Taiwan and believe you may have been exposed to or may have contracted coronavirus, your first point of contact should be the Taiwan Centers for Disease Control (CDC) helpline which is 1922.

COVID-19 vaccines if you live in Taiwan
Wherever possible British nationals should aim to be vaccinated in the country where they live. As further information is available about the national vaccination programme, this page will be updated. Sign up to get email notifications.
The Taiwanese authorities have announced the first stages of their COVID-19 vaccine roll-out programme. This includes 10 priority groups and lists the criteria and requirements for each. The local authorities have confirmed that all individuals, regardless of nationality, will be eligible to receive a vaccine providing they meet the requirements set out by the Central Epidemic Command Centre (CECC). Visit the Taiwan Centers for Disease Control website for further information.
In light of the increase of locally transmitted COVID-19 cases in Taiwan, the local authorities have announced that reservations for self-paid coronavirus vaccinations for overseas travel purposes, have been suspended until further notice. However, any individuals who received their first COVID-19 vaccination in the self-paid programme between 22 March 2021 and 11 April 2021, will be able to receive their second vaccine dose after 10 to 12 weeks.
The Medicines and Healthcare Products Regulatory Agency (MHRA) is the UK authority responsible for assessing the safety, quality and efficacy of vaccines. It has authorised the Pfizer/BioNTech, Oxford/AstraZeneca, Moderna and Janssen (Johnson and Johnson) vaccines for temporary supply and use in the UK. Find out more about MHRA approval for these vaccines.
British nationals living overseas should seek medical advice from their local healthcare provider in the country where they reside. Information about vaccines used in other national programmes, including regulatory status, should be available from the local authorities. This list of Stringent Regulatory Authorities recognised by the World Health Organisation may also be a useful source of additional information. Find out more information about the COVID-19 vaccines on the World Health Organization COVID-19 vaccines page.
