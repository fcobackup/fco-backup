This page has information on travelling to Qatar. If you are looking to enter Qatar between 1 November and 23 December 2022, check Qatar World Cup 2022 for specific entry requirements.
This page reflects the UK government’s understanding of current rules for people travelling on a full ‘British Citizen’ passport from the UK, for the most common types of travel.
The authorities in Qatar set and enforce entry rules. If you’re unsure how Qatar’s entry requirements apply to you, contact its UK embassy, high commission or consulate.
All travellers
The requirements for entering Qatar can be found on the Ministry of Public Health website, along with full details of Qatar’s travel and return policy.
World Cup
There are different entry requirements if you plan to enter during the World Cup from 1 November to 23 December.
If you are a non-GCC national or resident, you will need to hold a Hayya Card if you plan to enter Qatar from 1 November to 23 December, even if not intending to attend a World Cup match. You will be able to use your Hayya Card for multiple entries to Qatar during this period and once entered, you will be permitted to remain in the country until 23 January 2023.
From 6 December 2022, GCC nationals and residents will no longer require a Hayya Card to enter Qatar, but a valid Hayya Card will remain mandatory to attend a World Cup match.
See Qatar World Cup 2022, and the Hayya website for the latest information.
COVID-19
Visitors are not currently required to take a pre-departure PCR or Rapid Antigen test before travelling to Qatar. You will also not be required to pre-register on the Ehteraz health application prior to arrival.
However, entry into all public and private healthcare facilities still requires you to present the healthcare status on the Ehteraz app. Visitors may wish to download the Ehteraz app and activate it on arrival in the event they should require access to healthcare facilities. Changes to Qatar’s entry requirements do occur, please continue to check the Ministry of Public Health website for updates.
You may be required to pass through thermal screening or temperature checks on arrival into Qatar at air, land or sea ports.

If you’re transiting through Qatar
Transiting is when you pass through one country on the way to your final destination.
Transiting through Qatar is permitted for travellers who meet the requirements of their final destination country.
There are no additional requirements for transiting passengers, even if you choose to use the transit hotel within the airport.
Travellers cannot remain in the transit area for more than 24 hours between flights, regardless of whether you are using the transit hotel within the airport.
Further information about transiting through Qatar can be found on the webpage for Hamad International Airport.
Check your passport and travel documents before you travel
Check with your travel provider to make sure your passport and other travel documents meet their requirements.
Passport validity
If you are visiting Qatar your passport should be valid for a minimum of 6 months from the date you arrive.
If you are a resident of Qatar your passport must be valid on arrival.
Visas
You can get a free 30-day tourist visa-waiver on arrival in Qatar if you’re travelling on a full British Citizen passport. If you’re travelling for any purpose other than tourism, and/or hold one of the other types of British passport, you must get a visa before you travel.
If you need to stay longer than 30 days, you must extend your visa waiver before it expires through the Ministry of Interior. If you fail to do so, you may receive an overstay fine, which must be paid before leaving Qatar.
You can find further information on visa requirements and extensions on the Qatar Ministry of Interior website
UK Emergency Travel Documents
UK Emergency Travel Documents (ETDs) are not valid for entry into Qatar. However, ETDs are accepted for airside transit and exit from Qatar. If you are seeking to exit Qatar on an ETD because your full validity passport has been lost or stolen, you must obtain a police report in order to do so. These reports can be obtained at any police station in Qatar. You should allow sufficient time to collect this report as they can take up to 2 days to be processed. Without this report you may experience difficulties at the airport. If the holder of the ETD is a new-born child with no previous passport or identification, an exit permit is required before exiting Qatar. These can be obtained from the Immigration Office in Al Gharrafa. If your destination is not the UK you will need proof of residency for your destination country. An emergency travel document does not grant you entry. You are responsible for checking you have the correct documents to enter your destination country.
Living and working in Qatar
If you’re applying for a residence permit, you will have to undergo a medical test including blood tests and a chest X-ray. The tests screen for diseases including, but not restricted to, HIV/AIDS, Tuberculosis, Hepatitis B and C. Testing positive may lead to further tests and possible deportation.
