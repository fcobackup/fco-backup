Earthquakes
Earthquakes are a potential threat and tremors are felt occasionally in the Caribbean. In the event of an earthquake, you should be directed by the local authorities. To learn more about what to do before, during and after an earthquake, visit the website of the US Federal Emergency Management Agency.
Volcanoes
The SVG Prime Minister reported on 29 December 2020 that La Soufriere volcano on St Vincent was in an active state of effusive eruption.
During the morning of 9 April 2021, there were several explosive eruptions of La Soufriere and an ash plume 6km high. Such activity continued until 22 April, when the last explosive eruption occurred. On 2 December 2021, it was reported that the eruptive phase had ended.
British Nationals should continue to heed the advice of local authorities.
You should monitor the alert level of the underwater volcano ‘Kick’em Jenny’, located 5 miles off the coast of Grenada. Observe any maritime exclusion zones and follow the advice of the local authorities in the event of increased activity or an eruption.
