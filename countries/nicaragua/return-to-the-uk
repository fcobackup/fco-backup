There are currently no commercial options available to return to the UK from Nicaragua. Aeromexico have recently cancelled a number of flights. Their last flight to leave Nicaragua was on 9 April.
We know this is concerning for British people trying to leave Nicaragua. The British Embassy is working with the Nicaraguan authorities and commercial airlines on all possible options for a return to the UK for British nationals in Nicaragua.

To enable us to respond quickly to those trying to get home or who are affected by COVID-19, use our Embassy’s email address (based in Costa Rica): Consular.CostaRica@fco.gov.uk. When doing so, you should provide your full name, contact details, location and description of the situation. A member of our consular team will reach out to you.
If you cannot leave Nicaragua at this time, you should:
follow the advice of local authorities, including local measures to help minimise your risk of exposure to coronavirus
find accommodation that’s suitable for your needs.
keep in regular contact with family and friends at home, so they know you are safe and well
contact your airline, tour operator and travel insurance to see what help they can provide.
