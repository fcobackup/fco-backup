This page reflects the UK government’s understanding of current rules for people travelling on a full ‘British Citizen’ passport, for the most common types of travel.
The authorities in Uruguay set and enforce entry rules. For further information contact the embassy, high commission or consulate of the country or territory you’re travelling to. You should also consider checking with your transport provider or travel company to make sure your passport and other travel documents meet their requirements.
Restrictions in response to coronavirus
Entry to Uruguay
As of 1 November 2021 Uruguay will open its borders to foreign nationals who have been fully vaccinated no more than 9 months before entry. Unvaccinated foreign nationals are not currently permitted to travel to the country.
Visitors aged 18 and over:
Must present a negative COVID-19 PCR test taken within 72 hours of travelling
Must present proof of COVID-19 vaccinations (15 days must have passed since the last dose was administered).
Must fill out the health declaration form within 48 hours of travelling online or through the Coronavirus UY Android or IOS app.
Must have medical cover in Uruguay or travel insurance. It is advisable that your insurance covers any expenses due to coronavirus related illness, quarantine or self-isolation for the duration of your stay.
Should take a COVID-19 PCR test (at your own expense) on day 7 from when you took the pre-flight test during which time you do not need to self-isolate. If you choose not to take the PCR test on day 7 you are required to self-isolate for 14 days immediately upon arrival.
The following are exempt from all or part of the above:
Visitors aged 6 or under do not require any of the above documents.
Visitors aged 6-18 require all of the above documents excluding the vaccination certificate.
Visitors who have had coronavirus within the last 90 days (from date of last positive test) and not less than 20 days before date of boarding, do not have to do a PCR test, but must upload proof of positive PCR or antigen test to the online health declaration form.
If you present coronavirus symptoms you have been asked to request home health care and not visit health centres and hospitals. Further information is also available from the Uruguayan Ministry of Health (in Spanish). If you contract or come into contact with a person in Uruguay who tests positive for coronavirus, you must self-isolate immediately and seek medical advice.
If you require a PCR or antigen test in Uruguay, there are companies who offer home visits or drive-through tests and normally return the results between 24-72 hours. You will have to pay for the test if it has not been ordered by a health professional. The British government does not endorse or recommend any of these services.
