This page reflects the UK government’s understanding of current rules for people travelling on a full ‘British Citizen’ passport, for the most common types of travel.
The authorities in Brazil set and enforce entry rules. For further information contact the embassy, high commission or consulate of the country or territory you’re travelling to. You should also consider checking with your transport provider or travel company to make sure your passport and other travel documents meet their requirements.
Entry rules in response to coronavirus
Entry to Brazil
Entry by air
The Brazilian Government has removed the temporary suspension on entry to the country from travellers who have been physically present in the UK in the past 14 days. British and foreign nationals can now enter the country on direct (UK-Brazil) flights or by transiting through third countries, subject to regular entry requirements.
Anyone travelling to Brazil by air must present documentary evidence of a negative PCR test for COVID-19 taken within 72 hours of boarding or a negative antigen test taken within 24 hours of boarding in English, Spanish or Portuguese to their airline at check-in. From 18 December 2021, anyone travelling to Brazil by air or land will need to show proof of full vaccination with any COVID-19 vaccine approved by the World Health Organization’s Emergency Use Listing (WHO).
Brazil will accept the UK’s proof of COVID-19 recovery and vaccination record and proof of COVID-19 vaccination issued in the Crown Dependencies, as these are in line with the Brazilian government guidelines for certification. Your final vaccine dose must have been administered at least 14 days prior to travel. Your NHS appointment card from vaccination centres is not designed to be used as proof of vaccination and should not be used to demonstrate your vaccine status.
Unvaccinated travellers, or travellers without proof of vaccination, will not be allowed access to Brazil unless they meet the criteria set out in the decree - in this case, they will also be required to undergo quarantine for 14 days. Children aged 12 or younger do not need to provide proof of vaccination.
All travellers to Brazil are currently required to complete a Travelers Health Declaration form within 24 hours of boarding. This can be done online. The English version is available here.
All entry to Brazil is currently prohibited for all non-resident foreign nationals who have been in South Africa, Eswatini, Lesotho, Namibia, Botswana and Zimbabwe during the last 14 days.
Brazilian and resident foreign nationals, who have been in the above countries during the last 14 days, are allowed to enter Brazil. However, they have to comply with a 14 day quarantine period.
Further information is available on the website of Brazil’s Consulate General.
Entry by land
Brazil has re-opened all of its land boarders. For entry by land, travellers are required to present evidence of a negative PCR or Antigen test, as well as proof of full COVID-19 vaccination. However, unlike the requirements for those arriving by air, foreign travellers arriving by land without proof of vaccination are only permitted entry if they are seeking to transit through Brazil to their country of ordinary residence.
Transiting: If you are in a bordering country and need to cross the land border to board a flight back to your country of residence, you should get in touch with the British Embassy or Consulate. You will be permitted to enter Brazil with authorisation from the Federal Police following an official request from the Embassy and on presentation of flight tickets. You should travel straight to the airport once in Brazil.
Sea ports
Following a recommendation from the Brazilian National Health Surveillance Agency (ANVISA), the Brazilian Government has temporarily suspended domestic cruise ships from operating along the Brazilian coast. Given the fluid coronavirus situation globally, such cruises are likely to remain subject to disruption at short notice throughout 2022.
The Brazilian government continues to suspend the entry of all international cruise ships and prohibits most foreigners from disembarking at any port or other maritime location in Brazil regardless of nationality. These restrictions do not apply to resident foreigners and foreign spouses, children, parents or custodians of a Brazilian national.
Disembarkation will only be permitted when medical assistance is required or to catch a connecting flight back to the passenger’s country of residence.
Transiting Brazil
Passengers are allowed to freely transit as long as they do not leave the international airport area and have a ticket for onward travel. If you intend to transit by land, please read Entry by land.
Visas
From 3 November 2020, the Brazilian government resumed counting visitor length of stay. They had previously suspended this at the start of the pandemic. Anyone whose 90 days immigration deadline would have fallen between the suspension period of 16 March 2020 to 2 November 2020 will not be fined. If your 90 days expired on 3 November 2020 or later, you might be fined for overstaying. If you wish to extend your tourist visa, you should contact the Policia Federal.
Regular entry requirements
Visas
British nationals can normally enter Brazil without a visa as a tourist. For further information about visas, see the website of the Brazilian Consulate in London.
Make sure you comply with Brazilian immigration laws on arrival in the country. You must satisfy the Federal Police (the Brazilian immigration authority) of your intended purpose of visit. You will need to be able to demonstrate that you have enough money for the duration of your stay, and provide details of your accommodation and evidence of return or onward travel. Make sure your passport is stamped. If it is not, you may be fined on departure.
If you wish to extend your stay while in Brazil, you should apply to the Federal Police for an extension. If you overstay your visa, you are likely to be given notice to leave the country at your own expense and you may be fined or deported.
Passport validity
Your passport should be valid for a minimum period of 6 months from the date of entry into Brazil.
Dual nationality
The Brazilian immigration authorities often require dual British/Brazilian nationals visiting Brazil to travel on Brazilian (rather than British) passports.  
Travelling with children
There are additional requirements for British-Brazilian dual nationals under 18 entering or transiting through Brazil without their parents or legal guardian, or travelling with one parent only. These requirements don’t usually apply to foreign nationals, but as a precaution and to avoid any possible delays, British nationals under 18 entering or transiting through Brazil without their parents or legal guardian, or travelling with one parent only, are advised to bring a letter of authorisation to travel from any parent(s) not travelling. This applies particularly to children with a Brazilian parent, even if the child only holds a British passport. Contact the Brazilian Consulate in London for more information and advice.
Yellow fever certificate requirements
Check whether you need a yellow fever certificate by visiting the National Travel Health Network and Centre’s TravelHealthPro website.
UK Emergency Travel Documents
UK Emergency travel documents (ETDs) are accepted for entry, airside transit and exit from Brazil. Your ETD must be valid for a minimum period of 6 months from the date of entry into Brazil.
