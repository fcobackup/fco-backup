Credit cards are widely accepted in most major towns. UK cash cards can be used in most ATMs in Montevideo and Punta del Este, but there may be a charge for taking money out.
The Uruguayan Ministry of Tourism & Sport has introduced a series of tax benefits for tourists who pay for certain items (eg eating out, car hire) using a foreign credit card. You can find more details on the Tourism Ministry website.
