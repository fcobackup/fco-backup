St Lucia’s border re-opened on 4 June.
Testing and Quarantine requirements on arrival
You must complete a Pre-Arrival registration form prior to arrival to St Lucia which can be found on the St Lucia COVID-19 page. Visitors must fill out details including proof of negative PCR testing and indicate which COVID-19 Certified hotel they will be staying in.
Pre-testing prior to travel is now mandatory. Visitors must provide certified proof of a negative PCR (Polymerized Chain Reaction) COVID-19 test taken seven days or less before travel to St Lucia, effective from July 9 unless they are arriving from countries in the Travel Bubble designated by the Government of St Lucia.
Visitors travelling from destinations that have zero or a low instance of COVID-19 cases will be exempt from the seven-day pre-testing requirement. These destinations currently include Antigua, Barbuda, Aruba, Anguilla, Bahamas, Barbados, Bermuda, Bonaire, British Virgin Islands, Curaçao, Dominica, Grenada, Guyana, Jamaica, Montserrat, Saint Barthelemy, Saint Kitts and Nevis, Saint Martin, Saint Vincent and the Grenadines, Saint Martin, Trinidad and Tobago and Turks and Caicos. Visitors with a travel history from these areas in the last 14 days will also be exempt from quarantine.
All arriving passengers will be screened, including temperature checks, at the airport. Passengers arriving with proof of a negative PCR (Polymerized Chain Reaction) test may be exempt from on-island testing and advance through immigration, baggage claim, customs and arrivals for transportation to their COVID-19 certified hotel, pre-approved home quarantine facility or Government Operated Quarantine Facility. Anyone arriving without proof of a negative PCR test will be subject to immediate isolation and testing at their own cost. It is recommended that visitors check their local government websites to identify PCR testing locations. You will need to check with an accredited private healthcare provider in the UK for PCR testing options.
Quarantine requirement
On arrival, you are required to quarantine for 14 days at a pre-approved home quarantine address, Government operated quarantine facility or a COVID-19 certified property.
Any symptomatic passengers will be isolated and tested. All visitors will be required to remain in quarantine/isolation at your hotel or Government Operated Quarantine Facility until the test result is obtained. If the test is positive visitors will be transferred to a treatment facility until they receive two negative test results and are clinically stable.
