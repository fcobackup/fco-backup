The information on this page covers the most common types of travel and reflects the UK government’s understanding of the rules currently in place. Unless otherwise stated, this information is for travellers using a full ‘British Citizen’ passport.
The authorities in the country or territory you’re travelling to are responsible for setting and enforcing the rules for entry. If you’re unclear about any aspect of the entry requirements, or you need further reassurance, you’ll need to contact the embassy, high commission or consulate of the country or territory you’re travelling to.
You should also consider checking with your transport provider or travel company to make sure your passport and other travel documents meet their requirements.
Visas
You can visit Ecuador without a visa, but you may be asked about your reason for travel and to provide evidence of a return or onward flight/bus ticket when you arrive. On arrival in the country, you’ll normally be allowed to remain in Ecuador for up to 90 days per year. If you’re planning to stay for longer, you should apply for a visa from an Ecuadorean Embassy in London (or from another Ecuadorean embassy overseas) before you travel. You may be able to extend your 90 days with the immigration authorities. Likewise, you may be able to apply for a visa at the Ecuadorean Ministry of Foreign Affairs and Human Mobility before the 90 days expires.
As of February 2018, in principle all tourists will be required to hold a valid health insurance policy.
If you wish to work or study in Ecuador, check visa requirements with the Ecuadorean Embassy in London before travelling.
If you enter Ecuador via the border with Peru or Colombia you must insist on being given an entry stamp at the border showing the date of your arrival. There have been cases of buses not stopping at the border, which has caused great difficulties for foreign visitors who may need to return to the border entry point to get the required stamp.
Foreign visitors who overstay will be deported. An overstaying fine is due to be reinstated in early 2018. In principle, you will not be able to return to Ecuador for 9 months and your name could remain on immigration records. The relevant local regulation is still under consideration.
Passport validity
Your passport should be valid for a minimum period of 6 months from the date of entry; this is a strict legal requirement from the Ecuadorean government. Without this minimum validity entry to the country will be denied.
UK Emergency Travel Documents
UK Emergency Travel Documents (ETD) are also accepted for entry, airside transit and exit from Ecuador. Your emergency travel document must be valid for a minimum period of 6 months from the date of entry into Ecuador.
