Warning
FCDO advises against all travel to Haiti.

Terrorism
There is a high threat of terrorist attack globally affecting UK interests and British nationals, including from groups and individuals who view the UK and British nationals as targets. Stay aware of your surroundings at all times.
UK Counter Terrorism Policing has information and advice on staying safe abroad and what to do in the event of a terrorist attack. Find out how to reduce your risk from terrorism while abroad.
Terrorism in Haiti
Although there’s no recent history of terrorism in Haiti, attacks cannot be ruled out.
Haiti-Dominican Republic border closure
The border between Haiti and the Dominican Republic is closed to travellers. The status of the border remains subject to change at short notice. Monitor local media for updates.
Political situation
There are sometimes violent demonstrations, protests and roadblocks. Stay away from political rallies and crowds. Public transport is often disrupted because of blocked roads and security incidents, which can lead to fuel and food shortages.
Crime
If you choose to travel to or stay in Haiti against FCDO advice, check local media and make sure you have contingency plans in place. Be vigilant at all times, tell family and friends about your travel plans and carefully consider your movements in advance, taking the safest routes available.
The security situation is unpredictable and crime levels are high. There is usually an increase in crime leading up to the:
holiday season in December
Carnival (in February or March)
beginning of the school year (late August/early September)
Criminal and gang activity
Theft, including armed robbery, purse snatching and pickpocketing, is common in Haiti. Criminal and gang activity is especially common in:
Bel Air
Carrefour
Cité Soleil
downtown Port-au-Prince
Martissant
Petion-Ville
People using cash machines have been targeted by criminals. Gangs, often on motorbikes, target people making withdrawals or leaving banks, particularly those travelling on foot. Take care when withdrawing money at public ATMs and use supermarkets or hotels with security guards.  
Armed robbery is common. Victims are often attacked in the daytime by armed thieves on motorcycles. Some attacks have resulted in fatalities. Single women drivers in traffic have been targeted.
Criminal kidnaps
There is a high threat of criminal kidnaps in Haiti. Incidents of criminal kidnap can occur in any part of the country, at any time.
Criminal groups often use firearms and extreme violence to kidnap victims. Kidnappers regularly target vehicles, using other vehicles or improvised barriers to stop traffic and snatch individuals at gunpoint. Public and mass transit services are targeted in addition to private vehicles. These can be both opportunistic or targeted towards specific individuals.  
There is a high threat particularly throughout the metropolitan area of Port-au-Prince and across major road routes entering/leaving the city.
Criminal groups may target whole communities or individuals, including children. Missionary and humanitarian aid workers are viewed as legitimate targets. If you’re kidnapped, the reason for your presence is unlikely to protect you or secure your safe release.
Most victims have been released after the payment of a ransom. In some exceptional cases, however, victims have disappeared or been killed.
Be alert to the threat of kidnap and pay attention to local government announcements and media reporting. Be vigilant across the country, remaining alert to small groups, especially near where you’re staying.
Keep doors and windows secure at all times and be wary of inviting anyone into your residence who you do not know or were not expecting. Security guards are recommended at residential properties.
Laws and cultural differences
Illegal drugs and prison sentences
Penalties for possession, use or trafficking of illegal drugs are severe. Convicted offenders can expect lengthy legal proceedings, jail sentences and fines.
Pack all luggage yourself and do not carry items through customs for anyone else.
If you’re caught in possession of drugs or suspected of drug trafficking, you may be arrested and jailed for weeks or months before appearing in court. Prison conditions in Haiti are very poor.
Personal ID
You should always carry proof of your identity. Keep a copy of the photo page of your passport and visa stamp separately in a safe place.
LGBT+
Local attitudes towards the LGBT+ community are mostly conservative throughout the Caribbean. In Haiti, same-sex sexual activity is legal. However, the attitude of many Haitians to the LGBT+ community is hostile.
LGBT+ travellers should be mindful of local attitudes and be aware that showing affection in public could result in unwanted and negative attention.
It is uncommon for opposite or same-sex couples to show affection in public.
Read more advice for LGBT+ travellers.
Transport risks
Road travel
Road travel is highly dangerous. Armed carjacking is common and criminal groups often use improvised road blocks to extort or kidnap motorists.
If you are planning to drive a hire car or a UK vehicle, see information on driving abroad.
You can use a UK photocard driving licence to drive in Haiti for up to 90 days. If you still have a paper driving licence, you may need to update it to a photocard licence or get the correct version of the international driving permit (IDP).
After 90 days you’ll need an IDP.  
Extreme weather and natural disasters
Basic services such as transport and communications are likely to be severely disrupted if a major disaster happens.
Flash floods and landslides happen regularly.
Hurricanes
The Atlantic hurricane season runs from June to November. During this period, tropical storms can quickly develop into major hurricanes. Monitor local and international weather updates from the National Hurricane Center and follow the advice of local authorities, including any evacuation orders.
See extreme weather and natural hazards for information about how to prepare, and what to do if there is a warning of a hurricane.
Earthquakes
Earthquakes are a risk in Haiti. The US Federal Emergency Management Agency website has advice about what to do before, during and after an earthquake.
There is a risk of tsunamis if a major earthquake happens close to shore, follow the instructions of the local authorities.
