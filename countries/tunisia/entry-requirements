This page reflects the UK government’s understanding of current rules for people travelling on a full ‘British Citizen’ passport, for the most common types of travel.
The authorities in Tunisia set and enforce entry rules. For further information contact the embassy, high commission or consulate of the country or territory you’re travelling to. You should also consider checking with your transport provider or travel company to make sure your passport and other travel documents meet their requirements.
Entry rules in response to coronavirus (COVID-19)
Entry to Tunisia
Travellers from all countries into Tunisia must take a PCR test less than 72 hours before travel and carry dated evidence of a negative result.
From 25 August, if you are not fully vaccinated you are required to enter mandatory quarantine in a government-approved hotel for ten days on arrival in Tunisia. A list of approved hotels is below:

You are exempt from the requirement to enter mandatory quarantine if you can present official evidence to prove you have been fully vaccinated, but you must self-isolate at home for ten days. Proof of vaccination must be issued from the national health authority of your country of residence (evidence from the NHS will be accepted).
Children under the age of 18 who are unaccompanied or who are travelling with vaccinated adults are permitted to self-isolate at home, rather than in mandatory quarantine.
You are exempt from the requirement to self-isolate if you are travelling on an inclusive holiday with a tour operator. You must provide evidence of your booking and a negative Coronavirus PCR test taken less than 72 hours before your travel to Tunisia. You must follow all instructions from your tour operator to reduce the spread of Coronavirus, which are set by the Tunisian authorities. You must stay with your tour group at all times, including transportation and accommodation.
Testing on arrival
Travellers from all countries need to provide evidence of having taken a coronavirus PCR test that is negative less than 72 hours before your travel to Tunisia. You should arrange to take a test and ensure the certificate is dated.
See Entry to Tunisia for full entry requirements.
Data collection
You must complete this Tunisian government short online questionnaire before travelling.
On arrival in Tunisia, you must also share your contact details and travel information with authorities.
Testing on departure
No testing is available at the airport or sea ports. Passengers travelling from Tunisia, who require a test for the country they are travelling to, should arrange a private test.
There have been some reports of travellers from Tunisia being denied entry to a third country, on suspicion of carrying fake PCR test results. This may affect you if you are transiting in one country before onward travel to the UK.
For verification, travellers are advised to carry the original copy of their negative PCR test result, and ensure this has been signed and stamped by the laboratory, before travelling. A QR code on digital test results, if provided by the laboratory, can also be presented to verify the result.
Transiting Tunisia
A small number of transit flights are operating through Tunisia. If you are transiting through Tunisia, you must comply with sanitary measures and temperature checks.
Regular entry requirements
Visas
British passport holders don’t need a visa for visits of up to three months. On arrival, security checks are sometimes carried out on British passport holders who were not born in the UK. This can take a few hours and you will need to be patient until clearance is given. These types of checks rarely take place on departure.
Overstay fines
If you stay in Tunisia for longer than the authorised period, you will have to pay a fine. This rule may not apply if you are vulnerable and current circumstances oblige you to remain in the country.
Passport validity
For stays of up to 3 months your passport should be valid for the proposed duration of your stay; you don’t need any additional period of validity on your passport beyond this.
UK Emergency Travel Documents
Tunisian authorities accept UK ETDs for entry to and exit from Tunisia. If you’re leaving Tunisia on an ETD, make sure you have a copy of the police report about the loss/theft of your full validity passport to present to the Immigration Officer.
Dual nationals
Dual British-Tunisian nationals should enter and leave Tunisia on their Tunisian passports.
