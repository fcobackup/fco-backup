The Tonga authorities have introduced a number of precautionary measures in response to the coronavirus (COVID-19) pandemic.
Travel restrictions
A State of Emergency was declared on 20 March by the Government of the Kingdom of Tonga. Effective immediately, Tongan borders have closed to entry by all foreigners.
The Government of Tonga announced on 23 March that all flights in to Tonga have been cancelled from 23-28 March.
All international cruise ships and yachts scheduled to arrive after 19 March shall not be granted entry into Tonga until further notice.
Some countries in the region have also introduced travel restrictions to and from the Pacific islands. You should check specifics for any countries that might be involved in your travel when planning a trip to and/or from Tonga.

Local measures
Medical care across Tonga is not as advanced as you would find in the UK. Access to medical services and the availability of fresh foods in Tonga could be impaired during a serious or extended Covid-19 outbreak. Due to the rapidly changing nature of the Covid-19 outbreak across the region, flight availability and entry requirements/prohibitions can change at short notice. This means your ability to leave Tonga by commercial airlines, or your ability to travel to your chosen destination could be curtailed at short notice. Our ability to provide consular services or support any evacuation in the Pacific may also be limited by these factors. You should take these limitations and risks into account when making travel plans.
