Terrorism
There is a high threat of terrorist attack globally affecting UK interests and British nationals, including from groups and individuals who view the UK and British nationals as targets. Stay aware of your surroundings at all times.
UK Counter Terrorism Policing has information and advice on staying safe abroad and what to do in the event of a terrorist attack. Find out how to reduce your risk from terrorism while abroad.
Terrorism in Turkey
Terrorists are very likely to try to carry out attacks in Turkey.
Most terrorist attacks have occurred in southeast Turkey, Ankara and Istanbul.  You should remain aware of your surroundings, keep up to date with local media reports and follow the advice of local authorities.
Attacks could be indiscriminate including in places visited by foreigners, such as:
public buildings
places of worship
airports
large public gatherings (including major events, public holidays, religious occasions)
There have been a number of recent significant attacks in Istanbul:
In February 2024, one person was killed in an armed attack on the Çağlayan courthouse by the terrorist group DHKP/C
In January 2024, one person was killed by two gunmen in the Santa Maria Catholic Church in Sariyer, in an attack claimed by Daesh
In 2022, six people were killed in an explosion in central Istanbul.
Extremist groups based in Syria, including Daesh and Al-Qaeda linked groups, have the capacity to carry out attacks in neighbouring countries, including Turkey. Daesh has previously targeted border crossings and nearby locations on the Syrian side of the border.

Political situation
Occasional demonstrations can occur in cities and may become violent. Police have used tear gas and water cannon to disperse protests.
Events in Israel and the Occupied Palestinian Territories have led to heightened tensions in the region and demonstrations are ongoing in locations across Turkey. Large demonstrations have been reported outside diplomatic missions connected to the conflict in major cities, particularly Israeli diplomatic missions in Ankara and Istanbul.
Avoid all demonstrations and leave the area if one develops. Local transport routes may be disrupted.
Crime
Street robbery and pickpocketing
Street robbery and pick-pocketing are common in the major tourist areas of Istanbul. Be aware of your personal belongings and make sure they are always secure.
Drink and food spiking
Buy your own drinks and always keep sight of them. Be wary of strangers:
approaching you to change money
taking you to a restaurant or nightclub
offering you food and drink these could be spiked
Counterfeit alcohol
In a small number of cases, counterfeit branded bottles of alcohol have caused deaths of tourists. If you have any concerns, ask for advice from your tour operator or the Turkish authorities.
Sexual assault
In 2023, 42 cases of sexual assault, including rape, were reported to British consular staff in Turkey. Most cases happened during summer holidays in coastal tourist areas. Crimes were committed at night by someone the victim met during the day, including hotel workers. There have also been sexual attacks on minors visiting toilet facilities alone. Be extra vigilant in these situations.
Vehicle safety
Accepting lifts from strangers can be dangerous. Find a registered taxi and note the registration number before entering.
Laws and cultural differences
Personal ID
It is illegal not to carry some form of photographic ID in Turkey. Always carry your passport or residence permit. In some busy areas, especially Istanbul, the authorities may stop people for ID checks. There are also several police checkpoints on main roads across Turkey. Cooperate with officials conducting checks.
Dress visiting mosques
Dress modestly if you’re visiting a mosque or a religious shrine to avoid causing offence.
Personal injury claims
There are reports of tourists being encouraged to submit a claim for personal injury if they have experienced gastric illness in Turkey. Find out what you can do if you have suffered a personal injury on the Citizens Advice website. Only make a claim if you have genuinely suffered from injury or illness. If you make a false or fraudulent claim, you may face legal proceedings in the UK or Turkey.
Smoking bans
Smoking is illegal on public transport and in all indoor workplaces and public places. Smoking is restricted in some outdoor areas where cultural, artistic, sports or entertainment activities are held.
Illegal drugs and prison sentences
Turkey has strict laws against the use, possession and trafficking of illegal drugs. You may receive a fine or prison sentence of 4 to 24 years.
Stray dogs
Most towns and cities have stray dogs. Packs congregate in parks and wastelands and can be aggressive. Take care and do not approach stray dogs. If you’re bitten, get medical advice immediately. Rabies and other animal borne diseases are present in Turkey.
Sale of antiquities
Buying or exporting antiquities is illegal. You could be fined and receive a prison sentence of 5 to 12 years. Some historical items found at local markets and in antique shops can be sold within Turkey but are illegal to export. Confirm the status of antique items before you buy them.
Using cameras
Do not take photographs of or near military or official installations. Ask for permission before photographing people.
LGBT+ travellers
Same-sex sexual activity is legal in Turkey. However, many parts of Turkey are socially conservative and showing affection in public could receive unwelcome attention. Read more advice for LGBT+ travellers.
Comments about the nation and flag
It is illegal to insult the Turkish nation, state or the national flag, or to deface Turkish currency. These laws can also apply to comments or images online wherever they were uploaded. Offences under these laws carry a penalty in Turkey of a prison sentence of between 6 months and 3 years.
Outdoor activities and adventure tourism
Extreme sports
If you do an extreme sport, check that adequate safety precautions are in place. British nationals have been injured and killed doing extreme sports. Only use reputable operators. Make sure you are given full instructions and training before your activity. Make sure your travel insurance covers you for all activities you do.
Jeep safaris
Jeep safaris can be dangerous, there were a number of reported accidents in 2023. If you join a jeep safari, make sure you use a reputable company who have adequate health and safety procedures and equipment. Always check that such activities are covered by your insurance
Quad biking and mopeds
Quad biking is an extreme sport and carries the risk of serious injury or death. You need specific travel insurance to cover quad biking. Always read the details of your insurance cover, especially the small print and exclusions on your policy.
Make sure you are given full instructions and training before your activity.
Insurance sold by the hire company usually only provides third party insurance. It’s likely you will be charged for any damage to the rental vehicle and you may face arrest if you do not pay.
If you hire a moped you need a valid driving licence with at least category A1 - ‘light motorcycle’. Make sure the vehicle is in good condition. Drivers and passengers must wear helmets. Failure to do so may invalidate your insurance. If police stop you, they will fine you and take your licence.
Water sports
Book activities at a licensed water sports centre and before you start:
make sure the paperwork is completed
ask for a safety demonstration
make sure you know how to call for help
Obey any warning signs and flags on beaches. Follow instructions from lifeguards and observe the flag indicators on beaches.
Follow local advice if jellyfish or urchins are present.
See water safety on holiday from the Royal Life Saving Society and the Royal Society for the Prevention of Accidents watersports safety abroad guide.
Transport risks
Road travel
If you are planning to drive in Turkey, see information on driving abroad. You must carry a green card in Turkey.
Take care when travelling by road, particularly at night. Approach checkpoints slowly and follow the instructions of security personnel. Roads between major cities are generally in excellent condition, but can be poor in remote, rural areas. Accidents are common and mainly due to poor or reckless driving.
It is illegal not to wear a helmet on motorcycles and mopeds. You may get a large fine if you do not wear a helmet.
Do not drink and drive. The police fine drunk drivers and your licence could be confiscated for 6 months.
Licences and documents
You need either a 1968 international driving permit (IDP) or a valid UK driving licence (notarised in Turkish) to drive in Turkey. The 1949 IDP is not accepted anymore. You cannot buy an IDP outside the UK, so get one before you travel.
If you stay in Turkey for more than six months, you must convert your UK driving licence into a Turkish licence. Provisional driving licences aren’t recognised.
If you bring a vehicle registered in another country into Turkey, observe the Turkish customs regulations.
Extreme weather and natural disasters
Wildfires
Wildfires happen frequently in Turkey during summer.

Flooding
Severe rainstorms can cause flooding and landslides across Turkey, damaging roads and bridges. Some routes may become impassable, making it difficult to travel and reducing essential services.
If you’re in an affected area:
monitor local media
follow instructions of local authorities, including evacuation orders
Earthquakes
Many parts of Turkey regularly experience earthquakes and tremors. These can be a high magnitude, cause damage to infrastructure, and pose a risk to life.
A 7.8 magnitude earthquake hit Gaziantep and neighbouring provinces in the south-east of Turkey in February 2023. Strong earthquakes may continue to affect the region and it remains heavily damaged.
Follow any advice given by the local authorities.  See the US Federal Emergency Management Agency guidance about what to do before, during and after an earthquake .
