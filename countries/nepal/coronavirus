Travel in Nepal
The Government of Nepal has announced that most of the lockdown restrictions imposed to control the Covid-19 outbreak in-country will end from midnight on 21 July, with some restrictions remaining.
This will mean an immediate lift to the internal movement restrictions that have up until now limited the number of cars that can travel at one time. Long-route public transportation will reopen on September 1, and travel between different districts will no longer require the prior approval of the Chief District Officer(s) concerned.
Accommodation
Hotels will be allowed to operate from July 31.
If you are safe where you are, stay there except for essential movements, such as for food or medical reasons, unless you are seeking to return to Kathmandu in order to leave.
If you cannot stay where you are, email the British Embassy via BEKathmandu@fco.gov.uk with details of your name, nationality, passport number and location.
Public spaces and services
Shops are beginning to open, though many will only serve customers wearing some form of face masks. Shop openings may vary by location.
People are required to maintain social distancing and wear masks in public, and there is a ban on large gatherings.
Entertainment centres such as cinema halls and dance bars, health clubs and swimming clubs, salons, beauty parlours, spas, libraries, zoos, and museums remain closed until further notice.
Permissions for mountaineering expeditions, which have up until now been suspended, will resume from July 31.
There have been reports of some incidents in parts of Nepal of foreign tourists being threatened or intimidated by locals, allegedly in relation to coronavirus. Such incidents are rare. If you experience such problems, return immediately to your accommodation (if safe), or to the local law enforcement agencies (phone 100), or contact the British Embassy at +977 (0)1 423 7100.
Healthcare in Nepal
If you need medical attention and/or if you think you have any symptoms of COVID such as a fever or persistent cough please avoid contact with others if possible and go to a medical facility. For those who have health insurance cover, or are willing to pay then Mediciti and Norvic Hospitals can isolate and take a test to be sent to the national laboratory. Otherwise, go to Patan Hospital.
Make sure you have sufficient medicine, if required. The British Embassy has a list of pharmacies and hospitals that dispense in Kathmandu.
For contact details for English speaking doctors visit our list of healthcare providers.
Testing and isolation for COVID-19 is limited to certain Government hospitals, where services are basic. View Health for further details on healthcare in Nepal.
