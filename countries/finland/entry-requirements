The information on this page covers the most common types of travel and reflects the UK government’s understanding of the rules currently in place. Unless otherwise stated, this information is for travellers using a full ‘British Citizen’ passport.
The authorities in the country or territory you’re travelling to are responsible for setting and enforcing the rules for entry. If you’re unclear about any aspect of the entry requirements, or you need further reassurance, you’ll need to contact the embassy, high commission or consulate of the country or territory you’re travelling to.
You should also consider checking with your transport provider or travel company to make sure your passport and other travel documents meet their requirements.
Entry rules in response to coronavirus (COVID-19)
Entry to Finland
Finnish borders remain closed to non-resident foreign nationals entering the country, with some exemptions. Border controls have been lifted for travel between Finland and a number of different countries and there is currently no requirement to self-isolate when entering Finland from these countries (see the Finnish Border Guard website for the current list). The restrictions on travel continue to be in force for travel between Finland and the United Kingdom and are reviewed periodically. Visit the Finnish Border Guard website for more information.
British residents should display an ID card or other proof of residence when arriving in Finland.
Non-resident British nationals are permitted to enter Finland for limited essential or compassionate reasons with evidence for their travel. See the Finnish Border Guard website for more information.
Quarantine requirements
When arriving in Finland, you must avoid unnecessary close contact with others and self-isolate for a period of 14 days.
Transiting Finland
There are no Finnish restrictions on cross-border traffic with other states in the Schengen area for commuter and other essential traffic. Restrictions for other travellers remain in place. See the Finnish Border Guard website for more information.
Passengers are allowed to transit through Helsinki Airport as long as they can verify acceptance at their final destination. Finavia strongly recommend that passengers use facemasks as they travel round airports in Finland, and Finnair have made the wearing of facemasks mandatory for passengers aged seven or over on their flights. Please check your carrier’s requirements before travelling.
Regular entry requirements
Visas
If you hold a British Citizen passport, you don’t need a visa to enter Finland. If you’re planning a stay of longer than 3 months, see our Living in Finland guide and contact the Finnish Embassy if you have further questions.
The rules on travel will stay the same until 31 December 2020.
Visas from 1 January 2021
The rules for travelling or working in Europe will change from 1 January 2021:
You will be able to travel to countries in the Schengen area for up to 90 days in any 180-day period without a visa for purposes such as tourism. This is a rolling 180-day period.
Therefore, if you’re travelling to Finland, previous visits to the Schengen area within the 180 days before your date of travel would count against the 90-day limit.
If you are travelling visa-free to Finland and to other countries in the Schengen area, make sure your whole visit is within the limit.
To stay for longer, to work or study, or for business travel you will need to meet the entry requirements set out by Finland. This could mean applying for a visa or work permit. You should check with the Finnish Embassy what type of visa, if any, you will need.
Periods of stay authorised under a visa or permit will not count against the 90-day limit.
The European Commission has not yet set out how the limit of 90 days in any 180-day period for visa-free travel will be implemented for those who are already travelling in the EU or Schengen Area on 31 December 2020.
If you are travelling to Finland before 31 December 2020 and will stay until 1 January 2021 or later, you should check with the Finnish Embassy for information on how the 90-day visa-free limit will apply to you. This also applies if your stay includes travel to other Schengen area countries.
At border control for Finland, you may need to:
show a return or onward ticket
show you have enough money for your stay
use separate lanes from EU, EEA and Swiss citizens when queueing
Your passport may be stamped on entry and exit.
Passport validity
The rules on travel will stay the same until 31 December 2020.
Your passport should be valid for the proposed duration of your stay; you do not need any additional period of validity on your passport beyond this.
Passport validity from 1 January 2021
From 1 January 2021, you must have at least 6 months left on an adult or child passport to travel to most countries in Europe (not including Ireland).
If you renewed your current passport before the previous one expired, extra months may have been added to its expiry date. Any extra months on your passport over 10 years may not count towards the 6 months needed.
Check your passport is valid for travel before you book your trip. You will need to renew your passport before travelling if you do not have enough time left on your passport.
ETDs
UK Emergency Travel Documents (ETDs) are accepted for entry, airside transit and exit from Finland.
