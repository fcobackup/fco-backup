Further information
International flights to and from Côte d’Ivoire have been suspended until further notice, except for humanitarian and security purposes. Land borders are also closed
Ad-hoc flights may be organised to repatriate foreign visitors stranded in Cote d’Ivoire but these are likely to be rare. If any are announced the likelihood is that they will come available at very short notice and will be for visitors and people who are vulnerable. All requests for seats on these flights must be made through your Embassy. If you are a British national and you wish leave Cote d’Ivoire please send your details to British.Embassy.Abidjan@fco.gov.uk who will inform you if there is potential for you to get on a flight.
If you cannot afford travel costs and have exhausted all other options for getting funds, you may be eligible for an emergency loan from the British government. This would enable you to get back to the UK with one of the ad hoc commercial flights being organised for repatriation. The loan is a ‘last resort’ option and you will need to repay the loan when you are back in the UK. For more information please contact the British Embassy Abidjan by phone on +225 22442669 or by email to British.Embassy.Abidjan@fco.gov.uk
