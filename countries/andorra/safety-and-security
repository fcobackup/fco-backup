You can use a UK photocard driving licence to drive in Andorra. If you still have a paper driving licence, you may need to update it to a photocard licence or get the correct version of the international driving permit (IDP) as well.
Hire car companies often have stricter requirements for their customers, such as a year of driving experience, a higher minimum age and holding an IDP.
Andorra has stricter drink-driving laws than many other countries, including the UK. You can get a fine of up to 600 euros and a 2-month driving ban. The Andorra authorities can also impound your vehicle.
Check if you need a UK sticker to drive your car outside the UK.
From 1 November to 15 May, you must use winter tyres or carry snow chains in Andorra. You can get a fine if you do not. Winter tyres have a snowflake icon on the wall of the tyre.
