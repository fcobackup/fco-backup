If you plan to pass through another country to return to the UK, check the travel advice for the country you’re transiting.
Be prepared for your plans to change
No travel is risk-free during COVID. Countries may further restrict travel or bring in new rules at short notice, for example due to a new COVID-19 variant. Check with your travel company or airline for any transport changes which may delay your journey home.
If you test positive for COVID-19, you may need to stay where you are until you test negative. You may also need to seek treatment there.
Plan ahead and make sure you:
can access money
understand what your insurance will cover
can make arrangements to extend your stay and be away for longer than planned
Travel in Nepal
The Nepali authorities have imposed temporary restrictions to control the COVID-19 outbreak. Some non-essential services are partially closed, and restrictions may be introduced or extended at short notice. You must wear face masks to access essential services (including access to medical care, to shop, and to access the airport for outbound flights), and adults are also required to carry and show proof of vaccination. There are penalties for people who do not observe these rules, which are rigorously enforced.
Accommodation
Although some hotels in the Kathmandu valley are open, this can change at short notice. Local administrations in other districts are free to adapt a different model, and more restrictive lockdowns are still in place in other parts of the country.
public spaces and services are now currently operating a restricted service in the Kathmandu valley to control outbreaks of COVID-19, and other districts may operate more restrictive models. Shops and services when open will only serve customers wearing some form of face mask. Shop openings may vary by location, as local administrations in other districts are free to adapt a different model
people are required to maintain social distancing and wear masks in public. Up to 100 people may now attend gatherings, if vaccinated
there are current limitations on the opening of entertainment centres such as cinema halls and dance bars, health clubs and swimming clubs, salons, beauty parlours, spas, libraries, zoos, and museums. When open, you will need to wear masks, and adults will need to show proof of vaccination status.
There have been reports of some incidents in parts of Nepal of foreign tourists being threatened or intimidated by locals, allegedly in relation to coronavirus. Such incidents are rare. If you experience such problems, return immediately to your accommodation (if safe), or to the local law enforcement agencies (phone 100), or contact the British Embassy at +977 (0)1 423 7100.
Healthcare in Nepal
If you need medical attention and/or if you think you have any symptoms of COVID such as a fever or persistent cough please avoid contact with others if possible and go to a medical facility. For those who have health insurance cover, or are willing to pay then Mediciti and Norvic Hospitals can isolate and take a test to be sent to the national laboratory. Otherwise, go to Patan Hospital. Some facilities are experiencing pressure due to COVID-19, and you should allow for this.
Make sure you have sufficient medicine, if required. The British Embassy has a list of pharmacies and hospitals that dispense in Kathmandu.
For contact details for English speaking doctors visit our list of healthcare providers.
Testing and isolation for COVID-19 is limited to certain government hospitals, where services are basic. View Health for further details on healthcare in Nepal.
