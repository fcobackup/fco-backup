Travel in Thailand
Domestic travel options within Thailand are available but remain subject to disease control measures. If you are taking an internal flight in Thailand, you may be asked to download an app or complete additional travel documentation.
You will be required to wear a face mask and follow other disease control measures when using public transport, including planes, trains, buses and taxis.
With effect from Monday 26 April until further notice you must wear a mask in indoor and outdoor public spaces in Bangkok and many other provinces of Thailand. You can find a full list of the areas affected by these measures on the Thai Government’s Facebook page. If you do not wear a mask you may have to pay a fine.
COVID-related restrictions in Thailand
An emergency decree is currently in place. This includes instructions that you must not:
enter high risk areas
hoard essential goods
attend public gatherings
propagate false information
The Thai government also advises that you should avoid unnecessary travel and crowded places, and scan the ‘Thai Chana’ QR code where available.
The Thai authorities have also introduced a number of disease control measures at national and local levels. These include a Red / Orange / Yellow / Green rating for each of Thailand’s 76 provinces based on the number of COVID-19 cases. Restrictions in each province depend on the rating and any additional local rules, and they may change at any time.
You should follow the advice of local authorities and comply with disease control measures. You can also keep up to date with the latest health advice provided by Thailand’s Ministry of Public Health and updates from the Thai government on the situation, including daily video briefings in English provided by the Thai Ministry of Foreign Affairs.
Accommodation
Hotel and private rental accommodation is available throughout Thailand. However, some hotels remain closed so we advise you to contact hotels directly when booking.
The majority of hotels will ask to take your temperature on arrival and ask you to provide information on your recent travel history and any symptoms you may have related to COVID-19. You may also need to follow other disease control measures.
Some services and facilities in hotels may not be available e.g. leisure facilities.
