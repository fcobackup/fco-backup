In addition to this travel advice, view the latest updates for UK nationals travelling to and living in Europe.
As of 7 April 2019, the Hellenic Police will begin implementing systematic passport control checks for all European citizens travelling to/from destinations outside the Schengen area (including the UK). This is in line with the 2017 Schengen Borders Code regulation EU 2017/458, which will eventually be applied by all Schengen member states according to the individual timescales. Waiting times at passport control may be affected on departure from and arrival into Greece. You should ensure you arrive at the airport in good time.
British nationals make over 3 million visits to Greece every year. Most visits are trouble-free, but you should take sensible precautions to protect yourself and your belongings. See Crime
There are regular strikes, sometimes called at short notice that can cause disruption to public transport (including air travel and ports), as well as road networks and borders. You should avoid all demonstrations and follow the advice given by local security authorities. See Major pre-planned strikes and demonstrations
Localised or severe weather extremes, including wildfires, can affect areas of Greece over the extended summer period. At times, this can cause travel disruption. You should monitor local and international weather updates from the Greek Meteorological Service or European Meteorological Services website, follow the advice of local authorities at all times and check with your travel provider for travel updates. See Natural disasters
There were a number of cases of West Nile virus in Greece in 2018. You should consider preventative measures to minimise exposure to mosquitoes, for example using mosquito repellent when outdoors and closing doors or windows or using screens. See Health
You can withdraw cash using a UK card up to the daily limit imposed by the Greek banking system (usually €600) or the daily limit imposed by your UK card issuer - whichever is the lower amount. You should be able to pay for retail transactions with debit and credit cards as you would elsewhere, but always check beforehand as not all business hold a machine for processing card payments. There are no restrictions on taking euros from the UK to Greece or bringing euros back from Greece to the UK at the end of your stay. When travelling outside the UK you should take more than one means of payment with you (cash, debit card, credit card).

If you make a false or fraudulent claim, you may face legal proceedings in the UK or Greece.
