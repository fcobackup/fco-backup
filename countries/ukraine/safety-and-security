Russian invasion of Ukraine
The Russian invasion of Ukraine is ongoing, with attacks against a number of major cities. Several towns and cities in southern and eastern Ukraine are temporarily under Russian control. There is a real risk to life.
If you travel to Ukraine to fight, or to assist others engaged in the war, your activities may amount to offences under UK legislation and you could be prosecuted on your return to the UK. British nationals fighting in Ukraine have been killed or captured. Additionally, British nationals undertaking humanitarian work have been detained. The risk to life, or of mistreatment, is high. Consular support in these circumstances will be very limited.
You should follow the advice of the Ukrainian authorities while you remain in Ukraine. Check the measures in place under martial law in your location. These will vary from region to region. Pay close attention to your personal security and monitor the media for information about possible safety or security risks, including the impact of the invasion in your area. You should avoid demonstrations and public gatherings. Take extra care while moving around.
Crimea and Eastern Ukraine
The FCDO advises against all travel to Ukraine, including Crimea, Donetsk oblast and Luhansk oblast.
Following an illegal referendum on 16 March 2014, Russia illegally annexed Crimea on 21 March 2014. Russian forces and pro-Russian groups have established full operational control. The FCDO is not able to provide consular services to anyone in Crimea.
To enter or exit Crimea, in theory foreign nationals need to provide their passport and a special permit issued by the territorial body of the State Migration Service of Ukraine. However, due to the ongoing war in Ukraine, it is not currently possible for foreign nationals to enter or exit Crimea.
The UK has imposed restrictions on economic relations with Crimea following its illegal annexation by Russia. These restrictions apply to all UK people and companies and include an import ban, a full ban on investment and a prohibition on supplying tourism services in Crimea. Exports of further key goods for certain sectors are also banned.
The Crimean sea ports of Kerch, Sevastopol, Feodosia, Yalta and Yevpatoria have been designated by the Ukrainian authorities as closed to international shipping.
Crime
Before the invasion, serious crime against foreigners was relatively rare, but incidents did occur, with some cases being racially motivated.
You should report any incidents to the police by dialling 102. A list of local translators is available on the British Embassy website. We cannot confirm whether these translators are still offering services during Russia’s invasion of Ukraine.
Be alert to the possibility of street crime and petty theft. Foreigners may appear to be lucrative targets. Ensure you know what curfews are in place.
Don’t lose sight of your credit cards during transactions.
Theft of and from vehicles is common. Don’t leave documents or money in your vehicle. Unregulated taxi drivers can overcharge. Use official taxis, which have the name and telephone number of the taxi company on the side of the door and on the top of the taxi.
Do not leave drinks or food unattended as they could be spiked. Beware of accepting drinks from casual acquaintances.
