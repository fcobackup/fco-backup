Public spaces and services
The Polish government has strict sanitary rules and restrictions in place nationwide. From 20 March until at least 9 April tighter restrictions will be in place. The Polish Government advice is to stay at home where possible.
Facemasks are compulsory in open public spaces across Poland, apart from parks, forests and National Parks. Children under 4 are not required to wear facemasks. If there are medical reasons why you cannot wear a facemask, you must carry a doctor’s note with you explaining this. Bandanas, scarves, balaclavas and visors are not permitted alternatives to facemasks. Your mouth and nose must be covered. When outside, you should keep a 1.5 metre distance from others, unless you are a parent with a child under 13 or the carer of a disabled person.
You must also wear a facemask at all times in enclosed spaces, on public transport, in taxis or in an open space where you are unable to maintain a 1.5 metre distance. You do not need to wear a facemask in a private car. Police and sanitary inspectors are entitled to issue you with an on-the-spot fine (approximately PLN500/£100) if you are found not to be wearing a facemask when you should. Further prosecution could result in a fine of up to PLN 30,000 (£6,000) for failing to follow sanitary rules.
Seniors, aged 70 and over have been requested to stay at home, leaving only for work or necessities.
Public gatherings are limited to 5 people, excluding households bigger than 5 members and workplaces. Private gatherings may include no more than 5 people, excluding household members. There are restrictions on the number of people attending religious services and funerals. There is a nationwide ban on wedding receptions and wakes.
Public transport is operating with 50% capacity seating to maintain appropriate distance between passengers. You can still use taxis. Facemasks must be worn at all times.
Cultural institutions such as museums, art galleries, theatres, opera houses, casinos and cinemas will be closed from 20 March. Libraries may open with strict sanitary procedures in place.
National Forests, parks and beaches are open.
Non-essential shops in shopping malls and retail parks will be closed from 20 March (supermarkets and pharmacies remain open). Shops outside shopping malls and retail parks remain open. Customer numbers are limited in shops. This might mean you have to queue for entry. In all areas of Poland a facemask must be worn inside shops and hand sanitiser must be used where provided.
Petrol stations, car washes and car/motorbike repair centres remain open. Banks, insurance providers and post offices also remain open.
Restaurants, cafes and pubs are closed, and can only provide a takeaway/delivery service. Sporting events are not permitted with audiences, but may take place without an audience. Swimming pools, tennis courts and outdoor sports facilities, including ski slopes, will be closed from 20 March. Gyms, sanatoriums and aqua parks will also remain closed. As will tanning salons, massage salons and saunas.
Administrative offices may open with limited numbers inside at any one time. You might find some offices are only open by appointment and you are recommended to check websites or contact the office before travelling.
The above national measures may be extended further, in scope and time, at short notice. Some regions may have stricter rules in place. See here (in Polish) for details of regions with stricter rules.
