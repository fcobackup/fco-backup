The information on this page covers the most common types of travel and reflects the UK government’s understanding of the rules currently in place. Unless otherwise stated, this information is for travellers using a full ‘British Citizen’ passport.
The authorities in the country or territory you’re travelling to are responsible for setting and enforcing the rules for entry. If you’re unclear about any aspect of the entry requirements, or you need further reassurance, you’ll need to contact the embassy, high commission or consulate of the country or territory you’re travelling to.
You should also consider checking with your transport provider or travel company to make sure your passport and other travel documents meet their requirements.
Restrictions in response to coronavirus
All passengers arriving in Iceland can chose to be tested for COVID-19 or self-isolate for 14 days upon arrival. Testing is free of charge until 30 June, and ISK 15,000 (approximately £90) per test thereafter, with results provided in 24 hours. Children born in 2005 or later will be exempt from both testing and self-isolation.
You will also be required to fill out a pre-registration form before departure. You can find further information, including exemptions, from the Icelandic authorities at Covid.is (available in English).
If you test positive on arrival you will be required to enter self-isolation (at your hotel or government-provided accommodation) unless further tests determine the infection is inactive. You may also need to be tested again or enter self-isolation if you are exposed to a possible infection during your trip e.g. during the flight to Iceland.
