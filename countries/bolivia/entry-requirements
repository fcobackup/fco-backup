The information on this page covers the most common types of travel and reflects the UK government’s understanding of the rules currently in place. Unless otherwise stated, this information is for travellers using a full ‘British Citizen’ passport.
The authorities in the country or territory you’re travelling to are responsible for setting and enforcing the rules for entry. If you’re unclear about any aspect of the entry requirements, or you need further reassurance, you’ll need to contact the embassy, high commission or consulate of the country or territory you’re travelling to.
You should also consider checking with your transport provider or travel company to make sure your passport and other travel documents meet their requirements.
Visas for visitors
British nationals don’t need a visa to visit Bolivia. The length of stay permitted on entering Bolivia is initially 30 days. This can be extended for a further 60 days, at no extra charge, as long as you apply before the end of the 30 day period at one of the Department of Immigration offices throughout the country. The Department of Immigration has imposed an annual limit for tourists of 90 days in Bolivia without a visa. If you want to stay for a longer period seek advice from the Bolivian Embassy in London or the Department of Immigration office in La Paz at Avenida Camacho No. 1468.
Your passport must contain an entry stamp, otherwise you’ll have to pay a fine to leave. If you enter Bolivia overland make sure your passport is stamped on both sides of the border, with an exit stamp from the country you are leaving and an entry stamp on the Bolivian side - you may need to ask for directions to the immigration office. The British Embassy can’t intervene in immigration issues. Make sure you get an entry stamp when you arrive in Bolivia.
Residence permits and other types of visas
The Bolivian Immigration authority (Dirección General de Migración) has introduced new procedures and requirements for British nationals applying for residence permits and other types of visas in Bolivia. New requirements now include a police certificate of criminal records from the UK, which you can get from the Association of Chief Police Officers website. If you need any documents from the UK, get them translated into Spanish and legalised at the Bolivian Embassy in London.
Visit the Bolivian Immigration authority for more information.
