Consular support is severely limited in CAR as there is no British Embassy. However, the British Embassy Kinshasa, in the Democratic Republic of Congo can provide limited remote consular support to British nationals.
On 5 February, the Government of CAR announced a six month state of emergency across the country due to outbreaks of violence following presidential and legislative elections on 27 December. A national curfew is in place which comes into effect at 8pm and ends at 5am. You should follow the government’s instructions and avoid travel around Bangui during these hours. A second round of legislative elections took place on 14 March.
Tensions remain high and there is potential for further violence across the country. Attacks on individuals and groups, including car-jackings, are likely and unpredictable. There are armed patrols that have set up several roadblocks across the country. Detention by police forces and armed groups is a common occurrence, primarily for CAR nationals, but also for expatriates. You should take extreme care, and take personal security precautions, if possible.
Terrorist attacks in the CAR cannot be ruled out. See Terrorism
UK health authorities have classified CAR as having a risk of Zika virus transmission. For information and advice about the risks associated with Zika virus, visit the National Travel Health Network and Centre website.
