There are still limited commercial options to return to the UK from Slovakia.
If you live in the UK and are currently visiting Slovakia, you are strongly advised to return now by commercial means. Don’t risk getting stranded.
UK special charter flights will only operate for priority countries where commercial flights are not possible. You should not assume that these flights will become available in countries where commercial routes are operating. Please do not contact the contracted travel management company if no special charter flight is advertised here.
Flights
British travellers in Slovakia are allowed to leave, but international airports at Bratislava, Kosice and Poprad are closed to regular scheduled passenger flights.
Road and rail
International rail and bus services have stopped. Taxis are not allowed to carry passengers.
Exit by road is currently permitted to Austria and the Czech Republic under certain circumstances, but this may change at short notice.
Travel via bordering countries
There are restrictions on entry for most British nationals at the borders with Poland, Hungary, Czech Republic and Ukraine. Since 14 April there have also been controls and special requirements for entry to Austria.
It is however possible to return to the UK via Austria and the Czech Republic under certain circumstances.
If you plan to transit Austria, you will need to provide evidence that you are transiting (such as a flight or ferry booking or a full tank of fuel) and complete a declaration of transit. If you are ending your journey in Austria, the Austrian government may require non-residents to show a medical certificate. For more information, check the FCO travel advice for Austria.
There are indirect scheduled commercial flights to the UK from Vienna Airport via Frankfurt, Dublin and Amsterdam, but these may be subject to cancellation at short notice and flight schedules may mean you need an overnight stay. You should contact the airlines directly. The British Embassy in Vienna is issuing regular updates on Twitter and Facebook with the latest available information on departure options from Austria. See also FCO travel advice for Austria.
Entry to the Czech Republic can be arranged under certain circumstances if you are in transit for less than 24 hours. See FCO travel advice for Czech Republic.
To plan your route by road or air, check the FCO travel advice for all the countries you plan to travel through, including for any special documentation you may need.
For the latest information, please refer to the most recent social media updates from the British Embassy in Bratislava.
Travelling to Vienna Airport
Options for getting from Bratislava to the border with Austria are limited, but some car rental companies continue to offer services where you can drive to the border and leave the car there. You may need to pay for an additional car and driver to collect your hire car from the border to return it to Bratislava. It is then possible to cross into Austria on foot and arrange a taxi or car hire to meet you or take public transport to Vienna Airport from Kittsee or Wolfsthal. There is a list of car rental companies on the local English language Slovak Spectator website.
Help and support
If you need urgent consular assistance, you can contact the British Embassy on +421 2 59 98 2000.
The Embassy cannot provide further information or advice about departure options over the phone.
You will need to pay for your return travel to the UK. If departure options are available but you cannot afford the travel costs and have exhausted all other options for getting funds, you may be eligible to apply for an emergency loan from the government. This is a last resort option and you would need to repay the loan when you are back in the UK. For more information, you should contact Corporate Travel Management (CTM). CTM are a commercial partner of the FCO and are authorised to administer such loans on behalf of the FCO.
