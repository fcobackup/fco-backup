International travel
Passengers at the airport will need to follow strict regulations, including the mandatory use of masks and facial protectors (usually a clear plastic full-face covering) and social distancing
Commercial airlines are operating to and from Peru. If travelling via another country, it is essential you check the travel advice for that country, as some currently do not permit transit to/from the UK.
Iberia is flying from Lima to Madrid on a weekly basis. Air France will re-start flying from Lima to Paris on 2 April. Direct flights from some destinations in Europe to Lima will re-start on 31 March.
If you travel to Peru, you will need to show proof of a negative result from a COVID-19 PCR (molecular) test, issued no more than 72 hours before your flight
All passengers arriving in Peru, irrespective of nationality, have to quarantine for 14 days. This can be in a home or accommodation anywhere in the country, in liaison with the health authorities. When the quarantine is to be completed outside Lima, you must arrive there within 24 hours after arrival in Peru.
If upon arrival in Peru you test positive, you will have to self-isolate in the Villa Panamericana or any other temporary centre in Lima or in the centres that the regional government assigns. You may end quarantine if you take an antigen test upon your arrival in the country and the result is negative. If you receive a positive result, you will need to quarantine where the health authorities decide.

COVID-19 vaccines if you live in Peru
As information is available about the national vaccination programme, this page will be updated.
The Medicines and Healthcare Products Regulatory Agency (MHRA) is the UK authority responsible for assessing the safety, quality and efficacy of vaccines. It has authorised the Pfizer/BioNTech, Oxford/AstraZeneca and Moderna vaccines for temporary supply and use in the UK. Find out more about MHRA approval for these vaccines.
British nationals living overseas should seek medical advice from their local healthcare provider in the country where they reside. Information about vaccines used in other national programmes, including regulatory status, should be available from the local authorities.
