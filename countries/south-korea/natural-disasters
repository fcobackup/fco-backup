Typhoons
The typhoon season normally runs from June to November. You should monitor the progress of approaching storms on the Korea Meteorological Administration website and follow any advice given by the local authorities or you can call 131 in Korea to get an accurate weather forecast in English.   
See our tropical cyclones page for advice about what to do if you are caught up in a typhoon.
Earthquakes
Strong earthquakes are unusual in South Korea but not unheard of. Most earthquakes in South Korea are relatively weak (between 2.0 and 5.0 on the Richter scale). Information on earthquakes is published on the Korea Meteorological Administration website.
You should familiarise yourself with any guidance from your local authorities on safety procedures in the event of an earthquake. To learn more about what to do in case of an earthquake, check the safety tips from the Seoul Metropolitan Government.
