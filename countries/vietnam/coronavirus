Domestic travel
Air Travel
COVID-19 prevention measures vary depending on where you start your journey and your destination. You should check with your travel provider on the status of your flight and prevention measures in place at your destination and/or on return, before travelling.
Until further notice, all passengers on domestic flights must meet one of the following criteria to travel: (1) fully vaccinated for at least 14 days; (2) has certificate/ proof that they have recovered from Covid within 6 months; or (3) present a negative COVID-test (quick test or RTPCR) taken no longer than 72 hours before boarding time.
Inter-province public transport
Transport services may be cancelled or suspended at short notice. You should check with your travel provider on travel restrictions and any COVID-19 prevention measures in place at your destination and/or on return.
International travel
Commercial flights to and from Vietnam remain very limited, but from 1 January 2022 Vietnam resumed some international commercial flights on some selected routes, but not currently including any UK airports. A number of airline websites allow online booking from Vietnam. However, check carefully in advance whether these flights are guaranteed to fly and whether they are passenger flights. Flights and transit arrangements are still prone to changes and cancellation with little notice.
You should check with your travel agent or airline before travelling for any last minute change and/or additional travel requirements.
There are some restrictions on airside transit at airports you may transit when travelling to and from Vietnam. You should check in advance to ensure you will be able to transit, particularly transit times, visa and transit visa requirements and whether your baggage can be transferred airside at transit points.
Entry and borders
See Entry requirements to find out what you will need to do when you arrive in Vietnam.
Returning to the UK
Travelling from and returning to the UK
Check what you must do to travel abroad and return to England, Scotland, Wales or Northern Ireland.
If you plan to pass through another country to return to the UK, check the travel advice for the country you’re transiting. If you will pass through a red list country, book your hotel quarantine package before travelling to the UK.
You are responsible for organising your own COVID-19 test, in line with UK government requirements. The Vietnamese authorities have issued information on testing facilities and procedures (only available in Vietnamese). The testing facilities can be contacted directly.
Be prepared for your plans to change
No travel is risk-free during COVID-19. Countries may further restrict travel or bring in new rules at short notice, for example due to a new COVID-19 variant. Check with your travel company or airline for any transport and/or rule changes which may delay your journey home.
If you test positive for COVID-19, you may need to stay where you are until you test negative. You may also need to seek treatment there.
Plan ahead and make sure you:
can access money
understand what your insurance will cover
can make arrangements to extend your stay and be away for longer than planned
Public spaces and services
The measures to combat COVID-19 vary from province to province and can change at short notice. Vietnam has introduced a colour-coded categorisation to identify high risk COVID areas across Vietnam. These categories can vary between provinces and within cities. The categories are Red (very high risk), Orange (high risk), Yellow (medium risk) and Green (normal). The Vietnamese authorities regularly review the categorisations. Restrictions will differ depending on the categorisation of particular districts within cities. You should be ready to comply with local authorities.
You should also ensure that you have your ID/passport with you. Before travelling to another province you should check with your travel provider and/or accommodation what requirements are in place, both where you are travelling to and on return. Some provinces may require negative COVID-19 tests to be obtained before and/or after entry and some may impose periods of self-isolation. Social distancing rules remain in place in many places across Vietnam and you should follow these strictly. Mask wearing is compulsory in public settings. Those not wearing masks may be liable to spot fines.
Hanoi
Restrictions within Hanoi can vary between districts depending on colour-coded categorisations designated by the local authorities. The Hanoi local authorities review these categorisations weekly. You should be alert to changes and be ready to comply with restrictions put in place.
Ho Chi Minh City
You should install on your phone the PC-Covid App and register your travel. You should also carry other proof of your vaccinations.
There may be local variations so you should talk to your landlord or local ward authorities or resident group (tổ dân phố) for details as to what restrictions are in place in your area.
Residents should ensure they have their medical declaration QR code with them at all times. If you experience COVID-19 symptoms you should report to your local Ward Response Team or call 115
Healthcare in Vietnam
If you think you have COVID-19 symptoms, you should go immediately to a local doctor or hospital.

Testing and Quarantine/Self-Isolation
If you are asked to undertake testing, you should comply. Failure to comply can be an offence with significant punishments.
Quarantine periods and testing requirements can change at short notice and may vary between locations. Most provinces of Vietnam often permit those testing positive with COVID-19 to self-isolate at home for 10 days if their residences meet the requirements of the local health authorities, otherwise at a designated quarantine centre.
If you become a close contact of someone with COVID-19, you will have to self-isolate for 7 days, at your place of residence if your place meet requirements of local health or at a quarantine centre.
Once you have completed quarantine/self-isolation you should receive a document specifying this. You should keep this, as you may need to present it officials in Vietnam or when you leave Vietnam.
COVID-19 vaccines if you live in Vietnam
We will update this page when the Government of Vietnam announces new information on the national vaccination programme. You can sign up to get email notifications when this page is updated.
The Vietnamese vaccination programme started in March 2021. Currently approved by the Vietnamese Government for use in Vietnam are the AstraZeneca, Pfizer-BioNTech, Moderna, Janssen (Johnson & Johnson), Sinopharm, Sputnik V, Hayat-Vax and Abdala vaccines.
Depending on vaccine availability Vietnam has approved the combination of vaccines: Moderna and Pfizer and Astra Zeneca and Pfizer.
The Vietnamese authorities have confirmed that foreign residents will be offered vaccines as part of the vaccination programme, in line with Vietnam’s priority groups, if they choose to join the programme. You should also check if your employer has their own vaccination programme and check our social media for updates on vaccination availability.
If you are over 18, you can register for vaccination in Vietnam (website in English and Vietnamese) on the Vietnamese National Vaccine Registration Portal or download the e-health app (in Vietnamese only), after which you will receive instructions on how to register for vaccination. Additionally, you can register offline through your local residence group (Tổ dân phố) who will be involved in organising local vaccinations. Please talk to your landlord, local ward authorities, or local residence group for details, as these may differ according to your ward.
If you are aged above 65 or with underlying health conditions, you may be required to be vaccinated in hospital rather than a non-hospital setting.
