Public spaces and services
There are nationwide rules in place restricting movement and limiting activity. Protective face masks must be worn on public transport and are recommended for use in all indoor public spaces. Social distancing is encouraged everywhere.
Additional rules and penalties vary in different towns and cities, and rules can change rapidly, so you should follow the latest local guidance - check news outlets regularly for up to date information.
In Belgrade, bars and restaurants are not allowed to operate between 11pm and 6am. In all indoor public spaces it is mandatory to wear a protective face mask and maintain physical distance of at least 1.5m. Gatherings are limited to 100 people indoors and 500 outdoors, and the 1.5m physical distance rule applies whether indoors or outdoors. Failure to wear a mask when required will incur a fine.
Emergency situations have been declared in several municipalities due to COVID-19, including, but not limited to, Belgrade, Novi Pazar, Kragujevac, Pozega, Tutin, Arilje, Vranje, Ivanjica, Kraljevo, Lucani, Cacak and Sabac, and the rules in these towns may be much more strict. In these locations it may be difficult to access satisfactory healthcare for any medical issue including COVID-19.
There may be further restrictions (both nationwide and locally) to limit the spread of coronavirus. Infringements of these procedures may result in fines and/or a prison sentence.
