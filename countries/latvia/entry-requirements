The information on this page covers the most common types of travel and reflects the UK government’s understanding of the rules currently in place. Unless otherwise stated, this information is for travellers using a full ‘British Citizen’ passport.
The authorities in the country or territory you’re travelling to are responsible for setting and enforcing the rules for entry. If you’re unclear about any aspect of the entry requirements, or you need further reassurance, you’ll need to contact the embassy, high commission or consulate of the country or territory you’re travelling to.
You should also consider checking with your transport provider or travel company to make sure your passport and other travel documents meet their requirements.

A State of Emergency is in place until 9 June and means that:
British nationals are permitted to exit Latvia at designated land border crossing points, but there is no guarantee of onward travel

This also applies to border crossing points intended for local border traffic, with the exception of the carriage of goods
There are currently no direct commercial flights leaving Latvia to return to the UK. You should keep up to date with information from your tour operator, transport or accommodation provider on the impact on any existing travel plans.
Only Latvian nationals and foreign nationals who hold residence cards issued by the Latvian Office of Citizenship and Migration Affairs are authorised to enter Latvia from abroad.
If you need further information about entry requirements, contact the local immigration authorities or the nearest Latvian embassy/consulate. You should also check with your airline or travel company for the latest information.
Health measures on arrival
The Latvian Government and the Latvian Centre for Disease Prevention and Control have introduced measures requiring all travellers to Latvia arriving from anywhere abroad, including the UK, to take special protection measures:
self-isolate (quarantine) and carefully monitor their health for 14 days after their arrival in Latvia including by taking their body temperature twice a day (in the morning and evening)
if you experience mild flu-like (increased body temperature, cough, sore throat) symptoms for at least two days you should call 8303. The dispatcher will then evaluate on a case-by-case basis and refer you to a testing point or send a medical unit to you if you are unable to travel to a testing point
in case of sudden onset of at least one of the following symptoms – dry cough, fever, shortness of breath – restrict contact with people nearby, but in case not possible, keep distance of at least two metres from them, and call 113 immediately (State Emergency Medical Service)
Keep up to date with information from your tour operator, transport or accommodation provider on the impact on any existing travel plans.
