The Foreign and Commonwealth Office (FCO) advise against all but essential travel to Slovakia and recommends that British nationals that wish to leave Slovakia contact their travel operator to make arrangements to do so as soon as possible. This is in response to the ongoing coronavirus (COVID-19) pandemic and in line with restrictions imposed by the Slovakian authorities. See Health
As of 13 March entry to Slovakia is permitted only for Slovak citizens and foreign residents. British nationals with proof of temporary or permanent residence are allowed to enter the country by land border. All those arriving from abroad are required to self-isolate for 14 days. British travellers in Slovakia are allowed to leave but international airports at Bratislava, Kosice and Poprad are closed. International rail and bus services have also ceased. Taxis are no longer permitted to carry passengers. Exit via road to Austria is currently permitted but this may change at short notice. There are restrictions on entry for most British nationals at the borders with Poland, Hungary, Czech Republic and Ukraine.
The situation may change rapidly, including in neighbouring countries. Please consult travel advice for the country concerned.
Under the State of Emergency announced by the Slovak authorities on 12 March, all schools, universities, leisure and cultural facilities are closed, including ski resorts and spas. Many hotels have closed, and only take-away food is permitted from restaurants.
Further information on the measures implemented is available from the Slovak government website (in English).
The UK has left the European Union. Aside from any emergency travel restrictions, the rules on travel to EU countries will stay the same until 31 December 2020.
