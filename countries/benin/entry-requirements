This page reflects the UK government’s understanding of current rules for people travelling on a full ‘British Citizen’ passport, for the most common types of travel.
The authorities in Benin set and enforce entry rules. For further information contact the embassy, high commission or consulate of the country or territory you’re travelling to. You should also consider checking with your transport provider or travel company to make sure your passport and other travel documents meet their requirements.
Entry rules in response to coronavirus (COVID-19)
Entry to Benin
Entry visas are restricted. Entry and exit at border crossings is limited to “extreme necessity” and authorised in liaison with bordering countries.
The land border with Togo is closed.
Testing/screening on arrival and departure
Cotonou Cadjehoun International Airport has reinforced measures in place for visitors arriving in Benin. All arriving passengers must undergo mandatory COVID-19 testing - one test on arrival and a second test 14 days after the first negative test result. These tests are at passenger expense; fees are 100,000 FCFA (approximately £136) inclusive for two tests, payable to airlines at the time of booking flights. Passengers will be required to leave their passports with Immigration Police for 72 hours until the first test results are received.
All departing passengers must undergo testing at Cotonou Cadjehoun International Airport or Palais des Congres. Fees are 50,000 FCFA (normal service) or 75,000 FCFA (premium service). There is an online guidance page (in French) which explains the steps for arriving and departing passengers.
All passengers must complete a health form online.
Quarantine requirements
Those who test positive for COVID-19 will be subject to government-mandated isolation measures and will receive treatment free of charge. Quarantine areas will be guarded by defence and security forces to ensure that quarantine regulations are strictly adhered to, and the government of Benin will retain passengers’ passports until all testing and isolation requirements are met to ensure compliance.
Regular entry requirements
