The Belize authorities have introduced a number of precautionary measures in response to the coronavirus (COVID-19) pandemic.
Belize authorities already have in place a number of precautionary measures and travel restrictions. Among these, British and European nationals, as well as anyone who has travelled to the UK and Europe within the last 30 days, will be prohibited entry into Belize.
The Philip Goldson International Airport (Belize City) will close on Monday 23 March following the last scheduled flight departure. The Northern land border (Santa Elena Border) between Corozal and Chetumal, Mexico, including the Corozal free zone, will close at 11.59pm local time on Saturday 21 March. The rest of Belize’s entry ports remain closed – the Western, Southern and any other small border entry points. These restrictions will be reviewed after 30 days.
At the Northern border, Belizean nationals, residents and diplomats residing in Belize will be allowed entry into Belize subject to inspection and possible quarantine for 14 days. But there will be no exit from Belize except for agreed emergencies.
