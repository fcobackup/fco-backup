There are currently no commercial options available to return to the UK from Oman. Oman suspended all international flights on Sunday 29 March and land borders are closed. However, we have been informed that (subject to sufficient tickets being sold) Oman Air will fly to London Heathrow on 18 May, departing Muscat at 01:50. This will be a one-way flight. If you wish to reserve a seat and/or discuss the terms and conditions, please contact Oman Air direct:
Email: tawfeeq.ali@omanair.com
Whatsapp (or call): +968 9595 1000 (09:00-14:00 daily) The cut-off date to register interest with Oman Air is 13 May. If there is not sufficient interest, Oman Air will not operate the flight.
What to do
If you cannot leave Oman at this time, you should:
follow the advice of the local authorities, including local measures to help minimise your risk of exposure to coronavirus
find accommodation thatâ€™s suitable for your needs
keep in regular contact with family and friends at home, so they know you are safe and well
See more information and advice about staying where you are if you cannot return to the UK.
Future travel options
The UK government is working closely with the airlines, the Omani authorities and British companies exploring private repatriation for their staff, to make sure options are available for you to return to the UK as soon as possible.
This travel advice will be updated when departure options become available.
You will need to pay for your return travel to the UK. If departure options are available but you cannot afford the travel costs and have exhausted all other options for getting funds, you may be eligible to apply for an emergency loan from the government. This is a last resort option and you would need to repay the loan when you are back in the UK. For more information, you should contact Corporate Travel Management (CTM). CTM are a commercial partner of the FCO and are authorised to administer such loans on behalf of the FCO.
Your journey home
The National Travel Health Network and Centre (NaTHNaC) provides advice on how to stay safe as you travel by air.
When you arrive back in the UK, follow the guidance for when you return to the UK on steps you should take to protect yourself and others.
Help and support
If you need urgent consular assistance, you can contact the British Embassy in Muscat on +968 2460 9000.
The Embassy cannot provide further information or advice about departure options over the phone. This page will be updated when departure options become available.
Visas
The Royal Oman Police has confirmed that visitors to Oman who could not leave the country owing to the closure of borders will not be penalised for overstaying their visas.
If you have any questions on the validity or expiry of your visa, contact the Royal Oman Police directly.
