The information on this page covers the most common types of travel and reflects the UK government’s understanding of the rules currently in place. Unless otherwise stated, this information is for travellers using a full ‘British Citizen’ passport.
The authorities in the country or territory you’re travelling to are responsible for setting and enforcing the rules for entry. If you’re unclear about any aspect of the entry requirements, or you need further reassurance, you’ll need to contact the embassy, high commission or consulate of the country or territory you’re travelling to.
You should also consider checking with your transport provider or travel company to make sure your passport and other travel documents meet their requirements.
Entry rules in response to coronavirus (COVID-19)
Entry to Tunisia
Entry requirements into Tunisia vary depending on the prevalence of the epidemic in travellers’ country of residence. The Tunisian authorities have classified the UK as an “Orange” country.
While the Foreign and Commonwealth Office (FCO) advice against all non-essential international travel for British nationals remains in place, Tunisian authorities permit travellers from the UK to enter Tunisia, on the condition that they abide by the following rules.
The UK is classified as an “Orange” country. This means that visitors from the UK wishing to travel to Tunisia must take a PCR test (which detects the presence of the virus) 72 hours before they travel.
From the 26 August, all visitors to Tunisia, regardless of where they fly from, must take a PCR test 72 hours before they travel. You must show evidence of your negative test result at the airport when you arrive in Tunisia.
Upon arrival in Tunisia you must self-isolate at your hotel or place of residence for 14 days.
If you wish to pay for an additional PCR test after seven days of self-isolation, you can do so at your own expense. If the result of this second test is negative you will be permitted to end your quarantine early.
Upon entry you must sign a declaration to confirm that you will abide by these rules.
The Tunisian authorities are updating country classifications regularly so please ensure you check these pages for the latest status before travelling.
Lists of countries and their classifications as “Green”, with a low prevalence of the epidemic, and “Orange”, with a medium prevalence of the epidemic, are published (in French) online. See further information.
Individuals resident in “Red” countries are not permitted to enter Tunisia, unless they are Tunisian nationals or they hold residency in Tunisia. These individuals can travel to Tunisia subject to:
Having taken a coronavirus PCR test that is negative no more than 72 hours before departure and bringing evidence of this result with you; and
Spending seven days in a quarantine facility in a hotel (which you will have to pay for) then an additional seven days in confinement at home, subject to a negative COVID-19 test; and
Signing a declaration to confirm that you will abide by these rules
Transiting Tunisia
A small number of transit flights are operating through Tunisia. If you are transiting through Tunisia, you must comply with sanitary measures and temperature checks.
Testing on arrival
All travellers will have their temperature checked on arrival in Tunisia. No testing will be carried out on arrival, but from 26 August travellers resident in all countries, including the UK, need to provide evidence of having taken a coronavirus PCR test that is negative no more than 72 hours before departure. See Entry to Tunisia for further details.
Quarantine requirements
Quarantine requirements vary depending on the prevalence of the epidemic in travellers’ country of residence. Travellers from the UK need to self-quarantine for 14 days on arrival. See Entry to Tunisia
Data collection
On arrival in Tunisia, you must provide your contact details and travel information.
Testing on departure
No testing is available at the airport or sea ports. Passengers travelling from Tunisia, who require a test for the country they are travelling to, should take a test at the Institut Pasteur.
Regular entry requirements
Visas
British passport holders don’t need a visa for visits of up to three months. On arrival, security checks are sometimes carried out on British passport holders who were not born in the UK. This can take a few hours and you will need to be patient until clearance is given. These types of checks rarely take place on departure.
Overstay fines
If you stay in Tunisia for longer than the authorised period, you will have to pay a fine. This rule does not apply if you are vulnerable and current circumstances oblige you to remain in the country. This exemption applies until 30 September 2020.
Passport validity
For stays of up to 3 months your passport should be valid for the proposed duration of your stay; you don’t need any additional period of validity on your passport beyond this.
UK Emergency Travel Documents
Tunisian authorities accept UK ETDs for entry to and exit from Tunisia. If you’re leaving Tunisia on an ETD, make sure you have a copy of the police report about the loss/theft of your full validity passport to present to the Immigration Officer.
Dual nationals
Dual British-Tunisian nationals should enter and leave Tunisia on their Tunisian passports.
