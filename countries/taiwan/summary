In 2017 there were over 60,000 reported visits to Taiwan by British nationals. Most visits are trouble-free.
There is an ongoing outbreak of coronavirus (COVID-19) in China and elsewhere in the region. Taiwan has put in place a number of measures to combat coronavirus, including changes to entry procedures and restrictions on entry to Taiwan. Those who have boarded flights from 06:00 GMT 14 March to Taiwan from the United Kingdom, Ireland and Schengen Area will be required to self-isolate for 14 days. See Health
The UK does not recognise Taiwan as a state and has no diplomatic relations with Taiwan, so limited consular services are available to British nationals. See Consular assistance
Crime levels are low, but small-scale petty crime does exist. You should maintain at least the same level of vigilance as you would at home, and take sensible precautions. See Crime
There has been a significant increase in cases of dengue fever. See Health
You should not enter Taiwan with animal products without prior authorisation as those caught smuggling products may face heavy fines. See Customs regulations
Although there’s no recent history of terrorism in Taiwan, attacks can’t be ruled out. See Terrorism
Take out comprehensive travel and medical insurance before you travel.
You can contact the emergency services by calling 110 (police) or 119 (ambulance and fire).
If you’re abroad and you need emergency help from the UK government, contact the nearest British embassy, consulate or high commission.
