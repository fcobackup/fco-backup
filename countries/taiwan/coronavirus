Public spaces and services
Taiwan’s Central Epidemic Command Center (CECC) has been updating its guidance on epidemic prevention measures on a continual basis.
For the month of March, the following measures are now in place:
Starting from 17 April, there is no longer a requirement to wear face masks when taking public transport, on board aircraft or on vessels. The indoor mask mandate was relaxed from 20 February, but it remains a requirement to wear a mask when visiting hospitals and healthcare facilities. The CECC recommends you wear a mask in crowded places, where proper distance with others cannot be maintained.
Travel in Taiwan
Passengers arriving in Taiwan from overseas are now permitted to take public transportation from the airport.
If you suspect that you may have contracted COVID-19, or have experienced any suspected COVID-19 symptoms in the 14 days before your arrival in Taiwan, you should inform airport staff for immediate medical assistance.
You should refer to the Taiwan Centers for Diseases Control website or contact their helpline on 1922 for further information on the epidemic prevention measures in your area.
Healthcare in Taiwan
If you are in Taiwan and believe you may have been exposed to or may have contracted coronavirus, your first point of contact should be the Taiwan Centers for Disease Control (CDC) helpline which is 1922. If you are unable to speak to anyone at the CDC you can telephone the British Office, Taipei for support.
Fees for foreigners diagnosed with COVID-19
Starting from 1 January 2023, foreign nationals who do not hold a National Health Insurance (NHI) card are required to pay for medical costs associated with COVID-19 infection. Individuals with moderate or severe symptoms will be admitted directly to a hospital for treatment.
You should make sure that you have adequate travel and medical insurance and accessible funds to cover the cost of any medical treatment abroad. See the Foreign, Commonwealth and Development Office (FCDO) guidance on foreign travel insurance.
Quarantine requirements for COVID-19 cases contracted in Taiwan
Starting from 20 March, individuals who present as asymptomatic or with mild COVID-19 symptoms are no longer required to undergo a mandatory five-day quarantine. Symptomatic COVID-19 cases will be encouraged, but not required, to stay at home for self-health-management until your symptoms ease, or wear a mask at all times if you go out. Individuals with moderate or severe symptoms will be admitted directly to a hospital for treatment, with their case recorded by the authorities. The length of your quarantine period will depend on the seriousness of your COVID-19 infection.
You should refer to the Taiwan Centers for Disease Control (CDC) or contact their helpline on 1922 for further information.
