The information on this page covers the most common types of travel and reflects the UK government’s understanding of the rules currently in place. Unless otherwise stated, this information is for travellers using a full ‘British Citizen’ passport.
The authorities in the country or territory you’re travelling to are responsible for setting and enforcing the rules for entry. If you’re unclear about any aspect of the entry requirements, or you need further reassurance, you’ll need to contact the embassy, high commission or consulate of the country or territory you’re travelling to.
You should also consider checking with your transport provider or travel company to make sure your passport and other travel documents meet their requirements.
Border controls
The Danish authorities increased border controls at the land border with Germany in January 2016. Border controls were also introduced in November 2019 for travellers from Rønne, Helsingør, Frederikshavn, Grenaa and those using the Øresund Bridge, including all train traffic from Sweden. These checks are temporary but will be in place for an unspecified period of time.
If you’re travelling using the land border, or by rail, road, or ferry you should make sure you have your passport with you. Allow additional time, be vigilant and follow the instructions of local authorities. Check with local media, your carrier, ferry operator or Danish State Railways (DSB) for more information.
When crossing from Denmark to Sweden various forms of ID are accepted, but must include a photograph, the holder’s full name, social security number or date of birth, holders signature, a stated validity and information on the issuing authority. Children under 18 accompanied by an adult with the appropriate ID are not required to carry ID themselves.
Passport validity
Your passport should be valid for the proposed duration of your stay; you do not need any additional period of validity on your passport beyond this.
The rules on travel will stay the same until 31 December 2020.
Visas
If you hold a British Citizen passport, you don’t need a visa to enter Denmark. If you’re planning a stay of longer than 3 months, see our Living in Denmark guide and contact the Danish Embassy if you have further questions.
Greenland and the Faroe Islands aren’t members of the European Union. You don’t need a visa to enter for tourism, but you should get a work and residence permit before entry if you intend to live and work there.
The rules on travel will stay the same until 31 December 2020.
UK Emergency Travel Documents
UK Emergency Travel Documents (ETDs) are accepted for entry, airside transit and exit from Denmark. Your ETD must be valid for the proposed duration of your stay.
