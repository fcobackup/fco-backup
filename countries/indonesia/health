Warning
FCDO advises against all travel to parts of Indonesia.

Before you travel check that:
your destination can provide the healthcare you may need

This is particularly important if you have a health condition or are pregnant.
Emergency medical number
Call 118 and ask for an ambulance. 
Contact your insurance company quickly if you’re referred to a medical facility for treatment.
Vaccine recommendations and health risks   
At least 8 weeks before your trip:
check the latest vaccine recommendations for Indonesia
see where to get vaccines and whether you have to pay on the NHS travel vaccinations page
See what health risks you’ll face in Indonesia, including:
poor air quality
Zika virus
malaria
dengue
Air pollution
Air quality in Indonesia’s major cities can reach levels classed as ‘unhealthy for sensitive groups’ or ‘unhealthy’. You can check current air quality data for Jakarta on the Air Quality Index website.
Ash plumes from volcanoes can have an impact on health, particularly for anyone with pre-existing respiratory conditions. If you’re affected, get advice on how to prepare and cope with ash fall. 
During the dry season from May to November, widespread wildfires cause smoke haze, which drifts across parts of Indonesia, particularly Riau Islands, central Sumatra and Kalimantan. The haze can cause disruption to local and regional air travel, and the air pollution has an impact on public health. Keep up to date with local information and seek medical advice on appropriate precautions. A regional haze map is available from the Singapore Meteorological Service.
Tap water
Tap water is not safe to drink in Indonesia.
Altitude sickness

Rabies
 There are many street dogs in Bali and elsewhere, and monkeys around temples and tourist areas. Rabies exists in both wild and domestic animals, including pets. Seek immediate medical assistance if you’re bitten or scratched.
 Medication
The legal status and regulation of some medicines prescribed or bought in the UK can be different in other countries.

Healthcare in Indonesia
The standard of local medical care can be poor and some medical tests cannot be performed reliably. Psychological and psychiatric services are also limited.
Good medical care can be expensive. In remote areas, you may not be able to get treatment for serious injuries or illness. Medical evacuation can cost tens of thousands of pounds. Make sure you have adequate travel health insurance and accessible funds to cover the cost of any medical treatment abroad and repatriation.
