There are still commercial options to return to the UK from Uruguay.
If you live in the UK and are currently visiting Uruguay, you’re strongly advised to return now by commercial means. Don’t risk getting stranded.
UK special charter flights will only operate for priority countries where commercial flights are not possible. You should not assume that these flights will become available in Uruguay. Please do not contact the contracted travel management company if no special charter flight is advertised here.
Commercial flights
Iberia have flights scheduled to Madrid every Monday, Thursday and Friday in August and 3 times a week in September. Air Europa have flights scheduled twice a week to Madrid in August and September.
Only Uruguayan nationals and legal residents are allowed to enter Uruguay at present. See Entry Requirements
British Nationals returning to the UK will be able to transit Madrid with proof of onward travel to the UK.
Flights are at near full capacity. Check with your travel agent for seat availability. You should also read FCO Spain Travel Advice for any requirements for entering Spain.
Travelling via Sao Paulo
Amaszonas have flights scheduled to fly to Sao Paulo from Montevideo on every Saturday in August, which may be subject to change. We do not know if they will have any more flights out of Uruguay after then.
Transit passengers cannot spend more than 24 hours in Sao Paulo. You should have your travel booked to final destination before starting any journey, as you may not be allowed to board your flight without proof.
From Sao Paulo there are flights to Europe with Lufthansa, KLM, TAP, Air France and occasional LATAM flights to London. Eurotunnel is running services though you may have to fill out a health declaration.
How to book
To travel with Amaszonas contact a travel agent to include onward travel or call Amaszonas direct on +598 (0) 96 436 032 or +598 2710 2200 or e-mail cfuentes@amaszonas.com. If you have any problems booking your Amaszonas flights please email the Embassy on: consular.enquiriesmontevideo@fco.gov.uk.
You will need to pay for your return travel to the UK. If departure options are available but you cannot afford the travel costs and have exhausted all other options for getting funds, you may be eligible to apply for an emergency loan from the government. This is a last resort option and you would need to repay the loan when you are back in the UK. For more information, contact Corporate Travel Management (CTM). CTM are a commercial partner of the FCO and are authorised to administer such loans on behalf of the FCO.
Your journey home: re-entering the UK
When you return, you must follow the rules for entering the UK. You:
need to provide your journey and contact details up to 48 hours before you’re due to arrive in the UK
are not allowed to leave the place you’re staying for the first 14 days you’re in the UK except in very limited situations (known as ‘self-isolating’)
See also the list of people who are exempt from the border rules.
The National Travel Health Network and Centre (NaTHNaC) also provides advice on how to stay safe as you travel by air.
