This page has information on travelling to Georgia.
This page reflects the UK government’s understanding of current rules for people travelling on a full ‘British Citizen’ passport, for the most common types of travel.
The authorities in Georgia set and enforce entry rules. If you’re unsure how Georgia’s entry requirements apply to you, contact its UK embassy or consulate.
All travellers
The Foreign Ministry website is regularly updated with details of the latest entry requirements. As of 15 June 2022, foreign citizens do not need to provide proof of vaccination or a negative test result to enter Georgia.
Check your passport and travel documents before you travel
Passport validity
If you are visiting Georgia, your passport should be valid for the proposed duration of your stay. No additional period of validity beyond this is required by Georgian legislation. However, you should take into consideration the requirements of any countries you are transiting.
If you are in Georgia, and your passport has expired, you should apply for a new full validity UK passport. Please use this guidance to complete the application form and submit it at the Visa Application Centre in Tbilisi. If your passport has expired and you need to travel urgently you may be eligible for an Emergency Travel Document. Please follow the passport guidance linked above for more information.
Check with your travel provider to make sure your passport and other travel documents meet their requirements.
Visas
British nationals do not need a visa to enter Georgia for visits of up to one year. If you wish to stay for longer or to travel to Georgia for work or study, you need to apply for a longer term visa category. Contact the Embassy of Georgia in London or visit the Georgian Ministry of Foreign Affairs website for more details on entry requirements.
In exceptional cases the Border Police may refuse entry to Georgia by a visitor, or by a longer-term visa holder, if they consider the traveller meets any of the criteria for exclusion set out in Georgian law.
If you are in Georgia for more than 183 days and take up any form of paid employment, you are automatically liable for income tax and must inform the Revenue Service of your employment, whether you are on a visitor’s permit or officially resident. Non-compliance will be fined.
Travel insurance
All visitors to Georgia are required to have adequate travel/health insurance for their stay. You may be asked to provide evidence of this by your airline at check-in or by the immigration authorities upon arrival in Georgia. You may face difficulties if you cannot provide evidence of valid travel insurance.
Make sure you have adequate travel health insurance and accessible funds to cover the cost of any medical treatment abroad and repatriation.
Travelling with medicines
Georgia has a very strict anti-drugs policy, which can also cover prescription and non-prescription drugs or medicines, otherwise commonly available in the UK and the European Union. For example, non-prescription medicines containing codeine are illegal in Georgia. This can cause serious problems for travellers and in some cases lead to administrative and criminal proceedings. For further information on the legal status of a specific medicine, please contact your nearest Embassy of Georgia.
If you intend to travel with prescription medicine, you must carry a doctor’s prescription and ideally the original packaging. See Health.
