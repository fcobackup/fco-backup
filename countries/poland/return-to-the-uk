There remain commercial options to return to the UK from Poland. If you live in the UK and are currently visiting Poland, you’re strongly advised to return now by commercial means. Don’t run the risk of getting stranded.
UK special charter flights will only operate for priority countries where commercial flights are not possible. You should not assume that these flights will become available in countries where commercial routes are operating. Please do not contact the contracted travel management company if no special charter flight is advertised here.
Air travel
The suspension of international air transport has been extended until midnight on 26 April and is may be further extended. Special LOT repatriation flights to and from the UK have now stopped.
Please check with your airline for the latest schedule and information on flight availability, and for refund/rebooking processes for flights up to 26 April.
Road
It remains possible for British Nationals to depart Poland by car or coach over designated land border crossings, though the situation could change rapidly. Countries neighbouring Poland have also introduced border restrictions (Czech Republic, Germany, Lithuania, Russia, Slovakia and Ukraine). Check country specific FCO travel advice for any country that you plan to transit on the way back to the UK for details.
These options require advance planning, including proof of onward travel (for example an onward flight, ferry or train ticket). However, entry is ultimately a discretionary decision for Border Guards.
It is not currently possible to enter, and therefore transit, Poland by road from neighbouring countries unless you meet very limited criteria and quarantine rules. Those allowed to enter are:
Spouses and children or individuals under the permanent care of Polish nationals; or
Holders of a Pole’s Card; or
Individuals with the right to permanent or temporary stay in Poland or people with a work permit; or
Foreign nationals driving a means of transport used for transporting goods; or
Diplomats, consular staff, representatives of international organisations and their family members transiting Poland, leaving a maximum of 24 hours after entry.
Travel via Germany
FlixBus(https://global.flixbus.com/) are operating reduced services to Berlin from a number of cities including Warsaw, Wroclaw, Krakow, Szczecin and Medyka. Limited flights to the UK are available from German cities, including Berlin. Please check FCO travel advice for Germany for further updates.
You will need to pay for your return travel to the UK. If departure options are available but you cannot afford the travel costs and have exhausted all other options for getting funds, you may be eligible to apply for an emergency loan from the government. This is a last resort option and you would need to repay the loan when you are back in the UK. For more information, you should contact Corporate Travel Management (CTM). CTM are a commercial partner of the FCO and are authorised to administer such loans on behalf of the FCO.
Arrival in the UK
When you arrive back in the UK, follow the guidance for when you return to the UK on steps you should take to protect yourself and others.
