Travel in the Philippines
Measures have been introduced by the Philippine government to prevent the spread of coronavirus; these differ across the country. The National Capital Region (Metro Manila), Bulacan, Cavite, Laguna and Rizal are subject to Modified Enhanced Community Quarantine (MECQ) measures until 18 August.
Domestic air services to and from Ninoy Aquino International Airport (NAIA) have been suspended due to the imposition of MECQ in Metro Manila. International flights may also be reduced from the current passenger cap during this period. Check with your airline for further details.
Luzon (Batangas), Visayas – Region 7, Cebu City, Lapu-Lapu and Mandaue as well as the municipalities of Consolacion and Minglanilla in Cebu Province and Zamboanga within Mindanao are subject to General Community Quarantine (GCQ) until 15 August.
The rest of the Philippines is under Modified General Community Quarantine (MGCQ). You should closely monitor announcements from local authorities to understand the latest restrictions and regulations where you are situated, and their impact on your ability to travel and access essential services. Check the requirements of your local authority such as barangay clearance, health certificate or travel authority for any travel outside of your residence, including to the airport. For further information on rules and restrictions relating to quarantine classifications, visit the Department for Health website.

You can submit your request to our Consular team via the web contact form.
