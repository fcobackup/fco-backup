Approximately 4 million British nationals visit Italy every year. Most visits are trouble-free.
Demonstrations may occur with little or no warning in cities. You should avoid any protests, political gatherings, or marches.
Crime
Crime levels are generally low but there are higher levels of petty crime (particularly bag snatching and pick-pocketing) in the big city centres, such as Rome. Thieves can use a variety of methods to distract you.
Take care on public transport and in crowded areas in city centres, particularly in and around Termini station in Rome, where incidents of street muggings have been reported, and at other main stations.
Be particularly vigilant of theft on trains to and from airports and cruise ports in Italy (especially Fiumicino airport), as well as the Circumvesuviana train between Naples and Sorrento, and when unloading your baggage from trains and coaches.
Robberies from parked cars have been reported particularly in and around Rome, Ostia, Milan and Pisa, as well as at motorway service stations. Always lock your vehicle, never leave valuables in cars and avoid leaving luggage in cars for any length of time. Be aware that thieves may use a variety of methods to distract you or encourage you to stop your car. These may include asking for help or directions, or pointing out a fictional fault with your car.
Use a hotel safe for valuables where possible.
Alcohol and drugs can make you less alert, less in control and less aware of your environment. If you are going to drink, know your limit. Drinks served in bars overseas are often stronger than those in the UK. Don’t leave food or drinks unattended at any time. Victims of spiked drinks have been robbed and sometimes assaulted.
Local travel
Only use officially licensed taxis. These will have a taxi sign on the roof and a taxi name and number written on the side. Taxis should be called or taken from a rank rather than hailed in the street. Make sure the meter in the taxi has been reset before you set off.
Transport strikes are often called at short notice. You can find information on the Ministry of Transport website (in Italian).
Traffic can be busy, fast and chaotic especially in the larger cities. Take care when crossing roads. Pedestrians should cross roads using a crossing. You can be fined for crossing the road if you are within 100 metres of a crossing but not using it. Drivers don’t always stop, even though they are required to under the Italian Traffic Code. The green pedestrian crossing signal also allows cars to turn right onto the crossing, so cross with caution.
Road travel
In 2021 there were 2,875 road deaths in Italy. This compares to 1,608 road deaths in the UK in 2021.
If you are planning to drive in Italy, see information on Driving Abroad.
Licences and documents
If you are visiting Italy, you can drive on a full, valid UK driving licence, insurance and vehicle documents. If you’re living in Italy, check the Living in Guide for information on requirements for residents.
It is against the law for anyone who has been resident in Italy for more than 90 days, to drive any car registered outside Italy. This may result in a fine and/or the car being impounded.
Driving a British car abroad
You may need a UK sticker to drive your car outside the UK. From 28 September 2021 UK stickers have replaced GB stickers. Check the GOV.UK Displaying number plates website for more information on what to do if you are driving outside the UK.
Traffic restrictions
Private and hire cars are not allowed to enter the historic centre of many Italian cities without an official pass. If your hotel is in the centre of one of these cities, you can buy a pass from most car hire companies. The boundaries of historic centres are usually marked with the letters ZTL in black on a yellow background. If you pass this sign your registration number is likely to be caught on camera and you will be fined.
There is a congestion charge for Milan city centre. For further information see the  Milan Municipality website.
To reduce pollution, the city authorities in Rome sometimes introduce traffic restrictions on specific days whereby vehicles with odd or even number plates are not allowed on the roads in the ‘fascia verde’ area (covering most of Rome). For further information, including exceptions, see the Rome Municipality website.
See the European Commission, AA, RAC and Italian Police guides on driving in Italy.
Winter sports
If you are planning a skiing holiday , take advice on weather and avalanche conditions before you travel and familiarise yourself with local skiing laws and regulations.
You can contact the Italian State Tourist Board for advice on safety and weather conditions before you travel. Address: 1 Princes Street, London W1R 9AY. Telephone: 020 7355 1557 or 1439.
Regulations for the ski season include :
Third party liability insurance is a legal requirement and can be purchased locally with a ski pass
You must wear a helmet if you are under 18
Eating and drinking is not permitted on ski lifts or boarding areas
It is forbidden to climb a slope with snowshoes unless in a case of emergency
It is forbidden to ski under the influence of alcohol or drugs
Off-piste skiing is highly dangerous. You should follow all safety instructions meticulously given the dangers of avalanches in some areas and go with a qualified guide. For more information about the avalanche risk, visit the European Avalanche Warning Service website.
You should check your insurance covers off piste activity. It is a legal requirement for skiers and snowboarders to carry tracking equipment, snow probe and shovel if they go off-piste.
Further information about how to stay safe on the slopes can be found on the gov.uk webpage Preparing for winter sports abroad #SkiSafe.
Outdoor activities and adventure tourism
Hiking, mountaineering and other adventure sports carry specific risks.
If you’re taking part in such activities check that the company is well established in the industry and that you’ve arranged for your insurance to cover this specific activity. For sports activities like skiing, potholing and mountaineering, and for sports classed as particularly dangerous (for example off-piste skiing, mountain biking, climbing, paragliding or BASE jumping), your insurance should include mountain rescue services, helicopter costs and repatriation to your country of residence or possible transfer to neighbouring countries for treatment.
Check weather forecasts and conditions and make sure you’re properly equipped for the worst-case scenario with items such as a map, compass, GPS and/or telecommunication equipment. Risks are greater if you undertake any activity alone. You may wish to consider hiring a guide for expert advice. Always leave copies of your itinerary with someone
