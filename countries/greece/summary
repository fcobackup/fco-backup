Wildfires are ongoing in the Psachna area of the island of Evia (north of Athens) and in the Corianthiakos Bay area of Thiva (north-west of Athens). The Greek authorities have evacuated villages in Evia as a precaution, and the Greek authority wildfire alert remains at category 5 (red alert). Smoke from the fire on Evia is also affecting Athens. Local authorities have advised that anyone with breathing difficulties should remain indoors and switch off air-conditioning units. If you’re in affected areas, follow the advice of the Greek authorities and monitor the website of the General Secretariat for Civil Protection for updates.

In April 2019 the Hellenic Police began implementing systematic passport control checks for all European citizens travelling to/from destinations outside the Schengen area (including the UK). This is in line with the 2017 Schengen Borders Code regulation EU 2017/458, which will eventually be applied by all Schengen member states according to the individual timescales. Waiting times at passport control may be affected on departure from and arrival into Greece. You should ensure you arrive at the airport in good time.
