Crime
Be alert to the risk of street crime and petty theft, particularly in Chisinau, and for pickpockets and bag snatchers in crowded areas. Take precautions when using ATMs, there have been instances of credit card and ATM fraud see Money
Streets, pavements, and other public paths are not well maintained or illuminated including in Chisinau and other cities. It’s useful to carry a small torch after dark, as street lighting is poor.
Keep your valuables and passport in hotel safes and carry a copy of your passport with you.
Although most visitors experience no difficulties, some visitors of Asian or Afro-Caribbean descent have reported being stared at, verbally abused, assaulted, denied entrance into some clubs and restaurants, or harassed by police.
Transnistria
Due to the situation in Ukraine, the FCDO advises against all travel to Transnistria.
There have been a number of explosions in the Transnistria region in late April. Transnistria is outside the control of the Moldovan authorities. Our ability to offer consular support within this region is extremely limited, and in the event of military action on/near the border with Ukraine, would be further reduced.
From midnight local time on 28 February, all checkpoints between Ukraine and the Transnistria region were temporarily closed. All other border crossings into Moldova remain open.
If you are in Moldova you are strongly advised to read and be aware of the Ukraine travel advice.
The Entry requirements section has further details on entry into Transnistria.
