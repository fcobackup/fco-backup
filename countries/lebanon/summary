There are currently no regular commercial options available to return to the UK direct from Lebanon, due to the Lebanese Government’s decision to close all borders. The UK government is working closely with airlines, the Lebanese authorities and other governments to make sure options are available for British nationals to return to the UK as soon as possible. See Return to the UK.
Protests which began on 17 October 2019 are ongoing. The protests have centred on Beirut and Tripoli, but have occurred at various locations nationwide, often with little notice. Violent confrontations between protesters, security forces and supporters of political groups have occurred. As a result of the protests, major roads (including to and from Beirut airport) have become blocked, there have been short notice closures of banks and petrol stations, and medical supplies may become increasingly scarce. See Political situation
Following the attack on the coalition base at Taji in Iraq on 11 March, and subsequent US airstrikes, tensions may be raised across the region. There is a possibility of an increased threat against Western interests, including against UK citizens. You should remain vigilant and keep up to date with the latest developments, including via the media and this travel advice.
The security situation in parts of Lebanon can deteriorate quickly. A conflict with Israel could spark with little warning with a rapid escalation in violence. This included an exchange of fire between the militant group Hizballah and the Israeli Defence Force across the Blue Line in the South of Lebanon on 1 September 2019. See Security situation
Terrorists are very likely to try to carry out attacks in Lebanon. You should be vigilant at all times, avoid crowds and crowded places and follow the advice of the Lebanese authorities.On 3 June 2019, a suspected terrorist killed two Lebanese army soldiers and one Lebanese policeman in Tripoli. The attacker died in the subsequent operation by the Lebanese security agencies. Be particularly vigilant at this time. See Terrorism
There’s a heightened risk of terrorism against aviation. Additional security measures have been in place on flights departing from Lebanon to the UK since March 2017. You should co-operate fully with security officials.
Groups within Lebanon, including Hizballah, are proscribed under the Terrorism Act 2000 and the Terrorist Asset-Freezing Act 2010. Offences committed under the act – including funding and supporting proscribed organisations – may be liable to prosecution in the UK.
There are unexploded ordnance and land mines in many places. You should avoid travelling away from established paths, especially when hiking. This is particularly a concern in southern Lebanon. See Local travel
You can contact the emergency services by calling 112.
If you’re abroad and you need emergency help from the UK government, contact the nearest British embassy, consulate or high commission. Consular support is severely limited in parts of Lebanon where we advise against all travel and limited where we advise against all but essential travel.
The Overseas Business Risk service offers information and advice for British companies operating overseas on how to manage political, economic, and business security-related risks.
Take out comprehensive travel and medical insurance before you travel.
