Warning
FCDO advises against all travel to parts of Niger.

This information is for people travelling on a full ‘British citizen’ passport from the UK who choose to travel against FCDO advice. It is based on the UK government’s understanding of Niger’s current rules for the most common types of travel.
The authorities in Niger set and enforce entry rules. If you’re not sure how these requirements apply to you, contact the Niger Consulate in the UK.
Passport validity requirements
Your passport should be valid for the proposed duration of your stay. No additional period of validity is needed.
Check with your travel provider that your passport and other travel documents meet requirements. Renew your passport if you need to.
You will be denied entry if you do not have a valid travel document or try to use a passport that has been reported lost or stolen.
Visa requirements
You will need a visa to enter Niger. You can apply for a visa from the Nigerien embassy in Geneva.
Visit the embassy website for application forms, payment, and more information on requirements.
Enhanced security checks
 Nigerien authorities have conducted enhanced security checks on foreign nationals arriving into Niger. In some cases, passports have been withheld for several days.
Vaccine requirements
To enter Niger, you must have a certificate to prove you’ve had a yellow fever vaccination.
Customs rules
There are strict rules about goods you can take into or out of Niger. You must declare anything that may be prohibited or subject to tax or duty.
Money
Niger is a cash-based society. Credit cards are rarely accepted even in hotels and restaurants visited by international clients. There are few ATMs. Banks accept travellers cheques. You will have to produce your passport and the receipt for the cheques from the issuing bank.
