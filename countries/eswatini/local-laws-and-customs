Drugs
Possession and smuggling of narcotics are illegal. Foreign nationals have been imprisoned on drug offences. Punishments can be severe.
LGBT
Same-sex relationships and acts are illegal in Eswatini. There is prevalent discrimination against LGBT people within society and many LGBT people are not open about their sexual orientation or gender identity. It is therefore advisable to refrain from overt displays of affection in public, such as holding hands or kissing. See our information and advice page for the LGBT community before you travel.
Drinking and driving
The drink driving laws in Swaziland state that you must have no more than 50mg of alcohol per 100ml of blood in your system or 0.38mg per 1000ml of breath exhaled. The police are quite strict on enforcement, operating random roadside checks on a regular basis.
