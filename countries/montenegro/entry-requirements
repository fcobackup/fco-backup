This page reflects the UK government’s understanding of current rules for people travelling on a full ‘British Citizen’ passport from the UK, for the most common types of travel.
The authorities in Montenegro set and enforce entry rules.
All travellers
All travellers should familiarise themselves with the entry rules for Montenegro before travel.
If you’re fully vaccinated
If you’re fully vaccinated, and have received your last vaccination dose, initial or booster, within the 6 months from the date of entry, you can enter Montenegro without needing to test or quarantine.
All types of COVID-19 vaccines are accepted.
Proof of vaccination status
You must present proof that you have been fully vaccinated to enter Montenegro.
Montenegro will accept the UK’s printed version of proof of COVID-19 vaccination record and proof of COVID-19 vaccination issued in the Crown Dependencies. They may not accept digital proof. Your most recent vaccine dose (including booster doses) must have been administered not earlier than 6 months prior to travel. Your NHS appointment card from vaccination centres is not designed to be used as proof of vaccination and should not be used to demonstrate your vaccine status.
Residents of Montenegro
Foreigners and Montenegrin citizens with temporary or permanent residence permits can enter Montenegro without any required COVID-19 related documents, but will need to quarantine or self-isolate for 10 days.
Your period of quarantine / self-isolation can be terminated after 3 days, if you can provide a negative PCR test, issued by a registered laboratory.
If you’re not fully vaccinated
If you’re not fully vaccinated, or your latest vaccination dose, initial or booster was received more than 6 months before entry to Montenegro, you’ll need to show one of the following when entering Montenegro:
proof of a negative PCR test (taken no more than 72 hours before entry),or
a negative antigen rapid test-BAT (taken no more than 48 hours before entry and issued by a registered laboratory), or
proof of a recent COVID-19 recovery: a positive PCR or a positive rapid antigen test issued by a registered laboratory, that is older than 10 days, and not older than 6 months since the date of issuing the test’s result
See information on getting a test before entry.
If you’ve had COVID-19 in the past year
If you’re not fully vaccinated but have tested positive for COVID-19 in the last 6 months you can enter Montenegro. You’ll need to show evidence of a positive PCR test or a positive rapid antigen test, issued by a registered laboratory (taken more than 10 days and less than a 6 months from the date of entry to Montenegro). You will not need to take an additional COVID-19 test.
You can not use just the UK COVID Pass result to demonstrate proof of COVID-19 recovery when entering Montenegro. You’ll also need to present a positive PCR or rapid antigen test.
Children and young people
Children aged 17 and under do not need to show proof of vaccination or any COVID test result to enter Montenegro.
If you’re transiting through Montenegro
Transiting is when you pass through one country on the way to your final destination.
If you’re transiting through Montenegro you may be exempt from the entry rules – see ‘Exemptions’ below.

Check your passport and travel documents before you travel
You should check with your travel provider to make sure your passport and other travel documents meet their requirements.
Passport validity
If you are visiting Montenegro, your passport should be issued in the last 10 years and valid for at least 3 months after your planned date of departure from Montenegro.
If you hold dual citizenship, the Montenegrin authorities will consider you a citizen of the issuing state of the passport with which you entered Montenegro.
Visas
You can enter Montenegro for short-term stays of up to 90 days without a visa. The Montenegrin law considers “stays of 90 days” as 90 days in total in a 180-day period, counted from the first entry date.
On entering Montenegro, make sure the border police put an entry stamp in your passport. This helps avoid problems related to verifying the length of your stay in the country.
If you are in the UK the Montenegrin Embassy in London will be able to advise on what kind of visa you may need before travel to Montenegro.
If you wish to extend your stay once in Montenegro, you will need to apply for a visa or a temporary residence permit from the Montenegrin Ministry of Interior Affairs no later than one week before the 90-day period expires.
Border crossings
Only enter Montenegro through recognised border crossings.
If you are planning a mountaineering tour which involves crossing borders other than at an official border crossing point, contact the National Tourist Organisation for advice.
There may be additional delays on roads approaching the border crossings between Montenegro and neighbouring countries, given coronavirus-related restrictions. See Coronavirus page for further details.
Registration
By law you must register with the local police or tourism organisation in the town/city where you are staying within 24 hours of your arrival in Montenegro, unless you are staying in a hotel or other commercial accommodation where you’ll be registered automatically on checking in.
If you do not register you may be fined, detained or face a court appearance.
Customs requirements
The Montenegro Customs Administration advises travellers of the main regulations regarding import of food, medicines, flora and fauna species, animals, tobacco and alcoholic beverages and firearms, in their downloadable guide.
Although there is no limit to the amount of money you can bring into Montenegro, you should declare sums of money in excess of €10,000 (including travellers’ cheques or equivalent in other currencies). To take more than €10,000 out of the country you will need to provide proof that you brought the money in. Customs Officers at all border points issue declaration forms. On departure, you will need to return a certified copy of this declaration to customs. For sums of money in excess of €15,000 you should also have obtained a document which states the origin of the funds. If you fail to comply with these rules, your money may be confiscated.
To avoid customs charges, declare items of value like expensive jewellery, photographic and computer equipment.
UK Emergency Travel Documents
UK Emergency Travel Documents (ETDs) are accepted by Montenegrin authorities for entry, airside transit and exit from Montenegro and are valid forms of identity documents in Montenegro.
