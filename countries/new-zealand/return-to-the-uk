Coronavirus guidance is being updated.
Read the Prime Minister’s address for the latest information.

The New Zealand Government has announced temporary restrictions on travellers in response to coronavirus (COVID-19).
Most commercial flights from New Zealand to the UK have now been suspended, and flight availability is extremely limited. The UK is operating a series of charter flights from New Zealand to help British tourists, short term visitors and their direct dependants to return to the UK.
Commercial flights
If you wish to return to the UK, the Air New Zealand/British Airways route via Los Angeles is still flying. Both airlines plan to operate this route throughout May and possibly beyond, depending on demand. We understand that the US immigration ban will not affect transit through Los Angeles International Airport (LAX) for British Nationals travelling from New Zealand. We will advise as soon as possible if we are notified otherwise, or if there are any further changes to US border policy. You should check the travel advice for the USA for the full detail on transit restrictions.
We understand from Qatar Airways that flights scheduled for departure from Auckland in June have been postponed to later in the year – potentially not before October. Flights will still depart from Sydney, Melbourne and Perth.
Transit through Australia is restricted, but you can apply for exemptions. Full details can be found in our Australia Travel Advice.
Travelling to the airport
Foreign nationals in New Zealand can use public or private transport to travel to the airport in order to connect with international flights to their home country. Under Alert Level 3 you can only travel within New Zealand for the purpose of reaching the airport, and you must have a ticket for an outbound international flight before leaving your location. Under Alert Level 3 domestic travel is only permitted within 24 hours of a confirmed international flight.
Several criteria apply to domestic travel to get international flights home. See the New Zealand government’s COVID-19 website for full details. Check details of public transport in Auckland and public transport in Christchurch.
UK charter flights
The UK is operating a series of charter flights from New Zealand to help British tourists, short term visitors and their direct dependants to return to the UK.
The first group of flights departed Auckland on 24, 28 April and 2 May and Christchurch on 26 and 30 April, flying to London Heathrow via Hong Kong.
In response to demand, the UK set up a second group of flights, departing Auckland on 11, 15 May and Christchurch on 13 May, also to London Heathrow via Hong Kong. While transit services have been suspended in Hong Kong for all commercial flights, we have arranged special transit access for these flights only. All flights depart at 1:40pm.
These flights are open to British travellers and their direct dependants in New Zealand.
There are a limited number of seats remaining on the flights for 13 and 15 May, for which we will be prioritising the elderly, vulnerable and those in financial difficulties. Those who want to travel and fit these categories, or have another urgent need to travel, are advised to register.
How to book
If you would like to travel, register with our travel partner Corporate Travel Management (CTM) through their website:
register on waitlist Auckland flight on 15 May
register on waitlist for Christchurch flight on 13 May
You should note that:
to be eligible to take these flights, you must be normally resident in the UK. Eligibility, including your address in the UK, will be checked before tickets are issued
the flight costs £800 per person including children (infants up to 2 years old are free). You will be asked for your credit card details when you register with CTM, but will not be charged until you have a confirmed seat
the plane will be fully loaded, there will be no middle spare seat or PPE provided. Our priority is for as many British nationals to fly home as possible
you will not be able to travel if you are displaying any symptoms of coronavirus (COVID-19). The airline will carry out temperature checks on passengers before boarding. You will be asked to fill in a health questionnaire on-board in advance of your Hong Kong transit
you will be responsible for making their own onward domestic travel arrangements on arrival in the UK
Once you have registered, CTM will contact you to confirm whether you have secured a booking.
Help with your booking
If you are not able to complete your booking online, have any questions, or are unsure whether to travel, email the British High Commission at UKinNZ.COVIDResponse@fco.gov.uk.
You may find it helpful to read our guide to eligibility and the booking process for special charter flights.
You will need to pay for your return travel to the UK. If you cannot afford the travel costs and have exhausted all other options for getting funds, you may be eligible to apply for an emergency loan from the government. This is a last resort option and you would need to repay the loan when you are back in the UK. If you believe you may be eligible for this support for charter flights, contact UKinNZ.COVIDResponse@fco.gov.uk.
Travelling to the airport
You will need to make your own arrangements for transport to the airport. Do not make domestic travel arrangements until you have had an email from CTM to confirm your flight arrangements.
Under current New Zealand Government restrictions, you should take the most direct route and carry proof of your onward international travel. Domestic travel is only permitted within 24 hours of a confirmed international flight. CTM can assist with domestic flights, car hire or bus bookings within New Zealand to get you to the airport, and will contact you about your requirements once you have a confirmed booking on a charter flight.
