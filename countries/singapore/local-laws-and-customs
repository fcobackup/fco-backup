Death penalty
The death penalty exists for certain offences, including murder and drug trafficking. Trafficking is defined by possession of drugs above a certain amount (500g in the case of cannabis). There are severe penalties for all drug offences in Singapore, including possession. The Misuse of Drugs Act sets out the definitions.
Drunk and disorderly conduct
Drunk and disorderly conduct is a serious crime in Singapore. You should drink responsibly and know your limits.
Convicted offenders may face the following penalties, depending on the severity of the crime:
up to SGD5,000 (about £2,500) in fines
up to 15 years’ imprisonment
caning
Drinking in public places
As of 1 April 2015, it’s illegal to drink alcohol in a public place between 10.30pm and 7am. You can drink alcohol between these hours in:
restaurants
bars and cafes
the outdoor areas of private condominiums and chalets
outdoor events that have obtained a permit.
Geylang and Little India are designated as ‘Liquor Control Zones’. This means drinking in public places is prohibited all weekend, on public holidays and on the eve of public holidays. If you ignore this:
you could be fined up to SGD1,000 (approximately £500).
if you’re a repeat offender, you could be fined up to SGD2,000 (about £1,000) or sent to prison for up to 3 months.
E-cigarettes and smoking
You can’t bring vaporisers, like e-cigarettes, e-pipes, e-cigars, and refills into the country. These items are likely to be confiscated, and you could be fined or sent to prison.
The minimum age for the purchase, use, possession, sale and supply of all tobacco products in Singapore is 20 years old. This will be raised to 21 years old in 2021. Failure to comply carries fines. Along Orchard Road smoking is only permitted in designated smoking areas.
Visa overstay
Penalties for overstaying your visa include fines, imprisonment, corporal punishment (caning) and deportation depending on the length of overstay.
Outrage of modesty
You should avoid any action that could be interpreted as molestation. Scams involving false claims of molestation are thought to exist. Penalties for convicted offenders include a fine, imprisonment, and/or corporal punishment (caning).
Retention of passports during police investigations
If you’re the subject of a police investigation, your passport will be confiscated by the authorities. It will be returned to you once the investigation has concluded (if you’re convicted, it will be returned after you have served your sentence).
Investigations can take anywhere from a few days to several months, depending on the crime. In most cases, you aren’t allowed to leave Singapore while the investigation is ongoing. The British High Commission can’t interfere in these investigations, nor negotiate the release of your passport.
Others
Disrespecting public servants is treated seriously by the police.
A police permit is required for any outdoor public assembly or procession. You should avoid street gatherings and public demonstrations as they might be illegal. Filming an illegal public gathering is also forbidden, as is the wearing or displaying of any ‘cause related’ material without permission.
Approval from the Ministry of Manpower is required for a foreign national to give a talk on ‘racial, communal, religious, caused-related or political topics’.
The public display of national flags or national emblems is illegal except where a specific exemption has been granted.
Male homosexual acts are illegal in Singapore, but in a statement to Parliament in 2007 Singapore’s Prime Minister stated that ‘the government does not act as moral policemen’ and that ‘we do not proactively enforce’ the law on this issue. Openly gay and lesbian support groups and social venues exist. See our information and advice page for the LGBT community before you travel.
Both public and private Jehovah’s Witness meetings are illegal in Singapore. It is also against the law to possess any Jehovah’s Witness publication, including a Jehovah’s Witness bible. Similar measures exist against the Unification Church.
On-the-spot fines are common, and can be given for a wide range of behaviours which are tolerated in the UK. You’ll be fined for littering and smoking in some public places. It’s also illegal to bring chewing gum into the country, except for certain medical chewing gums.
Thorough checks may be carried out on departing travellers’ vehicles. Fingerprints may be scanned at border exit points.
The use of false ID is illegal.
There is zero tolerance for bribery. Any attempt to bribe or to otherwise prevent an official from carrying out their duties can result in arrest.
Acts of vandalism including graffiti carry harsh penalties such as fines, imprisonment and caning.
There are strict laws regarding rental of short-term accommodation.
