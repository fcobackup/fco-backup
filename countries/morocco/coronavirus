Coronavirus travel health
Check the latest information on risk from COVID-19 for Morocco on the TravelHealthPro website.
See the TravelHealthPro website for further advice on travel abroad and reducing spread of respiratory viruses during the COVID-19 pandemic.
International travel
With effect from midnight on 20 December, the Moroccan Government has suspended until further notice all direct flights between Morocco and the UK following the emergence of a new strain of COVID-19 in the UK. Passengers arriving in Morocco by air, travelling from the UK via a third country are also not allowed to enter Morocco. British nationals planning to travel between the two countries should contact their airlines, ferry and/or tour operators for further information.
With effect from 11pm on 30 March 2021, the Moroccan Government has suspended all regular flights until further notice between Morocco and France and Spain. All passengers from those countries travelling through another country are not allowed to enter Morocco. The only exceptions are over flights, cargo, and medical flights.
The Moroccan Government is, however, allowing a number of “ad hoc” flights from Morocco to France and any travellers interested in this option should contact Air France or Transavia by telephone if possible for flight information and bookings. Flights may be advertised at short notice and on an irregular basis, and a flight will only take place if enough seats are booked to make it viable. If not, the process will be repeated, so some persistence may be required. Routes to the UK may also be possible via several African countries, as well as the United Arab Emirates and Bahrain. As restrictions to flights can be imposed with little notice, travellers should consult airlines, relevant airline websites and airline search sites or speak to their travel agency to confirm which routes are currently available. Travellers transiting through third countries should ensure they consult FCDO Travel Advice for that country for the latest COVID-19 related travel and transit guidance.
British nationals in Morocco who require consular assistance should call the British Embassy on + 212 (0) 537 63 33 33 and follow the voice menu for “option 4 - consular assistance”.

COVID-19 vaccines if you live in Morocco
Wherever possible British nationals should aim to be vaccinated in the country where they live. As further information is available about the national vaccination programme, this page will be updated. Sign up to get email notifications.
Morocco began rollout of a national COVID-19 vaccination programme on 28 January 2021 and has set a target of 80% of the population to receive their vaccination before the end of May 2021. The Moroccan authorities have issued guidance on how to get a vaccine in Morocco (only available in French or Arabic). The guidance includes information on how you can register if you live in Morocco.
If you do not speak French or Arabic and need support accessing the vaccination campaign, you can call “Allo Liqah Corona” on: +212 (0)8 0000 0147 where English-speaking operators are also available.
You must possess a Moroccan residence card to access the vaccine programme. If you are resident in Morocco but have not formalised this with the Moroccan authorities, you can find advice on our living in Morocco page.
The Medicines and Healthcare Products Regulatory Agency (MHRA) is the UK authority responsible for assessing the safety, quality and efficacy of vaccines. It has authorised the Pfizer/BioNTech, Oxford/AstraZeneca and Moderna vaccines for temporary supply and use in the UK. Find out more about MHRA approval for these vaccines.
British nationals living overseas should seek medical advice from their local healthcare provider in the country where they reside. Information about vaccines used in other national programmes, including regulatory status, should be available from the local authorities. This list of Stringent Regulatory Authorities recognised by the World Health Organisation may also be a useful source of additional information. Find out more about COVID-19 vaccines on the World Health Organisation COVID-19 vaccines page.
