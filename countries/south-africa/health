Before you travel check that: 
you have appropriate travel insurance for local treatment or unexpected medical evacuation
your destination can provide the healthcare you may need
This is particularly important if you have a health condition or are pregnant. 
Emergency medical number
Dial 112 (from a mobile) or 10177 and ask for an ambulance.
Contact your insurance or medical assistance company quickly if you’re referred to a medical facility for treatment.
There may be other regional emergency numbers available, check locally.
Vaccine recommendations and health risks
At least 8 weeks before your trip:
check the latest vaccine recommendations for South Africa
see where to get vaccines and whether you have to pay on the NHS travel vaccinations page
See what health risks you’ll face in South Africa, including:   
malaria
chikungunya
cholera
Altitude sickness is a risk in parts of South Africa, including Johannesburg. Read more about altitude sickness on TravelHealthPro.
HIV 
HIV is a risk in South Africa. Take normal precautions to avoid exposure to HIV/AIDS. There is more information on sexually transmitted infection risk and prevention for travellers on TravelHealthPro. 
Medication
The legal status and regulation of some medicines prescribed or bought in the UK can be different in other countries.
If you take regular medication, make sure you can get repeat prescriptions if needed. Most prescription medicines in the UK need a prescription (‘script’) from a doctor in South Africa. The doctor may ask you to get an electronic prescription from your medical practitioner in the UK. There are pharmacies across the country – some have medical practitioners on site who can write prescriptions.
TravelHealthPro explains best practice when travelling with medicines.
Healthcare in South Africa
There is no healthcare agreement between the UK and South Africa.
Public medical care varies across South Africa. Standards of treatment and hygiene may not be the same as in the UK.
South Africa has a very high standard of private medical care. Private healthcare can be expensive, so make sure you have the right travel health insurance and funds to cover the cost of medical treatment abroad and repatriation if needed.
FCDO has a list of medical providers in South Africa.  
Rehabilitation centres for drug or alcohol addiction
Private rehabilitation centres are widely accessible to foreign visitors. You should read available guidance on rehabilitation, recovery and residential treatment in South Africa, if you are considering attending an inpatient treatment programme.
You should also:
do extensive research beforehand
choose a reputable facility that is registered with the South African Department of Social Development or the Western Cape’s Substance Use Disorder Service
get the right visa for your stay
get the right travel insurance, including medical cover suitable for a rehabilitation stay and your particular circumstances
Make plans in case: 
you relapse abroad
treatment is unsuccessful
you need unplanned repatriation to the UK – this may need to include access to extra funds
TravelHealthPro has information on travelling abroad for treatment. 
International Association for Medical Assistance to Travellers has information on the impact of travel and substance use. 
The British High Commission in Pretoria does not usually contact or visit people who have travelled specifically for medical treatment. 
Travel and mental health
Read FCDO guidance on travel and mental health. There is also guidance on TravelHealthPro.
