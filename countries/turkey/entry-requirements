The information on this page covers the most common types of travel and reflects the UK government’s understanding of the rules currently in place. Unless otherwise stated, this information is for travellers using a full ‘British Citizen’ passport.
The authorities in the country or territory you’re travelling to are responsible for setting and enforcing the rules for entry. If you’re unclear about any aspect of the entry requirements, or you need further reassurance, you’ll need to contact the embassy, high commission or consulate of the country or territory you’re travelling to.
You should also consider checking with your transport provider or travel company to make sure your passport and other travel documents meet their requirements.
Reopening of international borders
From 12 June, the Turkish government has begun to reopen its international land, sea and air borders. Scheduled passenger flights will resume on an individual country basis, subject to coordination with the Ministry of Health. Direct, scheduled passenger flights between Turkey and the UK resumed on 11 June. All passengers, of all nationalities, who meet Turkish immigration rules are permitted entry to Turkey from 12 June.
Due to restrictions imposed in other countries, in some cases, the resumption of scheduled passenger flights may not be possible until those countries have eased their own restrictions, and given permission for flights to resume to and from Turkey. For the latest information, please check with the airlines directly.
Passengers are required to wear a face mask at all times whilst in an airport, and for the duration of all flights, to and from Turkey. Passengers are required to complete a passenger locator form prior to arriving in Turkey, details of which will be provided by the operating airline.
All arrivals into Turkey will be subject to a medical evaluation for symptoms of coronavirus, including temperature checks. Any passengers showing symptoms including high fever, coughing or respiratory difficulties will be will be required to undergo a PCR test (a swab test – see here for details) for coronavirus. In the event that a test returns a positive result, you will be provided with medical treatment at a facility determined by the Ministry of Health or, if preferred, at a private medical facility in Turkey at your own expense.
Turkey has opened its land crossings into Turkey from Greece, Bulgaria, Georgia and Iraq. The land crossing into Iran remains closed. Leaving Turkey via these land borders is subject to any entry restrictions imposed in the country of arrival. You should check the relevant FCO Travel Advice page for that country for further information.
Sea ports of entry are now open.
Visas
British Citizens travelling to Turkey for tourist or business purposes are able to travel without a visa for visits of up to 90 days in any 180-day period. Turkish authorities have confirmed that any foreign nationals who overstay their visa, due to COVID-19, will not face any fines or penalties, provided they depart Turkey within 1 month of flights resuming to their country of citizenship. British nationals in Turkey who have overstayed their visa should depart Turkey by 11:59pm Turkish time on 11 July, to avoid being subject to penalties.
Penalties will be as follows:
Those departing from 12 July to 11 October will incur an administrative fine
Those departing from 12 October onwards will be banned from Turkey for a period of time determined by the length of overstay.
If you hold a different type of British nationality (eg BN(O), British Overseas Citizen, British Protected Person or British Subject), check visa requirements with the Turkish Consulate General before you travel. These types of passport are classed as ‘UK Special Passports’ in the Turkish e-Visa system. You’ll need to apply for a visa from the Turkish Consulate General before you travel.
If you plan to remain in Turkey for a period of more than 90 days, you should either apply for a longer stay visa before you travel, or get a residence permit from the local authorities in Turkey before your 90 day stay has elapsed. If you intend to work in Turkey, ensure you have the correct permits. More information is available from the Turkish Ministry of the Interior. If you don’t abide by the terms of your visa or permit, you may be fined, deported and banned from re-entering the country.
If you’re entering Turkey via a land border crossing, make sure your passport has a dated entry stamp before you leave the border crossing area.
