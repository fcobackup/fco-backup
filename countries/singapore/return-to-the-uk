There remain commercial options to return to the UK from Singapore.
If you live in the UK and are currently visiting Singapore, you are strongly advised to return to the UK now by commercial means. Donâ€™t run the risk of being stranded.
UK special charter flights will only operate for priority countries where commercial flights are not possible. You should not assume that these flights will become available in countries where commercial routes are operating.
Flights
Singapore Airlines continue to run direct flights between Singapore and London, at a reduced schedule of 3 flights per week.
Qatar Airways continue to fly between Singapore and the UK via Doha. Transit passengers travelling to the UK are still able to transit in Qatar. Availability on this route is limited.
There may be other indirect routes to the UK available. Before booking a flight, you should check requirements with your airline and consult travel advice for any entry or transit restrictions in place in countries on your flight route.
Flights are subject to change or cancellation at short notice.
You will need to pay for your return travel to the UK. If departure options are available but you cannot afford the travel costs and have exhausted all other options for getting funds, you may be eligible to apply for an emergency loan from the government. This is a last resort option and you would need to repay the loan when you are back in the UK. For more information, you should contact Corporate Travel Management (CTM). CTM are a commercial partner of the FCO and are authorised to administer such loans on behalf of the FCO.
