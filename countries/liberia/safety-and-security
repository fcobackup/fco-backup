Terrorism
There is a high threat of terrorist attack globally affecting UK interests and British nationals, including from groups and individuals who view the UK and British nationals as targets. Stay aware of your surroundings at all times.
UK Counter Terrorism Policing has information and advice on staying safe abroad and what to do in the event of a terrorist attack. Find out how to reduce your risk from terrorism while abroad. 
Terrorism in Liberia 
Although there is no recent history of terrorism in Liberia, attacks cannot be ruled out. 
Terrorist groups in West Africa continue to mount attacks in the region. Attacks could be indiscriminate, including in places frequented by foreign nationals, such as:
beach resorts 
hotels 
cafés and restaurants
Stay aware of your surroundings, keep up to date with local media reports and follow the advice of local authorities. 
Political situation
Liberia is generally stable politically, but protests and demonstrations do occasionally happen. Avoid protests, demonstrations, political rallies and large crowds. Follow the advice of local authorities. 
Crime 
The crime rate in Liberia is high. Liberians are the main victims of crime, but foreign nationals can be targeted. Most crime is opportunistic theft, but there are organised criminal gangs. Thieves are often armed with knives or machetes, and occasionally carry firearms.
Protecting yourself and your belongings
Foreign nationals have been mugged in the Mamba Point and Sinkor areas of Monrovia, where most international visitors stay. Criminals also operate in nightclubs and on beaches during the day. 
Foreigners have reported assault and robbery happening in taxis. 
You can take steps to reduce your personal risk by: 
not carrying valuables or large sums of money in public 
avoiding walking around Monrovia after dark 
avoiding isolated areas after dark, including beaches 
only staying in reputable accommodation with suitable security arrangements 
arranging for transport, including to and from the airport, in advance 
Sexual assault 
Liberia has a high rate of rape and sexual assault. There have been cases of rapes and attempted rapes of foreign women although these are rare. 
Laws and cultural differences
Personal ID 
Carry photo ID with you at all times, such as your driving licence or a copy of the photo page of your passport. You may be asked to show it at any time by immigration officials or the police. 
Drug trafficking and diamond smuggling 
Drug trafficking and diamond smuggling are illegal. If convicted you’ll get a long prison sentence. Local prison conditions are harsh. 
LGBT+ travellers 
Same-sex sexual activity is illegal in Liberia.
Read more advice for LGBT+ travellers. 
Adoption in Liberia 
The Ministry of Justice in Liberia can issue a decree of adoption if all legal requirements are met. However, adoption orders from Liberia are not recognised in the UK. If you’re returning to live in the UK, you’ll need to apply for entry clearance for the child as a Liberian child coming for adoption in the UK. 
Money 
Credit and debit cards are not generally accepted in Liberia, except for a few of the major hotels and some larger supermarkets. They may be unable to process card payments when internet connections are poor. Not many places accept travellers cheques.
There are a few ATMs that accept Visa cards in Monrovia, including in the 2 main hotels used by international visitors. ATMs often run out of money.
Foreign exchange and banking facilities are limited. Western Union and MoneyGram can transfer money from the UK, although there are very few offices outside Monrovia.
Liberia’s banks are currently experiencing cash shortages of both US dollars and Liberian dollars. Banks and foreign exchange facilities may not be able to pay out transferred funds or fulfil ATM withdrawals. Bring sufficient funds, in US dollars, to cover all expenses.
Outdoor activities
Swimming and water safety
Beaches in Liberia can have rip tides and other dangerous currents. Get local advice before going in the water.
See water safety on holiday from the Royal Life Saving Society. 
Avoid canoes and fishing boats offering passenger services. They are regularly overwhelmed by strong waves and currents. 
Sporting events 
The Samuel K Doe Stadium in Monrovia can become overcrowded during major football matches or events. 
Transport risks
Road travel
If you’re planning to drive in Liberia, see information on driving abroad. 
Get security advice about travelling by road anywhere outside Monrovia. 
Most foreign nationals travelling by road outside Monrovia will hire a car with a driver, and travel in convoy of at least 2 vehicles in case of breakdowns or possible attacks. 
Road conditions and driving standards 
The roads from Monrovia to the port town of Buchanan and to the border with Sierra Leone at Bo Waterside, and to the border with Guinea at Ganta, are mainly paved and in reasonable condition.
Most other roads outside Monrovia are unpaved. Roads outside Monrovia can be treacherous and most are unlit.
The road from Monrovia to Roberts International Airport is currently undergoing roadworks and can be hazardous. 
Driving and road conditions deteriorate significantly during the rainy season from May to November, and many roads become impassable. 
The standard of driving is generally poor, and many vehicles do not have lights. Drivers often swerve to avoid potholes and taxis can slow or stop unpredictably to pick up or drop off passengers. Motorcycle taxis (‘pein-peins’) are particularly dangerous.
If you’re involved in a traffic accident, be aware that local crowds can become hostile and may attempt to attack you.
The Liberian National Police and other security authorities operate checkpoints on roads throughout the country. You’re more vulnerable to being robbed at an illegal checkpoint at night.
Pull over to the side of the road immediately when instructed by security forces travelling with VIP convoys.
Air travel 
The UK Air Safety List (ASL) lists all known airlines in Liberia that do not meet international safety standards and are banned from operating commercial air services to, from, and within the UK. Check the UK Air Safety List when considering which airlines to fly with. The list is maintained by the Department for Transport, based on advice from the UK Civil Aviation Authority.
