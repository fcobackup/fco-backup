If you happen to visit a ‘hotspot’ on the same day as someone infected by the virus, you’ll receive a health alert via SMS and may need to be tested. Read further information in the Ministry of Health press release on reopening.

Anyone requiring a COVID-19 polymerase chain reaction (PCR) test can get it from one of the clinics approved by the Ministry of Health.
These clinics issue digital test result certificates. You should have these digital certificates notarised before you travel. Anyone looking to have their digital certificates notarised can use the services provided by the Government of Singapore.

COVID-19 vaccines if you live in Singapore
Wherever possible British nationals should aim to be vaccinated in the country where they live. As further information is available about the national vaccination programme, this page will be updated. Sign up to get email notifications.
The Singapore government has stated that it will vaccinate all residents and long-term visitors (including Permanent Residents, Employment Pass, S-Pass and Work Permit holders, foreign domestic workers, Dependent Pass, Long-Term Visit Pass and Student Pass holders). More information, including on registration, can be found at Singapore’s COVID-19 vaccination website. A Vaccine Injury Financial Assistance Programme exists to cover any vaccine related impacts on health.
All Permanent Residents and citizens may appeal for early vaccination if they have an urgent need to travel overseas for formal education or to move overseas for work, to travel to visit or care for a critically ill immediate family member, or for their own medical treatment if it cannot be accessed in Singapore. Applications can be made on the Singapore Ministry of Health website.
The local authorities have warned that vaccine-related scams exist. If in doubt, check the Ministry of Health website or call their hotline on 1800-333-9999.
The Medicines and Healthcare products Regulatory Agency (MHRA) is the UK authority responsible for assessing the safety, quality and efficacy of vaccines. It has authorised the Pfizer/BioNTech, Oxford/AstraZeneca and Moderna vaccines for temporary supply and use in the UK. Find out more about MHRA approval for these vaccines.
British nationals living overseas should seek medical advice from their local healthcare provider in the country where they reside. Information about vaccines used in other national programmes, including regulatory status, should be available from the local authorities. This list of Stringent Regulatory Authorities recognised by the World Health Organisation may also be a useful source of additional information. Find out more about COVID-19 vaccines on the World Health Organisation COVID-19 vaccines page.
