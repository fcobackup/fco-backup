Terrorism in Maldives  
Terrorists are likely to try and carry out attacks in Maldives.
Attacks could be indiscriminate, including in places visited by foreigners. Stay aware of your surroundings, keep up to date with local media reports and follow the advice of local authorities.
The Maldivian authorities have disrupted a number of terrorist attack plans since 2017, and have made several arrests relating to attack planning, recruitment of terrorist fighters and spreading extremist ideology. There have been anti-Western protests by extremists on some islands, including expressions of support for Daesh.
Examples of recent significant attacks include:
in 2021, a high-profile politician and a number of bystanders were injured by the detonation of an improvised explosive device (IED) in central Malé
in 2020 there was an arson attack on a police speedboat in Laamu Gan
in 2020, knife attacks that injured 3 foreigners in Hulhumalé were claimed by Daesh supporters
Political situation
Political protests take place occasionally in Malé. Avoid any protests or rallies to ensure your safety and security.  
Crime
Crime levels are low in the exclusive resort islands, but petty crime does happen. Do not leave items unattended on the beach or in unlocked hotel rooms.
Outside the resorts, there are incidents of gang-related violence including knife crime, mainly in Malé and in Hulhumalé. Avoid empty roads when on foot, particularly after dark.
Laws and cultural differences
Maldives is an Islamic country. It is illegal to publicly observe a religion other than Islam. Make sure that your actions do not offend, especially during Ramadan or when visiting religious areas around mosques. Violations of local laws may lead to a prison sentence.
Ramadan is a holy month for Muslims. The dates vary by year and country. In 2024 Ramadan is expected to take place between 11 March and 10 April in Maldives. During this time, do not eat, drink or smoke in public in the daytime, outside of holiday resorts. Get more advice when you arrive from your tour guide, hotel or business contacts.
Alcohol laws and bans
Alcoholic drinks are only available on resort islands. Do not take any alcohol out of your resort. You can be arrested and deported for possessing and drinking alcohol, or being intoxicated outside resorts and on inhabited islands.    
Illegal drugs and prison sentences
Maldives has strong anti-drugs laws. Importing or possessing drugs carries severe penalties, up to and including life imprisonment.
Wildlife, animal products and souvenirs
It is illegal to take tortoiseshell jewellery or ornaments, or pieces of coral out of Maldives. 
LGBT+ travellers
Same-sex relations are illegal and if you are convicted, you could get a fine or a lengthy prison sentence.    
Read more advice for LGBT+ travellers.
Local dress standards
You should be sensitive to local dress standards when outside holiday resorts, including on beaches used by locals. Men and women should:
have shoulders covered
avoid short or tight-fitting shorts
have arms and upper legs covered when bathing
Nudism and topless sunbathing are not allowed anywhere, including on resort islands.
Outdoor activities and adventure tourism
Swimming safety
The sea around Maldives can have strong tidal currents and a number of tourists drown every year. Always take local advice before going into the sea.
Scuba diving
Many resort islands are more than an hour away from the nearest decompression chamber. Make sure you understand how your dive operator would get you to one of the 3 hyperbaric chambers in the islands. 
Transport risks
Road travel
If you are planning to drive a car in Maldives, see information on driving abroad.
You’ll need to have both the correct version of the international driving permit (IDP) and your UK driving licence with you in the car. 
Hire car companies often have stricter requirements for their customers, such as a year of driving experience and minimum age 20 or 21.
Sea travel
There is a high risk of piracy and armed robbery in the Gulf of Aden and Indian Ocean.
There have been attacks on local fishing sailing vessels (dhows) in the Gulf of Aden and Horn of Africa. The international Naval Counter Piracy Forces advise all sailing yachts to stay out of the designated High Risk Area because of the risk of hijack or hostage-taking for ransom by criminal groups.
Extreme weather and natural disasters
Flooding
Flash flooding can affect low-lying islands during periods of heavy rain. Follow the advice of the local authorities.
