As of 14 March, we advise against all but essential travel to Liberia due to the high risk of quarantine for British nationals arriving in country.
Some airlines have suspended international flights into/out of Liberia or reduced the frequency of their flights. You should contact your airline or travel company to check for any changes.
There is an ongoing outbreak of coronavirus (COVID-19) in China, some other countries in the region and elsewhere. The Liberian authorities have introduced a number of measures to limit the spread of the virus. Measures include mandatory quarantine for some travellers entering Liberia.
There is a high risk that British nationals will be put into 14 days of quarantine while the authorities impose travel restrictions. See Health and Entry Requirements
We are not advising British nationals resident in Liberia to leave as the risks of quarantine for them are much lower.
Protests and demonstrations do take place in Monrovia on occasion. You should avoid protests, demonstrations, large gatherings and crowds and follow the advice of local authorities.
Terrorists are likely to try to carry out attacks in Liberia. Attacks could be indiscriminate. You should be vigilant, especially in places visited by foreigners. See Terrorism
General medical facilities throughout Liberia are unable to provide the same standard of healthcare as in the UK. Facilities in rural areas are rudimentary. Many medical facilities expect to be paid up-front for treatment. If you travel to Liberia, stay in contact with your employer or host organisation about the support that they can provide to you while you’re in the country.
If you’re concerned that you might have been exposed to, or showing symptoms of Ebola or Lassa Fever, you should seek immediate medical advice. If you’re in the UK call NHS on 111.
Avoid travelling at night outside Monrovia, except to or from Roberts International Airport. Make sure you have pre-arranged transport from the airport. See Crime and Road travel
The small British Embassy in Monrovia can only offer limited consular assistance.
If you’re abroad and you need emergency help from the UK government, contact the nearest British embassy, consulate or high commission.
Take out comprehensive travel and medical insurance before you travel.
