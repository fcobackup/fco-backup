The Cayman Islands is a separate legal jurisdiction to the United Kingdom and has its own laws.
There are harsh penalties for those caught with drugs of any kind. The possession or importation of weapons (including air pistols and catapults) or ammunition (including empty magazines) is illegal. Those caught will be subject to severe penalties.
Observe customs regulations on the import and export of agricultural products and the protection of marine and animal life. There are a number of marine and animal specimens that may not be taken from the islands. If in doubt, check with the customs office before buying, or attempting to import or export such items.
Same-sex partnerships, legally binding or otherwise, arenâ€™t generally recognised in Cayman law although there is now some recognition of partnerships for immigration purposes. Last year a judicial ruling legalised marriage between same sex couples but the Cayman Islands Government appealed the decision. The Court of Appeal overturned the ruling and an appeal has been lodged with the Privy Council. Same sex marriage is no longer legal in the Cayman Islands. Hotels and resorts are generally welcoming, regardless of sexual orientation. Local attitudes can be conservative and some people may not approve of public displays of affection between same-sex couples.
