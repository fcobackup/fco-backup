Borders and travel
Commercial flights between Tunisia and all other countries were suspended at 11.59pm on 17 March. All maritime borders are closed. If you are already in Tunisia, and it is not essential that you remain, you should urgently contact your airline or tour operator and arrange to leave as soon as possible.
Local measures
A countrywide curfew is in effect from 8pm to 6am. All schools and nurseries are closed, as are all cafés and restaurants. All sporting fixtures, conferences, public prayers and events have been cancelled.
An “obligatory confinement period” is in effect between 6am and 8pm. During this time people are only expected to leave their house for essential business such as grocery shopping or medical care. The Tunisian government has also prohibited travel between cities and regions. All visitors arriving in Tunisia must self-quarantine for a period of 14 days.
At the end of April, the Tunisian authorities announced a phased change to the confinement measures. From 4 May, the majority of shops and businesses will be allowed to reopen with the exception of cafes, bars, restaurants and hairdressers. Schools and nurseries remain closed.
The authorities have announced that the following groups of people must continue to abide by full confinement rules:
Those aged 65 years or over
Children under the age of 15
Pregnant women; and
People with underlying health conditions.
As part of these measures, the Tunisian authorities have announced that the wearing of a face mask in public places and the workplace is now mandatory. Failure to respect this rule could lead to a fine.
During this phase, people must continue to travel only for good reason such as grocery shopping or medical care. There are also limitations on the number of passengers permitted on public transport.
