Warning
FCDO advises against all travel to Ukraine.

The Foreign, Commonwealth & Development Office (FCDO) provides advice about risks of travel to help British nationals make informed decisions. Find out more about FCDO travel advice.
FCDO advises against all travel to Ukraine
Your travel insurance could be invalidated if you travel against FCDO advice. Consular support is also severely limited where FCDO advises against travel.
FCDO continues to advise British nationals against all travel to Ukraine. This is because the risks are too high.
Russian invasion of Ukraine
The Russian invasion of Ukraine is ongoing, with attacks against a number of major cities, including Kyiv. Several towns and cities in southern and eastern Ukraine are temporarily under Russian control. Ukraine’s airspace is closed. There is a real risk to life.
The situation in Ukraine can change quickly. Local rules and measures may change at short notice or with no notification. FCDO cannot confirm that all information here reflects the latest situation in Ukraine.
Cyber attacks
In December, there was a high-impact cyber attack on Ukrainian networks.   Ukraine’s largest mobile network operator, Kyivstar, suffered a cyber attack which left users without a mobile signal or the ability to use the internet. It also disrupted air raid apps, some banks, ATMs, and point-of-sale terminals. The Ukrainian bank Monobank, was also targeted, disrupting access to the bank’s website.
Zaporizhzhia Nuclear Power Plant
There have been reports of military activity and shelling in the area of the Zaporizhzhia Nuclear Power Plant. There have been no reports of any radiation release.
Kakhovka Dam
Flooding in the Kherson region following the destruction of the Kakhovka Dam in June 2023 has caused widespread damage to infrastructure. There are serious risks to life and health from contaminated water, unexploded bombs and debris.
If you are in Ukraine
Leave Ukraine if safe to do so
We continue to advise British nationals still in Ukraine to leave, if they judge it safe to leave.
Transport networks are likely to be severely disrupted. Expect increased documentation checks, transport restrictions and increased security measures. Other measures could include additional border controls, restrictions on public events, curfews, restrictions on telephones, internet and broadcasting, and evacuations of certain areas.
If you are a dual British-Ukrainian national or you have the right to reside in the UK, and want to leave Ukraine, contact the State Border Guard Service of Ukraine on adpsu@dpsu.gov.ua for advice.
Ukrainian nationals and dual-national males aged 18 to 60 are prohibited from leaving the country.
The authorities in the countries bordering Ukraine set and enforce their entry rules. Before you travel, check the foreign travel advice for any countries you plan to travel through. If you need consular assistance, contact the British Embassy in that country.
If you cannot leave now
If the risks are too high (including if you are close to military activity) or you cannot leave for another reason you should:
stay indoors whenever possible
keep away from windows
monitor the media for developments that would allow you to leave safely
stay alert to air raid warnings and follow advice of the Ukrainian authorities
keep your departure plans under constant review
ensure your travel documents are up to date
Martial law is in place. Follow the instructions of the Ukrainian authorities and check any measures in place in your location, as they will vary by region.
Monitor travel advice regularly. Sign up to get email notifications when this advice is updated. See FCDO advice on how to deal with a crisis overseas.
Assisted departure or evacuation
The British Embassy is operating with a limited capacity in Kyiv. We cannot provide any in-person consular assistance.
FCDO cannot facilitate your departure from Ukraine or evacuation. If you are in Ukraine against FCDO advice, or require support to leave Ukraine, take advice from a private security company and take appropriate security measures.
FCDO cannot endorse or recommend any private security companies. Research whether a service provider will be suitable for your requirements and meets code of conduct and safety standards. The Security in Complex Environments Group (SCEG) has several companies listed on their website. These companies have accredited certification for international standards.
FCDO has not completed due diligence checks on these companies. FCDO does not accept any liability arising to any person for any loss or damage suffered through using these service providers or this information. FCDO is not able to provide financial assistance for employing private security or medical evacuation companies.
