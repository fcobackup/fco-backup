Before you travel check that:
your destination can provide the healthcare you may need
you have appropriate travel insurance for local treatment or unexpected medical evacuation
This is particularly important if you have a health condition or are pregnant.
Emergency medical number
Call 999 and ask for an ambulance.
Contact your insurance company promptly if you’re referred to a medical facility for treatment.
Vaccinations and health risks
At least 8 weeks before your trip check:
the latest information on vaccination recommendations and health risks in TravelHealthPro’s Dominica guide - these include Zika virus, dengue and chikungunya
where to get vaccines and whether you have to pay on the NHS travel vaccinations page
Medication
The legal status and regulation of some medicines prescribed or bought in the UK can be different in other countries. 
Read best practice when travelling with medicines on TravelHealthPro. 
The NHS has information on whether you can take your medicine abroad. 
Healthcare facilities in Dominica  
FCDO has a list of doctors in Dominica.   
There is also guidance on healthcare if you’re living in Dominica.  
The Dominica China Friendship Hospital, the government hospital in Roseau, can cope with many types of treatment, but serious cases may require emergency evacuation. 
Before choosing to be treated at a private facility, you should check the payment policy. Private clinics may ask for payment up front, so insurance documents may not be sufficient.  
Private medical treatment in Dominica can be expensive. Make sure you have adequate travel health insurance and accessible funds to cover the cost of any medical treatment abroad and repatriation. 
Travel and mental health 
Read FCDO guidance on travel and mental health. There is also mental health guidance on TravelHealthPro.
