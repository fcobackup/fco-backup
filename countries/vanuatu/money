The local currency is the Vanuatu Vatu (VUV). Credit and debit cards are not frequently used in the country. You may find that some tourist resorts or restaurants accept credit or debit cards in Port Vila and Luganville but less so in the rest of Vanuatu. There are banking facilities and money exchange services in Port Vila through ANZ and BSP (Bank South Pacific) banks . ATM facilities covering most UK bank cards are available in many areas.
