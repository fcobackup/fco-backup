This page reflects the UK government’s understanding of current rules for people travelling on a full ‘British Citizen’ passport from the UK, for the most common types of travel.
The authorities in Laos set and enforce entry rules.
All travellers
The government of the Lao PDR has announced the reopening of all international borders as of 9 May 2022.
Visa on entry and e-Visa will be available from the above date.
Fully vaccinated individuals do not require pre-departure or on arrival tests.
Unvaccinated individuals will be required to take an ATK test a maximum of 48 hours before departure.
There is no requirement to quarantine.
Visitors contracting or arriving with COVID-19 will be responsible for all treatment costs.
All visa processes will return to pre-pandemic regulations, tourists visas will again only be extended twice in country.
Be aware that if you do not renew your visa within 90 days new regulations set a fine of 2 million LAK, deportation to your home country and a ban on returning to Laos.
If you’re fully vaccinated
Proof of vaccination status
Laos will accept the UK’s proof of COVID-19 recovery and vaccination record and proof of COVID-19 vaccination issued in the Crown Dependencies. Your final vaccine dose must have been administered at least 14 days prior to travel. Your NHS appointment card from vaccination centres is not designed to be used as proof of vaccination and should not be used to demonstrate your vaccine status.
See the ‘All travellers’ section.
Children and young people
Requirements are the same regardless of age. See the ‘All travellers’ section.
If you’re transiting through Laos
There are currently no transit options via Laos.
Check your passport and travel documents before you travel
Passport validity
Your passport should have at least 6 months’ validity remaining on your date of entry into Laos.
Additionally, be aware that airlines will now only allow boarding of flights to and from Laos if you have two blank pages in your passport.
Check with your travel provider to make sure your passport and other travel documents meet their requirements.
Yellow fever certificate requirements
Check whether you need a yellow fever certificate by visiting the National Travel Health Network and Centre’s TravelHealthPro website.
UK Emergency Travel Documents
UK Emergency Travel Documents (ETDs) are accepted for entry, airside transit and exit from Laos. If you’re planning to enter Laos using a UK ETD you should contact the nearest Lao embassy or consulate to get the appropriate visa before you travel.
If your passport has been lost or stolen, you must report the loss or theft to the nearest police station and get a police report. You will then need to get a certificate of loss from the Immigration Department in Vientiane, which usually takes 1 to 2 working days.
After getting an ETD from the British Embassy, you will need to get an exit visa from the Lao Ministry of Foreign Affairs, which takes up to 3 days.
