Warning
FCDO advises against all travel to Afghanistan.

The Foreign, Commonwealth & Development Office (FCDO) advises against all travel to Afghanistan.
You should not travel to Afghanistan.
Terrorists are very likely to try to carry out attacks in Afghanistan. There is a heightened threat of terrorist attacks in or around religious sites and during religious events and celebrations, such as the month of Ramadan.  The security situation in Afghanistan is volatile. There is an ongoing and high threat of terrorist attacks throughout Afghanistan, including around airports.
See Terrorism.
Travel throughout Afghanistan is extremely dangerous and border crossings may not be open. See Safety and security.
There is a significant risk of detention of British nationals. The British Government may not be notified about such detentions  and there are considerable challenges in securing consular contact or access. You  may not be able to contact your next of kin and detention may be lengthy without clarity being given to your charge. See Detention.
There are no British consular officials in Afghanistan and our ability to provide consular assistance is severely limited and cannot be delivered in person within Afghanistan. If you are a British national already resident in Afghanistan, you should carefully consider the risk to  your safety and security from staying there. The situation could change quickly and without warning. 
If you choose to travel to or stay in Afghanistan against FCDO advice, you should keep a low profile. Be vigilant, try to avoid all crowds and public events including religious events, and take appropriate security precautions.
If you are a British national in Afghanistan and need to speak to a consular officer, you can:
call the FCDO on 020 7008 5000 (available 24 hours a day)
submit an enquiry
contact us on Twitter or Facebook.
British nationals may access consular services at our diplomatic missions in neighbouring countries.
The FCDO cannot offer advice on the safety of travelling to any departure point within Afghanistan.
If you are a British national in Afghanistan, and would like information about applying for UK visas for your family then visit www.gov.uk/apply-to-come-to-the-uk.
If you would like information about applying for a British passport, or would like to check on your passport application, then visit www.gov.uk/overseas-passports or call the passport advice line on +44 (0) 300 222 0000.
If you plan to pass through another country to return to the UK, check the travel advice for the country youâ€™re transiting.
Because the FCDO advises against all travel to Afghanistan, your travel insurance may not apply there. Check with your insurance provider before travel.
Afghanistan is in a major earthquake zone and remains at risk from powerful earthquakes, aftershocks, landslides and flooding. See Natural disasters.
