This page reflects the UK government’s understanding of current rules for people travelling on a full ‘British Citizen’ passport, for the most common types of travel.
The authorities in Austria set and enforce entry rules. For further information contact their embassy or consulate. You may also check with your transport provider or travel company to make sure your passport and travel documents meet their requirements.
If you are travelling to Austria for work, read the guidance on visas and permits as the rules have changed since 1 January 2021.
Restrictions in response to coronavirus (COVID-19)
Lockdown for the unvaccinated
People who are not fully vaccinated must remain at home. The only valid reasons to leave the home include to avoid immediate danger or harm to oneself or one´s possessions, to seek medical attention (including vaccinations), for education or work purposes (though working from home is recommended where possible), to exercise for physical or mental health, and to purchase essentials such as food or medicine.
Entry to Austria
You can follow official Austrian advice on the following websites, though laws and English translations may lag announcements:
Die aktuellen Maßnahmen zum Coronavirus im Überblick (sozialministerium.at)
RIS - COVID-19-Einreiseverordnung 2021 - Bundesrecht konsolidiert, Fassung vom 31.12.2021 (bka.gv.at)

https://www.bmk.gv.at/en/service/entry-requirements.html
You should also check with your airline.
You must show either proof of full vaccination (see “Vaccination validity”) or recovery from COVID-19 in the past 180 days to enter Austria.
You should also present a negative PCR test not more than 72 hours old at the point of entry. If you do not have a negative PCR test result, you are in addition required to fill out the pre-travel clearance form and enter 10 days of quarantine. You can leave quarantine with a negative PCR test result at any point. If you received a booster vaccination 120 days or more after your second shot, you do not need to provide a PCR test, you also do not need to fill out the pre-travel clearance form and do not need to quarantine. Proof of recovery in the past 180 days, after 2 vaccinations, counts as a booster.
Residents of Austria or another EU/EEA state who cannot provide proof of vaccination or recovery can enter Austria but must fill in a pre-travel clearance form and enter quarantine for 10 days. They can leave quarantine after 5 days with a negative PCR test result.
Vaccination validity
For the one-shot Johnson & Johnson vaccine, you must show that you received a booster no more than 270 days before arrival. For double-shot vaccines (e.g. AstraZeneca, Pfizer, Moderna), you must show that you received the second injection no more than 270 days before arrival.
If you received a booster more than 120 days after being fully immunised, this must not have been more than 270 days before arrival.
Demonstrating your COVID-19 status
Austria will accept the UK’s proof of COVID-19 recovery and vaccination record and proof of COVID-19 vaccination issued in the Crown Dependencies. An NHS email/SMS of a positive test is not sufficient to prove recovery. If you are travelling with a printed PDF proof of vaccination status, it must date from after 1 November 2021 to ensure that the certificate can be scanned successfully. Austrian immigration officials will insist on QR codes, as provided by the UK COVID Pass, as proof of vaccinations and boosters, and have denied entry to those without this evidence. Your NHS appointment card from vaccination centres is not designed to be used as proof of full vaccination.
The negative molecular biological test (PCR, LAMP, TMA) must not be older than 72 hours at time of entry.
There are some exemptions for professional purposes, as set out in Austria’s entry requirements.
Children requirements from Monday 24 January 2022
Children under the age of 12 do not need proof of vaccination/recovery or a PCR test if accompanied by fully vaccinated or recovered adults. If the accompanying adult has to quarantine, the child must quarantine too. The child can then leave self-isolation at the same time as the adult.
Children aged 12 or over and born on or after 1 September 2006 can use the first PCR test of their Holiday Ninja Pass to enter Austria. Find out how to apply online.
For anyone born before 1 September 2006, the adult entry rules apply.
Transit Austria
If you are transiting through Austria without a stopover, you do not need proof of vaccination, a medical certificate or pre-travel clearance form if you can prove you are transiting without a layover in Austria.
Neighbouring countries may be restricting movement across borders, including for transit, and conducting health checks. Check the travel advice for any country you need to travel through.
Regular entry requirements
Visas
The rules for travelling or working in European countries changed on 1 January 2021:
you can travel to countries in the Schengen area for up to 90 days in any 180-day period without a visa. This applies if you travel as a tourist, to visit family or friends, to attend business meetings, cultural or sports events, or for short-term studies or training
if you are travelling to Austria and other Schengen countries without a visa, make sure your whole visit is within the 90-day limit. Visits to Schengen countries within the previous 180 days before you travel count towards your 90 days
to stay longer, to work or study, for business or for other reasons, you will need to meet the Austrian government’s entry requirements. Check with the Austrian Embassy what type of visa and/or work permit you may need
if you stay in Austria with a residence permit or long-stay visa, this does not count towards your 90-day visa-free limit.
Any time you spent in Austria or other Schengen countries before 1 January 2021 does not count towards your 90-day visa-free limit.
At Austrian border control, you may need to queue in separate lanes from EU, EEA and Swiss citizens.
Check your passport is stamped if you enter or exit the Schengen area through Austria as a visitor. Border guards will use passport stamps to check you’re complying with the 90-day visa-free limit for short stays in the Schengen area. If relevant entry or exit stamps are not in your passport, border guards will presume that you have overstayed your visa-free limit.
You can show evidence of when and where you entered or exited the Schengen area, and ask the border guards to add this date and location in your passport. Examples of acceptable evidence include boarding passes and tickets.
You may also need to:
show a return or onward ticket
show you have enough money for your stay
If you are resident in Austria your passport should not be stamped. You should proactively show your proof of residence as well as your valid passport at Austrian border control. For further information, see our Living in Austria guide.
Passport validity
If you are planning to travel to an EU country (except Ireland), or Switzerland, Norway, Iceland, Liechtenstein, Andorra, Monaco, San Marino or Vatican City, you must meet the Schengen area rules.
Your passport must meet 2 requirements. It must be:
less than 10 years old on the day you enter (check the ‘date of issue’)
valid for at least 3 months after the day you plan to leave (check the ‘expiry date’)
We are asking the European Commission to clarify the 10-year rule. Their guidance for Schengen border guards may not be updated until the spring of 2022. Until then, for some Schengen countries your passport may need to be less than 10 years old during your whole visit, and the 3 months at the end of your visit may need to be within 10 years of your passport’s issue date.
Check both the issue date and the expiry date in your passport. If you renewed your passport early, extra months may have been added to its expiry date. This could affect the requirement for your passport to be less than 10 years old.
Contact your travel provider or embassy of the country you are visiting if you think that your passport does not meet both these requirements. Renew your passport if you need to.
Travelling with children
If you are a single parent, or travelling with a child who is not your own, you will need documentary evidence of parental responsibility and a letter of consent. For further information on exactly what will be required at immigration contact the Austrian Embassy in London.
UK Emergency Travel Documents
UK Emergency Travel Documents are accepted for entry, airside transit and exit from Austria.
