This page gives you guidance on how to stay safely in Ireland as a visitor, if you are unable to return to the UK.
Everyone should comply with the measures put in place in Ireland to limit the spread of coronavirus (COVID-19).
Moving around in Ireland
On 29 June, Ireland moved to Phase 3 of its roadmap for easing lockdown restrictions. You are now able to travel anywhere in Ireland, and most businesses, services and cultural activities can reopen.
Public health measures currently in place
The Irish Government is reminding people of the ongoing risk posed by Covid-19. Physical distancing should be maintained at all times. Amongst other measures, you are still advised to:
Wash your hands well and often
Observe good cough & sneeze etiquette
Distance yourself at least 2 metres away from other people, especially those who might be unwell
Limit your contact with others when out and about
Keep your close contacts to a small number of people
Avoid crowded areas
Wear a face covering in situations where physical distancing is not possible, for example shops, busy public transport, or if you are meeting someone who is vulnerable to the virus
Keep a log of all of your contacts throughout the day
Please see comprehensive guidance and advice from the Irish Government.
Social and mass gatherings
Indoor gatherings of up to 50 people and outdoor gatherings of up to 200 people are allowed when conducted in line with public health advice.
Cultural, Social and Sport Measures
All remaining community, religious, cultural, social and sport facilities can now reopen, whilst observing physical distancing and other relevant public health guidelines.
Sporting activities may recommence, including team leagues, close contact sports, indoor gyms, sports facilities and pools.
Over 70s and those extremely medically vulnerable to Covid-19
The guidance for people who are over 70 or extremely medically vulnerable has been updated. The main guidance is to protect yourself by staying at home as much as you can. Should you wish to visit someone, receive visitors in your home, visit shops, travel and engage in other outdoor activities, it is recommend that you continue to follow the public health and social distancing guidance. The Irish Government states that as risk cannot be completely eliminated, you will need to decide what is right for you and your health. Please see the Irish Government website for further information, which covers relevant information for a range of different scenarios.
Education and childcare measures
A number of educational facilities are now able to open, whilst observing all of the relevant public health guidelines. Please see the Irish Government website for further details.
Healthcare and residential care
The resumption of visiting at hospitals, nursing homes and other residential settings is continuing on a planned, phased basis. Please contact the facility you are visiting ahead of your visit for details, and do not visit if you have symptoms of Covid-19 or have been a close contact of someone who is confirmed as having the virus.
Health Services
A phased reintroduction of non-Covid care in hospitals and other health services settings has begun, which will be delivered alongside Covid-19 care.
Work
Anyone who can work from home should continue to do so. The Irish Government has also published extensive guidance for business owners to guide the reopening of their businesses. This covers guidance for keeping both customers and employees adequately protected.
For full details, visit the Irish Government website.
Transport
The Irish Government recommends that public transport should be used in off-peak times if at all possible. It is advised that you wear a face covering on public transport, stay at a 2 metre distance if possible during the journey and wash your hands when you return home. Social distancing means that overall capacity on public transport remains restricted.
See more detailed guidance from the Irish Government on the safe use of face coverings.
You can now travel throughout Ireland and to Ireland’s offshore islands.
Private transport
Tours, events and private bus use, and vehicle hire are now allowed.

Finance
There is a range of financial support from the government that you can access while you are unable to return due to coronavirus restrictions.
If you’re in Ireland, and have exhausted all other options to cover essential living costs while you wait to return home, you could apply for an emergency loan for your living costs from the UK government. You can only apply if you normally live in the UK and you cannot return home. This last-resort option is for those most in need, and you would need to repay the loan when you are back in the UK. Apply for an emergency loan.

Help and support
If you need urgent consular assistance, contact your nearest British embassy, high commission or consulate. All telephone numbers are available 24/7.
