Cases of coronavirus (COVID-19) have been confirmed in Uruguay. The Uruguayan authorities have introduced a number of measures to limit the spread of the virus.
To date, the Uruguayan government has introduced a range of mandatory measures to combat the spread of coronavirus. This includes:
only Uruguayan nationals and legal residents are allowed to enter Uruguay
partial border closure and mandatory 14-day quarantine for passengers arriving from abroad.
cruise ships allowed to refuel and take on supplies in Montevideo on a case by case basis
suspension of direct flights to and from Europe and the US (from 20 and 18 March respectively)
closure of the border with Argentina (including ferry services)
You will need to check the Travel Advice for any country you will be transiting or visiting after or before Uruguay as there may be other restrictions in place.
Further information is also available from the Uruguayan Ministry of Health (in Spanish). You should comply with any additional screening measures put in place by the authorities.
If you need further information about entry requirements, contact the local immigration authorities or the nearest Uruguayan embassy. You should also check with your airline or travel company for the latest information.
