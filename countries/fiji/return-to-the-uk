You can find out more information on this and apply on the Australian Department of Home Affairs website. You should contact our Sydney consulate using the online contact form once you have requested your exemption.
The New Zealand government has announced, with strict health and onward flight criteria, the ability for travellers from Pacific Island Countries to transit New Zealand; this ability to transit may change at short notice and is only available for a short period.
