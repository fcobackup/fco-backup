There are still commercial options to return to the UK from Saudi Arabia.
If you live in the UK and are currently visiting Saudi Arabia, you’re strongly advised to return now by commercial means. Don’t risk getting stranded.
Flights
Saudia has scheduled flights from Riyadh to London, and from Jeddah to Manchester, on 19th May. There is no need to register with the British Embassy. Flights can be booked online at Saudia. Please remember to select ‘One Way’.
British nationals and residents who book a flight on 19 May can receive help from the Embassy with transport and permissions letters if they apply in time. See Travelling to the airport. The next Embassy-supported flight will be in June.
Saudia have also opened online booking for several other flights to the UK. The Embassy cannot help with transport or permission letters for these flights, and passengers will be responsible for making their way to the airport without our assistance.
You will need to pay for your return travel to the UK. If departure options are available but you cannot afford the travel costs and have exhausted all other options for getting funds, you may be eligible to apply for an emergency loan from the British Government. This should be a last resort option and you would need to repay the loan when you are back in the UK. Contact the British Embassy Riyadh for information on how to apply.
Travelling to the airport
If you are departing on a flight from Riyadh or Jeddah on Tuesday 19 May, you can receive help from the British Embassy with transport and permissions letters to help you reach the pick-up points.
The British Embassy cannot help with transport or permissions letters for other flights. You will be responsible for making their way to the airport without British Embassy assistance.
If you need transport from the Western Regions to Jeddah, send your contact details and location to KSA.Info@fco.gov.uk with WESTERN REGIONS TRANSPORT in the title by 12pm on Thursday 14 May.
If you need transport from Dammam to Riyadh, email KSA.Info@fco.gov.uk with DAMMAM TRANSPORT in the title by 12pm on Sunday 17 May.
If you are already in Riyadh or Jeddah, you will need to arrange your own transport to the airport using the commercial options available. If you need a permissions letter, email KSA.Info@fco.gov.uk with PERMISSIONS LETTER in the title. We will send out permissions letters on Sunday 17 May.
Future travel options
The British Embassy has been working closely with airlines and the Saudi authorities to arrange a regular commercial flight option to the UK as soon as possible. The next British Embassy-supported flight will be in June.
This travel advice will be updated with further information once departure options are available. Sign up for email alerts and follow the British Embassy Riyadh on Twitter and Facebook.
We are working hard to ensure that there are more opportunities to buy tickets for flights in the coming months. However, it is not possible to say when flights will depart. Depending on demand, it may not be possible for all Britons to buy tickets when they wish to travel. If you need to return to the UK, buy a ticket for the next British Embassy-supported flight.
