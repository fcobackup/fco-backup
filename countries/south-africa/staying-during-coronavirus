Coronavirus guidance is being updated.
Read the Prime Minister’s address for the latest information.

This page gives you guidance on how to stay safely in South Africa, if you are unable to return to the UK.
You should comply with the measures put in place in South Africa to limit the spread of coronavirus (COVID-19).
Moving around in South Africa
The South African authorities have published coronavirus advice and have introduced a number of measures to limit the spread of the virus. Failure to comply could result in a fine or arrest.
On 23 April, President Ramaphosa announced that the South African government would be introducing a new risk-based, five-level approach to changes to lockdown restrictions. On 1 May, South Africa moved to level 4 (from level 5). The level of restriction in place may differ by province and district. You should follow advice from the local authorities about what restrictions apply where you are.
All ‘non-essential domestic travel’ continues to be prohibited. Internal flights are no longer running. You must wear a mask if using public transport, which will operate with strict hygiene requirements and reduced passenger numbers.
Everybody in South Africa must stay at home, except to buy essential products including food and medicine. Only certain categories of workers are currently exempt. Walking, running and cycling are allowed between 6am and 9am within 5km of your house. All social gatherings and inter-provincial travel are still prohibited. Everyone must wear a face mask when in public.
From 1 May, the South African government has instituted a nationwide curfew from 8pm - 5am.
You should continue to comply with any regulations set out by the South African government during the lockdown. You can find more details on the five-level approach to lockdown restrictions on the South African Resource Portal.
Visas
Since the introduction of restrictions to international flights, the South African authorities have announced that people who exceed their 90 day stay, or the validity of their temporary residence visas, as a result of travel restrictions linked to COVID-19 will not be penalised as over-stayers when they depart. See Entry requirements
Accommodation
You should make sure you have accommodation for the duration of the lock down, or until you have a confirmed ticket on a special charter flight.
Those hotels which still have international guests should remain open until their guests are able to leave South Africa. See the list of hotels that have advised they can accept British people.
You can also call a national hotline: +27 (0)800 029 999 to speak to a professional who will assess your individual need and advise on next steps.
If you are staying in the Western Cape, you can contact the Western Cape provincial government who may be able to assist in identifying new accommodation, using the following numbers:
Cape Town, Overberg and Winelands and West Coast: +27 (0)82 554 2010
Garden Route and Karoo: +27(0)82 972 2507
Cape Town CBD: +27(0)21 487 6552
Health
If you take regular medication, make sure you have a sufficient supply for the full duration of South Africa’s lockdown period. Pharmacies are classified as an essential service, and will remain open. Most medicines that require a prescription from a doctor in the UK will require one in South Africa. If necessary, you should obtain an electronic prescription from your medical practitioner to enable a local doctor to write one. Ask your insurer, or your accommodation provider to help you find one.

Private hospitals in South Africa are prepared to treat coronavirus, and the standard of care may be higher than in government hospitals. Our experience suggests that only people who are showing symptoms of coronavirus are able to get a test, at both private and public hospitals.
