Entry and borders
See Entry requirements to find out what you will need to do when you arrive in Switzerland.
Neighbouring countries may introduce restrictions at borders and conduct health checks. Check the travel advice for any country you need to travel to or through. See our Travel Advice for France and Germany for the latest rules for transiting those countries from/to Switzerland.
Be prepared for your plans to change
No travel is risk-free during COVID-19. Countries may further restrict travel or bring in new rules at short notice, for example due to a new COVID-19 variant. Check with your travel company or airline for any transport changes which may delay your journey home.
If you test positive for COVID-19, you may need to stay where you are until you test negative. You may also need to seek treatment there.
Plan ahead and make sure you:
can access money
understand what your insurance will cover
can make arrangements to extend your stay and be away for longer than planned
COVID-19 restrictions
Switzerland has lifted all COVID-19 pandemic restrictions – there are no social distancing or mask wearing measures in place. There is no mandatory isolation requirement if you test positive for COVID-19. Local restrictions or mandatory mask wearing and proof of vaccination may be in place in hospitals or care homes.
However, you should follow the basic principles on hygiene to protect yourself and others. If you feel unwell, it is advised to stay at home. If you have COVID-19 symptoms, it may be a good idea to get tested, especially if you are at high risk.
Within Switzerland, there is no certificate requirement at the national level.
Further information is available from the Federal Office of Public Health.
Cantons may impose further restrictions, and you should check cantonal websites for further details.
