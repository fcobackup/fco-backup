We are working with the Indian authorities and airlines to support British nationals who want to leave India and return to the UK. To support this we need to collect information on British nationals currently in India to advise when commercial flights to the UK become available. If you are a British national who is currently visiting India and you wish to return urgently to the UK, please email Conqry.Newdelhi@fco.gov.uk. Please include your full name (and the names of any family members with you), date/s of birth for all named family members), your passport number, visa status and contact details, including your exact location in India. Please confirm your date of arrival in India and details of the return flight that you had planned to take back to the UK. Please also inform us if you have any special circumstances such as a medical condition we may need to be aware of.
If you are a British national in India, you should be prepared to stay in country until commercial flights resume. You will need to be ready to comply with local isolation, testing or quarantine requirements, and to rely on the local health system. Given that many additional state level restrictions remain in place, and continue to be introduced, moving within India may be more difficult than normal for British nationals. For example, hotels in some states have been instructed to refuse entry to foreign nationals and some states have entry restrictions in place and may quarantine foreign nationals on arrival. Unless you have an urgent reason to travel within India you may have to stay where you are whilst the flight ban and lockdowns remain in place. Indian Government has announced it is expanded testing, including through private laboratories, though testing is still available only on the prescription of a registered medical practitioner. If you are symptomatic (the latest we understand according to the Ministry of Health & Family Welfare, is coughing and fever and/or shortness of breath) noting a history of travel still applies unless you have been in contact with a confirmed positive case; and would like to get tested and understand the process and availability of doing so, please contact a registered medical practitioner.
The situation remains fluid and we advise British nationals to continue to monitor the local advice on any state level restrictions and follow the instructions of the local authorities.
