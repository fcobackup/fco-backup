Travel in the Philippines
The Philippine government is easing large scale social restrictions in a number of stages. The National Capital Region, which includes Metro Manila, will remain under General Community Quarantine (GCQ) until 15 July. However local government units have discretion to place specific areas under Enhanced Community Quarantines (ECQ). The level of community quarantine differs across the Philippines. Cebu City has temporarily been returned to ECQ until 15 July. You should closely monitor announcements from local authorities to understand the latest restrictions and regulations where you are situated, and their impact on your ability to travel and access essential services.
If you plan to take a commercial flight but are experiencing difficulty travelling to the airport due to community quarantine restrictions, the British Embassy can provide a letter to facilitate your passage through checkpoints. You can submit your request to our Consular team via the web contact form. You can also seek assistance from your local Department of Tourism office, which may be able to offer advice on transport options or hotels.
The Philippine Government has confirmed that foreign nationals will be able to leave the Philippines at any time during the period of enhanced quarantine. See Entry requirements.
There is disruption to travel routes both domestically and across the region. Check with your travel provider for updates.
