In response to coronavirus, the Government of Lebanon has implemented a series of restrictions on movement within Lebanon. See Staying during coronavirus.
The UK government is working closely with airlines, the Lebanese authorities and other governments to make sure options are available for British nationals to return to the UK. While Lebanon’s borders remain closed, the Lebanese Government is permitting a limited number of flights to operate on an exceptional basis to facilitate the repatriation of stranded travellers. See Return to the UK.
Protests against the deteriorating economic situation in Lebanon, which began in October 2019, are continuing. The protests have centred on Beirut and Tripoli, but have occurred at various locations nationwide, including most recently the Beqaa Valley and Saida, often with little notice. Violent confrontations between protesters, security forces and supporters of political groups have occurred. This includes clashes in Tripoli on 27 April 2020 where a protestor died, and several protestors and members of the security forces were injured.
As a result of protests, major roads (including to and from Beirut airport) have become blocked, banks have closed, and there is a risk that supplies (including medical) may become increasingly scarce. See Political situation
Following the attack on the coalition base at Taji in Iraq on 11 March, and subsequent US airstrikes, tensions may be raised across the region. There is a possibility of an increased threat against Western interests, including against UK citizens. You should remain vigilant and keep up to date with the latest developments, including via the media and this travel advice.
A conflict with Israel could spark with little warning and lead to a rapid escalation in violence. There have been exchanges between Hizballah and the Israeli Defence Force across the Blue Line in the South of Lebanon. This has included cross-border shelling, most recently in 2019. See Security situation
Terrorists are very likely to try to carry out attacks in Lebanon. You should be vigilant at all times, avoid crowds and crowded places and follow the advice of the Lebanese authorities. Previous attacks have targeted the security forces, as well as locations where Western visitors may congregate. On 3 June 2019, a suspected terrorist killed two Lebanese army soldiers and one Lebanese policeman in Tripoli. See Terrorism
There’s a heightened risk of terrorism against aviation. Additional security measures have been in place on flights departing from Lebanon to the UK since March 2017. You should co-operate fully with security officials.
Groups within Lebanon, including Hizballah, are proscribed under the Terrorism Act 2000 and the Terrorist Asset-Freezing Act 2010. Offences committed under the act – including funding and supporting proscribed organisations – may be liable to prosecution in the UK.
There are unexploded ordnance and land mines in many places. You should avoid travelling away from established paths, especially when hiking. This is particularly a concern in southern Lebanon. See Local travel
You can contact the emergency services by calling 112.
If you’re abroad and you need emergency help from the UK government, contact the nearest British embassy, consulate or high commission. Consular support is severely limited in parts of Lebanon where we advise against all travel and limited where we advise against all but essential travel.
The Overseas Business Risk service offers information and advice for British companies operating overseas on how to manage political, economic, and business security-related risks.
Take out comprehensive travel and medical insurance before you travel.
