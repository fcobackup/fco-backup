All land borders with Peru and Colombia remain closed until further notice.
Entry and borders
See Entry requirements to find out what you will need to do when you arrive in Ecuador.
Returning to the UK
When you return, you must follow the rules for entering the UK.
You are responsible for organising your own COVID-19 test, in line with UK government testing requirements. You should contact local authorities for information on testing facilities (available in Spanish only).
Be prepared for your plans to change
No travel is risk-free during COVID. Countries may further restrict travel or bring in new rules at short notice, for example due to a new COVID-19 variant. Check with your travel company or airline for any transport changes which may delay your journey home.
If you test positive for COVID-19, you may need to stay where you are until you test negative. You may also need to seek treatment there.
Plan ahead and make sure you:
can access money
understand what your insurance will cover
can make arrangements to extend your stay and be away for longer than planned

Please check more detailed information with local authorities – details below - to ensure that you comply with any local restrictions, including vehicle circulation restrictions in your area.
Restrictions do not apply for key sectors such as public and private healthcare, security, basic public services, emergency response, produce sectors and those who need to transport goods and food. People who are transporting passengers to/from the airport (showing flight tickets) and verified medical emergencies and appointments are also exempt.
Restrictions
The central government´s “red, amber, green” alert system is no longer in force. However, it will be used as an internal management tool for epidemiological monitoring.
Each municipal government is responsible for determining its own specific restrictions including, but not limited to, maximum capacity for public transport, the circulation of private vehicles against licence plate numbers, health prevention protocols for all businesses and industries and alcohol sale and consumption.
We strongly recommend that you follow the local municipalities’ social media channels to obtain the most up to date notifications, but bear in mind that these might change at any time:
Quito: @MunicipioQuito; Guayaquil: @alcaldiagye; Cuenca: @MunicipioCuenca; Galapagos: @CGGalapagos
Ecuador’s National Emergency Operations Committee (COE) has a website with their official resolutions (Spanish only).
Within the national health emergency, the Ecuadorean Ministry of Health will continue to issue the required health prevention measures, including PCR tests and any mandatory self-isolation (Aislamiento Preventivo Obligatorio – APO) requirements.
Restrictions in Quito
Quito Municipality continues with its campaign to increase testing and triage. In addition to adhering to the standard general biosecurity measures, you must also carry an identity card at all times.
All COVID-19 measures will continue to be enforced robustly and infringements will be handled by the relevant competent authorities.
The “Hoy No Circula” circulation private vehicle restriction system has been reactivated from 21 May owards.
Vehicles with number plates ending in the following numbers cannot circulate on the following days:
Monday: 0, 1, 2, 3
Tuesday: 2, 3, 4, 5
Wednesday: 4, 5, 6, 7
Thursday: 6, 7, 8, 9
Friday: 8, 9, 0, 1
As of 1 July 2021, from Monday to Friday, the “Hoy No Circula” vehicle restriction is in effect between 7am to 7pm. This is only applicable for the urban areas of Quito Metropolitan District.
All vehicle number plates are allowed to circulate all day at the weekends and on official public holidays.
Vehicle circulation restrictions do not apply for verified medical emergencies and appointments; for transfers to the airport (showing flight tickets) and for key sectors with safe passage documents.
In addition, people who work for certain vital sectors, such as health, food provision, financial and emergencies, will be allowed to circulate on the days which the vehicle’s number plate would not normally be permitted to circulate. You must present valid credentials or proof of emergency if stopped by a local authority. The issuance of special safe passage documents (“salvoconductos”) has been reinstated for private vehicles that can justify their need to circulate inside the “Hoy No Circula” restrictions.
All public and social gatherings are prohibited. Pubs and nightclubs are closed until further notice. All sport activities that cannot comply with the minimum distancing requirements are also suspended temporarily.
You will be fined 50% of a minimum salary if you are found drinking in public spaces (including inside vehicles).
Public transport, bus terminals and tourist transport can operate at a maximum of 50% capacity. As of 26 July, shopping centres, banks, cinemas, theatres, restaurants, gyms (complying with minimum distancing requirements) and entertainment centres can operate at a maximum capacity of 50%. Outdoor academic events can be held at 70% capacity.

Healthcare in Ecuador
If you present symptoms while in Ecuador, you should call 171 (Spanish only) and you will be assisted by trained Ministry of Public Health (MSP) personnel. You can also call 911, which has some English-speaking operators. For further information (in Spanish), follow the Ministry of Public Health official social media channels @Salud_Ec.
The authorities have allowed for privately-arranged COVID-19 tests in laboratories approved by the Ministry of Health. On 20 April 2021, the central government set maximum reference costs for these tests.
Pharmacies in Ecuador are known as “farmacias”. They can be easily accessed in the main cities, but potentially less accessible in rural areas. Most pharmacies in Ecuador will have a delivery service.
The Ecuadorean government recommends the “SaludEC” app, a new platform to support COVID-19 response, by registering for general reports and official announcements. It provides information to evaluate potential COVID-19 symptoms. It also allows online medical checks and scheduling appointments at Ministry of Public Health centres for non-coronavirus needs.
If you test positive for COVID-19 in Ecuador before returning to the UK
If you receive a positive COVID-19 test in country, you should seek medical assistance by contacting either a public or private doctor to advise you on treatment and mandatory self-isolation measures, in private accommodation or hotel of your choice. There are no quarantine facilities in Ecuador.
If your condition deteriorates, you can call 911 or directly approach a private or public hospital or medical centre to seek assistance.
For contact details for English speaking doctors visit our list of healthcare providers.
It is your responsibility to comply with the required 10 days of self-isolation if you test positive.
Minors (under 18) have to comply with the same self-isolation requirements. They will be denied access to hotels without an adult.
Your emotional and mental wellbeing is important. Read guidance on how to look after your mental wellbeing and mental health

COVID-19 vaccines if you live in Ecuador
Wherever possible British nationals should aim to be vaccinated in the country where they live. As further information is available about the national vaccination programme, this page will be updated. Sign up to get email notifications.
The new Ecuadorean government has made changes to the official vaccination programme (“Plan de Vacunación 9/100”). The Ministry of Health (MSP) has partnered with the National Electoral Council (CNE) to use the electoral roll to determine who needs to be vaccinated, and where. This means that if you did not register to vote in the latest Ecuadorean elections you may not currently be registered for vaccination. You can check if you are registered by accessing the new official website (available in Spanish only) and entering your Ecuadorean ID number (“cédula”) and your date of birth. If you are registered, you will be given an estimated date of vaccination as well as the assigned venue. If you are not registered, you can sign up for a vaccine at: https://registrovacunacion.cne.gob.ec/
On the relevant government webpage, the following new options are now available: “change the vaccination centre” and “registration update”. In addition, a Smartphone App “CNE” is now available to check vaccination centre locations and status.
The vaccination programme focuses on age, serious health conditions and disabled groups, thereby prioritising the most vulnerable. You are encouraged to monitor the above communication channels. If you live in Ecuador, and for any reason you do not have an Ecuadorean Identity Document (“cédula”), you can approach the nearest vaccination centre with a valid passport when your age group is announced. Likewise, if you were not enrolled to vote in Ecuador and your new registration is not yet available on the system, you can still receive the vaccine by showing your online registration and your Ecuadorean ID. You can find out your nearest vaccination centre by calling 171.
Using the same age and vulnerability criteria, if you have already received the first vaccination dose overseas and you are reaching the second dose timeframe, you can receive the second dose by showing your Ecuadorean ID and your original vaccination card.
The Medicines and Healthcare Products Regulatory Agency (MHRA) is the UK authority responsible for assessing the safety, quality and efficacy of vaccines. It has authorised the Pfizer/BioNTech, Oxford/AstraZeneca and Moderna vaccines for temporary supply and use in the UK. Find out more about MHRA approval for these vaccines.
British nationals living overseas should seek medical advice from their local healthcare provider in the country where they reside. Information about vaccines used in other national programmes, including regulatory status, should be available from the local authorities. This list of Stringent Regulatory Authorities recognised by the World Health Organisation may also be a useful source of additional information. Find out more about COVID-19 vaccines on the World Health Organisation COVID-19 vaccines page.
