There have been regular demonstrations in Guinea since October 2019 leading to significant travel disruption and a number of violent incidents including deaths. Protests in Middle Guinea in January led to several public buildings being ransacked and set on fire and increased criminal activity. The National Front for the Defence of the Constitution (FNDC) have continued to call for demonstrations. Demonstrations may be spontaneous and unpredictable, with routes blocked. There has been damage to vehicles passing through or around demonstrations as well as an increase in criminality. Serious violence occurred around the legislative elections and referendum which were held on 22 March 2020. Demonstrations are likely to continue leading up to and after the 18 October Presidential elections. You should exercise caution and be vigilant and aware of your surroundings, staying clear of demonstrations and monitor local media. “Villes mortes” (general strikes) happen intermittently. See Political situation
Terrorist attacks can’t be ruled out. Attacks could be indiscriminate. You should be vigilant, especially in places visited by foreigners. See Terrorism
The Guinean authorities maintain police and local militia checkpoints across the whole country. Carry identification with you at all times. See Road travel and Local laws and customs
Motorists have encountered theft at gun point, particularly at night. See Crime
