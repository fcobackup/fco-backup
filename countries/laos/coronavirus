See the TravelHealthPro website for further advice on travel abroad and reducing spread of respiratory viruses during the COVID-19 pandemic.
International travel
If you’re a British national intending to travel to Laos, you should check with your airline due to restrictions affecting all nationalities travelling from or transiting countries with community transmission of COVID-19. Departing flights are unaffected. You should sign up for email alerts for updates to this travel advice.
Commercial flights to and from Laos remain very limited. Check with your travel company for the latest information.
Lao Government COVID-19 regulations require that you inform the Embassy if you’re departing Laos. If you are leaving Laos, email BritishEmbassy.Vientiane@fcdo.gov.uk with your full name, passport number, flight details and a scan or photograph of the identification page of your passport. Please advise if you are travelling from a location other than Vientiane.
The Embassy will inform the Lao Ministry of Foreign Affairs of departing British Nationals, as required by the Lao Government.
Entry and borders
The government of the Lao PDR has suspended the visa on arrival service at all international entry points. No visas are being issued to people travelling from or transiting a country with ongoing COVID-19 outbreak. However, the authorities may consider granting entry permission for foreigners (e.g. experts, technicians and foreign nationals that are needed for essential projects) who wish to travel to Laos. See Entry requirements
The closure of all customary international land borders has been extended until 19 June 2021.
Travel in Laos
Some restrictions on travel within Laos have been extended until 19 June 2021. According to the Lao authorities, public transport by land and air is permitted between provinces where community transmission has not been identified. The government has announced that travel from Vientiane Capital is permitted for people who can show they have been fully vaccinated at least a month before travel. However given the low number of people who currently meet this requirement there are few public transport options available in practice.
Please monitor local official announcements for guidance in the latest restrictions.
Thailand land border
The Thai government has announced that all Thailand-Laos border crossings are restricted until further notice, including the Friendship Bridge between Vientiane and Nong Khai. Commercial goods are permitted to cross at present and there have been exemptions for medical emergencies at the discretion of the Laos and Thai medical authorities.
If you want to travel to Thailand, you must apply for permission to travel via the Royal Thai Government’s online platform. You should keep up to date with the latest information on the websites of the Thai Ministry of Foreign Affairs, the Royal Thai Embassy in Vientiane, and the Thai Ministry of Public Health.
Accommodation
Hotels and private rental accommodation is available throughout Laos, although a number of hotels/hostels are currently closed due to reduced tourist numbers. You should arrange accommodation in advance of travel.
Public places and services
Many businesses including gyms/spas, sports facilities, night markets, cinemas, and tourist attractions are closed. Some businesses, restaurants, shopping malls and retail shops and food markets may be open if COVID preventative measures are in place. These may include providing alcohol gel, face masks being worn, 1m physical distancing and checking temperatures.
Large social gatherings, weddings and traditional events are not permitted. In Vientiane Capital many of the COVID-19 prevention measures have been extended until 19 June as community transmission remains, whilst in other parts of Laos there have been some easing of restrictions. The main restrictions are:
Vientiane Capital has introduced a zoning system, with different parts of the city graded red, yellow or green - restrictions are heaviest in the red areas. These zones may change over time
Travel in and out of Vientiane Capital is prohibited from infected areas
Meetings, events or gatherings of more than 50 people are prohibited
Entertainment venues, karaoke venues, bars, internet cafes, spas, and gyms are closed
Further measures may be introduced at short notice. You should follow the advice of the Lao authorities.
