FCDO advises against all but essential travel to parts of Thailand.
Before you travel check that:
your destination can provide the healthcare you may need
you have appropriate travel insurance for local treatment or unexpected medical evacuation
This is particularly important if you have a health condition or are pregnant.
Emergency medical number
Dial 1669 and ask for an ambulance.
Contact your insurance or medical assistance company promptly if you’re referred to a medical facility for treatment.
Vaccinations and health risks
At least 8 weeks before your trip check:
the latest information on vaccinations and health risks in TravelHealthPro’s Thailand guide
where to get vaccines and whether you have to pay on the NHS travel vaccinations page
Health risks in Thailand include:
rabies
Zika virus
dengue fever
See the ‘Other risks’ section of the TravelHealthPro Thailand guide for more on health risks.
To avoid mosquito-borne viruses, such as dengue fever and Zika virus, take steps to avoid being bitten by mosquitoes.
Air quality
There can be high levels of air pollution in large cities. This includes Bangkok and Chiang Mai, which are also affected by seasonal regional smoke haze from the burning of trees. The high pollution and particulate count sometimes reach dangerous levels. This may worsen bronchial, sinus or asthma conditions.
Check air quality levels for many cities on the World Air Quality Index website.
Medication
The legal status and regulation of some medicines prescribed or bought in the UK can be different in other countries.
Hospitals and pharmacies across Thailand will usually accept UK prescriptions. Brand name medication can often be more expensive than locally produced medication.
Medication sold on the street may not be genuine or may have been stolen. Taking medication without medical advice or a prescription can have serious health consequences.
Read best practice when travelling with medicines on TravelHealthPro. The NHS has information on whether you can take your medicine abroad.
Healthcare facilities in Thailand
FCDO has a list of English-speaking doctors in Thailand. All hospitals require guarantee of payment before treating patients. Make sure you have adequate health insurance.
Private hospitals in Thailand are of a high standard but can be expensive. Public hospitals and clinics do not always meet UK standards, particularly outside Bangkok.
