Terrorists are very likely to try to carry out attacks in Burkina Faso. Burkina Faso contributes to the UN peacekeeping initiative in Mali (MINUSMA) and is therefore considered a legitimate target by Al-Qaida in the Islamic Maghreb (AQ-M) and its associated groups.
In May 2018, Burkinabe security forces engaged suspected terrorists in the Rayongo district, on the outskirts of Ouagadougou. Three suspected terrorists were killed, and 5 gendarmes and 1 civilian wounded. Weapons and bomb-making materials were found at the scene.
In March 2018, a terrorist attack took place on the French Embassy and the Army Headquarters in Ouagadougou. 16 people were killed, including 8 attackers, and 80 people injured.
In August 2017, gunmen attacked the Aziz Istanbul restaurant in Ouagadougou. 19 people were killed, including 9 foreigners.
A terrorist attack took place at a hotel and restaurant in central Ouagadougou in January 2016 in which 30 people were killed, including a number of foreigners.
There have also been recent attacks on police and military personnel close to the borders with Mali, Niger and Cote d’Ivoire, including an attack in Soum Province in February 2017, which has been linked to terrorist activity. Further attacks are possible and could occur without warning. If you are in Burkina Faso, you should be vigilant, monitor local media and follow the advice of the local authorities.
There’s a very real threat of kidnap in Burkina Faso and the wider Sahel region. There was an increase in attacks during 2016; in January 2016, 2 western nationals were abducted in Burkina Faso in the northern town of Djibo near the border with Mali. This threat is likely to continue as groups remain intent on demonstrating capability and increasing influence across the region. This was demonstrated by the March 2017 merger of AQ-M Sahel, Ansar al-Dine and al-Murabitun into the new group ‘Jamaat Nusrat al-Islam wal Muslimeen’. The threat to western interests in the region remains. Read more about the threat from terrorism in the Sahel region.
The long-standing policy of the British government is not to make substantive concessions to hostage takers. The British government considers that paying ransoms and releasing prisoners increases the risk of further hostage-taking and finances terrorist activity. The Terrorism Act (2000) also makes payments to terrorists illegal.
There’s a heightened threat of terrorist attack globally against UK interests and British nationals from groups or individuals motivated by the conflict in Iraq and Syria. You should be vigilant at this time.
