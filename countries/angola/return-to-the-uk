Although all scheduled international flights to and from Angola were suspended on 20 March, limited charter flight options to connect to the UK continue to become available on an ad-hoc basis (see Flights section below).
If you live in the UK and are currently visiting Angola you’re strongly advised to return now by commercial means. Don’t run the risk of getting stranded.
UK Government special charter flights will only operate for priority countries where commercial flights are not possible. You should not assume that these flights will become available in countries where commercial flights are operating. Do not contact the contracted travel management company if no flight is advertised here.
Flights
A commercial charter flight from Luanda to Lisbon will operate on 14 April. Seats are available for UK nationals. If you wish to travel on this flight, you should contact: luanda@atlantidawta.com as soon as possible. There are currently no plans for any direct charter flights to London. A number of airlines are still operating regular connecting flights from Lisbon to London.
Travelling to the airport
The Government of Angola has permitted the travel of foreign nationals within Angola when travelling to the airport to return to their home country.
If you’re trying to get back to the UK and need financial help, see the FCO’s guide on financial assistance.
