In recent years there have been occasional incidents of unrest and violence on the Eastern Aegean islands of Lesvos, Chios and Samos, most recently in response to an increase in arrivals of migrants from Turkey in March 2020, and a fire at the Moria camp for migrants in September 2020. It is possible that further incidents may arise. If you’re on these islands, you should remain vigilant, avoid any demonstrations or related large gatherings, keep up to date with developments and follow the advice of the local authorities.
