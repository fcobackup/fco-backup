If you test positive for COVID-19, you may need to stay where you are until you test negative. You may also need to seek treatment there.
Plan ahead and make sure you:
can access money
understand what your insurance will cover
can make arrangements to extend your stay and be away for longer than planned

Public places and services
The Samoan government announced on 10 June 2021 that it was further relaxing restrictions brought in to limit the spread of COVID-19. Under the new restrictions, some gatherings such as church services, village meetings, and non-contact sport events are permitted.
