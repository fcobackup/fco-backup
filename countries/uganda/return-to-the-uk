Since 22 March, all international flights to and from Uganda have been suspended. Cargo flights are permitted, but crew must observe strict guidelines. Land borders and lake ports are also closed, except for truck drivers.
The British High Commission will continue to work with the Government of Uganda, other embassies and airlines on options for helping British nationals who wish to return home. However, no further UK Government-backed special charter flights are currently planned from Uganda. Entebbe International Airport remains closed and there are currently no commercial flights departing.

Future travel options
If you wish to leave Uganda, you should also register your interest to leave by email to Returnfrom.Uganda@fco.gov.uk.
You will need to pay for your return travel to the UK. Where departure options are available but you cannot afford the travel costs and have exhausted all other options for getting funds, you may be eligible to apply for an emergency loan from the government. This is a last resort option and you would need to repay the loan when you are back in the UK.
If you cannot leave Uganda at this time, see advice on staying in Uganda during coronavirus.
We are issuing regular updates on our Twitter and Facebook pages with the latest available information on possible flights.
