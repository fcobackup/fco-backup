COVID-19 whilst in Ghana: testing positive and close contact rules
Those who test positive and are asymptomatic or have mild symptoms are required to self-isolate at their usual residence in Ghana. This can be private accommodation or at their hotel. Those testing positive with underlying health conditions and/or symptoms will need to go to a government COVID-19 facility or a private health facility accredited by the government for treatment. The self-isolation period is 14 days or until you receive a PCR negative test result.
Entry into a government isolation facility can be arranged in exceptional circumstances although there will likely be a fee.
If you come into contact with someone who has tested positive for COVID-19 while in Ghana, then you have to self-isolate. You should seek the advice of a local medical practitioner on the recommended period of isolation.
Travel in Ghana
Domestic flights and public transport systems are operating normally.
Accommodation
All hotels and other rented accommodation are now open and implementing COVID-19 health and safety measures. Contact your chosen accommodation direct to confirm details.
Public spaces and services
The Government of Ghana has eased COVID-19 social restrictions but these can change at short notice. All in-person activities, such as those that take place in churches, mosques, conferences, workshops, private parties, events, cinemas and theatres may operate at full capacity, provided the audience/participants are fully vaccinated.
The Government of Ghana continues to advise that people wash their hands, use hand sanitiser and avoid over-crowded gatherings.
Healthcare in Ghana
The Ghana Ministry of Health advises that if you develop fever, cough or difficulty breathing and recently returned from a COVID-19 affected area or have come into contact with a person confirmed to have COVID-19, you should call any of the following toll-free numbers: 112, +233 50 949 7700 and +233 558 439 868.
Unlike in the UK, you will need to go to a pharmacy to obtain most over-the-counter medicines. Only a very limited selection are available at supermarkets or other stores and you may be offered another brand or a similar generic medicine as an alternative. Where possible, purchase known brands or medicines with a Ghana Food and Drug Administration registration number stamped on the packet. Pharmacies are widely available and are usually identified by a green cross. They will accept prescriptions from the UK.
