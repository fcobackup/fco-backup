This advice reflects the UK government’s understanding of current rules for people travelling on a full ‘British citizen’ passport from the UK, for the most common types of travel. 
The authorities in Sri Lanka set and enforce entry rules. If you’re not sure how these requirements apply to you, contact the Sri Lankan High Commission in the UK. 
COVID-19 rules 
There are no COVID-19 testing or vaccination requirements for travellers entering Sri Lanka. 
Passport validity requirements 
To enter Sri Lanka, your passport must have an ‘expiry date’ at least 6 months after the day you arrive. 
Check with your travel provider that your passport and other travel documents meet requirements. Renew your passport if you need to.  
You will be denied entry if you do not have a valid travel document or try to use a passport that has been reported lost or stolen. 
Visa requirements 
Tourist visas are normally valid for 30 days. If you overstay your visa you could be fined or detained by the police. 
You must follow the guidelines for tourists issued by Sri Lanka’s Immigration and Emigration department. 
Applying for a visa 
You can get and pay for a Sri Lanka ‘Electronic Travel Authorisation’ (ETA) online, a few days before you arrive. You should get your approval notice within 24 hours, and you can use this to enter Sri Lanka. 
You can also get a 30-day tourist visa on arrival if you land at Bandaranaike International Airport in Colombo. It costs 60 US dollars, which is 10 US dollars more than the ETA. 
You can complete an online arrival form 3 days before arriving in Sri Lanka. The service is free and may save time when you arrive.
If you want to stay for more than 30 days, up to 180 days, you need to apply online as you cannot apply on arrival. 
If you want to extend your visa, contact the Immigration and Emigration department. 
You do not need a visa if you’re travelling through Sri Lanka by air, as long as the connecting flight is within 24 hours of your arrival. Check with your airline about transit times. 
Vaccination requirements  
At least 8 weeks before your trip, check the vaccinations and certificates you need in TravelHealthPro’s Sri Lanka’s guide. 
Depending on your circumstances, this may include a yellow fever vaccination certificate.
Customs rules 
There are strict rules about goods you can take into or out of Sri Lanka. You must declare anything that may be prohibited or subject to tax or duty. 
Taking money into Sri Lanka 
Most major banks allow Visa and Mastercard cash withdrawals. There are ATMs in major towns and cities, but not all accept international cards. 
You cannot transfer money without an exchange control permit issued by the Central Bank of Sri Lanka. 
Some travellers have reported problems using cards on arrival in Sri Lanka when their bank’s automated fraud protection system blocks transactions. Inform your bank in advance of your intended travel arrangements.
