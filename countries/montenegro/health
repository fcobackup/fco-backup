you have appropriate travel insurance for local treatment or unexpected medical evacuation
This is particularly important if you have a health condition or are pregnant.

Contact your insurance or medical assistance company quickly if you’re referred to a medical facility for treatment.

Health insurance cards
Montenegro recognises the Global Health Insurance Card (GHIC).
You will need to take your British passport and GHIC to a local office of the Montenegrin Health Insurance Fund (in Montenegrin) to request a certificate of entitlement to medical care. You need this in advance of medical treatment, or as soon as possible after an urgent admission to hospital. If you do not have a certificate, the hospital will charge for the treatment and paid bills will not be reimbursed.
Any treatment provided is on the same terms as Montenegrin nationals. You’ll have to pay for your prescribed medicines and for other medical treatment.
The NHS’s getting healthcare abroad webpage has details about:
how to apply for a GHIC
how to get temporary cover if you lose your card or it does not arrive in time
what special conditions apply in Montenegro
A GHIC is not an alternative to travel insurance. You may have costs your GHIC does not cover.
