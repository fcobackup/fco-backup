Although there’s no recent history of terrorism in Ecuador, attacks can’t be ruled out.
On 27 January 2018, a car bomb was detonated outside a police station in San Lorenzo, a town near the Colombian border in the Esmeraldas province resulting in 28 people injured. The Ecuadorean government stated this was a terrorist act and has declared a state of emergency in the province.
There’s considered to be a heightened threat of terrorist attack globally against UK interests and British nationals, from groups or individuals motivated by conflict in Iraq and Syria. You should be vigilant at this time.
