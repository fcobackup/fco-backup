Rainy season
The rainy season in much of Thailand is from May to October. In Koh Samui and the south east of Thailand it is from November to March. However, the rainy seasons have been unpredictable in recent years. Heavy storms can cause disruption including from flooding and landslides. Lakes, caves and waterfalls are particularly prone to dangerous flash flooding during the rainy season.
September and October 2022 have so far seen heavy rain across the country, and localised flooding in several areas, including across Bangkok. You should keep up to date with updates and weather warnings from the Thai Meteorological Department. The Bangkok Metropolitan Administration posts updates on its official Facebook and Twitter accounts.
The Mekong River Commission posts updates on the Mekong River levels on its website.
