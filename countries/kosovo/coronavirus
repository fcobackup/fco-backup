Be prepared for your plans to change
No travel is risk-free during COVID-19. Countries may further restrict travel or bring in new rules at short notice, for example due to a new COVID-19 variant. Check with your travel company or airline for any transport changes which may delay your journey home.
Plan ahead and make sure you:
can access money
understand what your insurance will cover
can make arrangements to extend your stay and be away for longer than planned
What to do if you test positive for COVID-19
The Kosovan government ended the COVID-19 state of emergency in May 2023, and lifted all COVID-19 related measures. As a result, there is no longer a legal requirement to self-isolate if you test positive for COVID-19.
Travel in Kosovo
All COVID-19 related measures have been lifted, and public transport is permitted to operate at full capacity.
Bars, restaurants and other public venues are also able to work according to their regular working hours and at full capacity.
