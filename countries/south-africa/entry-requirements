The authorities in the country or territory you’re travelling to are responsible for setting and enforcing the rules for entry. If you’re unclear about any aspect of the entry requirements, or you need further reassurance, you’ll need to contact the embassy, high commission or consulate of the country or territory you’re travelling to.

Passport validity
Technically, your passport should be valid for at least 30 days beyond your intended date of exit from South Africa, in line with South African immigration regulations. However, some immigration officials still request that a passport should have at least 6 months validity on the date of entry to South Africa. To avoid problems at the airport on arrival, you’re advised to ensure your passport meets this requirement.
Your passport should have at least 2 blank pages if you require a visa to enter the country. If you do not need a visa, one blank page will be sufficient.

All British nationals are now required to apply for a visa to enter South Africa. Visas will not be issued for British nationals who have recently been in countries South Africa considers high risk for coronavirus. which including the UK, China, Germany, Iran, Italy, the Republic of Korea, Spain, the USA, France and Switzerland.

The South African government has indicated that those British nationals who are currently in South Africa on a work, study, or other long-term visa may currently remain, under the terms of that visa. If they leave South Africa, they will not be permitted to return on the same visa, and will need to reapply for a new visa.
If you entered South Africa on a 90-day stamp which has not yet expired, you do not require a visa to leave South Africa. But the availability of flights between South Africa and the UK is reducing significantly. South African Airlines has suspended all regional and international flights until 31 May. A number of other airlines are also suspending international flights. You should speak to your airline or tour operator promptly about your return flight.
The South African authorities have told us that British travellers wishing to transit South African international airports en route back to the UK may do so without a visa as long as they stay airside, unless they have been in the UK or another ‘high-risk’ country since 15 March 2020. UK nationals are no longer able transit South African airports en route to third countries, if travelling from the UK or another ‘high risk’ country.
If you overstay, you are likely to be declared undesirable and denied entry into South Africa in future. The enforcement of these penalties is strict, and appeals can take many months to process.
