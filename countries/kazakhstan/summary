Travelling from and returning to the UK
Check what you must do to travel abroad and return to England, Scotland, Wales or Northern Ireland.
If you plan to pass through another country to return to the UK, check the travel advice for the country you’re transiting. If you will pass through a red list country, book your hotel quarantine package before travelling to the UK.
In early January 2022, protests in all main cities led to a nationwide State of Emergency being declared with a curfew in place from 11pm to 7am. The curfew remains in place and may be extended at short notice. On 4 January 2022, protests became increasingly violent, particularly in Almaty where we advise against all but essential travel. Entry to and exit from Almaty is currently difficult, but some trains are now operating to the capital Nur-Sultan and other parts of Kazakhstan. Other cities in the south may also be difficult to access at short notice due to check-points and curfews.
If you are in Almaty, you should stay away from areas where there is a risk that you could get caught up in incidents of unrest. See Safety and security
