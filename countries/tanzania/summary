Travel to Tanzania is subject to entry restrictions
The government of Tanzania has removed mandatory 14-day quarantine requirements for visitors on arrival, as well as the requirement for a negative COVID-19 test.
Tanzania is implementing temperature screening for passengers on arrival. If you show symptoms of COVID-19 on arrival, you may undergo enhanced screening and be required to take a Covid test, followed by a possible 14-day self-isolation.
