On March 17, the Director of the Migration Institute announced that foreigners can leave Guatemalan territory by land through the Tecun Uman border post to Mexican territory. This is an optional decision for all foreigners. We know that foreigners have also been able to leave Guatemala via the El Carmen border post which is also open. Visit the portal of the Mexican Embassy in Guatemala for information on immigration requirements.
