The information on this page covers the most common types of travel and reflects the UK government’s understanding of the rules currently in place. Unless otherwise stated, this information is for travellers using a full ‘British Citizen’ passport.
The authorities in the country or territory you’re travelling to are responsible for setting and enforcing the rules for entry. If you’re unclear about any aspect of the entry requirements, or you need further reassurance, you’ll need to contact the embassy, high commission or consulate of the country or territory you’re travelling to.
You should also consider checking with your transport provider or travel company to make sure your passport and other travel documents meet their requirements.
Entry rules in response to Coronavirus
Entry to Sudan
On 16 March 2020, the Sudanese Civil Aviation Authority closed all airports to regular international commercial passenger airlines. A restricted number of flights are now permitted from regional countries. You should check with your travel agent or your airline for further information regarding flight schedules. Cargo and humanitarian flights continue to operate. Passengers of Sudanese origin are subject to testing for coronavirus (COVID-19) on arrival. All other passengers must possess a certificate confirming a negative test result taken within 72 hours prior to arrival.
Data collection
All arrivals must provide details of their original place of travel, transit and final destination, their address and their contact details in case the authorities need to contact them in the event of another passenger testing positive.
Testing on departure
The Sudanese Civil Aviation authorities require that you undergo a temperature check before entering the airport. Some airlines have strict rules on face coverings and gloves before you may board. You should check the conditions set out by your airline.
Regular Entry Requirements
Visas
British nationals need a visa to visit Sudan. Apply before you travel via the Sudanese Embassy in London.
You should register with the Aliens Department at the Ministry of Interior within 3 days of your arrival in the country. You will need 2 passport size photos. The fee is the Sudanese Pound equivalent of around £35. If you don’t register within 3 days of arrival, you may be fined. Some of the larger hotels will do this for you but you should ask when you check-in.
Visitors to Sudan on a single entry visa need to get an exit visa to leave the country, though this is not always enforced. Exit visas can be processed at the airport. If requested, you should be ready to show proof of your sponsor and pay the exit visa fee of 50 US dollars.
Most foreign residents, including British nationals, also need an exit permit. You should check the details with your sponsor, ideally before your arrival, and to ensure that you understand and are happy with the process. You should also be aware that this requirement could make it difficult for you to leave the country at short notice, should the need arise.
Children under 18
The rules on children under 18 travelling without being accompanied by their father changed in July 2020. Children no longer need to obtain their father or male relative’s consent to enter and exit Sudan.
Previous travel to Israel
If your passport has an Israeli visa or Israeli entry/exit stamps you will not be allowed to enter Sudan.
Yellow fever certificate requirements
Check whether you need a yellow fever certificate by visiting the National Travel Health Network and Centre’s TravelHealthPro website.
Passport validity
Your passport should be valid for a minimum period of 6 months from the date of entry into Sudan.
UK Emergency Travel Documents
UK Emergency Travel Documents (ETDs) are not valid for entry into or transit through the Republic of Sudan. However, ETDs are accepted for exit from the country.
