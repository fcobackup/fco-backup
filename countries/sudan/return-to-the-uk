There are currently only limited commercial options to return to the UK from Sudan (on Emirate’s via Dubai). Since 16 March, regular commercial international passenger flights to and from Sudan have been suspended. Cargo flights are permitted, but crew must observe strict guidelines. Land borders and seaports are also closed, except for food and aid transport.
Emirates’ website currently offers passenger flights from Khartoum to Dubai for selected dates during July. You should visit the Emirates website to check availability and make your booking.
The UK government chartered a special flight to help British nationals in Sudan return to the UK on 21 May. There are currently no further special flights planned. This travel advice will be updated with further information on options to return to the UK as soon as this is available.
You are responsible for arranging your onward travel to the UK or other destination. You should check onward travel options and UAE Covid-19 guidance before you commit to a flight.
The British Embassy is not able to answer any questions about these flights. If you need more information, you should contact Emirates directly.
The Embassy cannot provide further information or advice about departure options over the phone. This page will be updated when departure options become available and, if you are registered with the Embassy, we will alert you by email. To get the latest information sign up for travel advice email alerts.
