This page has information on travelling to The Gambia.
This page reflects the UK government’s understanding of current rules for people travelling on a full ‘British Citizen’ passport from the UK, for the most common types of travel.
The authorities in The Gambia set and enforce entry rules. If you’re unsure how The Gambia’s entry requirements apply to you, contact its UK embassy, high commission or consulate.
All travellers
Airport Development and Security Fee
A compulsory Airport Security Fee must be paid upon entering and exiting the country. The fee is 20 dollars, or equivalent in euros, sterling or local currency. This will be collected via marked kiosks in Banjul International Airport. Visa credit card is accepted. Children below 2 years of age and passengers in transit are exempt.
Coronavirus
From 13 December 2022, all COVID-19 travel restrictions for travellers to The Gambia have been lifted. The rules that previously applied to travellers coming to The Gambia no longer apply:
you are no longer required to show proof of being fully vaccinated
you are no longer required to show proof of a negative COVID-19 test.
Check your passport and travel documents before you travel
Passport validity
If you are visiting The Gambia, your passport should be valid for the proposed duration of your stay.
Contact your travel provider or embassy of the country you are visiting if you think that your passport does not meet both these requirements. Renew your passport if you need to.
Visas
For visits of less than a month, you don’t need to get a visa before you travel. British nationals are given a 28 day stamp in their passports on arrival. You can get further 28 day extensions from the Immigration Office in Banjul or the Tourist Police Stations in the Tourism Development Area.
If you’re planning to enter The Gambia for a period longer than 3 months, check entry requirements with the Gambian High Commission in London.
Yellow fever certificate requirements
Check whether you need a yellow fever certificate by visiting the National Travel Health Network and Centre’s TravelHealthPro website.
