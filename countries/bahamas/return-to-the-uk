Commercial flights
There are currently extremely limited commercial options available to return to the UK from The Bahamas. Due to the travel restrictions there are no direct flights to the UK or Europe. Severely limited options may be possible via other destinations such as the US, but you should refer to those countries’ restrictions before travelling to ensure that you will be allowed to enter the country for onward connection. The Bahamian Tourism Ministry has announced that international commercial air travel will restart on 1 July.
Travellers should contact their airlines, travel agents and tour operators for advice. British Airways have advised that they do not plan to resume flights to Nassau until 1 September. Affected BA customers will be notified of their flight cancellations with status update messages and can call the BA Contact Centre on: 1 877 767 7970 to rebook; or go to www.ba.com
The US Embassy in The Bahamas provide regular updates on limited flight services to the US where transit to the UK may be possible. They are advising that the flight departures to the US are not guaranteed and subject to cancellation at short notice. See travel advice for the USA for details of eligibility to transit the US and other restrictions.
Private aircraft and vessels
Restrictions on private aircraft and vessels have been relaxed. The Bahamas Ministry of Tourism has announced that private aircraft and vessels will be allowed to enter the country from 15 June. Details are available on the Ministry of Tourism website.
Cruise lines: crew
Bahamian flagged cruise lines are able to have safe anchor in The Bahamas but are not allowed to disembark passengers or crew. Each cruise line is making individual plans for their ships. Crew and staff should contact their cruise company for updates and information on those plans.
The Foreign Office have a dedicated team liaising with the Department for Transport and the cruise lines on their plans for crew and other staff. They can be contacted at cruisecrewusa@fco.gov.uk or fcocorrespondence@fco.gov.uk Or please call 020 7008 1500 option 1 for serious health or other emergency consular assistance.
Future options
The UK operated a special flight from Nassau on Tuesday 7 April for British tourists, short term visitors and their direct dependants to return to the UK. Further special flights of this kind are not planned.
While commercial flights and charter airlines continue to provide transit routes via the USA for eligible travellers, the British High Commission Nassau is in contact with airlines, the Bahamian authorities and other governments to make sure other commercial options for returning to the UK are available as soon as possible. British Airways plan to resume their direct route at the end of August. This is subject to change.
You will need to pay for your return travel to the UK. International money and wire services businesses are restricted but the Ministry of Foreign Affairs have said that SunCash is facilitating money transfers and other operators may also be available. Some local banks have adjusted their hours.
If departure options are available but you cannot afford the travel costs and have exhausted all other options for getting funds, you may be eligible to apply for an emergency loan from the government. This is a last resort option and you would need to repay the loan when you are back in the UK.
For more information, you should contact Corporate Travel Management (CTM). CTM are a commercial partner of the FCO and are authorised to administer such loans on behalf of the FCO.
