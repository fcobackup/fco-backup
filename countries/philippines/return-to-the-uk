Commercial options to return to the UK have been running throughout the lockdown period. However the Philippine authorities have announced a temporary suspension of commercial passenger flights beginning at 8am (local time) on 3 May until 7:59am (local time) on 10 May. Contact your airline if you have a flight booked during this time.
Commercial flights
There remains widespread disruption to international travel routes, and domestic flights are currently suspended.
The following airlines have been operating international flights from Manila Ninoy Aquino International Airport, with connections to the UK:
Qatar Airways to London Heathrow, Manchester and Edinburgh, via Doha
Korean Air to London Heathrow, via Seoul Incheon
Gulf Air to London Heathrow, via Bahrain
You will need to pay for your return travel to the UK. If departure options are available but you cannot afford the travel costs and have exhausted all other options for getting funds, you may be eligible to apply for an emergency loan from the government. This is a last resort option and you would need to repay the loan when you are back in the UK. For more information, you should contact Corporate Travel Management (CTM). CTM are a commercial partner of the FCO and are authorised to administer such loans on behalf of the FCO.
Travel to departure airports for commercial flights
Resolution No.15 of the Philippines Inter-Agency Task Force grants that all stranded foreign nationals can travel to and from national government facilities such as airports, ferries, bus terminals etc.
If you plan to take a commercial flight but are experiencing difficulty travelling to the airport due to community quarantine restrictions, the British Embassy can provide a letter to facilitate your passage through checkpoints.
Contact the British Embassy Manila at ukinthephilippines@fco.gov.uk. You can also seek assistance from your local Department of Tourism office, which may be able to offer advice on transport options or hotels.
Your journey home
The National Travel Health Network and Centre (NaTHNaC) provides advice on how to stay safe as you travel by air.
When you arrive back in the UK, follow the guidance for when you return to the UK on steps you should take to protect yourself and others.
Future options
The British Embassy Manila is in contact with airlines, the Philippine authorities and other governments to make sure commercial options for returning to the UK remain open for as long as possible.
