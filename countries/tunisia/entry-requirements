The information on this page covers the most common types of travel and reflects the UK government’s understanding of the rules currently in place. Unless otherwise stated, this information is for travellers using a full ‘British Citizen’ passport.
The authorities in the country or territory you’re travelling to are responsible for setting and enforcing the rules for entry. If you’re unclear about any aspect of the entry requirements, or you need further reassurance, you’ll need to contact the embassy, high commission or consulate of the country or territory you’re travelling to.
You should also consider checking with your transport provider or travel company to make sure your passport and other travel documents meet their requirements.
Entry rules in response to coronavirus (COVID-19)
Entry to Tunisia
Entry requirements into Tunisia vary depending on the prevalence of the epidemic in travellers’ country of residence. One 28 September, the Tunisian authorities classified the UK as a “red” country. This means you will only be permitted to enter Tunisia if you are a Tunisian national or a permanent resident in Tunisia. British nationals that are not permanent residents in Tunisia will not be permitted to enter the country.
After 28 September, only Tunisian residents or nationals will be allowed to enter the country. The following measures will apply:
You must take a PCR test (which detects the presence of the virus) 72 hours before travel and show evidence of the negative test result, with the date of the test clearly labelled, at your point of arrival in Tunisia.
On arrival you will be placed into obligatory quarantine and given a PCR test after five to seven days.
Quarantine will last for 14 days in total. Seven days will be in a quarantine centre. For the second week you will be permitted to quarantine at home if your PCR test comes back negative.
You will need to pay for your accommodation at the quarantine centre.
The Tunisian authorities are updating country classifications regularly so please ensure you check these pages for the latest status before travelling.
Lists of countries and their classifications as “Green”, with a low prevalence of the epidemic, and “Orange”, with a medium prevalence of the epidemic, are published (in French) online. See further information.
Individuals resident in “Red” countries are not permitted to enter Tunisia, unless they are Tunisian nationals or they hold residency in Tunisia.
Transiting Tunisia
A small number of transit flights are operating through Tunisia. If you are transiting through Tunisia, you must comply with sanitary measures and temperature checks.
Testing on arrival
All travellers will have their temperature checked on arrival in Tunisia. No testing will be carried out on arrival, but for those currently permitted to enter Tunisia (Tunisian nationals and residents only) arrivals from all countries, including the UK, need to provide evidence of having taken a coronavirus PCR test that is negative no more than 72 hours before departure. You should not use the NHS testing service to get a test in order to facilitate your travel to another country. You should arrange to take a private test and ensure the certificate is dated. See Entry to Tunisia for further details.
Quarantine requirements
Quarantine requirements vary depending on the prevalence of the epidemic in travellers’ country of residence. Travellers from the UK who are still permitted to enter need to self-quarantine for 14 days on arrival. See Entry to Tunisia
Data collection
On arrival in Tunisia, you must provide your contact details and travel information.
Testing on departure
No testing is available at the airport or sea ports. Passengers travelling from Tunisia, who require a test for the country they are travelling to, should arrange a private test.
Regular entry requirements
Visas
British passport holders don’t need a visa for visits of up to three months. On arrival, security checks are sometimes carried out on British passport holders who were not born in the UK. This can take a few hours and you will need to be patient until clearance is given. These types of checks rarely take place on departure.
Overstay fines
If you stay in Tunisia for longer than the authorised period, you will have to pay a fine. This rule does not apply if you are vulnerable and current circumstances oblige you to remain in the country. This exemption applies until 30 September 2020.
Passport validity
For stays of up to 3 months your passport should be valid for the proposed duration of your stay; you don’t need any additional period of validity on your passport beyond this.
UK Emergency Travel Documents
Tunisian authorities accept UK ETDs for entry to and exit from Tunisia. If you’re leaving Tunisia on an ETD, make sure you have a copy of the police report about the loss/theft of your full validity passport to present to the Immigration Officer.
Dual nationals
Dual British-Tunisian nationals should enter and leave Tunisia on their Tunisian passports.
