Political situation
There continues to be potential for instability in Chad, particularly in its border regions and in the run-up to and during major political events, such as during Chad’s ongoing political transition and ahead of elections, due to take place before the end of 2024.
Public demonstrations including anti-government protests are common in Chad. You should avoid all political rallies and gatherings, demonstrations and protests. Crowds can gather quickly and may become violent. In October 2022, there were clashes between protesters and security forces, with reports of live ammunition being used by security forces and a number of civilian fatalities and casualties.
Foreign, national and local government facilities have been targeted and damaged in previous demonstrations. You should monitor the local news to help you avoid such gatherings. If you become aware of a crowd gathering where you are, you should leave the area immediately.
In April 2021, an armed convoy belonging to the rebel group “Le front pour l’alternance et la concorde au Tchad” (FACT) crossed into north-western Chad from Libya and engaged in fighting with government forces. Then President Idriss Deby Itno was killed and a Transitional Military Council was established to govern Chad. All British nationals were advised to leave the country due to the increased risk of instability. The British Embassy in N’Djamena closed temporarily, and reopened in May 2021.
In April-May 2021 and October 2022 there were violent clashes between protesters and security forces in N’Djamena and southern Chad. A number of people were killed.
In May 2021, there were reports of armed groups entering south-western Chad from the Central African Republic before being repelled by Chadian forces. Chadian rebel groups remain active and could launch attacks in Chad without warning.
Foreign, national and local government facilities have been targeted and damaged in previous demonstrations. You should monitor the local news to help you avoid such gatherings. If you become aware of a crowd gathering where you are, you should leave the area immediately.
Crime
The number of reports of car-jackings on roads outside N’Djamena has increased, including during daylight hours. You should use a police or military escort when driving outside the capital, and carry working communications equipment.
Armed robberies, particularly from cars, in some residential areas of N’Djamena are common. Foreigners are sometimes targeted.
Be vigilant and take particular care in the capital. Consider travelling by car and not by foot, especially if you are alone. Keep doors locked and windows closed. Do not carry large sums of money, jewellery, or other valuables. Avoid isolated or less developed areas of towns and do not travel alone or at night.
Local travel
Before considering any travel outside the capital, take professional security advice. You should follow your employer’s security advice and make sure the correct Chadian authorities are aware of your journey, you have the right permits in place if needed, and you hold comprehensive travel insurance.
The border with Sudan is subject to closure at short notice. The border between Chad and Central African Republic has been closed and instability in neighbouring Central African Republic remains concerning. In May 2021, there were reports of armed groups entering south-western Chad from the Central African Republic before being repelled by Chadian forces.
The area bordering Libya is heavily land-mined. The northern regions of Borkou, Ennedi and Tibesti remain unsafe.
Road travel
Road travel can be dangerous due to the state of the roads and quality of driving. Accidents involving motorbikes are particularly common. Crowds can quickly gather around the scene of an accident and, whilst rarely violent, can be intimidating. If you’re involved in an accident, try to make contact with the police or other local authority immediately.
For travel outside the capital, you will need authorisation from the Ministry of the Interior, which is normally granted without difficulty after a few days. Roads are poor and often impassable during the rainy season (July-October), especially in the south. Heavy rains during the rainy season (July-October) can result in major flooding in many areas, particularly in the south and east. You should ensure you have adequate supplies of food and clean water.
You should travel in convoy, keep doors locked and carry spare fuel and supplies. Police checkpoints are common: you may be asked to show your passport, driving licence and vehicle registration documents. Do not travel by road after dark.
Take care when passing along the road in front of the Presidential Palace in N’Djamena. Do not stop in front of the Palace or drive close to the guards. Do not use this road at night. In three separate incidents in March 2019, 2 motorists were killed by Palace guards, and a motorcyclist shot.
