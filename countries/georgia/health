Warning
FCDO advises against all travel to parts of Georgia.

Before you travel check that:
your destination can provide the healthcare you may need
you have appropriate travel insurance for local treatment or unexpected medical evacuation
This is particularly important if you have a health condition or are pregnant.
Emergency medical number
Dial 112 and ask for an ambulance.
Contact your insurance company quickly if you’re referred to a medical facility for treatment.
Vaccine recommendations and health risks
At least 8 weeks before your trip:
check the latest vaccine recommendations for Georgia
see where to get vaccines and whether you have to pay on the NHS travel vaccinations page
Altitude sickness is a risk in parts of Georgia, including Gudauri ski resort, Mount Kazbegi, and Mount Tetnuldi. Read more about altitude sickness on TravelHealthPro.
Health risks include:
rabies – treatment is available in Tbilisi and major towns. If you’re bitten or scratched by a dog, get medical attention immediately.
