The information on this page covers the most common types of travel and reflects the UK government’s understanding of the rules currently in place. Unless otherwise stated, this information is for travellers using a full ‘British Citizen’ passport.
The authorities in the country or territory you’re travelling to are responsible for setting and enforcing the rules for entry. If you’re unclear about any aspect of the entry requirements, or you need further reassurance, you’ll need to contact the embassy, high commission or consulate of the country or territory you’re travelling to.
You should also consider checking with your transport provider or travel company to make sure your passport and other travel documents meet their requirements.
Entry rules in response to coronavirus (COVID-19)
Entry to Denmark
Border checks are in place at all entry points. If you are not a Danish national and/or resident in Denmark, the rules on entry into Denmark depend on whether you are arriving from an ‘open’ country or a ‘banned’ country. A country’s status can change dependent on its infection rate for COVID-19. The status is updated weekly on Thursdays. You can check each country’s ‘open’ or ‘banned’ status on the Danish government’s Coronavirus website.
Banned country status
The UK is currently a ‘banned’ country. This means that you can only enter Denmark from the UK if you have a ‘worthy’ purpose to enter.
Worthy purpose to enter
You should read the Danish authorities’ online Q&A for further information on what is a ‘worthy’ purpose and the documentation you will be required to submit when entering Denmark with a ‘worthy’ purpose.
You can check with the Danish authorities on their helpline (+45 7020 6044) for advice on the conditions of entry for foreign nationals.
Use of face masks at Danish airports
It is now compulsory to wear face masks on flights with several airlines. You should check with your airline before travel. Passengers are responsible for providing their own face masks. It is compulsory to wear a mask throughout terminals in Danish airports. You should wear a medical mask from the moment you enter the terminals, on board the plane, and until you leave again upon arrival. It is recommended by the Danish health authorities to change the mask every 3 to 4 hours.
Travel to the Faroe Islands
All travellers from the UK to the Faroe Islands must have a “worthy purpose” to enter in line with the Danish government’s entry requirements for “banned” countries.
You should check the latest guidance on entry requirements for travel to the Faroe Islands before departure.
You will be tested for COVID-19 on arrival. A follow up test on the sixth day of the visit is strongly recommended. Children younger than 12 do not need to be tested. Travellers will have to pay for the test. Each test costs approximately DKK 390-500.
You should expect long waiting times upon arrival.
Travellers from banned countries should immediately proceed to “home” quarantine for 14 days. You should read the guidelines for home quarantine before you travel.
Travel to Greenland
All passengers are required to follow provisions related to testing and quarantine and to fill out a “Sumut”-form.
You should check before travel the latest guidance on entry requirements for travel to Greenland
Regular entry requirements
The Danish authorities increased border controls at the land border with Germany in January 2016. Border controls were also introduced in November 2019 for travellers from Rønne, Helsingør, Frederikshavn, Grenaa and those using the Øresund Bridge, including all train traffic from Sweden. These checks are temporary but will be in place for an unspecified period of time.
If you’re travelling using the land border, or by rail, road, or ferry you should make sure you have your passport with you. Allow additional time, be vigilant and follow the instructions of local authorities. Check with local media, your carrier, ferry operator or Danish State Railways (DSB) for more information.
When crossing from Denmark to Sweden various forms of ID are accepted, but must include a photograph, the holder’s full name, social security number or date of birth, holders signature, a stated validity and information on the issuing authority. Children under 18 accompanied by an adult with the appropriate ID are not required to carry ID themselves.
Visas
If you hold a British Citizen passport, you don’t need a visa to enter C. If you’re planning a stay of longer than 3 months, see our Living in Denmark guide and contact the Danish Embassy if you have further questions.
Greenland and the Faroe Islands aren’t members of the European Union. You don’t need a visa to enter for tourism, but you should get a work and residence permit before entry if you intend to live and work there.
The rules on travel will stay the same until 31 December 2020.
Visas from 1 January 2021
The rules for travelling or working in Europe will change from 1 January 2021:
You will be able to travel to countries in the Schengen area for up to 90 days in any 180-day period without a visa for purposes such as tourism. This is a rolling 180-day period.
Therefore, if you’re travelling to Denmark, previous visits to the Schengen area within the 180 days before your date of travel would count against the 90-day limit.
If you are travelling visa-free to Denmark and to other countries in the Schengen area, make sure your whole visit is within the limit.
To stay for longer, to work or study, or for business travel you will need to meet the entry requirements set out by Denmark. This could mean applying for a visa or work permit. You should check with the Danish Embassy what type of visa, if any, you will need.
Periods of stay authorised under a visa or permit will not count against the 90-day limit.
The European Commission has not yet set out how the limit of 90 days in any 180-day period for visa-free travel will be implemented for those who are already travelling in the EU or Schengen Area on 31 December 2020.
If you are travelling to Denmark before 31 December 2020 and will stay until 1 January 2021 or later, you should check with the Danish Embassy for information on how the 90-day visa-free limit will apply to you. This also applies if your stay includes travel to other Schengen area countries.
At border control for Denmark, you may need to:
show a return or onward ticket
show you have enough money for your stay
use separate lanes from EU, EEA and Swiss citizens when queueing
Your passport may be stamped on entry and exit.
Passport validity
The rules on travel will stay the same until 31 December 2020.
Your passport should be valid for the proposed duration of your stay; you do not need any additional period of validity on your passport beyond this.
Passport validity from 1 January 2021
From 1 January 2021, you must have at least 6 months left on an adult or child passport to travel to most countries in Europe (not including Ireland).
If you renewed your current passport before the previous one expired, extra months may have been added to its expiry date. Any extra months on your passport over 10 years may not count towards the 6 months needed.
Check your passport is valid for travel before you book your trip. You will need to renew your passport before travelling if you do not have enough time left on your passport.
UK Emergency Travel Documents
UK Emergency Travel Documents (ETDs) are accepted for entry, airside transit and exit from Denmark. Your ETD must be valid for the proposed duration of your stay.
