This advice reflects the UK government’s understanding of current rules for people travelling on a full ‘British citizen’ passport from the UK, for the most common types of travel.
The authorities in Paraguay set and enforce entry rules. If you’re not sure how these requirements apply to you, contact the Paraguayan Embassy in the UK.
COVID-19 rules
There are no COVID-19 testing or vaccination requirements for travellers entering Paraguay.
Passport validity requirements
To enter Paraguay, your passport should be valid for the duration of your stay.
Check with your travel provider that your passport and other travel documents meet requirements. Renew your passport if you need to.
You will be denied entry if you do not have a valid travel document or try to use a passport that has been reported lost or stolen.
Make sure you get your passport stamped.
Make sure that an immigration official stamps, dates and signs your passport when you arrive. If you do not have an entry stamp in your passport, you will get a fine when you leave the country.
This is important if you enter Paraguay at a land border, typically the crossing between Ciudad del Este and Foz do Iguaçu in Brazil. Long-distance bus drivers sometimes tell foreign nationals that they can complete immigration formalities in Asunción. This is not true, and you will get a fine if you do not get your passport stamped at the point of entry.
Visa requirements
You do not need a visa to visit Paraguay. You will normally get permission to stay for 90 days on arrival.
If you want to stay for another 90 days, check with the Paraguayan Immigration Department (in Spanish). 
If you are travelling to Paraguay to work or study, you should contact the Paraguayan Embassy in the UK or check the Ministry of Foreign Affairs visa information. 
Travelling with children
You need a parental permission document (‘Permiso del Menor’) to bring a child into or out of Paraguay if they are not travelling with both parents. The permission document must be certified by the Paraguayan Embassy in the UK, or your nearest Paraguayan embassy. You can get more information on requirements for children entering or leaving Paraguay from the Paraguayan Immigration Directorate (in Spanish).    
Vaccination requirements
At least 8 weeks before your trip, check the vaccinations and certificates you need in TravelHealthPro’s Paraguay guide.   
Depending on your circumstances, this may include a yellow fever vaccination certificate.
Customs rules
There are strict rules about goods you can take into or out of Paraguay. You must declare anything that may be prohibited or subject to tax or duty.
Taking money into and out of Paraguay
Declare any cash or travellers cheques if the value is 10,000 US dollars or more. You can make an online declaration in advance, or at computer terminals at the airport or place of arrival. You will get a certified declaration to show you brought it in with you.
Many ATMs accept bank cards. When exchanging money, use registered banks or a bureau de change. Do not change money with people on the street or on arrival at the airport as false banknotes are common.
