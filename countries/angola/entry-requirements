This page has information on travelling to Angola. Check what you must do to return to the UK.
This page reflects the UK government’s understanding of current rules for people travelling on a full ‘British Citizen’ passport from the UK, for the most common types of travel.
The authorities in Angola set and enforce entry rules.
All travellers
You will need to show evidence of a negative COVID-19 PCR test completed 72 hours before departure to enter or travel through Angola as a visitor.
In addition to the above requirement, all arriving passengers are required to undergo a rapid COVID-19 test immediately on disembarkation from the plane. The cost of the test is approximately USD $20 and is payable by Angolan bank card and visa card on arrival. The test is undertaken in a hangar at the airport. It usually takes approximately 20 to 40 minutes, depending on the number of passengers being processed, but it is advisable to carry water and refreshments in case there is a long wait.
All departing passengers are required to show evidence of negative COVID-19 PCR test completed 72 hours before departure from Angola.
If you’re fully vaccinated
If you’re fully vaccinated, you can enter Angola without needing to quarantine regardless of your reason for travel.
Only vaccines authorised by the European Medicines Agency or by the World Health Organisation are accepted. All passengers who are fully vaccinated and test negative on disembarkation are exempt from any quarantine requirements.
Any passenger (vaccinated or not) receiving a positive COVID-19 result will go immediately into mandatory quarantine at a government facility for observation and further testing.
If you’re not fully vaccinated
If you’re not fully vaccinated, you will need to undertake compulsory self-quarantine for 7 days before undergoing a further COVID-19 test. A negative test is required to obtain a Titulo De Alta (ALTA) from the approved health centre and to be discharged from quarantine.
If you’ve had COVID-19 in the past year
Children and young people
Travellers of any age, including children under 12 years old, travelling by air or sea must present evidence of a negative COVID-19 PCR test completed 72 hours before departure to enter or travel through Angola as a visitor.
Children under the age of 12 years old do not need to show proof of vaccination on entry to Angola.
There are additional requirements for passengers under 18 entering or transiting through Angola without their parents or legal guardian, or travelling with one parent only. These requirements don’t usually apply to foreign nationals, but as a precaution and to avoid any possible delays, British nationals under 18 entering or transiting through Angola without their parents or legal guardian, or travelling with one parent only, are advised to bring a letter of authorisation to travel from any parent(s) not travelling.
If you’re transiting through Angola
Transiting is when you pass through one country on the way to your final destination.
Check with your airline before departing.
Exemptions
There are no exemptions to Angola’s entry requirements.
Check your passport and travel documents before you travel
Passport validity
Your passport should be valid for a minimum period of 6 months from the date of entry into Angola.
Visas
You must apply for a valid visa and/or work permit before travelling to Angola, otherwise you may be detained at the airport and then deported. The deportation process can take a long time. You should check all entry requirements with the Angolan Consulate in London well in advance of travel.
If you’re applying for a tourist visa, you can submit documentation online in advance of travel and be granted a pre-approval, normally within 72 hours. This allows you to receive your physical visa on entry into Angola, subject to a fee equivalent to USD $120, paid in cash (preferable) or by Visa or MasterCard to the immigration officer on arrival. Further information can be found on the online application portal.
You may be fined 15,000 Kwanzas (Angolan currency) per day if you overstay your visa. You may not be allowed to leave the country until your fine has been paid. Legal action may be taken against you if you don’t pay your fine. This may include being detained, deported or not being allowed to re-enter Angola.
Fines are in place for a wide range of visa offences including (but not limited to) working, studying or residing without the correct visa, changing employment without notifying the authorities, employing staff with incorrect visas, failing to renew residence cards, or changing address without notifying the authorities.
