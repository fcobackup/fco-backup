This information is for people travelling on a full ‘British citizen’ passport from the UK. It is based on the UK government’s understanding of Sierra Leone’s current rules for the most common types of travel.
The authorities in Sierra Leone set and enforce entry rules. If you’re not sure how these requirements apply to you, contact the Sierra Leone High Commission in the UK.  
Passport validity requirements 
To enter Sierra Leone, your passport must have an ‘expiry date’ at least 6 months after the date of your visa application.  
Check with your travel provider that your passport and other travel documents meet requirements. Renew your passport if you need to. 
You will be denied entry if you do not have a valid travel document or try to use a passport that has been reported lost or stolen.  
Visa requirements 
You must have a visa to enter Sierra Leone. 
Applying for a visa 
You can get a visa to visit or for business travel either: 
when you arrive in Sierra Leone for 80 US dollars, paid in cash in US dollars
before you travel – apply online for an e-visa 
Single entry visas are valid for 90 days from date of issuing for visits up to a maximum of 30 days. 
Multiple entry visas are valid for 365 days from date of issuing and are valid for multiple separate trips for up to a maximum of 30 days for each visit. 
If you’re travelling for a purpose other than a visit or business, you must get a visa before you travel. Contact the Sierra Leone High Commission in the UK. 
Vaccine requirements  
To enter Sierra Leone, you must have a certificate to prove you’ve had a yellow fever vaccination.  
For more details about medical entry requirements and recommended vaccinations, see TravelHealthPro’s Sierra Leone guide. 
Mpox
Expect extra health measures, such as temperature checks, hand sanitising and questions on arrival into Sierra Leone. These measures have been put in place to reduce the risks from Mpox. If you are found to have a high temperature, you will be referred to the airport’s medical unit for further evaluation.
Precautions such as social distancing, hand washing and sanitising are in place across businesses and public spaces. If you do not follow local rules, you may be fined or prosecuted. Check locally for rules in place.
Airport security fee 
All passengers must pay a 25 US dollar airport security fee on arrival and departure. You must show proof of payment before immigration. You can pay: 
in advance online through Securipass 
on your mobile through Orange Money or Afrimoney 
at United Bank for Africa or Sierra Leone Commercial Bank  
Customs rules 
There are strict rules about goods you can take into or out of Sierra Leone.
You must declare anything that may be prohibited or subject to tax or duty. 
Export of precious stones  
You must have an export licence to leave Sierra Leone with precious stones. Check the quality of any gems or minerals you buy. Any deals that appear too good to be true probably are.
