Warning
FCDO advises against all but essential travel to parts of Bangladesh.

This guide also has safety advice for regions of Bangladesh.
Terrorism
There is a high threat of terrorist attack globally affecting UK interests and British nationals, including from groups and individuals who view the UK and British nationals as targets. Stay aware of your surroundings at all times.
UK Counter Terrorism Policing has information and advice on staying safe abroad and what to do in the event of a terrorist attack. Find out how to reduce your risk from terrorism while abroad.
Terrorism in Bangladesh
Terrorist attacks in Bangladesh cannot be ruled out.
Terrorist attacks could be indiscriminate, including in places visited by foreign nationals, such as:
crowded areas
religious buildings
political rallies
There have been occasional attacks against minority religious communities and targeting police and security forces. These have included improvised explosive device (IED) attacks in major cities. Some groups have also targeted people who they consider to have views and lifestyles contrary to Islam.
The Bangladeshi authorities continue to disrupt planned attacks. Increases in security force presence and restrictions on movement may be put in place at short notice. You should remain aware of your surroundings, particularly in and around police buildings. Avoid large gatherings and other locations with a police or security presence. Follow the advice of local authorities.
Political situation
Since July, there has been widespread violence across Bangladesh, resulting in deaths. Following the resignation of the former Prime Minister on 5 August 2024, an interim government was formed on 8 August 2024.
Although the situation is calmer, it remains volatile. Be alert to quickly changing situations on the streets. If you see a demonstration starting, move to a place of safety. Follow the advice of local authorities. Follow updates in local media and get email notifications when this travel advice is updated.
Political rallies and demonstrations may continue to take place. These can quickly turn violent and can lead to clashes with law enforcement. During demonstrations and strikes (‘hartals’), there can be arson, violence and vandalism in towns and cities across the country, which can result in fatalities. Attacks against property and public transport are possible.
Police stations
The recent unrest has had an impact on policing. There has been significant damage to some police stations across the country. Most have re-opened, although not all police officers have returned to duty.
If you travel to a police station, make sure someone goes with you.  
Crime
Robbery and violence
Criminal gangs operate in Dhaka and other cities. Thieves often work in pairs on motorcycles or motorised rickshaws known as ‘CNGs’.
Potential threats include armed robbery, violent crime and rape.
Passengers using rickshaws, taxis, buses or trains are vulnerable to violent crime, particularly at night. Avoid using public transport if you’re travelling alone. See Transport risks.
Protecting yourself and your belongings
Beware of pickpockets and bag-snatchers. When walking in public, do not use a mobile phone. Avoid carrying or showing large amounts of money, or wearing expensive-looking jewellery or watches.
Dhaka and Sylhet airports
Dhaka international and Sylhet airports are fully operational. Check with your travel provider for updates.
Risks at Dhaka and Sylhet airports include:
theft, including passport theft
harassment
taxi drivers overcharging or robbing customers
To reduce your risk:
avoid touts offering to carry your bags
keep documents and belongings safe
arrange taxis in advance
Laws and cultural differences
Bangladesh is a majority Muslim country. Respect the local traditions, customs and laws. Make sure your actions do not cause offence.
Personal ID
Local officials may ask you for ID.
Carry copies of the photo page in your passport and your Bangladeshi visa. Keep the originals somewhere safe and leave copies with friends or relatives in the UK.
Dress code
Both men and women should dress modestly to avoid causing offence. Women should cover their shoulders and legs in public.
Ramadan
Ramadan in 2025 is expected to start around the first day of March and last until the end of March.
Ramadan is a holy month for Muslims. Get advice on respecting Ramadan from your tour guide, hotel or business contacts.
You should:
check opening hours of shops and restaurants
follow local dress codes – clothing that does not meet local dress codes may cause more offence at this time, both for women and men
be aware that fasting can cause tiredness, particularly during the later afternoon and early evening
British nationals of Bangladeshi origin
If you’re a British national of Bangladeshi origin, the Bangladeshi government will consider you to be a Bangladeshi citizen, even if you:
have never had a Bangladeshi passport
were born outside of Bangladesh
This may limit the help the UK government can offer you. For more information on Bangladeshi nationality, check with the Bangladeshi High Commission in the UK.
The Bangladesh Police Expatriate Help Cell offers services to foreign nationals, including dual nationals.
Alcohol laws
You may need a liquor permit to drink alcohol in Bangladesh. A liquor permit allows you to drink alcohol in government-licensed bars. Check the requirements at your local district office and apply for a permit if necessary.
Illegal drugs penalties
There are severe penalties for possessing and trafficking illegal drugs. Some drug-related offences are punishable by the death penalty or life imprisonment.
Prison sentences and conditions
If you break local laws, you may get a prison sentence, served in a local prison. Delays and inefficiency in the judicial system can result in long detentions until court hearings eventually take place. Prison conditions are far below UK standards.
British nationals detained in Bangladesh have the right to request access to British High Commission officials.
Family law and property disputes
Family law in Bangladesh is very different from UK law. Always check your legal position when, for example, child custody is an issue.
The British High Commission in Dhaka cannot help British nationals of Bangladeshi origin with land or property problems.
LGBT+ travellers
Same-sex sexual activity is illegal in Bangladesh.

Transport risks
Road travel
If you are planning to drive in Bangladesh, see information on driving abroad.
You need a 1949 international driving permit (IDP) and a UK driving licence to drive in Bangladesh. You cannot buy an IDP outside the UK, so get one before you travel.
Driving standards
Bangladesh has a high rate of road accidents, mainly because:
driving standards are poor
many vehicles are unlicensed and not roadworthy
mandatory vehicle safety checks are often ignored
a large number of rickshaws use the roads and ignore traffic laws
Driving at night is especially dangerous as many drivers do not use headlights or use undipped headlights. There is also a risk of robbery if you travel between towns after dark. Avoid driving alone at night.
Cycle rickshaws and taxis
Cycle rickshaws are not safe – they offer little protection if there is an accident.
Police are often unable to verify private hire drivers’ details, as driving records are often inaccurate.
Ride-hailing apps like Uber are available in Bangladesh. To make sure you get in the right car safely:
wait in a safe location, not out on the street
match the car’s registration plate, make and model
ask the driver to state your name
check the driver’s photo
share your journey details and consider enabling GPS tracking on your phone so trusted contacts can see your location
Buses
The risks of travelling by bus include:
extremely poor maintenance and driving standards
frequent traffic collisions, some resulting in deaths
rape, sexual assaults and other crimes, sometimes committed by the bus crew
Avoid travelling by bus alone and at night.
Air travel
Due to the security situation in Bangladesh, there are frequent disruptions to air travel, often at short notice. Stay in touch with your airline. Security checks at the airport can also be slow.
In 2019, an attempted hijacking took place of a Biman Bangladesh Airlines flight from Dhaka to Dubai via Chittagong. The Bangladesh Civil Aviation Ministry has completed its investigation into the incident. Extra security measures are in place.
Rail travel
The rail network is extensive but old and generally considered slow.
Rail travel risks include:
frequent fatal accidents
flood-damaged bridges and culverts in dangerous condition
crime, including theft and sexual assault
On some trains, you may be able to lock first-class compartment doors. Make sure the door is locked if you’re travelling at night.
For information see Bangladesh Railways.
Sea and river travel
River and sea ferry risks include:
dangerous overcrowding, particularly during religious holidays and other festivals
falsified safety certificates on some vessels
missing or inappropriate safety and survival equipment
lack of communication equipment
criminal gangs targeting vessels
Extreme weather and natural disasters
Find out what you can do to prepare for and respond to extreme weather and natural hazards.
Monsoon season
The monsoon season runs from June to September and can cause widespread flooding and travel disruption.
If travelling, you should check:
access routes
weather updates from the Bangladesh Meteorological Department
the advice of local authorities
Tropical cyclones
There is a risk of tropical cyclones in Bangladesh. Check weather reports from the Bangladesh Meteorological Department and the World Meteorological Organization.
Earthquakes
Around half of Bangladesh, including the cities of Moulvibazar and Sylhet, is in a high-risk earthquake zone. Other areas, including Dhaka, are at moderate risk. Tremors and earthquakes, usually minor ones, happen occasionally.
The US Federal Emergency Management Agency website has advice about what to do before, during and after an earthquake.
Tsunamis
Bangladesh can be affected by tsunamis. In some cases the Bangladeshi government will issue tsunami warnings. Monitor local news and follow any advice given by local authorities.
