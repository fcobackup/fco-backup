If you’re looking to return to the UK you should liaise regularly with your airline. Regular updates on routes operating to the UK from Thailand, and contact details of airlines, can be found on the UK in Thailand Facebook page.
If you wish to leave Thailand you should make a plan to leave now and contact your airline or tour operator. We are aware that many airlines are suspending or reducing flights, both direct and indirect, to the United Kingdom. We anticipate that you will find it increasingly difficult to return to the UK. This disruption is likely to last for many months.
You should also check your airline’s policies towards coronavirus, including whether special requirements are in place such as providing a medical health certificate during the check-in procedure. You should review the coronavirus policies of your travel or health insurance provider.
