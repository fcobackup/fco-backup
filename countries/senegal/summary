The Senegal authorities have introduced new measures in relation to coronavirus. A national state of emergency is in place including a curfew and obligatory wearing of face masks in public. There is a ban on all scheduled commercial air transport until 31 May, with the exception of flights with ‘special authorisation’. See Coronavirus.
The Foreign & Commonwealth Office (FCO) advises British people travelling abroad to return to the UK as soon as possible. British Embassy Dakar is issuing regular updates on Twitter and Facebook with the latest available information on flight departure options for British nationals wishing to leave Senegal. Limited places are now available on direct flights to the UK on 23 and 26 April - for British travelers ordinarily residing in UK and unable to find other options. See Return to the UK
It is not currently possible to obtain a “carte d’etranger” due to Coronavirus restrictions. If you have been in Senegal for over 3 months Senegalese authorities have told us this will not present a problem if you are trying to leave Senegal, provided that the 3 month period expired after the State of Emergency was put in place (23 March).
Strikes, political demonstrations and social protests are a relatively frequent occurrence, particularly in Dakar but also other cities. These are normally peaceful, but can sometimes turn violent. You should exercise caution and avoid areas where demonstrations and large gatherings are likely.
Pickpocketing and street crime are common in parts of Dakar, particularly around Place de l’Indépendance, the central area of the Plateau and the Western Corniche, as well as Goree Island. Be cautious when changing cash given the risk of false money circulating. See Safety and security
Terrorists are likely to try to carry out attacks in Senegal. Attacks could be indiscriminate, including in places visited by foreigners. See Terrorism
You should be vigilant when travelling in Casamance, the region south of The Gambia. Where possible you should avoid travelling at night, stick to main roads and travel in a convoy when you can. The Casamance region has suffered from decades of low intensity separatist violence, largely directed at Senegalese security forces. While the security situation has improved significantly since 2012, there are occasionally violent incidents, including armed attacks on travellers. Mines remain in this area from years of conflict.
There is a lower level of risk in the main tourist areas of the Casamance. See Local travel
Most visits to Senegal are trouble-free.
Take out comprehensive travel and medical insurance before you travel.
If you’re abroad and you need emergency help from the UK government, contact the nearest British embassy, consulate or high commission.
