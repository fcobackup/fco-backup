Cases of coronavirus (COVID-19) have been confirmed in Austria. The Austrian authorities have introduced a number of measures to limit the spread of the virus.
British nationals in Austria should follow the advice of the Austrian authorities. British nationals that wish to leave Austria should contact their travel operator to make arrangements to do so as soon as possible.
Extensive measures are in place throughout Austria, affecting all areas of everyday life. All restaurants, bars and cafes are closed. Face masks are compulsory on public transport and in shops.
Border controls are in force at Austria’s borders with Switzerland and Liechtenstein, and from 10 April at the borders between Austria and Slovakia and the Czech Republic respectively. Please see the travel advice pages for these countries for more information.
Anyone entering Austria from Germany, Hungary, Italy, Liechtenstein, Slovenia or Switzerland, or anyone who has, in the last 14 days, been in an area for which the Austrian Foreign Ministry has travel warnings in place due to COVID-19 (including the UK), must present a medical certificate with micro-biological test results in English, French, German or Italian which is no older than 4 days old. From 14 April until 30 April, these provisions will also apply to anyone entering Austria from all neighbouring states. Anyone with a valid Austrian residence permit arriving in Austria is required to self-isolate for 14 days.
UK nationals transiting through Austria without a stopover do not require a health certificate, if they can prove they are transiting.
Neighbouring countries are restricting movement across borders and conducting health checks. There are no direct air or rail connections from Austria to the Czech Republic, France, Italy, Slovakia, Spain, and Switzerland. You should refer to travel advice for the country you are travelling from/to for information.
