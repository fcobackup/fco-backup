There is a military conflict ongoing in Ethiopia. Military clashes are now occurring in Tigray, Amhara and Afar regional states. The conflict may escalate and spread quickly and with little warning. In the coming days we may see the conflict move closer to Addis Ababa, which could severely limit options for British Nationals to leave Ethiopia. The FCDO advises against all travel to Ethiopia, except Addis Ababa Bole International Airport to which we advise against all but essential travel, because of the risk of the conflict spreading to new areas without prior warning.
You should leave Ethiopia now while commercial options are still available. It is likely to become much more difficult to leave Ethiopia in the coming days. The deterioration in the political and security situation, means that the assistance the British Embassy can provide is likely to be very limited. Do not rely on the FCDO being able to evacuate you in an emergency. Currently, there are commercial flights to most destinations from Addis Ababa Bole International Airport, with most domestic flights operating normally (except Semera, Dessie, Weldiya and Tigray). Addis Ababa Bole International Airport is a transit hub for flights across Africa and these flights continue to operate safely at this time.
Given the rapidly changing situation in Ethiopia, some staff and dependents in the British Embassy Addis Ababa have been temporarily withdrawn. If you need urgent help, call +251 (0)11 617 0100. If you experience technical difficulties or if you are in the UK call +44 (0)20 7008 5000.
You should check that you are prepared for dealing with a crisis overseas Keep your passport, and those of immediate family members, up-to-date, along with any visas that you may require; during a crisis, visa services may be limited or closed, which could make travelling more complicated (see our crisis guidance). If your British passport has expired, you can apply for an Emergency Travel Document.
Please make sure you are ready to change your plans quickly if you need to. If you are in the vicinity of military activity and you cannot leave safely, you should stay indoors, away from windows and remain alert to developments that would enable you to leave safely.
On 2 November, a nationwide State of Emergency was declared. Public meetings and demonstrations are banned. Movement without ID will be restricted. Curfews and roadblocks may be introduced with little or no warning. There is likely to be an enhanced security presence. Travellers are advised to monitor local news and social media closely and comply with instructions from the authorities. You should carry copies of your identification at all times. You should avoid large gatherings and demonstrations.
The nationwide State of Emergency provides the police with greater powers to arrest and to search property. You should be aware that the police are using these powers where there are security threats or where there is a concern about an individual’s support to banned groups. Those of Tigrayan or Oromo ethnicity may face increased scrutiny, although this power could affect all people, including at the airport and through direct police operations. You should comply with the law, including on carrying ID cards, possession of foreign currency and possession of weapons. You should avoid confrontation and follow the instructions of the authorities. See Addis Ababa
