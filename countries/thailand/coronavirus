Entry and borders
International passenger flights to Thailand are suspended until 31 May.
An Emergency Decree is in place until 30 April. It means the Thai authorities have barred all foreign nationals from entering or transiting Thailand except in certain limited circumstances. If you do not meet one of the following criteria you should not try to enter or transit Thailand:
persons on diplomatic or consular mission, or under International Organisations, representatives of governments performing their duties in Thailand or other persons or international agencies that the Ministry of Foreign Affairs gives permissions, and their families. They must have a fit-to-fly health certificate (issued no more than 72 hours before travelling) and a Certificate of Entry issued by the Ministry of Foreign Affairs. If suspected of carrying COVID-19, they may be denied entry into the country
non-Thai nationals with work permits or who have been granted permission from Thai government agencies to work in Thailand. They must have a fit-to-fly health certificate (issued no more than 72 hours before travelling), a Certificate of Entry issued by the Royal Thai Embassy or the Royal Thai Consulate-General in their country of departure, and a completed Declaration Form. Upon entry into Thailand, they will be subject to a 14-day state quarantine at a Thai government-designated facility at their own expense. If suspected of carrying COVID-19, they may be denied entry into the country
persons exempted by the Prime Minister or Permanent Secretary of Ministry of Foreign Affairs, under certain conditions and for a prescribed time period
pilot-in-command and crew members – with a fixed travel schedule
carriers of necessary cargoes – they must leave the country immediately after their mission is completed
You should keep up to date with the latest information on the websites of the Civil Aviation Authority of Thailand, and the Ministry of Public Health.
Transit passengers
Due to the ongoing Emergency Decree travellers are not permitted to transit Thailand, except those people listed above in ‘Entry and Borders’.
Thai authorities may introduce further measures. You can monitor the latest updates from Thailand’s Ministry of Public Health website, and refer to their Q&A for travellers.
Social measures
The Thai authorities have introduced measures that place restrictions on public gatherings. A nationwide curfew is in effect daily from 10pm until 4am until further notice.
The only exceptions are medical personnel, banking sector workers, transportation of essential goods, commuting to and from the airport (with flight tickets), postal delivery, and those with official night shift duty. Violation of this curfew can lead to 2 years in jail and/or 40,000 THB fine.
You should follow local guidance. There have been multiple cases of foreign nationals being arrested and fined or sentenced to jail for breaching curfew restrictions.
The sale of alcohol has now been temporarily banned in many provinces, including Bangkok.
In many provinces of Thailand all non-essential businesses are temporarily closed, and are expected to remain so until at least 30 April. Supermarkets, pharmacies, sections in malls selling foodstuffs and restaurants offering takeaway service remain open, although some restrictions on opening times have been applied.
All entertainment venues such as pubs and clubs, and educational institutions are temporarily closed, as are popular tourist activities. Some provinces may impose stricter measures including curfews or lockdowns on certain premises. There are screening checkpoints in place for travel between provinces.
An emergency decree came into force on 26 March 2020, initially until 30 April 2020 (subject to extension). A number of measures have been outlined stating, among other instructions, that individuals must not:
enter high risk areas
hoard essential goods
attend public gatherings
propagate false information
The Thai authorities have advised the elderly (over 70 years), children (under 5 years) and those with pre-existing medical conditions (diabetes, hypertension, respiratory diseases, lung diseases) not to leave their home except for essential purposes, such as buying groceries, conducting business transactions, going to a hospital or filing complaints to the police.
The Thai authorities have introduced instructions that all passengers must wear masks on all public transport. Many supermarkets and other businesses that remain open have the same requirement.
The Thai Department of Disease Control linked the smoking of cigarettes to the impact of coronavirus. Smoking in public is banned and can result in a fine of up to 5,000 Baht. Electronic cigarettes are already illegal in Thailand and their use may incur further fines or imprisonment.
Travel restrictions
Since 26 March 2020 the Thai authorities have been implementing measures to deter travelling between provinces. A large proportion of internal bus and train routes are closed and there are some restrictions on travel between provinces.
If you are taking an internal flight inside Thailand you are required to download the AOT Airports App and complete a T8 Travel Form. A number of regional airports, including Phuket, are temporarily closed. There are a number of road checkpoints in place across Thailand so you should carry a passport as proof of identification when in public.
Further measures may be introduced at any time. All British nationals are advised to follow the advice of the Thai authorities.
All British nationals in Thailand are advised to remain up to date with the latest health advice provided by Thailand’s Ministry of Public Health and updates from the Thai Government on the situation.
Provincial authorities may enact measures which are stricter or different to those in other areas, including making masks compulsory at all times, longer curfews or the closure of hotels and beaches. Some provinces have closed their borders entirely, imposed internal travel restrictions, or are asking tourists to use particular hotels. You should check you can access accommodation and the services you need for the duration of your stay and if you can’t you should change your plans.
