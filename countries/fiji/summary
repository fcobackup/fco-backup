Weather system TD 13F has become Tropical Cyclone Keni. The Fiji Meteorological Office forecast that TC Keni will pass to the south of Fiji’s main island of Viti Levu, bringing heavy rain and high winds. This will likely exacerbate the flooding and damage caused recently by Tropical Cyclone Josie. Expect rising river levels and the potential of flash flooding. Avoid travel in low-lying areas and on flooded roads. Flights into and out of Fiji will be disrupted. Monitor weather updates from the Fiji Meteorological Service, in local newspapers and on Radio Fiji 2 on 105 FM, and follow the advice of the local authorities including any evacuation orders. See our Tropical Cyclones page for further advice about what to do if you’re caught up in a storm.
