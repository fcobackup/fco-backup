Terrorism
There is a high threat of terrorist attack globally affecting UK interests and British nationals, including from groups and individuals who view the UK and British nationals as targets. You should remain vigilant at all times.
UK Counter Terrorism Policing has information and advice on staying safe abroad and what to do in the event of a terrorist attack. Find out how to reduce your risk from terrorism while abroad.
Terrorism in France
Terrorists are very likely to try to carry out attacks in France.
Terrorism attacks could be indiscriminate, including in places frequented by foreign nationals such as:
shopping centres
entertainment establishments
cultural events
public transport
places of worship
Methods of attack have included knife attacks, shootings, bombings and vehicle attacks. Be vigilant in public places and follow the advice of local French authorities.
There have been several recent high-profile terrorist attacks in France, including: 
in 2023, one person was killed in a knife and hammer attack in central Paris  
in 2023, a teacher was killed in a knife attack in a school in Arras
Industrial action
Throughout June, planned industrial action by port worker and air traffic control unions is expected to disrupt some ferry routes and flights across France, with some routes and flights diverted or cancelled. 
Check your operator’s advice before travelling, including where you are taking connecting flights.
Until September, possible industrial action may cause disruption on the Paris public transport system (RATP). Check the RATP website for live service updates.
Crime
Protecting your belongings
Take sensible precautions against street and car crime. Pickpockets can work in gangs; one distracts you while the other one goes into your bag. Don’t leave your passport or other valuable items alone in vehicles.
Thieves and pickpockets operate on the Paris underground, RER lines and at mainline stations. Make sure you:
don’t keep your passport, credit cards and other valuables in the same place
use the inside compartments in bags where possible
carry your bag across your body rather than on your shoulder
keep your belongings close to you in restaurants and bars
aren’t distracted around tourist attractions and cash points
If your passport is lost or stolen, it is advisable to report this to the police and obtain a police report.
Assault
There have been several cases of serious assault on the RER (train) line B, which serves:
Paris Charles de Gaulle airport
Orly airports
Paris Gare du Nord Eurostar terminus
There have also been serious assaults on RER line D, which serves the Stade de France.
Be drink aware
Drinks served in bars abroad are often stronger than those in the UK. Be careful about taking drinks from strangers or leaving your drinks unattended. Victims of spiked drinks have been robbed and sometimes assaulted.
Laws and cultural differences
Personal ID
You must be able to prove your identity either by providing documents when asked or within 4 hours at a police station. Identity documents can be:
passport
photo driving licence
other documentation provided by a government body
Covering your face in public
Covering your face in public places in France is illegal. This includes balaclavas, full veils or any other garment or mask that is used to hide the face. You can be fined up to €150 euros if you don’t comply. Forcing someone to hide their face is also a crime and is punishable by a year’s imprisonment and a fine of up to €30,000 euros. If the person forced to hide their face is under 18 years old, the sentence is doubled. This law applies to tourists.
Outdoor activities and adventure tourism
Swimming safety
Some beaches may have strong undercurrents known as riptides (baïnes), especially along the Atlantic Coast. Local sea conditions can be dangerous even for strong swimmers.
Most beaches have lifeguards and flag warning systems. Make sure you understand the warning system before swimming and always follow the advice closely. Follow local advice if there are jellyfish in the sea.
There is a risk of rip tides in some areas, particularly around the coast of Gironde and Landes. See further information on the Gironde Prefecture French local authority website (in French).
See more information on safe swimming on ABTA’s swim safe webpages.
Trekking, winter sports and mountaineering
Check weather forecasts and conditions and make sure you’re properly prepared. Don’t undertake any activity alone and consider hiring a guide for expert advice. Always leave copies of your itinerary with someone.
For sporting activities, or travel to mountainous areas, make sure your insurance covers you for extra medical costs in case of accident or emergency, mountain rescue services and helicopter costs. In the départements of Savoie and Haute-Savoie, you may need to be transferred to Switzerland for treatment.

Transport risks
Road travel
If you’re planning to drive in France, see information on driving abroad and read the RAC France guide .
Licences and permits
You need either a 1968 international driving permit (IDP) or a valid UK driving licence to drive in France. The 1949 IDP is not accepted anymore. You cannot buy an IDP outside the UK, so get one before you travel. You must be 18 or over to drive in France.
Driving a British car abroad
You may need a UK sticker to drive your car outside the UK. These have replaced GB stickers. Check the guidance on displaying number plates if you are driving outside the UK.
Road safety
If you’re involved in a car accident or witness an accident on the motorway, use the orange emergency phones to ask for help.
If you are driving long distances in France:
plan your journey carefully
take into account unknown roads, weather conditions and fatigue
take regular breaks
Keep vehicle doors locked in slow-moving traffic and secure your vehicle if you leave it unattended.
Information on road safety and potential traffic black spots is available on the Bison Futé website (in French only). Alternatively, real-time information on road traffic conditions is available on 107.7 FM in French and in English (Motorways radio – Autoroute Info).
Migrants around Calais may try to enter the UK illegally. Sometimes migrants might try to slow down traffic on roads to ports, including by placing obstacles on the Calais Port road. If this happens, keep moving where it’s safe to do so, or stop and call 112 if isn’t safe to proceed. Keep car doors locked.
Driving regulations
France has strict drink driving laws. Police regularly carry out roadside checks for alcohol and drugs. Penalties include fines, loss of licence and prison. You can be given on-the-spot fines for a variety of driving offences, including speeding.
Air pollution sticker
All vehicles driving in central Paris, Lyon and Grenoble must display a pollution sticker from 8am to 8pm, Monday to Friday. Checks can happen at any time, depending on pollution levels.
Some older vehicles don’t qualify for a sticker at all due to their high emissions. These vehicles can’t be driven in central Paris at all from 8am to 8pm, Monday to Friday.
Other cities may also limit vehicle access to town centres and main roads. For more information or to apply for a sticker, visit the French Ministry of Environment website.
Road hauliers
Burglaries can happen while lorry drivers are asleep in their vehicles. You should:

There have been many attempts by illegal migrants to enter vehicles while stationary or in slow-moving traffic. Take sensible precautions, particularly in northern France.
Extreme weather and natural disasters
Forest fires
Forest fires happen anywhere in southern France during the summer months, particularly along the Mediterranean coast and in Corsica.
Fires have become more frequent because of drought and high temperatures. French authorities may evacuate areas and close roads for safety reasons.
If you’re staying in a high-risk area, you shoud:
check the local safety and emergency procedures
be vigilant
follow the advice of local authorities
See more information on how to stay safe on the French Government website. If you are caught in, or witness a wildfire, call the emergency services on 18 (fire) or 112 (emergency services).
Flooding
There is a risk of flooding in areas of France. If your accommodation is near a river, check the vigicrues website for more information on potential flood risks.
Avalanches
There is a risk of avalanches in mountainous areas. Check weather conditions on the Meteo France website and follow local advice before you ski or hike.
Observe all warnings about avalanches and where appropriate consider carrying avalanche search equipment. Check the latest avalanche risk areas on the Meteo Alarm website. Conditions on roads in mountainous areas can quickly become difficult in winter. Carry water, food, warm clothing and medicines in your vehicle.
