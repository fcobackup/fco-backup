Guatemala has active volcanos, some prone to heightened activity. Some are at high altitude with sub-zero temperatures at night. Six tourists died of exposure on Acatenango in January 2017. Warm clothing and waterproofs are essential. Local tour organisers tend to underestimate the risks.
Before climbing volcanos, you should check and follow the advice of local authorities and monitor the situation. See Volcanos. Also visit the website of the Guatemalan Meteorological Office, “INSIVUMEH” and the disaster agency “CONRED” for information on access, restrictions and recommendations.
Avoid travelling on public buses (repainted US school buses). Private inter-city coach services are safer, but not immune from attack. See Local travel
