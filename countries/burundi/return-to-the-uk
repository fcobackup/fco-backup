If you cannot leave Burundi at this time, you should:
• follow the advice of local authorities, including local measures to help minimise your risk of exposure to coronavirus
• find accommodation that’s suitable for your needs
• keep in regular contact with family and friends at home, so they know you are safe and well

You will need to pay for your return travel to the UK. If departure options are available but you cannot afford the travel costs and have exhausted all other options for getting funds, you may be eligible to apply for an emergency loan from the government. This is a last resort option and you would need to repay the loan when you are back in the UK. For more information, you should contact Corporate Travel Management (CTM). CTM are a commercial partner of the FCO and are authorised to administer such loans on behalf of the FCO.
