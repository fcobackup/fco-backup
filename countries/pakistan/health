At least 8 weeks before your trip, check the latest country-specific health advice from the National Travel Health Network and Centre (NaTHNaC) on the TravelHealthPro website. Each country-specific page has information on vaccine recommendations, any current health risks or outbreaks, and factsheets with information on staying healthy abroad. Guidance is also available from NHS (Scotland) on the FitForTravel website.
General information on travel vaccinations and a travel health checklist is available on the NHS website. You may then wish to contact your health adviser or pharmacy for advice on other preventive measures and managing any pre-existing medical conditions while you’re abroad.
The legal status and regulation of some medicines prescribed or purchased in the UK can be different in other countries. If you’re travelling with prescription or over-the-counter medicine, read this guidance from NaTHNaC on best practice when travelling with medicines. For further information on the legal status of a specific medicine, you’ll need to contact the embassy, high commission or consulate of the country or territory you’re travelling to.
While travel can be enjoyable, it can sometimes be challenging. There are clear links between mental and physical health, so looking after yourself during travel and when abroad is important. Information on travelling with mental health conditions is available in our guidance page. Further information is also available from the National Travel Health Network and Centre (NaTHNaC).
Coronavirus
There is an ongoing outbreak of coronavirus (COVID-19). The virus originated in China, but cases have been confirmed in several other countries, including Pakistan.
The Pakistan Government is taking precautions to prevent the spread of the virus, including the closure of schools.
On 13 March the government announced the closure of the border with Iran, Afghanistan and Sost border with China and that all outgoing and incoming international flights are limited to Karachi, Islamabad and Lahore airports only. On 17 March the government lifted restrictions on international flights to all airports except Gwada and Turbat. Check with your airline whether you are affected. The government also announced on 17 March that international air passengers arriving in Pakistan from 00:01 UTC/ 05:01 PST on 21 March will need to present an original test result for coronavirus (COVID-19). The test must have been taken in the 24 hours prior to boarding the flight, and must show the name and passport number of the passenger. UK health institutions do not issue coronavirus (COVID-19) medical certificates. From 00:01 UTC/ 05:01 PST on 21 March the risk of being unable enter Pakistan will be extremely high. You should factor this into your travel plans, and contact your airline. All international arrivals in Karachi airport must self-isolate for 14 days.
