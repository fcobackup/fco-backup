For updates on future options for returning to the UK please monitor this page and our social media channels (UKinCyprus on Facebook and Twitter).
There are currently limited, commercial options available to return to the UK from Cyprus. From 9 June, Wizz air has an agreement with the Cyprus government to operate flights from Larnaca to London Luton, bookable on the Wizz air website. Given the current closure of the Green Line, if you are located in the north of the island and wish to take one of these flights, you will need to provide your details to the British High Commission in Nicosia 48 hours in advance of your flight, in order to comply with Republic of Cyprus regulations. You should send an email to UKinCyprus@fco.gov.uk stating:
Your name
Date of birth
British passport number
Date of your confirmed flight booking
In providing these details to the British High Commission, you agree that they may be passed to the Cypriot authorities.
The UK government is not responsible for any decisions taken by the Republic of Cyprus authorities at their Green Line crossing points and passing your details to the British High Commission in Cyprus is not a guarantee that you will be allowed to cross. No other airline is currently operating direct flights to the UK until further notice.
From 21 June, Turkish Airlines has announced that it intends to operate flights from the north of Cyprus to Turkey. All flights are advertised and available to purchase on the Turkish Airlines website. Consult the travel advice for Turkey for the latest information on entry requirements.
For all flight routes, you should contact your airline for the latest information on flight status and availability over the coming months, however please bear in mind that flights could be cancelled at short notice.
Future travel options
The British High Commission in Nicosia is issuing regular updates on Twitter and Facebook with the latest available information on departure options from Cyprus.
You should also contact airlines or travel operators directly for more information on options for leaving the island. Sign up for travel advice email alerts here..
You will need to pay for your return travel to the UK. If departure options are available but you cannot afford the travel costs and have exhausted all other options for getting funds, you may be eligible to apply for an emergency loan from the government. This is a last resort option and you would need to repay the loan when you are back in the UK.
For more information, you should contact Corporate Travel Management (CTM). CTM are a commercial partner of the FCO and are authorised to administer such loans on behalf of the FCO.
