The Tuvalu authorities have introduced a number of precautionary measures in response to the coronavirus (COVID-19) pandemic.
There are now a number of confirmed coronavirus cases in the South Pacific. The situation may change rapidly, including in neighbouring countries. Follow local guidance at all times.
We advise all non-resident British nationals to leave, and for resident British nationals to be aware of Australia and New Zealand border closures and maintain contact with travel providers on flight restrictions.
