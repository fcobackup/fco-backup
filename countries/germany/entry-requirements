The information on this page covers the most common types of travel and reflects the UK government’s understanding of the rules currently in place. Unless otherwise stated, this information is for travellers using a full ‘British Citizen’ passport.
The authorities in the country or territory you’re travelling to are responsible for setting and enforcing the rules for entry. If you’re unclear about any aspect of the entry requirements, or you need further reassurance, you’ll need to contact the embassy, high commission or consulate of the country or territory you’re travelling to.
You should also consider checking with your transport provider or travel company to make sure your passport and other travel documents meet their requirements.
Entry rules in response to coronavirus (COVID-19)
Entry to Germany
The German Government has extended its ban on all air passenger flights arriving from the UK to Germany to a ban on all forms of transport until Wednesday 6 January.
During this period, transport operators are banned from offering plane, bus, ferry and train journeys from the UK to Germany.
From 1 January 2021, transport operators can apply to the German authorities for an exemption to transport individuals who are resident in Germany. Please contact your transport operator for more information.
In order to travel to Germany on exempt transportation from 1 January 2021 UK nationals resident in Germany will require proof of residence. If you are not yet in possession of a residence card, you will be required to provide evidence that you are resident in Germany.
This could include an address registration certificate (Meldebescheinigung), a tenancy agreement, a utility bill in your name, or a certificate of application (Fiktionsbescheinigung).
Travellers arriving in Germany who have been in the UK in the preceding 10 days will be required to provide their local public health authority with a negative coronavirus test result. The test result can be in either paper or electronic form and must be no older than 48 hours. You should attempt to be tested before travel, otherwise a test will be taken upon entering Germany. Even with a negative test, you will still then be required to self-isolate for 10 days following your arrival in Germany, with the possibility for test and release after 5 days
You can find further details about the current restrictions, including quarantining after a negative test on the German Health Ministry website.
For more information on testing requirements, visit the Robert Koch Institute page.
You can find your local public health authority online.
If you’re travelling to Germany from an EU/EEA country, you do not need to demonstrate a valid reason to enter Germany. You may be required to quarantine (see below). Please be aware that the German government is advising against all non-essential travel.
If you’re travelling to Germany from a country outside the UK or EU/EEA, you will also not need a valid reason for travel if you are a German resident (this also applies for any core family members travelling with you). Guidance for other travellers is available on the German Federal Police website (in German).
However, if you’re travelling to Germany from an area designated as presenting an increased risk of infection, you will need to follow the rules on quarantine on arrival, as set out below. The UK is currently designated as an increased risk area.
The Federal Ministry of the Interior has detailed information on its website, including in English, about the rules on entry and exit from Germany.
Travel from increased risk areas
If, in the ten days before you travel to Germany, you have been in an area designated as presenting an increased risk of infection, you must register online in advance of travelling to Germany. This online registration process replaces the paper landing cards previously required for travellers from risk areas.
On arrival you must travel to your accommodation and quarantine there for ten days. After five days it is possible to secure release from quarantine with a negative test.
There are some exemptions from the quarantine requirement, including for frontier workers and individuals deemed to be providing essential activities. Precise rules are set by the federal states, so please consult the provisions applicable in the place where you are staying.
The UK is currently designated as an increased risk area. You can find the full list of areas in English on the Robert Koch Institute website.
Transiting Germany
British citizens (and all EU/EEA citizens) can transit via Germany as part of a longer journey.
Regular entry requirements
Visas
If you hold a British Citizen passport, you don’t need a visa to enter Germany. If you’re planning a stay of longer than 3 months, see our Living in Germany guide and contact the German Embassy if you have further questions.
The rules on travel will stay the same until 31 December 2020.
Visas from 1 January 2021
The rules for travelling or working in Europe will change from 1 January 2021:
you will be able to travel to countries in the Schengen area for up to 90 days in any 180-day period without a visa as a tourist, to visit family or friends, to attend business meetings, cultural or sports events, or for short-term studies or training
if you are travelling to Germany and other Schengen countries without a visa, make sure your whole visit is within the limit. Visits to Schengen countries within the previous 180 days before you travel would count towards the 90-day limit
To stay for longer, to work or study, for business or for other reasons, you will need to meet the entry requirements set out by Germany. This could mean applying for a visa and/or work permit. You should check with the German Embassy what type of visa and/or work permit, if any, you will need.
if you are in Germany with a visa or permit, your stay will not count towards the 90-day limit.
The 90-day limit for visa-free travel will begin on 1 January 2021. Any days you stay in Germany or other Schengen countries before 1 January 2021 will not count towards the 90-day limit.
At border control for Germany, you may need to:
show a return or onward ticket
show you have enough money for your stay, and
use separate lanes from EU, EEA and Swiss citizens when queuing
Your passport may be stamped on entry and exit.
Entry for British citizens who are resident in Germany
If you are resident in Germany, please carry proof of your residence when travelling.
If you were living in Germany before 31 December 2020, you should carry your residence document (Aufenthaltsdokument-GB), as well as your valid passport when you travel. If you have applied but not yet received your document, carry your certificate of application (Fiktionsbescheinigung).
If you have not yet applied for a residence document GB, you should carry evidence that you are resident in Germany. This could include an address registration certificate (Meldebestätigung), tenancy agreement, or a utility bill in your name, dating from 2020.
If you cannot show that you are resident in Germany, you may be asked additional questions at the border to enter the Schengen area, and your passport may be stamped. This will not affect your rights in Germany.
Passport validity from 1 January 2021
From 1 January 2021, you must have at least 6 months left on an adult or child passport to travel to most countries in Europe (not including Ireland).
If you renewed your current passport before the previous one expired, extra months may have been added to its expiry date. Any extra months on your passport over 10 years may not count towards the 6 months needed.
Check your passport is valid for travel before you book your trip. You will need to renew your passport before travelling if you do not have enough time left on your passport.
UK Emergency Travel Documents
UK Emergency Travel Documents (ETDs) are accepted for entry, airside transit and exit from Germany.
Working in Germany
If you intend to work in Germany, you should get detailed information on employment regulations from the German Embassy.
