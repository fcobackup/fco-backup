The Slovak government has imposed restrictions on public life to counter the spread of COVID-19.

From 8 February, the measures and restrictions in a given district may change according to the local epidemiological situation, as set out in a framework announced by the Slovak government known as the ‘Covid Automat’. Details can be found on the Slovak government website (in Slovak only).
Nationwide, the following restrictions remain in force:
Facemasks must be worn outdoors in all built-up areas, such as towns and villages. The wearing of facemasks remains compulsory indoors, including on public transport and in shops. Masks are not required in the countryside if you are with others from the same household or can maintain a five-metre distance
Visits to and meetings with other households are no longer allowed
Restaurants, bars and cafés may only operate a takeaway service
Ski resorts and hotels are closed
The number of people in shops is restricted and temperature checks may be carried out at the entrances. You must maintain a two metre distance when queuing. Supermarkets and chemists have reserved shopping hours between 9am and 11am for those over 65
From 8 February, either a recent negative test result, proof of recovery from C19 within the last 3 months, evidence that you have a medical condition preventing your ability to take a test, or a course of vaccination completed at least 14 days previously will be required for the following activities:
