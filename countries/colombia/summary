Given the ongoing situation in Colombia, as of 6 July a small number of UK-based staff and dependants in the British Embassy have been temporarily withdrawn. The Embassy will continue to carry out all its regular work including providing 24/7 consular assistance and support to British people in Colombia.

Terrorists are very likely to try to carry out attacks in Colombia. The security situation can change very quickly in many areas of the country. You should pay close attention to warnings issued by the Colombian authorities. See Terrorism
Despite high levels of crime, most visits to Colombia are trouble-free. See Crime
If you’re abroad and you need emergency help from the UK government, contact the nearest British embassy, consulate or high commission. Consular support is limited in parts of Colombia where we advise against all but essential travel and areas where there is a limited state presence. When consular support is unavailable, the British Embassy will liaise with local authorities to request assistance.
If you need to contact the emergency services, call 123 (in Spanish).
UK health authorities have classified Colombia as having a risk of Zika virus transmission. For more information and advice, visit the website of the National Travel Health Network and Centre website.
