Cases of coronavirus (COVID-19) have been confirmed in Equatorial Guinea. The Equatorial Guinea authorities have introduced a number of measures to limit the spread of the virus
Entry and borders
The Government of Equatorial Guinea has announced the suspension of all international flights.
All land, air and sea borders have been closed, however cargo planes and some commercial activities related to the import of food and work materials into the country will be permitted.
Visas
All Equatorial Guinea diplomatic missions abroad are prohibited from issuing entry visas to Equatorial Guinea.
The Government of Equatorial Guinea has confirmed it will not penalise British nationals whose visas have expired while they are unable to leave the country due to coronavirus restrictions. If this is your situation, you should write a letter to the Ministry of Foreign Affairs (Visa Section) informing them, and keep a copy for future visa applications. You will be allowed to leave the country freely when able to, and this will not affect your chances of being granted a visa in the future.
Local measures
Residents are restricted from movement within the country, except for justified reasons. The use of masks when moving around has been made obligatory.
Further information
Further information on coronavirus, including advice on preparing for foreign travel and helping reduce the spread of the virus, is available from Public Health England and on the TravelHealthPro website.
