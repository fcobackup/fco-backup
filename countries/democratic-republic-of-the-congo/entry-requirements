Warning
FCDO advises against all travel to parts of Democratic Republic of the Congo.

This information is for people travelling on a full ‘British citizen’ passport from the UK. It is based on the UK government’s understanding of current rules for the most common types of travel.
The authorities in the Democratic Republic of the Congo (DRC) set and enforce entry rules. If you’re not sure how these requirements apply to you, contact the DRC Embassy in the UK.
Passport validity requirements
Your passport must have an ‘expiry date’ at least 6 months after the date you arrive in DRC.
Check with your travel provider that your passport and other travel documents meet requirements. Renew your passport if you need to.
You will be denied entry if you do not have a valid travel document or try to use a passport that has been reported lost or stolen.
Visa requirements
You must have a visa to visit DRC.
Applying for a visa
Apply for a visa through the DRC Embassy in the UK.
Allow at least 2 to 3 weeks for application processing.
Some types of visa applications are referred to Kinshasa for a decision. In these cases, if you submit a letter of invitation from the person or organisation you’re visiting, stamped by the Ministry of Foreign Affairs in Kinshasa, you may speed up the process.
Consider getting a long-term visa if you are planning to stay in DRC for a considerable period. When you apply for or renew a long-term visa, DRC authorities need a ‘consular certificate’ as part of the application. The British Embassy in DRC can issue a consular certificate for you.  
Checks at border control
If you have a Rwandan or Ugandan immigration stamp in your passport you may have some difficulties on arrival, but it should not prevent you from entering DRC.
If you’re crossing regularly between Rwanda and DRC you may have immigration difficulties if you have not regularised your residency status.
Departure tax
You need to pay a departure tax of 55 US dollars on international flights and 10 US dollars on domestic flights. You pay these fees when you check in for your departure. Get an official receipt and a copy for each fee. Hand the originals on request to immigration and at boarding and keep the copies.
Vaccine requirements
To enter DRC, you must have certificates to prove you’ve had:  
a yellow fever vaccination
a polio vaccine, in some circumstances
For full details about medical entry requirements and recommended vaccinations, see TravelHealthPro’s DRC guide.
You may need a yellow fever certificate for onward travel to some other countries, due to the risk of yellow fever in DRC.
Customs rules
There are strict rules about goods you can take into or out of DRC. You must declare anything that may be prohibited or subject to tax or duty.
You may have difficulties when entering DRC if you are travelling with:
satellite phones
GPS receivers
military clothing
