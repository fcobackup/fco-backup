All passengers permitted entry into Taiwan who have been in the UK in the previous 14 days, will be required to complete their mandatory 14 day quarantine at a designated quarantine centre.
Foreign nationals entering Taiwan must provide a negative COVID-19 test report completed in the three working days prior to boarding their flight.

International airport transits are now permitted. Transiting passengers must arrive in and depart Taiwan within eight hours on flights operated by the same airline.
Travellers from destinations designated as low risk by local authorities may be eligible for a reduced self-isolation period
