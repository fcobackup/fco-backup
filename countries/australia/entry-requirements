The information on this page covers the most common types of travel and reflects the UK government’s understanding of the rules currently in place. Unless otherwise stated, this information is for travellers using a full ‘British Citizen’ passport.
The authorities in the country or territory you’re travelling to are responsible for setting and enforcing the rules for entry. If you’re unclear about any aspect of the entry requirements, or you need further reassurance, you’ll need to contact the embassy, high commission or consulate of the country or territory you’re travelling to.
You should also consider checking with your transport provider or travel company to make sure your passport and other travel documents meet their requirements.
Entry rules in response to coronavirus (COVID-19)
Entry to Australia
You will need to apply for a visa via special exemption to be able to travel to Australia – normal visa applications are no longer accepted. Only Australian citizens and returning permanent residents and their immediate family members are permitted to enter Australia without an exemption until further notice.
Travellers who have a compassionate or compelling reason to enter Australia can apply to the Australian authorities for an exemption. There are a limited number of categories for exemption.
You should provide as much documentary evidence as you can to support your application for an exemption. For further information on the exemption categories and documentation required, see the Department of Home Affairs website.
The Department of Home Affairs is experiencing high levels of demand for exemptions and there is no guarantee of either the timing of a decision or the outcome. You should make your application as early as possible and provide full supporting documentation.
All travellers entering Australia need to undertake a mandatory 14-day quarantine at a designated facility (for example a hotel) at their port of arrival. This is arranged by State governments and is free of charge, except in:
The Northern Territory. See their webpage for further details including fees.
Queensland – See their webpage for further details including fees. If you made your flight booking before midnight on 17 June 2020, you will not have to pay.
You may face a range of penalties for non-compliance with quarantine measures.
Transiting Australia
The Department of Home Affairs website sets out information on transiting Australia, including on transit visas.
Due to COVID-19 related border restrictions, you can only travel to Australia to transit to another country if your connecting flight leaves from the same airport. Depending on your circumstances, you may need to apply for a transit exemption from the Australia Border Force Commissioner before you travel to Australia.
You do not need to apply for an exemption if you can remain in the airport for the duration of your transit. You must remain airside and you will not be able to pass customs (even to collect your baggage). You will need to maintain social distancing, cough etiquette and hand hygiene. At your first point of departure, you will need to have checked your baggage through to your final destination.
You must apply for an exemption if you need to leave the airport before catching your connecting flight. Currently the Australian authorities also recommend you should apply for an exemption if your transit time is over eight hours You should apply for this online via the Department of Home Affairs website in advance of travel to Australia. You will need to provide evidence in your application that you have connecting flights booked.
British nationals are able to transit through Australia for a maximum of 8 hours without a visa. If your transit time is longer than 8 hours you will need a valid visa. See the Department of Home Affairs website for details including how to apply.
If you plan to travel or transit on from Australia, check the latest entry restrictions for your destination and keep in touch with your airline, cruise line or tour operator before you travel.
For further information on transits, quarantine and related issues including up to date State/Territory information, see this Australian Department of Health webpage.
Quarantine requirements
State quarantine requirements remain in place, and airport operating hours vary. This may limit how long you can stay in the airport, and whether you need to apply for a transit exemption and an additional exemption from Australia’s 14-day quarantine arrangements issued by the relevant State health authority. You should check with your airline, as well as on State and Territory websites for the latest details and how to apply.
If you have to leave the airport you will be directed on arrival in Australia to a quarantine facility by Australian authorities. You will be required to remain there until proceeding to the airport for your departing flight. You will not be required to make your own quarantine or transport arrangements: these are handled by local authorities.
Visas during COVID-19
The Australian authorities advise all tourist visitors to return to their home countries as soon as possible. They also advise other temporary visa holders who are unable to support themselves over the next six months to return home.
Latest COVID-19 guidance on visa conditions and details how to apply for a visa is available on the Department of Home Affairs website. The guidance is clear that any visa application will be assessed considering the COVID-19 enhanced border measures and the applicant’s individual circumstances. Applications for new visas should be made before a current visa expires, and if a current visa holder has a “no further stay” condition, a request to waive this condition must be made.
If you are unable to leave Australia and your visa is nearing expiry or has expired already, you should contact the Australian Department of Home Affairs as soon as possible. Australia does not issue visa extensions so you will need to apply for a new one to remain lawful in Australia, and provide relevant supporting documentation. The type of visa you can apply for to remain in Australia usually depends on the type of visa you currently hold. For example, those on Visitor visas would be expected to apply for new Visitor visas.
You can find more detail for temporary visa holders, including visitors, students and working holiday makers on the Department of Home Affairs frequently asked questions webpage.
Leaving Australia if you are an Australian citizen or permanent resident
All Australian citizens and British nationals who are permanent residents in Australia cannot leave Australia without an exemption.
If you are a British/Australian dual national who is ordinarily resident in a country outside Australia, you do not require an exemption to leave Australia. You should be ready to show evidence that you normally reside outside Australia if requested by authorities on departure at the airport.
If you a permanent resident in Australia and have a compelling or compassionate reason to travel overseas, you need to apply for an exemption in advance from the Commissioner of the Australian Border Force. You should apply for an exemption as early as possible - at least 48 hours before your intended departure time. Further details on categories for exemptions, the exemption application form, and the evidence you must provide to support your exemption application, can be found on the Department of Home Affairs website.
Regular entry requirements
Visas
Subject to current restrictions, British citizens can usually get the following types of electronic visitor visa:
eVisitor visa direct from the Department of Immigration & Border Protection. There is no visa application charge or service fee for this
Electronic Travel Authority (ETA) via your travel agent or airline. There is no visa application charge, but a service fee of A$20 applies
Information on all other types of visa is available from the Department of Immigration & Border Protection, or from the Australian High Commission in London.
If you hold an ePassport you can use SmartGate to pass through passport control when arriving in Australia. See the Australian Border Force website for more information.
Working holiday visa
If you’re on a working holiday visa you should be aware of your rights as employees in Australia and how to report any concerns about unfair or unlawful treatment.
Thousands of British working holiday makers travel to Australia each year with the vast majority enjoying their stay without issue. Working conditions, accommodation and medical facilities are generally of a good standard.
In October 2016 the Fair Work Ombudsman published a report following an inquiry into the wages and conditions of people working under the working holiday visa program, which highlighted exploitative workplace cultures where unreasonable and unlawful requirements were being imposed in some isolated and remote workplaces. If you have concerns about your workplace conditions or treatment you can contact the Fair Work Ombudsman on 13 13 94. You can also report concerns to them anonymously.
If you feel you’re being treated unfairly or unlawfully by an employer, you can email the UK’s National Crime Agency (NCA) at the British High Commission in Canberra at: Australia.WHVreferrals@fco.gov.uk. The NCA is working with a number of Australian authorities to help identify and address any illegal employer behaviour affecting British nationals.
For further information and advice, see our working holiday makers booklet.
Passport validity
For entry into Australia, your passport should be valid for the proposed duration of your stay. No additional period of validity beyond this is required.
If you are transiting another country on your way to or from Australia, make sure you check the entry requirements for that country. Many countries will only permit entry if you have at least 6 months validity remaining on your passport.
UK Emergency Travel Documents
UK Emergency Travel Documents are valid for entry into, transit through, and exit from Australia.
Dual nationals
If you’re a British national living in Australia with Australian citizenship, or you’re a dual national, you should leave and enter Australia on your Australian passport, otherwise you may face difficulties and delays. For more information, see the Department of Foreign Affairs & Trade’s website. Please see the Coronavirus page for more information on current restrictions on dual nationals leaving Australia.
