The information on this page covers the most common types of travel and reflects the UK government’s understanding of the rules currently in place. Unless otherwise stated, this information is for travellers using a full ‘British Citizen’ passport.
The authorities in the country or territory you’re travelling to are responsible for setting and enforcing the rules for entry. If you’re unclear about any aspect of the entry requirements, or you need further reassurance, you’ll need to contact the embassy, high commission or consulate of the country or territory you’re travelling to.
You should also consider checking with your transport provider or travel company to make sure your passport and other travel documents meet their requirements.
Entry rules in response to coronavirus (COVID-19)
Entry to Bulgaria
UK and other non-Bulgarian nationals residents arriving from the UK (either by direct or indirect means) are currently not permitted entry to Bulgaria for non-essential purposes due to an ongoing travel ban on arrivals from the UK imposed by an Ordinance from the Bulgarian Ministry of Health and EU-wide COVID-19 restrictions. Some forms of essential travel are still permitted. These include travel by UK and other third-country nationals who are legally resident in Bulgaria and their immediate family members who ordinarily reside with them, and travel by Bulgarian citizens and their non-Bulgarian immediate family members. If you are exempt from the ongoing travel ban, you will be allowed to enter the country, but may need to show proof of residence, with a visa or residence permit or equivalent document and relationship status.
Immediate family members are restricted to the following categories: wife, husband, or a person you live with in a relationship akin to marriage; and dependent children under the age of 18 years of age. You will be expected to show documentation to prove relationship status (e.g. birth/marriage certificate) if you are not in possession of a Bulgarian residence permit.
The temporary ban on entry is in force at all air, road, rail and sea border crossings into Bulgaria on travellers arriving from the UK.
In addition to those exemptions set out above, a small number of other categories of travellers deemed to be travelling for essential purposes are also exempt from the travel ban. These include medical professionals; those travelling for humanitarian purposes; some seasonal workers; and some travellers undertaking trade and investment activities. Staff engaged in international passenger transport and haulage are also exempt from the travel ban. The travel ban on arrivals from the UK is currently anticipated to remain in place until 31 January 2021.
Further information on the full range of exemptions is available on the following Bulgarian Government web site (in Bulgarian). If you fall into one of the exempted categories, you should contact your travel operator in advance of travel for further information on how to demonstrate your exemption from the travel ban.
Many land borders crossings in the region are restricted or closed for passenger traffic. Furthermore, neighbouring countries are implementing additional health requirements for entry to or departure from Bulgaria including declarations and COVID-19 tests. You should check the relevant FCDO Travel Advice.
If you need to travel, plan ahead and before you travel check border information published by the Ministry of Interior (English and Bulgarian) before you travel.
Quarantine requirements
From 00:01 on 1 January 2021, all arrivals to Bulgaria from the UK, with only very limited exceptions, are required to provide evidence of a PCR test with a negative result undertaken up-to 72 hours before arrival or opt to undertake an official 10-day quarantine period upon arrival to Bulgaria. If you choose to undertake a PCR test, you should carry a hard-copy certificate showing your negative PCR test result when you travel. You will be required to show it upon entry to Bulgaria. Check the list of UK private providers of Coronavirus testing and make arrangements for your test in good time. It may not be possible to secure a test at short notice. There is no exemption set out in the Bulgarian Ministry of Health Ordinance for children or infants.
Those who do not provide evidence of a negative PCR-test will be required to quarantine upon arrival in Bulgaria for a ten-day period, overseen by the Regional Health Authority for the region where you will reside. You will be required to provide an address where you will stay for the full ten-day period and should expect checks to be made to ensure that you are complying with the terms of the quarantine in full. Fines and even a prison sentence can be imposed on those found to have broken the quarantine requirement.
A very small number of travellers are exempted from the quarantine requirement, and from the need to provide evidence of a negative PCR test. These include people transiting through Bulgaria and hauliers and transport crew members of vessels or aircraft who do not remain in Bulgaria following their work-related duties.
If you’re travelling to Bulgaria from or via another country, you may still be subject to quarantine measures and/or may need to provide evidence of a negative PCR test undertaken no-longer than 72 hours before arrival. Check the latest information on the Ministry of Interior website (English and Bulgarian).

to stay for longer, to work or study, for business travel or for other reasons, you will need to meet the entry requirements set out by Bulgaria. This could mean applying for a visa and/or work permit. You should check with the Bulgarian Embassy what type of visa and/or work permit, if any, you will need
if you are in Bulgaria with a visa or permit, your stay will not count towards the 90-day limit
The 90-day limit for visa-free travel will begin on 1 January 2021. Any days you stay in Bulgaria before 1 January 2021 will not count towards the 90-day limit.

Passport validity
The rules on travel will stay the same until 31 December 2020.
Your passport should be valid for the proposed duration of your stay; you do not need any additional period of validity on your passport beyond this.
Passport validity from 1 January 2021
From 1 January 2021, you must have at least 6 months left on an adult or child passport to travel to most countries in Europe (not including Ireland).
If you renewed your current passport before the previous one expired, extra months may have been added to its expiry date. Any extra months on your passport over 10 years may not count towards the 6 months needed.
Check your passport is valid for travel before you book your trip. You will need to renew your passport before travelling if you do not have enough time left on your passport.
