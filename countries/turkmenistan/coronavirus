The Turkmenistan authorities have introduced a number of precautionary measures in response to the coronavirus (COVID-19) pandemic.
Coronavirus (COVID-19)
The Turkmenistan authorities have introduced new measures in relation to coronavirus. See Coronavirus.
There have been no confirmed cases of COVID-19 in Turkmenistan.
In response to the COVID-19 pandemic, all individuals regardless of their citizenship, are required to present a medical certificate confirming a negative molecular biological test result upon entry to Turkmenistan. The certificate must be issued by a licensed medical practitioner in Russian or English. Those who cannot provide the required medical certificate will be denied entry to Turkmenistan.
All international flights will now arrive at Turkmenabat airport rather than Ashgabat airport. You should check with your airline, travel company or in-country sponsor for details of how this will affect your visit. All travellers arriving at Turkmenabat airport and border crossing points will undergo primary medical examination on arrival, including an oral swab to test the respiratory system. Any passenger testing positive will be taken to an infectious disease clinic for a period of quarantine of at least 14 days. Travellers are likely to be required to pay for medical tests and any required stay in quarantine. These charges will be in USD and can only be paid in cash, which may be at least USD 300 and possibly much more. You should have clean/unmarked banknotes with you.
Further advice on coronavirus is available from Public Health England and on the TravelHealthPro website.
