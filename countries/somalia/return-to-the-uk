Coronavirus guidance is being updated.
Read what you can and cannot do

There are currently no commercial options available to return to the UK from Somalia (excluding Somaliland – see below). The Somali authorities have banned all passenger flights until further notice.
This travel advice will be updated when departure options become available.
Flights from Somaliland
There are still commercial options to return to the UK from Somaliland. If you live in the UK and are currently visiting Somaliland, you are strongly advised to return now by commercial means. Don’t risk getting stranded.
Ethiopian Airlines continue to schedule one flight per week between Hargeisa and Addis Ababa for those wishing to leave Somaliland. Onward flights to the UK and European destinations are available from Addis Ababa. You should contact Ethiopian Airlines or your travel company for the latest availability and booking information.
If you are trying to get back to the UK and need financial help, see the FCO’s guide on financial assistance.
You will need to pay for your return travel to the UK. If departure options are available but you cannot afford the travel costs and have exhausted all other options for getting funds, you may be eligible to apply for an emergency loan from the government. This is a last resort option and you would need to repay the loan when you are back in the UK. For more information, you should contact Corporate Travel Management (CTM). CTM are a commercial partner of the FCO and are authorised to administer such loans on behalf of the FCO.
