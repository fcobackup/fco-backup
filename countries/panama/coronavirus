The Panama authorities are introducing a number of measures to limit the spread of the virus. You should monitor the press and official announcements of the Panamanian government to ensure you are up-to-date with any changes to these restrictions.
Travel restrictions and borders
Borders are closed to all but citizens and residents with a mandatory two week self-isolation on arrival. There will be no commercial international flights to or from Panama until 22 May 2020 at the earliest. Domestic flights are also suspended.

On 30 April, it was announced that all foreign nationals whose permission to remain in Panama expired after 13 March 2020 would have this extended to 15 May 2020.
On 19 March 2020, the Panamanian Government began establishing sanitary cordons in different provinces of the country, including Panama City, with checkpoints in various locations. The Panamanian Government may change suddenly the provinces with sanitary cordons, and may introduce other restrictions on movement. These are posted on the Panamanian Ministry of Health Twitter feed.
You should avoid any unnecessary travel to and from any of the areas included in sanitary cordons. If you urgently need to travel, you will need to show ID and proof of your reason for needing to cross the checkpoint in order to pass, such as evidence of your flight out of Panama.
Local authorities may also impose similar restrictions on movement.
Local measures
Panama is currently under a state of emergency, and quarantine measures are in place.
From 1 April 2020, unless you fall under one of the quarantine exemptions, only women are permitted to leave their homes/accommodation on Mondays, Wednesdays and Fridays and only men are permitted to leave their homes/accommodation on Tuesdays, Thursdays and Saturdays. No one should leave their homes/accommodation on Sundays (although please note that since Easter weekend, Panama has had a total curfew on weekends, including on Saturday). On those days, you are allowed to leave your homes/accommodation to shop for food and medication during one hour (with a half hour grace period either side) according to the last digit of your passport. You should not leave your accommodation outside of these times unless it is an emergency or you fall under one of the limited exemptions. Details of the times you can leave your accommodation can be found on the British Embassy Twitter account.
In Panama City, the wearing of masks outside one’s accommodation is compulsory. Elsewhere, members of the public have been urged to wear masks when leaving their accommodation. Some pharmacy and supermarket chains require customers to wear masks.
Transport
Ubers are no longer in circulation for passenger travel. Yellow taxis have a reduced presence, and do not operate on Sundays.
The police and security forces are empowered to enforce restrictions on movements and events due to the current state of emergency. You should follow their instructions.
Business
Commercial businesses have been ordered to close, except for supermarkets, pharmacies, health clinics, fuel stations and other key businesses. Supermarkets can have no more than 50 people inside.
Medical Care
On 15 March, Panamanian authorities announced new restrictions on access to medical services for routine care, as well as widespread closures of commercial and leisure establishments. Further restrictions were announced on 20 March. On 25 March the distribution, sale and consumption of alcoholic drinks has been banned for the duration of the national state of emergency.
The authorities have set up a hotline (169) to answer any questions or receive information regarding a suspected case of coronavirus. If you are concerned that you may be unwell as a result of the coronavirus, you should call the national hotline on 169, or use the Panamanian Government’s “R.O.S.A” (virtual clinic) using this link to send a WhatsApp message, and follow their advice.
British nationals who are in Panama will be able to access the Panamanian public healthcare system on the same terms as Panamanians. Coronavirus tests in the public system for those who meet the clinical requirement to be tested will be free of charge.
Due to government measures imposed to contain the spread of the novel coronavirus, routine healthcare – including elective surgeries and consultations with doctors – in both hospitals and other clinics has been restricted to people with chronic illness, children and those who are pregnant.
