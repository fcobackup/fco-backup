There are currently no commercial options available to return to the UK from Oman. Oman suspended all international flights on Sunday 29 March and land borders are closed.
We know this is concerning for British people trying to leave Oman. The UK government is working closely with the airlines, the Omani authorities and British companies exploring private repatriation for their staff, to make sure options are available for you to return to the UK as soon as possible.
What to do
If you cannot leave Oman at this time, you should:
follow the advice of the local authorities, including local measures to help minimise your risk of exposure to coronavirus
find accommodation that’s suitable for your needs
keep in regular contact with family and friends at home, so they know you are safe and well
