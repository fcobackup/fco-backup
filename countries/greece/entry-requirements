Coronavirus guidance is being updated.
Read the Prime Minister’s statement for the latest information.

The information on this page covers the most common types of travel and reflects the UK government’s understanding of the rules currently in place. Unless otherwise stated, this information is for travellers using a full ‘British Citizen’ passport.
The authorities in the country or territory you’re travelling to are responsible for setting and enforcing the rules for entry. If you’re unclear about any aspect of the entry requirements, or you need further reassurance, you’ll need to contact the embassy, high commission or consulate of the country or territory you’re travelling to.
You should also consider checking with your transport provider or travel company to make sure your passport and other travel documents meet their requirements.
Restrictions in response to coronavirus
The Greek authorities have introduced testing and self-isolation/quarantine requirements for new arrivals into Greece. These may vary according to where your flight originated.
Mandatory testing and self-isolation/quarantine are in place for anyone arriving into Greece from an airport listed by the European Aviation Safety Agency (EASA). The nationality of the person arriving in Greece is not relevant: instead, the EASA’s list refers to airports in regions deemed as meriting additional public health measures. You can read EASA’s list of airports here. The list will be updated on a regular basis.
If you arrive into Greece on a flight from an airport which is not listed by the EASA, you may not be tested or required to self-isolate. However, the Greek authorities have indicated their intention to carry out sample testing on some arrivals, who are also likely to be required to self-isolate. If you are asked to take part in sample testing and to self-isolate, you should conform with the Greek authorities’ requirements. Failure to do so may result in you being refused entry into Greece.
You should also be aware that if other passengers on your flight subsequently test positive, you may be subject to further quarantine/ self isolation requirements. These will be mandatory and you should comply with the Greek Authorities’ requirements.
British nationals are not affected by the European Union’s measures to close EU borders to non-EU country nationals. If you’re a British national, you can still enter Greece, but you must comply with the Greek authorities’ requirements, including on testing and self-isolation.
Regular entry requirements
Passport validity

Visas
If you hold a British Citizen passport, you don’t need a visa to enter Greece. If you’re planning a stay of longer than 3 months, see our Living in Greece guide and contact the Greek Embassy if you have further questions.
The rules on travel will stay the same until 31 December 2020.
Travelling with medication
According to Greek law, a visitor can bring up to 5 different prescribed medicines for personal use, with a maximum of 2 boxes of each medicine.
Some prescribed and over-the-counter medicines available in the UK, including medication containing codeine, are considered controlled substances in Greece. A doctor’s prescription is required in all cases, which should mention your details, the types of medicine and the condition treated. On arrival, Greek Customs may in some cases require you to obtain permission from the Greek National Organisation of Medicines - if you need to carry more than the permitted number of boxes, for example. The National Organisation of Medicines examines these requests on a case by case basis.
For more information on controlled medicines, contact the Greek National Organisation of Medicines (telephone: 0030 213 2040 285 / 307 / 225, open Monday to Friday, 12pm to 3pm Greece time, or email: relation@eof.gr).
UK Emergency Travel Documents
UK Emergency Travel Documents are valid for entry, airside transit and exit from Greece.
