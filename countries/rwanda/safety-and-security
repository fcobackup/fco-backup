This guide also has safety advice for regions of Rwanda.
Terrorism
There is a high threat of terrorist attack globally affecting UK interests and British nationals, including from groups and individuals who view the UK and British nationals as targets. Stay aware of your surroundings at all times.    
UK Counter Terrorism Policing has information and advice on staying safe abroad and what to do in the event of a terrorist attack. Find out how to reduce your risk from terrorism while abroad.
Terrorism in Rwanda
Terrorist attacks in Rwanda cannot be ruled out.
Attacks could be indiscriminate including in places visited by foreigners. Stay aware of your surroundings, keep up to date with local media reports and follow the advice of local authorities.
Crime
Protecting yourself and your belongings
Crime levels are relatively low in Rwanda, but there are cases of burglary, theft, bag-snatching and mugging (violent theft) in Kigali.
To reduce your personal risk:
take care when walking at night
arrange transport in advance
lock car doors when driving
do not leave valuables in parked cars
avoid carrying large amounts of money or other valuables
Personal safety in military zones
Some off-limits military zones in Kigali may not be well lit or signposted. You could be arrested and detained if you enter these areas. Take extra care when walking around less populated zones, particularly at night.    
Laws and cultural differences
Using cameras in secure areas
It is illegal to photograph some government buildings. If you use a drone to take photographs of a prohibited area without a permit, you risk being imprisoned or receiving a severe fine.
LGBT+ travellers
Consensual same-sex sexual acts are not illegal in Rwanda, but can be frowned upon by locals.
Rwanda’s laws do not discriminate against sexual orientation, and its constitution prohibits all forms of discrimination. Read more advice for LGBT+ travellers.
Plastic bag ban
There is a ban on plastic bags in Rwanda for environmental reasons. If you have plastic bags when you arrive in the country, they will be confiscated.  
Genocide Memorial Day
The week following Genocide Memorial Day on 7 April is an official week of mourning. 2024 will mark the 30th anniversary of the genocide against the Tutsi.
National day of community service (Umuganda)
The last Saturday of each month is Umuganda, a national day of community service. Most normal services close from 7am to 11am. Kigali also has a car-free morning from 7am to 10am on the first and third Sunday of the month to promote exercise and reduce car emissions. Other cities in the country may also hold car-free mornings. You should check with the local authorities as these might happen at different times. 
Outdoor activities and adventure tourism
Gorilla trekking
If you plan to travel close to the Democratic Republic of the Congo border on a gorilla trek, be aware of the risks that short-notice border closures could have on any travel plans in the region and be cautious. Keep up to date with developments through your tour operator and check the local media.
Transport risks
Road travel
If you are planning to drive in Rwanda, see information on driving abroad.
You’ll need to have both the 1949 version of the international driving permit (IDP) and your UK driving licence with you in the car. You cannot buy an IDP outside the UK, so get one before you travel.
After one year of driving, you must have a Rwandan licence. You should:
write a letter of application to the Commissioner Traffic and Road Safety
attach your existing licence
attach a copy of your visa or foreign resident ID card
pay a fee
Driving standards
Roads from Kigali to all major towns are in good condition but can be damaged by landslides during the rainy season. After dark, many roads outside of larger urban centres are unlit and driving standards are poor.   
Shared taxis (mini vans) and motorbike taxis are the most common form of public transport, but are very vulnerable to accidents.
Building health and safety
Levels of building health and safety in Rwanda are lower than in the UK. Buildings and construction sites have collapsed, causing deaths and serious injuries.
Fire safety standards vary and fires in residential and public places are a continuing risk. Poor wiring and sub-standard electrical cables have caused building fires. Take extra care when using electronic equipment.
Extreme weather and natural disasters
Find out what you can do to prepare for and respond to extreme weather and natural hazards.
Flooding
The rainy season runs from February to May and from September to December. April is the height of the rainy season. Heavy storms can cause disruption and damage, including landslides and floods. Monitor local media reports and follow the advice of local authorities.
Earthquakes
There is a risk of earthquakes in Rwanda. The US Federal Emergency Management Agency has advice about what to do before, during and after an earthquake. The US Geological Survey has a real-time earthquake map that captures information following significant seismic activity. If there is an earthquake, monitor local media reports and follow the advice of the authorities.
