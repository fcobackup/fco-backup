Travel to Iran is subject to entry restrictions
Entry to Iran is permitted for Iranian nationals, residents and holders of some types of visas only. The authorities are not permitting anyone to enter Iran from the UK, via direct or indirect flights until 19 January. This date is subject to change, possibly at very short notice
All passengers arriving into Iran by air must hold a valid health certificate issued by the health authorities of the country of departure. This must contain a COVID-19 molecular test performed by an approved centre of the departure country, carried out within 96 hours of entry into Iran. Non-Iranian nationals will not be permitted entry without such a certificate
You will need to provide contact details on arrival in Iran

Military action in 2020 in Nagorno-Karabakh and the surrounding areas and on the inter-state border between Azerbaijan and Armenia, hit civilian areas resulting in deaths and casualties. A ceasefire agreement between Armenia and Azerbaijan was signed on 10 November 2020. However, tensions remain. In the event of any significant regional tensions, you should remain vigilant and keep up to date with the latest developments, including via the media and this travel advice. See Border areas
If you decide your presence in Iran is essential, you should maintain a low profile and keep up to date with developments, including via this travel advice. Avoid any rallies, marches and processions, keep away from military sites and follow the instructions of the local authorities at all times.
There is a risk that British nationals, and a significantly higher risk that British-Iranian dual nationals, could be arbitrarily detained or arrested in Iran. The criminal justice process followed in such cases falls below international standards. Iran does not recognise dual nationality. If you are a dual British-Iranian national and are detained in Iran, the FCDO’s ability to provide consular support is extremely limited. See Safety and security
Terrorists are very likely to try to carry out attacks in Iran. Attacks could happen anywhere, including in places visited by foreigners. On 22 September 2018, there was an attack on a military parade in Ahvaz, capital of Khuzestan province. On 7 June 2017, there were two attacks in Tehran – one in the Majles (the Iranian parliament) in central Tehran and another at the Imam Khomeini Shrine near Imam Khomeini international airport.
