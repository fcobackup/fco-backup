Algeria and Senegal are in the final of the African Cup of Nations football tournament in Cairo on the evening of Friday 19 July. Following earlier matches in the competition, football supporters were involved in scenes of violent disorder in several cities across France and notably around the Champs Elysées in central Paris. In advance of tonight’s final, large numbers of French police and gendarmerie officers are likely to be deployed at potential flashpoints. You should remain vigilant, follow the instructions given by the local authorities and move away quickly if there are signs of disorder.
Some protests linked to the yellow vest (gilets jaunes) movement continue across France, generally taking place on Saturdays. While now smaller in scale, previous demonstrations have led to violence. If demonstrations do turn violent, a heavy police/gendarmerie presence is to be expected. Motorists travelling through France may continue to experience some delays or blockages caused by local demonstrators - you should drive with caution as protestors may be present on roads, motorways and toll booths. In all cases, you should avoid demonstrations wherever possible and follow the advice of the local authorities.

There remain some migrants around Calais, who may seek to enter the UK illegally. There have been instances of migrants seeking to slow down traffic on approach roads to ports, including by placing obstacles on the Calais Port approach road. If this happens you should keep moving where it’s safe to do so, or stop and call 112 if isn’t safe to proceed (keeping car doors locked).
Terrorists are very likely to try to carry out attacks in France. Due to ongoing threats to France by Islamist terrorist groups, and recent French military intervention against Daesh (formerly referred to as ISIL), the French government has warned the public to be especially vigilant and has reinforced its security measures. Check the French government’s advice about what to do if a terrorist attack occurs. See Terrorism
All vehicles, including motorbikes, driving in central Paris, Lyon and Grenoble now need to display a special ‘pollution sticker’. You must display a sticker to drive in central Paris from 8am to 8pm on Monday to Friday. The requirement to display a sticker can be implemented at any time, depending on pollution levels. Some older vehicles don’t qualify for a sticker at all due to their high emissions; these vehicles can’t be driven in central Paris at all from 8am to 8pm on Monday to Friday. In order to manage air pollution levels, cities may also limit vehicle access to town centres and main roads, including the Paris region. For more information, and to apply for a sticker, visit the French Ministry of Environment website (in English).
