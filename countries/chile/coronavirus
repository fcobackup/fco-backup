International travel
Since 23 November, the air border at Santiago Airport has re-opened, allowing the entry of non-resident foreigners, who comply with strict sanitary measures. Please see Entry requirements
Since 10 December, the whole Metropolitan Region - including Santiago - is in Stage 2 (Transition). This restricts travel to other regions. Additionally, quarantine – meaning you cannot leave your residence without permission to do so - is currently mandatory over the weekends (from Friday night at midnight until Monday morning at 5am). See Travel in Chile section
The UK government is working closely with airlines, the Chilean authorities and other governments to make sure options remain available for you to return to the UK. There are currently listed commercial options to return to the UK from Chile on the BA direct flight to London Heathrow or via the US, Brazil, Spain, France and Holland. All flights could be subject to last minute change or cancellation. You should contact the airline prior to booking.
Airlines may require all passengers to have filled-in a “Pasaporte Sanitario” to be allowed to board their flights. This government form, requests information on recent countries visited and coronavirus-related health. Once filled-in and submitted, you will receive a PDF of the completed form that you can store on your phone or print.
If you plan to fly back to the UK make sure you have not overstayed on your Chilean visa – this could affect your departure. If you have any concerns about visa renewal, visit the Chilean Immigration Office website for further information.

Travel in Chile
If you are travelling to the airport to catch a flight from one of the areas under quarantine or curfew, presenting your passport and boarding pass will permit you to cross any checkpoints. Use a recognised taxi service or airport transfer whose driver should have the requisite permissions.
Chilean authorities require the use of masks in all public spaces/public transport, including the airport.
Quarantine orders and sanitary cordons are in place in Santiago and in other parts of the country. A nationwide curfew (now running between midnight and 5am) has been in place since 22 March.
If you are planning to continue your trip from Santiago Airport to other regions, be aware that since 10 December a restriction for travelling from Santiago to other regions is in place and you will not be allowed to continue your journey outside of Santiago
Be aware that if you wish to travel to Magallanes Region, you will need to provide proof of a negative PCR-test result given within 72 hours prior to travel.
Chile is deploying a flexible approach to bringing municipal areas (called comunas) in and out of quarantine/sanitary cordons. New measures can be announced by the government at any time and come into force shortly after, although changes are typically announced every Wednesday and are applied from Fridays onwards.
On 28 July, as part of the Chilean government’s step-by-step, five stage plan for the parts of Chile under quarantine orders to emerge in a phased manner from lockdown, comunas across Chile began to move from quarantine (Stage 1) into later stages. The rules on mobility in each stage are as follows:
Stage 1: Quarantine. Restricted mobility; permits required for essential activity; evening curfew, social distancing and cordon sanitaire in place; obligatory quarantine for those over 75; prohibition of movement to secondary home. This remains the status for much of the country.
Stage 2: Transition. Quarantine remains in place at weekends and bank holidays; social gatherings of no more than 10 people allowed inside; evening curfew, social distancing and cordon sanitaire in place; obligatory quarantine for those over 75; and a prohibition on movement to other regions.
Stage 3: Preparation. Under this stage there will be no more mobility restrictions within the comuna; social gatherings capped at 50 people; evening curfew, social distancing and cordon sanitaire in place; obligatory quarantine for those over 75; and a prohibition on movement to a secondary home.
Stage 4: Initial opening. Significant step that aims to re-open certain low risk activities and to avoid crowds and physical contact. Establishment of a new way of living: COVID MODE. Social gatherings with no more than 50 people permitted; cinemas, theatres, restaurants and cafes allowed to function at 25% capacity; restaurants and cafés allowed to open to the public at 25% capacity; gradual return to physical classes in education establishments (Education Ministry plans and health situation permitting). Evening curfew and cordon sanitaire dependent on local authority decision; social distancing still required; pubs and clubs remain closed; over 75’s allowed to leave their homes for 60 minutes per day; prohibition of movement to secondary home. Re-opening of borders.
Stage 5: Advanced opening. This step relies on the population becoming accustomed to activities in COVID MODE. Social gatherings with no more than 150 people permitted; cinemas, theatres, restaurants and cafes allowed to function at 75% capacity; gyms, pubs and clubs can function at 50% capacity; gradual return to physical classes in education establishments. Social distancing of 1 metre; free movement for those over 75 and movement to secondary homes allowed.
The Government’s “Chile Atiende” website outlines which phase-out stage each comuna of Chile is in under the first heading (“En qué lugares de Chile hay cuarantena?”).
In areas in quarantine you are only allowed to leave your residence under certain circumstances, including for medical reasons, basic services, and public services. If you need to leave your residence for food supplies or medical reasons, you must get a permit from the Comisaria Virtual. Foreigners may use their passport number to access the system. The pages are only in Spanish.
Individuals that wish to pass the sanitary cordons must obtain a “Salvoconducto” permit and a “Health Passport” (“pasaporte sanitario”) (under “viajeros regionales” for residents or “viajeros regionales” for foreign visitors), at least 24 hours before.
Information on the areas of Chile that have sanitary cordons is available on the Government’s “Chile Atiende” website under the seventh heading (“Dónde hay aduanas sanitarias y cordones sanitarios?”).
Checkpoints for health inspections are in force at various points around Santiago and elsewhere. In addition to checking the health of persons passing through, these checkpoints will be used to confirm that specific individuals who have been ordered to quarantine by medical authorities are not violating their quarantine. You will need to get a “Health Passport” prior to travel and present it at any checkpoint.
Public places and services
Chilean authorities require the use of masks in all public spaces, irrespective of what stage of the quarantine phase-out a comuna is in.
