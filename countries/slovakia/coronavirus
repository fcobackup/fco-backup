Public spaces and services
The Slovak Government has imposed restrictions on public life to counter the spread of COVID-19 and is implementing a programme of nationwide testing linked to self-isolation rules and restrictions on travel within Slovakia.
From Saturday 24 October to Sunday 1 November, a general ban remains in force on people’s movement outside their home or accommodation. There are a number of exemptions, including:
Travelling between the hours of 1 am and 5 am
Travelling to work
Travelling to take a coronavirus test
Buying food and toiletries at your nearest shop
Visiting a doctor or a pharmacy
Accompanying children to school
Going to the post office, bank, or taking your car for a service
For a wedding or christening ceremony, or the funeral of a close friend or relative
Travel to care for relatives or close friends that are vulnerable or unwell
Going for a recreational walk in the countryside (away from built up areas), but only within your residential district.
Dog walking is limited to within 100 metres of your home.
From 2 November, the above exceptions for work, school, essential services and country walks will only apply if you have a negative test result.
Over the weekend of 31 October to 1 November, the authorities are asking everyone aged 10 to 65, including foreign residents and visitors, to take part in nationwide coronavirus testing. Those aged over 65 who rarely leave the house need not take part. Taking the test is voluntary, but those choosing not to take part will be subject to stricter lockdown rules for at least the following week and should self-isolate. A repeat round of testing during the weekend of 7-8 November is yet to be confirmed.
Lists of testing sites have been published on local authorities’ websites and on social media. Testing is free of charge, and you will need to take your ID card or passport. More information including a video showing the testing procedure is on the “I am responsible” website (in Slovak only).
From 2 November, only those with a negative test certificate from the nationwide testing programme will be allowed to move freely, including going to work and shopping for non-essentials. Police may ask to see your test certificate, and you should carry this paper document with you. There are some limited exceptions for young children and those with certain medical conditions, see text of regulation in Slovak.
In addition to the above, previous restrictions on activities and social distancing rules remain in force:
Facemasks must be worn outdoors in all built-up areas, such as towns and villages. The wearing of facemasks remains compulsory indoors, including on public transport and in shops. Masks are not required in the countryside if you are with others from the same household or can maintain a five-metre distance.
Local public transport is running, but face masks are compulsory .
Hotels and guest houses are permitted to remain open, but may close or have reduced or cancelled services in order to comply with nationwide travel restrictions, social distancing and hygiene requirements.
Restaurants, bars and cafés may only operate a takeaway service.
Fitness centres, wellness centres, swimming pools, water parks, saunas, cinemas and theatres are closed.
The number of people in shops is restricted and temperature checks will be carried out at the entrances. You must maintain a two metre distance when queuing.
Supermarkets and chemists have reserved shopping hours between 9am and 11am for those over 65.
