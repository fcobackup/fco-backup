This page has information on travelling to British Virgin Islands. Check what you must do to return to the UK.
This page reflects the UK government’s understanding of current rules for people travelling on a full ‘British Citizen’ passport from the UK, for the most common types of travel.
The authorities in British Virgin Islands set and enforce entry rules.
All travellers
You will need a valid passport, with validity covering the proposed duration of your stay to enter or travel through the British Virgin Islands as a visitor. See below for further information on travel documentation.
Entry to the BVI by air is only permitted through the Terrance B. Lettsome International Airport. You can enter by sea through the Road Town Jetty; Soper’s Hole Dock, West End; Great Harbour, Jost Van Dyke; or Spanish Town, Virgin Gorda.
Everyone (including children) entering the BVI will be subject to temperature checks on arrival. Travellers displaying signs of illness may also be tested at their point of entry. Everyone aged 5 and over, regardless of COVID-19 vaccination status, must present a negative rapid antigen test or RT-PCR test taken within 48 hours prior to arrival. The type of test taken should be guided by the entry requirements of any country transited en route to the BVI. If you’re unable to present a negative test result or a recovery certificate (see If you’ve had COVID-19 in the past year) you must take a rapid antigen test upon arrival at a cost of $50.
There are no quarantine requirements on arrival providing you have a negative RT-PCR or rapid antigen test. Any traveller who tests positive for COVID-19 on arrival will be required to self-isolate for 7 days. You’ll be able to end your quarantine on day 7 if you receive a negative rapid antigen test, or on day 10 if symptom-free for at least 24 hours. Please note that your arrival day is day 0.
Anyone who has been in close contact with a COVID-19 positive person should wear a well-fitted mask for 14 days when around others and take a rapid antigen or RT-PCR test between day 5 and 7 after exposure, or earlier if you develop symptoms.
There is a US$50 tax for all passengers, payable on leaving the BVI by air ($15 departure tax, $5 security charge departure tax and a $30 airport development fee). This is generally included in the ticket price. If you’re departing the BVI by ferry, a departure tax of US$20 per person or US$15 for residents is payable. Visitors arriving by air or sea are also charged an Environmental and Tourism levy of US$10 on arrival.
If you’re fully vaccinated
Entry requirements for the BVI are the same for all travellers, regardless of COVID-19 vaccination status.
Proof of vaccination status
You don’t need to provide proof of your vaccination status for entry to the BVI.
If you’re not fully vaccinated
Entry requirements for the BVI are the same for all travellers, regardless of COVID-19 vaccination status.
If you’ve had COVID-19 in the past year
If you have recovered from COVID-19 within 90 days prior to arrival, you can present a document issued by a licensed medical professional certifying COVID-19 recovery instead of a negative rapid antigen or RT-PCR test.
Children and young people
Children aged 5 to 17 should follow the same testing requirements as adults entering the BVI (see All travellers). There are no testing requirements for Children aged 4 and under.
If you’re transiting through the British Virgin Islands
Transiting is when you pass through one country on the way to your final destination.
If you’re transiting through the British Virgin Islands on your way to another country and staying in the airport (airside), you need to show proof of a negative RT-PCR or rapid antigen test taken within 48 hours prior to arrival.
If you are transiting through the British Virgin Islands on your way to another country and will be passing through immigration (sometimes known as a layover), for example to stay in a hotel for a flight the next day, you will be subject to the entry protocols set out above.
Further information about transiting through the British Virgin Islands can be found on the Government of the Virgin Islands website.
Day Trippers
Day trippers (those who have been away from the BVI for less than 24 hours or remaining in the BVI for less than 24 hours) don’t need to present a COVID-19 test result upon arrival.
Day trippers are permitted to move freely throughout the BVI subject to adhering to the relevant COVID-19 protocols (see Public spaces and services). You should check the COVID-19 entry requirements of the location you are travelling to/from.
Check your passport and travel documents before you travel
If you’re visiting the British Virgin Islands, your passport should be valid for the proposed period of your stay.
If you are a resident in the British Virgin Islands, your passport must be valid for at least 3 months from the date you arrive.
Check with your travel provider to make sure your passport and other travel documents meet their requirements.
Visas
British nationals don’t need a visa to visit the BVI. It’s normal practice for BVI immigration authorities to issue you with a one-month entry stamp on arrival. You may also be granted an extension for one further month. Extensions for up to 6 months are granted on the discretion of the Chief Immigration Officer, providing the individual can show proof of independent financial means. You may need to show evidence of accommodation and your plans to leave the BVI at the end of your stay.
Work Permits
Travellers who hold an expired work permit and are re-entering the BVI must submit a written request to the Immigration Department at least 5 working days prior to travel. This also applies to holders of valid work permit exemptions.

UK Emergency Travel Documents
UK Emergency Travel Documents (ETDs) are accepted for entry, transit and exit from the BVI. If you’re travelling via the USA on an ETD, you will need to get a valid US visa.
As the BVI is a British Overseas Territory, there is no formal British diplomatic or consular representation. UK ETDs are processed by the British High Commission in Barbados.
