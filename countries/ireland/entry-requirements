This advice reflects the UK government’s understanding of current rules for people travelling on a full ‘British citizen’ passport from the UK, for the most common types of travel.
The authorities in Ireland set and enforce entry rules. If you’re not sure how these requirements apply to you, contact Ireland’s embassy in the UK.
COVID-19 rules
Countries may restrict travel or bring in rules at short notice. Check with your travel provider for changes.
If you test positive for COVID-19, you may need to stay where you are until you test negative. You may also need to seek treatment there.
You should also read TravelHealthPro’s general COVID-19 advice for travellers.
Entry to Ireland
There are no COVID-19 testing or vaccination requirements for passengers entering Ireland.
Check the latest requirements from the Irish Department of Foreign Affairs.
ID requirements
If you are a British citizen, you do not need a passport to enter Ireland. However, some carriers and airlines might require identification. Irish immigration officers check the ID of all passengers arriving by air from the UK and might ask for proof of British nationality, particularly if you were born outside the UK. You should take your British passport with you. Check the Ireland Citizens Information Board for guidance on acceptable ID.
You do not need ID to cross the border between Northern Ireland and Ireland.
Visa requirements
British citizens do not need a visa to visit Ireland. Ireland, along with the UK, is a member of the Common Travel Area (CTA). UK nationals do not need a visa or residency permit to live, work or study in Ireland.
Vaccination requirements (other than COVID-19)
At least 8 weeks before your trip, check the vaccinations and certificates you need in TravelHealthPro’s Ireland guide.
Customs rules
There are strict rules about goods that can be brought into and taken out of Ireland. Find out about customs rules from the Irish Revenue. You must declare anything that may be prohibited or subject to tax or duty.
Travelling with pets

Taking money into Ireland
If you are travelling with or sending 10,000 euros or more, check Irish Revenue guidance on travelling with cash.
