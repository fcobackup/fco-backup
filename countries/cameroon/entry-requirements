Visas
The Cameroonian High Commission in London has reopened for business.
There is currently no visa-on-arrival service at either Yaoundé or Douala International Airport.
The Government of Cameroon has confirmed it will not penalise British nationals whose visas have expired while they are unable to leave the country due to coronavirus restrictions. Immigration Police will not pursue you if this is your situation, you will be allowed to leave the country freely when able to, and this will not affect your chances of being granted a visa in the future.
If you have a query about your immigration status while in Cameroon, contact the General Delegation for National Security in Yaoundé (telephone: +237 22221 2884).
Dual nationality
Cameroon doesn’t recognise dual nationality in adults. If you have acquired British citizenship but previously held Cameroon citizenship, or as an adult still hold a Cameroon passport, you should not attempt to enter Cameroon on your Cameroonian passport because this is against the law.
Passport validity
Your passport should be valid for a minimum period of six months from the date of your visa application.
UK Emergency Travel Documents
UK Emergency Travel Documents are accepted for entry into Cameroon, provided they include the necessary visa.
Yellow fever certificate requirements
Check whether you need a yellow fever certificate by visiting the National Travel Health Network and Centre’s TravelHealthPro website.
