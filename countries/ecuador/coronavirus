Be prepared for your plans to change
No travel is risk-free during COVID-19. Countries may further restrict travel or bring in new rules at short notice, for example due to a new COVID-19 variant. Check with your travel company or airline for any transport changes which may delay your journey home.
If you test positive for COVID-19, you may need to stay where you are until you test negative. You may also need to seek treatment there.
Plan ahead and make sure you:
can access money
understand what your insurance will cover
can make arrangements to extend your stay and be away for longer than planned

Whilst masks are no longer mandatory in either indoor or outdoor public spaces, you may be required to wear them by private establishments. Carry a mask and your proof of vaccination with you.
You may be required to present your COVID-19 vaccination certificate (showing 2 complete doses) to enter establishments, transport or airports. This will not apply to public sector institutions and for essential services such as health and education. COVID-19 vaccination certificates are also mandatory for all passengers over 5 years old for all inter-district, interstate, urban and tourist buses.

Healthcare in Ecuador
If you present COVID symptoms while in Ecuador, you should call 171 (Spanish only) and you will be assisted by trained Ministry of Public Health (MSP) personnel. You can also call 911, which has some English-speaking operators.
Private COVID-19 tests are carried out in laboratories approved by the Ministry of Health.
Most private labs offer testing at home or at hotels; the tests are easy to arrange at an extra fee. Quito and Guayaquil international airports also have private labs in place for COVID-19 tests.
The Ecuadorean government recommends the “SaludEC” app, a new platform to support the COVID-19 response. It can provide general reports, official announcements and information to evaluate potential COVID-19 symptoms. It also allows online medical checks and scheduling appointments at Ministry of Public Health centres for non-coronavirus needs.
