Terrorism
There is a high threat of terrorist attack globally affecting UK interests and British nationals, including from groups and individuals who view the UK and British nationals as targets. Stay aware of your surroundings at all times.
UK Counter Terrorism Policing has information and advice on staying safe abroad and what to do in the event of a terrorist attack. Find out how to reduce your risk from terrorism while abroad.
Terrorism in Spain
Terrorists are likely to try and carry out attacks in Spain.
Attacks could be indiscriminate, including in places visited by foreign nationals. Stay aware of your surroundings, keep up to date with local media reports and follow the advice of local authorities.
In January 2023, one person was killed and others injured in a machete attack at 2 churches in Cadiz
Political situation
Demonstrations, political gatherings or marches can take place with little or no warning, particularly in cities. Follow the advice of police and local authorities.
While most demonstrations are peaceful, there is a risk of unrest or violence. If you’re near areas where demonstrations are taking place, be aware of what is happening around you and move away if there are signs of disorder.
Lost or stolen passports
If your passport is lost or stolen, you must renew your passport or apply for an emergency travel document. You cannot use a police report to leave Spain.
Crime
Protecting your belongings
Be alert to the risk of street crime. Thieves use distraction techniques and often work in teams. Take care of your passports, money and personal belongings, particularly when collecting or checking in luggage at the airport, and while arranging car hire.
Do not carry all your valuables in one place. Keep a copy of the photo page of your passport somewhere safe.
Make sure your accommodation has adequate security. Keep all doors and windows locked. If you’re concerned about the security of your accommodation, speak to your travel operator or the property owner.
Vehicle crime
‘Highway pirates’ target foreign-registered and hire cars, especially those towing caravans. They may flag you down, claiming there is something wrong with your car or that you have damaged theirs. If you decide to stop to check the condition of a vehicle, stop in a public area with lights, such as a service station. Be wary of anyone offering help.
When driving, be wary of approaches from people posing as plainclothes police in unmarked cars. In all traffic-related matters, police officers will usually be in uniform.
Unmarked police vehicles have a flashing electronic sign on the rear window saying ‘Policía’ or ‘Guardia Civil’. Genuine police will only ask you to show vehicle documents – not to hand over your bag or wallet.
Attacks and sexual assault
Attacks, including sexual assaults, are rare but do occur. In an emergency call 112.
Avoid splitting up from your friends, do not leave drinks unattended and do not go off with people you do not know. Save the location of your accommodation on your maps app, so it’s easy to find. See TravelAware ‘Stick with your mates’ for tips and advice.
See advice on getting help if you are a victim of crime abroad.
British Consulates in Spain (+34 917 146 300 or +44 207 008 5000) can provide local information and support.
Drink spiking and alcohol
Be alert to the possible use of ‘date rape’ and other drugs including GHB and liquid ecstasy.
Buy your own drinks and always keep them in sight to avoid them being spiked. Alcohol and drugs can reduce your vigilance, making you less in control. If you drink, know your limit. Drinks served in bars in Spain are often stronger than those in the UK.
Scams
Thieves posing as police officers may ask to see your wallet, claiming they need to see it for identification. Genuine police officers will ask to see ID but will not ask for wallets or purses. All police officers, including those in plain clothes, carry official ID.
Timeshares and holiday clubs
Be cautious if you are planning to buy or sell a timeshare. There are companies who offer false incentives.
Read timeshare fraud advice from Action Fraud.
Laws and cultural differences
Personal ID
You must provide photo ID if asked by a police officer. This includes the Guardia Civil and national, regional and local police forces. The police have the right to hold you at a police station until they have confirmed your identity.
Ignoring direct requests of a police officer can be considered as ‘disobedience’, which is a criminal offence.
Hotels, tourist accommodation and car rental companies have a legal duty to register passport details of tourists who check in or collect a vehicle.
When checking in to your accommodation, wait until hotel staff have registered your passport details, or taken a copy of your passport. Do not leave your passport at reception to collect later.
You may need to show ID when buying goods with credit or debit cards. Some shops will accept your driving licence or a copy of your passport, but some may ask for your passport.
Alcohol laws and bans
It’s illegal to drink alcohol in the street in some areas of Spain. You can get an on-the-spot fine. There are strict controls on drinking and sexual activity in public places, including on beaches.
Alcohol laws in the Balearic Islands
Local laws limit the sale and availability of alcohol in areas of some resorts on the Balearic Islands, including:
Magaluf (Calvià), Mallorca
Playa de Palma, Mallorca
San Antonio (San Antoni de Portmany), Ibiza
This bans:
happy hours
open bars (such as ‘all you can drink in one hour’ offers)
the sale of alcohol from vending machines
self-service alcohol dispensers
organising pub crawls and party boat trips
‘off-licence’ sales between 9:30pm and 8am
Hotels and other establishments will evict you if you behave dangerously on balconies. You could also get a fine.
Illegal drugs and prison sentences
Possession of even a small quantity of drugs can lead to arrest and detention. Possession of large quantities will usually result in prosecution and a prison sentence.
Illegal commercial parties in villas and private homes
There have been a number of serious accidents involving people attending illegal commercially promoted parties in villas and private homes on the islands of Ibiza and Mallorca.
Licensed clubs and bars have to meet safety and security standards, including emergency exits and capacity limits, and have trained, licensed security staff. Illegal commercial parties may not meet these standards. Take care of your belongings, make sure you know where emergency exits are and do not take unnecessary risks.
You may get a fine for attending illegal commercially promoted parties.
Dress code
In some parts of Spain it’s illegal to be in the street wearing only a bikini or swimming shorts. Being bare-chested is also illegal in some areas in Spain. You could be fined if you’re caught wearing swimwear on the seafront promenade or adjacent streets.
For security reasons, some public authorities in Spain do not allow the burka or niqab to be worn in their buildings. If you visit town council buildings wearing a burka or niqab, you may be asked to remove it while inside.
Changing money
Always use official money exchange offices or banks because unofficial money changers may give you counterfeit money. Possession or use of counterfeit money is considered a serious crime in Spain and may lead to prosecution.
LGBT+
Spain is a generally tolerant and progressive place for LGBT+ travellers. There are active LGBT+ communities and social venues, particularly in big cities. Same-sex marriage is legal. Transgender people can register under their preferred sex in public documents such as birth certificates, identity cards and passports without undergoing prior gender reassignment surgery.
Read more advice for LGBT+ travellers.
Outdoor activities and adventure tourism
Falls from height
There have been a number of serious accidents, some fatal, involving British nationals falling from height, including from balconies.
Do not take unnecessary risks around balconies or other high places, particularly if you’re under the influence of drink or drugs. If you are staying in a room with a balcony, follow the safety advice at the hotel or apartment, and watch out for friends who may be at risk.
In some regions you may be fined or evicted from your hotel if you are found to be behaving irresponsibly around balconies. Your travel insurance may not cover you for incidents that take place on a balcony or if you were under the influence of drink or drugs when the incident happened.
Festivals, concerts and processions
Many large events and public processions are held in Spain each year. Follow the advice of police and local authorities when attending events.
Take care of your valuables if attending a festival or large concert. See the festival travel checklist for more advice.
Swimming and beaches
Every year, people drown in the sea and in swimming pools in Spain. Always supervise children, even if they can swim or there is a lifeguard present.
Take care when swimming in the sea. Some beaches, especially around Spanish islands, may have strong undercurrents.
Hidden rocks or shallow depths can cause serious injury or death. Do not dive into unknown water and do not swim at beaches where a river runs into the sea.
Many beaches have a flag system. Make sure you understand the system and follow any warnings (a red flag means you must not enter the water). Take extra care and get local knowledge if there are no lifeguards, flags or signs.
If you are walking along unmonitored beaches, be aware that waves can come in further than expected and have strong undertows.
See further tips on ABTA’s swim safe pages and Water Safety on Holiday from the Royal Life Saving Society. 
Follow local advice if jellyfish are present.
Hill walking, skiing and mountain activities
Temperatures in some parts of Spain can change very quickly. Take extra care when planning a hike or walk. Check local weather reports for warnings of extreme heat or cold temperatures.
Altitude sickness may be a risk in some of the higher mountain ranges in Spain, particularly in the regions of Granada, Huesca and Tenerife. See Health.
For advice on safety and weather conditions for skiing or other outdoor activities you can:
call the Spanish National Tourist Office in London on 020 7317 2028
see the European Avalanche Warning Services
If an accident happens while mountaineering, canoeing, potholing or climbing, or if you become lost in the mountains and need mountain rescue, call:
112 for the emergency services
062 for the Civil Guard
The Catalonia region has started billing climbers, skiers and other adventurers whose negligent behaviour causes them to need rescue.
Transport risks
Check with your airline, tour operator or transport company whether there is any planned strike action which might disrupt your journey.
Road travel
You can use a UK photocard driving licence to drive in Spain. If you still have a paper driving licence, you may need to update it to a photocard licence. Provisional licences are not valid for driving in Spain.
To drive a car or a motorcycle over 125cc in Spain you must be 18 years of age or above, and at least 16 years old to ride a motorcycle up to 125cc. You must carry a valid driving licence and ID.  
If you are using UK insurance, always carry your certificate with you in case you are stopped. Check that your UK insurance will cover you to drive in Spain, and for how long. This certificate is generally only valid for a stay of less than 3 months.
Check the requirements for driving if you live in Spain.
Driving a British car abroad
You may need a UK sticker to drive your car outside the UK.
Driving regulations
If you are planning to drive in Spain, see information on driving abroad and check the rules of the road in the RAC’s Spain guide. The guide lists driving regulations and other legal requirements you need to be aware of.
Spain has strict drink-driving laws. Police regularly carry out roadside checks for alcohol and drugs. Penalties include fines, loss of licence and a prison sentence.
The police can give you on-the-spot fines for a variety of driving offences including speeding. If you accept the fine and pay within 20 days, it will be reduced by 50%. More information on how to pay is available on the Spanish driving agency website.
Seatbelts are compulsory for all passengers in the front and back seats. Children aged 11 and under, or under 1.35m in height, must use an approved child safety seat secured on the back seat. Children are only permitted to travel in the front seat of the car if the rear seats are already occupied by other children or if the vehicle does not have rear seats.
Car hire agencies can provide child seats, so let them know you need one when you reserve the car. Incorrect installation of a child seat or not wearing a seatbelt can be considered a serious offence and met with fines. 
It is illegal to use a mobile phone when driving, even if you have pulled over to the side of the road. You must be completely away from the road. Using an earpiece is also illegal. Only completely hands-free units are allowed.
Low emission zones
Some inner-city areas in Spain have introduced permanent low emission zones (‘Zonas de bajas emisiones’ – ZBE) where Spanish vehicles must meet specific exhaust emission standards and display an air pollution sticker. The stickers are not issued to vehicles with foreign registration plates, but some cities require you to register your vehicle in advance – for example, Barcelona.
The Spanish government’s general information helpline 060 (if calling in Spain) or +34 902 887 060 (if calling from UK) may be able to provide further information.
Taxis
Only use official registered or licensed taxis, or reputable transport companies you recognise. Licensing regulations differ across Spain and in certain cities pre-booking is required.
Passengers caught using unlicensed taxi services are liable for fines of up to 600 euros. Make sure you book your taxi or airport transfer through a licensed firm.
Extreme weather and natural disasters
Find out what you can do to prepare for and respond to extreme weather and natural hazards.
Extreme temperatures
Extreme temperatures can affect many areas of Spain over the summer months. Follow the Spanish Meteorological Office (AEMET) and European Meteorological Services for severe weather warnings.
The NHS has information on how to cope in hot weather. You can also follow guidance from the Spanish Ministry of Health (in Spanish).
Check with your travel provider and follow the advice of local authorities.
Wildfires
Wildfires happen often in Spain, including on the islands, during the summer months.
Be aware of your environment when visiting or driving through woodland areas. For information on wildfire risk visit the Spanish Meteorological Office (AEMET).
Causing a wildfire is a criminal offence in Spain, even if unintentional. Make sure cigarette ends are properly extinguished, do not light barbecues and do not leave empty bottles behind. You can be heavily fined for not following the rules against lighting outdoor barbecues in forest areas. Make sure you know the rules if considering a barbeque.
For information on what to do in the event of a wildfire, visit Civil Protection (website in Spanish). Immediately report any fire you see to the emergency services on 112. In the case of wildfires, the situation can change quickly, so you should stay up to date with official advice.
Flooding
Flash flooding can cause travel disruption and damage to property and infrastructure. Check weather warnings from Spain’s meteorological office (AEMET) before travel and follow the advice of the local authorities.
