Visit your health professional at least 4 to 6 weeks before your trip to check whether you need any vaccinations or other preventive measures.
Check the latest country-specific information and advice from the National Travel Health Network and Centre (NaTHNaC) on the TravelHealthPro website or from NHS (Scotland) on the fitfortravel website. Useful information and advice about healthcare abroad is also available on the NHS Choices website.
There is a reciprocal healthcare agreement for British nationals visiting Montenegro, which entitles you to free treatment for genuine emergencies. In order to exercise this right, you should present a British passport and some evidence of being insured in the UK to the office of the Health Fund of Montenegro and obtain a certificate. More detailed information can be found on our living in Montenegro page. The reciprocal agreement does not cover repatriation to the UK or any additional costs, so we highly recommend taking out adequate travel health insurance to cover the cost of any medical treatment abroad and repatriation.
If traveling with prescription medication, check with the government of Montenegro, and its Ministry of Foreign Affairs to ensure the medication is legal in Montenegro. Always carry your prescription medication in original packaging with your doctorâ€™s prescription.
If you need emergency medical assistance during your trip, dial 124 to contact the ambulance service directly. You should contact your insurance/medical assistance company promptly if you are referred to a medical facility for treatment.
