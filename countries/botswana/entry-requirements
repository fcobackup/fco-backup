COVID-19 rules
There are no COVID-19 testing or vaccination requirements for travellers entering Botswana.
Passport validity requirements
To enter Botswana, your passport must have an ‘expiry date’ at least 6 months after the date you arrive and at least 3 blank pages.
Check with your travel provider that your passport and other travel documents meet requirements. Renew your passport if you need to.
You will be denied entry if you do not have a valid travel document or try to use a passport that has been reported lost or stolen.
Make sure you get your passport stamped.
This will record your date and port of entry. Unstamped passports will raise suspicions of illegal entry.
Dual nationals
Dual nationals must enter Botswana on the same passport they used to exit the previous country.
Visa requirements
You can visit Botswana for up to 90 days without a visa.
If you want to work, study or volunteer in Botswana, see the requirements for business, study and employment visas.  
Overstaying a visa or a permitted visit can cause a delay to your departure. If you want to extend your stay, contact Botswana’s Department of Immigration.
Travelling with children
You must have an original or certified copy of the full birth certificate of any child aged 17 or under when you enter or leave the country.
Any parent not present must sign an affidavit giving their consent for the child to travel. For more information contact the Botswana High Commission in the UK.
