Liberia’s banking sector is currently experiencing cash shortages (of both US dollars and Liberian dollars). Banks and foreign exchange facilities may be unable to pay out transferred funds or fulfil ATM withdrawals. Bring sufficient funds, in US dollars cash, to cover all expenses. See Money.
Protests and demonstrations do take place in Monrovia on occasion. You should avoid protests, demonstrations, political rallies, large gatherings and crowds and follow the advice of local authorities.

General medical facilities throughout Liberia are unable to provide the same standard of healthcare as in the UK. Facilities in rural areas are rudimentary. Many medical facilities expect to be paid up-front for treatment. If you travel to Liberia, stay in contact with your employer or host organisation about the support that they can provide to you while you’re in the country.
If you’re concerned that you might have been exposed to, or showing symptoms of Ebola or Lassa fever, you should seek immediate medical advice. If you’re in the UK call NHS on 111.

The small British Embassy in Monrovia can only offer limited consular assistance.
