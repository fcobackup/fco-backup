The FCDO advises against all but essential travel to:
the whole of Réunion based on the current assessment of COVID-19 risks.
If you are returning to the UK from Réunion, you will need to self-isolate on your return (unless you are exempt). Check the latest guidance for England, Northern Ireland, Scotland and Wales.
Travel is subject to entry restrictions
Entry to Réunion is restricted at present. For further information, see the local Prefecture website for essential reasons.
Travellers have to provide the completed necessary “attestation” which is available from the local Prefecture website.
Travellers have to produce a negative result of a PCR test carried out less than 72 hours before departure. Arrivals to Réunion will be required to self-isolate for seven days, before taking another PCR test. Travellers may need to produce a self-certified document affirming that they have no COVID symptoms and that to their knowledge they have not been in contact with any person confirmed positive within the last 14 days.
These entry requirements are subject to change. For further information on the entry restrictions in place for French Overseas Territories, see the French government’s website before travelling.
