There are currently no commercial options available to return to the UK from El Salvador given the closure of San Salvador Airport to passenger flights until further notice and entry restrictions imposed by neighbouring countries.
We know this is concerning for British people trying to leave El Salvador. The UK government is working closely with airlines, the Salvadoran authorities and other governments to make sure options are available for you to return to the UK as soon as possible.

You will need to pay for your return travel to the UK. If departure options are available but you cannot afford the travel costs and have exhausted all other options for getting funds, you may be eligible to apply for an emergency loan from the government. This is a last resort option and you would need to repay the loan when you are back in the UK.
For more information, you should contact Corporate Travel Management (CTM). CTM are a commercial partner of the FCO and are authorised to administer such loans on behalf of the FCO.
