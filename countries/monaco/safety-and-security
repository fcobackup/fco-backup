Terrorism 
There is a high threat of terrorist attack globally affecting UK interests and British nationals, including from groups and individuals who view the UK and British nationals as targets. Stay aware of your surroundings at all times.
UK Counter Terrorism Policing has information and advice on staying safe abroad and what to do in the event of a terrorist attack. Find out how to reduce your risk from terrorism while abroad. 
Terrorism in Monaco 
Although there’s no recent history of terrorism in Monaco, attacks cannot be ruled out. 
Crime 
Protecting yourself and your belongings 
Street crime is rare, but take sensible precautions to protect your passport and valuables. 
Thefts have happened on trains to and from Monaco, and at Nice airport, particularly at the car rental parks where bags have been stolen while drivers are loading their cars. 
Laws and cultural differences 
Dress code
You could get a fine if you walk around in swimsuits, stripped to the waist, or barefoot, apart from on beaches and in bathing areas.   
Outdoor activities and adventure tourism
Swimming
Get local advice before swimming in the sea, especially if you see jellyfish.
See water safety on holiday from the Royal Life Saving Society.
Transport risks 
Road travel 
If you are planning to drive in Monaco, see information on driving abroad and check the rules of the road in the RAC’s Monaco guide. The guide lists driving regulations and other legal requirements you need to be aware of. 
You’ll need to have both the 1968 version of the international driving permit (IDP) and your UK driving licence with you in the car. You cannot buy an IDP outside the UK, so get one before you travel.
Hire car companies often have stricter requirements for their customers, such as a year of driving experience, a higher minimum age and holding an IDP.
Check if you need a UK sticker to drive your car outside the UK.
