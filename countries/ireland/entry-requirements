The information on this page covers the most common types of travel and reflects the UK government’s understanding of the rules currently in place. Unless otherwise stated, this information is for travellers using a full ‘British Citizen’ passport.
The authorities in the country or territory you’re travelling to are responsible for setting and enforcing the rules for entry. If you’re unclear about any aspect of the entry requirements, or you need further reassurance, you’ll need to contact the embassy, high commission or consulate of the country or territory you’re travelling to.
You should also consider checking with your transport provider or travel company to make sure your passport and other travel documents meet their requirements.
Entry rules in response to coronavirus (COVID-19)
There are a series of rules in place regarding entry to Ireland during the Covid-19 pandemic. Please refer to the relevant page of the Irish Government website for full information on all of these.
Passenger Locator Form
If you are coming to Ireland from overseas, including if you are travelling onwards to Northern Ireland, you must complete a COVID-19 Passenger Locator Form. Failure to complete this form is an offence.
If you arrive via Northern Ireland and have been overseas in the 14 days prior to your arrival in Ireland, then you must complete an electronic COVID-19 Passenger Locator Form online.
Some people (such as essential supply chain workers) are exempted from completing this form.
Passengers travelling onwards to Northern Ireland via Ireland must ensure that they are familiar with the public health measures in place there, including the requirement to complete a UK Passenger Locator form.
Requirement for a pre-departure Covid-19 RT-PCR test
If you are arriving into Ireland from overseas or are transiting through an Irish port or airport you must have a negative/‘not detected’ result from a pre-departure Reverse Transcription Polymerase Chain Reaction (RT-PCR) COVID-19 test carried out no more than 72 hours prior to your arrival in Ireland. Antigen or other test types do not meet the requirements. See the list of private providers of COVID-19 testing in the UK for the purposes of international travel.
You will be asked to show evidence of this test result before boarding the aircraft or ferry from your point of origin, and will be denied boarding if you cannot produce this evidence. On arrival you will have to provide this evidence to Irish immigration officers. Written confirmation of your test result should be retained for at least 14 days.
If you arrive without evidence of a negative or ‘not detected’ RT-PCR test or a valid exemption:
this is an offence
you must enter and pay for mandatory quarantine in a hotel until either you receive a negative or ‘not detected’ RT-PCR test result or you have quarantined in the hotel for 10 days.
If you arrive into Ireland from overseas and enter via Northern Ireland, then you must have a negative / non-detected RT-PCR test result taken within 72 hours of arrival at the point of entry and retain this test result for 14 days after arrival. It must be shown upon request to a member of An Garda Síochána (the Irish police force).
A list of exemptions for people who do not need a pre-departure RT-PCR test is listed on the Irish Government website.
Post-arrival quarantine requirements for all passengers arriving in Ireland.
Mandatory quarantine requirements apply to all persons who have been overseas in the 14 days prior to entering Ireland. Arrivals from designated high-risk countries are subject to mandatory hotel quarantine (see below).
For all other people arriving in Ireland from non-designated countries, a 14-day quarantine period must be undertaken at the address specified on the Passenger Locator Form. You may only leave your place of residence during the quarantine period for unavoidable reasons of an emergency nature, such as to protect a person’s health or welfare, or to leave Ireland.
Passengers who travel from another country to Ireland via Northern Ireland must also observe the mandatory quarantine regime.
You can end your period of quarantine if you receive written confirmation of a ‘non-detected’ RT-PCR test result taken no less than 5 days after arrival. You must retain the written confirmation of your test result for at least 14 days. It is an offence not to fulfil the legal requirement for mandatory quarantine.
Designated High-Risk Countries: Mandatory Hotel Quarantine
Travel to Ireland from specific countries designated as ‘high risk’ is now subject to mandatory hotel quarantine. Travellers arriving from the UK are not currently subject to these requirements, unless they have been in a designated high-risk country in the preceding 14 days.
Mandatory hotel quarantine accommodation must be pre-booked in advance of travel. See further information about mandatory hotel quarantine, including information on how to pre-book, costs, a list of exempted categories, and further Q&A material.
Mandatory hotel quarantine applies to any passenger who has been in any of the designated countries in the previous 14 days, even if they only transited through one of these countries and even if they remained airside.
The arrangements also apply to any passenger who is travelling on to Northern Ireland; people in this category are also required to pre-book a space in a designated hotel and fulfil all the requirements of mandatory hotel quarantine before continuing their journey. Likewise anyone who arrives overland into Ireland from Northern Ireland is required to check into a pre-booked mandatory hotel quarantine facility within four hours of arrival if they have been in a designated high-risk country within the preceding 14 days.
Exemption for those who have been fully vaccinated
If you are fully vaccinated and have the documents to prove it, then you do not have to complete mandatory hotel quarantine when you come to Ireland. Any dependents travelling with you, including children, will also be exempted from the requirement to complete mandatory hotel quarantine.
However, if even you are fully vaccinated, you still have to have a negative RT-PCR test taken in the 72 hours before departure and complete a period of self-quarantine at home or wherever you specified in your passenger locator form.
More information is available on exemptions on the Irish Government website.
The list of designated states may change at short notice and passengers are required to check the list before travelling to Ireland.
Regular entry requirements
ID
Ireland, along with the UK, is a member of the Common Travel Area. British nationals travelling from the UK don’t need a passport to visit Ireland. However, Irish immigration officers will check the ID of all passengers arriving by air from the UK and may ask for proof of nationality, particularly if you were born outside the UK. You are therefore advised to take your British passport with you.
For more information about the types of ID you might be asked to present, see the website of the Ireland Citizens Information Board.
Before travelling, check with your carrier about their ID requirements, as most airlines and other transport providers won’t carry passengers to and from Ireland unless they’ve seen satisfactory photographic ID.
Passport validity
If you’re using a passport to enter Ireland, it should be valid for the proposed duration of your stay; you don’t need any additional period of validity on your passport beyond this.
UK Emergency Travel Documents
UK Emergency Travel Documents (ETDs) are accepted for entry into, transit through, and exit from Ireland.
