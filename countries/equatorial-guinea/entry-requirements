COVID-19 rules
There are no COVID-19 testing or vaccination requirements for travellers entering Equatorial Guinea.
Passport validity requirements
To enter Equatorial Guinea, your passport must have an ‘expiry date’ at least 6 months after the date you arrive.
Check with your travel provider that your passport and other travel documents meet requirements. Renew your passport if you need to.
You will be denied entry if you do not have a valid travel document or try to use a passport that has been reported lost or stolen.
Visa requirements
You must have a visa to visit Equatorial Guinea. Short-term visas are valid for 90 days. For longer stays you must apply at local police stations.
Applying for a visa
Complete the online visa application form and upload the required documents. The processing time is 72 hours. Print out the e-visa letter to present on arrival, and border officials will issue your visa.
You can also apply in person at the embassy and get the visa before you travel.
Make sure you get your passport stamped.
Make sure the border control officer issues your visa and puts a stamp in your passport. Travellers have reported being delayed or threatened with detention because their passports have not been properly processed.
Residence permits
Long-term visitors must get a residence permit of one-year validity from the Ministry of National Security. If you have a residence permit, you will not need a visa.
Vaccination requirements
You must have a certificate to prove you’ve had a yellow fever vaccination, due to a risk of yellow fever transmission.
For full details about medical entry requirements and recommended vaccinations, see TravelHealthPro’s Equatorial Guinea guide.
Health screening
You may have to fill in a health questionnaire about any recent travel to Ebola-affected countries, including Liberia, Guinea and Sierra Leone.
Customs rules
You must declare anything that may be prohibited or subject to tax or duty.
