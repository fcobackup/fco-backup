A number of airline operators are starting to announce that international flights to/from Australia have been suspended or will be suspended shortly.
British nationals already in Australia should contact their airline, travel provider and insurance company for the latest travel information. Those who want to return to the UK soon should take account of the fast moving situation and plan accordingly.
If you are unable to leave Australia and your visa is nearing expiry, you should contact the Australian authorities as soon as possible
