Public spaces and services
Enhanced measures are in place across Italy to help prevent the spread of Coronavirus:
A nightly curfew is in place in all regions from 2200 to 0500. You cannot leave your place of residence during this time apart from for emergency, work or health reasons. You’ll need to carry a self-declaration form explaining your reasons for travel.
There is a strong recommendation from the Italian Government that people do not travel by public or private transport except for work, study or health reasons, or for reasons of necessity.
Public transport is operating at 50% capacity and its use is discouraged except for essential purposes.
Social distancing of one metre must be observed.
The use of masks is mandatory in all public spaces, whether outdoors or indoors. You should pay close attention to signage when travelling and carry a mask with you at all times.
Only four people can sit together at a restaurant, bar or café. These venues must close at 6pm, although they can offer takeaway service, for consumption at home, until 10pm.
Museums, theatres, cinemas and concert venues are closed.
Dance activity in nightclubs and open air venues has been suspended and parties are not permitted.
Parks are open and outdoor exercise is permitted, subject to social distancing. Contact sport is banned and sports centres, swimming pools, spas and wellness centres are closed.
Funerals are permitted to take place with limited attendance. Churches can celebrate mass, weddings and baptisms. Receptions following civil and religious ceremonies are banned.
Conferences and trade fairs are banned, unless held online.
More stringent measures are in place in some Italian regions that have been designated ‘red zones’.
Travel to or from one of those regions should only be for work, health or emergency reasons. Bars and eateries are closed and only shops selling essential items are open. More information on regional classifications is available on the Ministry of Health website (in English).
Regional and local authorities in Italy are empowered to adjust these measures where required, which may occur at short notice. You are strongly advised to consult the websites for the regions in which you are travelling for the latest information. You should also pay close attention to local signage.
