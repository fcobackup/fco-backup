Cases of coronavirus (COVID-19) have been confirmed in Cyprus. The Cypriot authorities have introduced measures to limit the spread of the virus.
On 18 March, the Foreign and Commonwealth Office advised British nationals that wished to return to the UK to make arrangements to do so as soon as possible. British nationals that wish to leave Cyprus should contact their travel operator or airline for further advice. British nationals in Cyprus should follow the advice of the Cypriot authorities. Travellers to Cyprus must follow restrictions imposed by Cypriot authorities. For information on how to return to the UK from Cyprus, see Return to the UK.
Travel Restrictions
From 15 March, UK nationals (and other non-Cypriots) are not permitted to enter the Republic of Cyprus for tourism while a state of emergency is in force.
Cypriot nationals and other legal residents will only be allowed to enter the Republic for urgent medical needs or repatriation of the most vulnerable. Further advice can be obtained from Cyprus’ High Commissions, Consulates or Embassies abroad. Individuals falling into the above categories will be expected to obtain a certificate from Cyprus’ diplomatic missions abroad in order to gain permission to travel and will be subject to 14 days’ quarantine in a state facility on arrival.
There is a near complete ban on flights to and from Cyprus from 21 March until 30 April. Although some commercial flights are still able to leave Cyprus, only humanitarian and cargo flights may arrive. The Cyprus government is organising repatriation flights from European hubs. See Return to the UK for details
The administration in the north of Cyprus has introduced a total ban on entry for all foreign nationals, including from the UK, until 30 April. This includes those holding residency, work, or student permits. Exemptions exist for spouses and children of ‘citizens’ of north Cyprus, regardless of whether they are ‘citizens’ themselves. Anyone returning to north Cyprus from abroad will be quarantined for 14 days in centres organised by the administration. A partial curfew, including movement restrictions, is in place. Only essential businesses will remain open until 30 April. There are currently no flights between Turkey and the north of Cyprus until at least 1 May.
Neighbouring countries including Greece and Turkey have also introduced restrictions which may impact on travel. Check country-specific FCO Travel Advice for details.
Closure of Hotels
All hotels have ceased operations and will remain closed until 30 April. The Republic of Cyprus government is using a small number of hotels to accommodate Cypriot nationals and permanent residents who have recently returned from abroad for quarantine purposes.
Other Measures
Following policy changes announced by the Republic of Cyprus Government and the administration in the north, all crossing points between the Republic and the north are effectively closed to travellers.
From 06:00 on 31 March until 30 April, further movement restrictions are in place. Anyone under 65 years old going outdoors must send an SMS to 8998 explaining the reasons for going outdoors.
Further guidance and information is available from the Press and Information Office website. If you do not have a Cypriot mobile phone, you are advised to buy a local pay-as-you-go SIM card in order to use this service.
Anyone over the age of 65 may use a written form, or exceptionally a handwritten note following the format outlined in the guidance. There is a further form which employers should complete for their employees in order to travel to work.
Healthcare
For information from the Cypriot authorities, see the Cypriot Ministry of Health website If you develop fever and/or respiratory symptoms such as shortness of breath or cough, the Cyprus Government advise that you stay indoors and immediately contact the Ministry of Health’s public health line: 1420
