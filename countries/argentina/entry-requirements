Restrictions in response to coronavirus
Borders and travel
Argentina’s borders are closed to most foreign nationals and non-residents entering the country. Some exceptions apply to this rule.
With effect from 30 October, nationals and residents of neighbouring countries can enter Argentina to visit the Metropolitan Area of Buenos Aires for tourism purposes. Entry will only be allowed through the Port of Buenos Aires (Buquebus Terminal) and through Ezeiza International Airport and San Fernando International Airport in the Province of Buenos Aires. Those who qualify will have to present a negative COVID-19 PCR test taken within 72 hours prior to arrival and have medical insurance with comprehensive cover for coronavirus. For further information on requirements, or to check whether you qualify, contact your airline and Argentine Immigration.
From 30 November, some non-resident foreign nationals who don’t usually require a visa to enter Argentina will be allowed into the country, at the discretion of immigration officials at: Ezeiza and San Fernando International Airports; the Buquebus terminals; and the land border crossings at Paso de los Libres-Uruguayana, Sistema Cristo Redentor, San Sebastian and Gualeguaychú-Fray Bentos. For your entry to be considered, you must:
be a direct family member of an Argentine national
have an exceptional reason to visit your Argentine family member
plan to visit for a limited period of time
not have any COVID-19 related symptoms
If you meet the above criteria, you will have to show the following to both your airline, or Buquebus, authorities before boarding, as well as to immigration officers upon arrival in Argentina:
a legalised (apostilled) birth or marriage certificate, or common law partnership documentation
a copy of your Argentine relative’s national ID (DNI)
a letter explaining the exceptional reasons for your visit
proof that you have booked a return flight
proof that you have taken a COVID-19 PCR test, with a negative result, within 72 hours of your arrival
and proof you have medical insurance with comprehensive cover for coronavirus
The British Embassy cannot offer advice to British nationals on whether you meet the above criteria. You should check with your airline and your nearest Argentine Consulate for further information ahead of travelling.
The borders remain open for departures. While the Argentine government is permitting a limited number of exceptional international flights, all scheduled international flights have been suspended until further notice.

Regular entry requirements
Visas
You don’t need a visa to enter Argentina as a tourist unless you’re travelling on an Emergency Travel Document. On presentation of a valid British passport you will normally be given an entry stamp permitting you to stay in the country for a period of up to 90 days.
If you wish to extend your stay for another 90-day period, seek advice from the Argentine Migrations Office.
If you’re travelling to Argentina for any purpose other than tourism, contact the Embassy of the Argentine Republic in London.
Passport validity
Your passport should be valid for the proposed duration of your stay. No additional period of validity beyond this is required.
