Cases of coronavirus (COVID-19) have been confirmed in Bosnia and Herzegovina. The Bosnian authorities have introduced a number of measures to limit the spread of the virus.
International travel
Current travel measures include prohibiting entry at borders to all foreign nationals. Some groups are exempt from this rule, including: residents, diplomats, EUFOR/NATO staff, freight drivers and crew, and foreigners in transit to their country of residence. Everyone entering BiH is required to self-isolate for 14 days. Those showing symptoms of the virus could find themselves detained in camps. New restrictions on travel may be introduced at short notice. You should comply with any additional screening measures put in place by the authorities.
A number of restrictions are in place at border crossing points into and out of Bosnia and Herzegovina. The Border Police of Bosnia and Herzegovina are publishing regular updates. Countries neighbouring Bosnia and Herzegovina (Croatia, Serbia and Montenegro) have also introduced restrictions. Please check country-specific FCO Travel Advice for details.
The Bosnian authorities have advised that where individuals’ visas or residence permits have expired due to current restrictions on travel meaning they were unable to leave the country, the Bosnian authorities will adopt a case by case approach. If your visa or residence permit has expired, you should contact your nearest Field Office of the Service for Foreigners’ Affairs.
