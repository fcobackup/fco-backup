The Foreign, Commonwealth and Development Office advises against all travel to:
areas of Western Sahara within 30km north/west of the Berm
areas of Western Sahara south/east of the Berm
Before you travel, check the ‘Entry requirements’ section for Western Sahara’s current entry restrictions and requirements. Due to COVID-19, these may change with little warning. Monitor this advice for the latest updates and stay in contact with your travel provider.
If you plan to pass through another country to return to the UK, check the travel advice for the country you’re transiting.
It is more important than ever to get travel insurance and check it provides appropriate cover. See the FCDO’s guidance on foreign travel insurance.
There is no British diplomatic presence in Western Sahara and consular support is severely limited. If you need consular assistance you should contact the British Embassy in Rabat, Morocco. If you’re abroad and you need emergency help from the UK government, contact the nearest British embassy, consulate or high commission.
If your return journey to the UK transits another country, you should check whether it is subject to a travel ban or any other additional requirements. If so, contact your travel provider.
Western Sahara is a disputed territory and the UK regards its status as undetermined. See Political situation

Take out comprehensive travel and medical insurance before you travel.
