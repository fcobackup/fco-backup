Entry rules in response to coronavirus (COVID-19)
On 27 April, the Government of Malta announced that, with immediate effect, the UK will be rated Amber for travel to Malta. All passengers travelling to Malta from the United Kingdom are required to have evidence of a negative Polymerase Chain Reaction (PCR) test, dated within 72 hours prior to arrival, before boarding flights to Malta.
Scheduled flights may be subject to short notice cancellation. Check the Malta Airport website or contact the airline to check the status of flights.
Entry to Malta
All passengers travelling to Malta from the United Kingdom are required to have evidence of a negative Polymerase Chain Reaction (PCR) test, dated within 72 hours prior to arrival. Passengers are required to present a physical copy of a negative Covid-19 PCR test at check-in and after landing in Malta. This requirement also applies to children and infants.
Passengers are also required to complete a Public Health Travel Declaration Form and Passenger Locator Form. Both forms will need to be shown to airline officials on departure and health officials stationed at the Terminal Temperature Screening Points following arrival in Malta.
For further information about entry requirements Visit the Maltese Government website. The Maltese Government will regularly review the list of countries for which prior testing will be required.
Malta have a traffic light system for international arrivals. You may not travel to Malta from a country which is red listed via one of the amber listed countries. If you are travelling to Malta from the UK or another amber listed country, you must have been in the UK or other amber listed country for a minimum of 14 days. If you wish to travel to Malta from a red listed country you will need prior permission from the Maltese authorities. You should contact your nearest Maltese Embassy or High Commission for more information.
You should not use the NHS testing service to get a test in order to facilitate your travel to another country. You should arrange to take a private test.
Self-isolation
The current list of countries exempt from self-isolation can be found on the Visit Malta website. If arriving from an exempt country or region passengers will need to certify they have resided in that country for at least 2 weeks prior to travelling. There will, however, be temperature checks for all arriving and departing passengers. Those passengers with a high temperature will be required to undergo a swab test. Further details on the procedures are explained on the Malta International Airport website.
Regular entry requirements
Visas
The rules for travelling or working in European countries changed on 1 January 2021:
you can travel to countries in the Schengen area for up to 90 days in any 180-day period without a visa. This applies if you travel as a tourist, to visit family or friends, to attend business meetings, cultural or sports events, or for short-term studies or training
if you are travelling to Malta and other Schengen countries without a visa, make sure your whole visit is within the 90-day limit. Visits to Schengen countries within the previous 180 days before you travel count towards your 90 days
to stay longer, to work or study, for business travel or for other reasons, you will need to meet the Maltese government’s entry requirements. Check with the Maltese High Commission what type of visa and/or work permit you may need
if you stay in Malta with a visa or permit, this does not count towards your 90-day visa-free limit
Any time you spent in Malta or other Schengen countries before 1 January 2021 does not count towards your 90-day visa-free limit.
At Maltese border control, you may need to use separate lanes from EU, EEA and Swiss citizens when queueing. Your passport may be stamped on entry and exit. You may also need to:
show a return or onward ticket
show you have enough money for your stay
There are separate requirements for those who are resident in Malta. If you are resident in Malta, you should carry proof of residence as well as your valid passport when you travel. For further information on these requirements, see our Living in Malta guide.
Passport validity
Check your passport is valid for travel before you book your trip, and renew your passport if you do not have enough time left on it.
You must have at least 6 months left on an adult or child passport to travel to most countries in Europe (not including Ireland).
If you renewed your current passport before the previous one expired, extra months may have been added to its expiry date. Any extra months on your passport over 10 years may not count towards the 6 months needed.
UK Emergency Travel Documents
UK Emergency Travel Documents are accepted for entry, airside transit and exit from Malta.
Yellow fever certificate requirements
Check whether you need a yellow fever certificate by visiting the National Travel Health Network and Centre’s TravelHealthPro website.
