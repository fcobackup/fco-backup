Flights
There are limited options to return to the UK. Royal Brunei have commenced flights to Kuala Lumpur. From Kuala Lumpur, onward travel to London is possible on Qatar Airways via Doha. Before booking a flight, you should check requirements with your airline and consult travel advice for any entry or transit restrictions in place.
Details of Royal Brunei’s schedule can be found on the Royal Brunei Airlines website.
Brunei has introduced an exit travel ban, including for permanent residents, and expatriate workers (green identity card holders), and their dependents. Exceptions will be considered by the Prime Minister’s Office on a case by case basis, through email applications to travelapplication@jpm.gov.bn giving 14 days’ notice of the intention to travel, and setting out reasons why they need to leave the country. Full details are available on the Prime Minister’s Office website.
You will need to pay for your return travel to the UK. If departure options are available but you cannot afford the travel costs and have exhausted all other options for getting funds, you may be eligible to apply for an emergency loan from the government. This is a last resort option and you would need to repay the loan when you are back in the UK. For more information, you should contact Corporate Travel Management (CTM). CTM are a commercial partner of the FCO and are authorised to administer such loans on behalf of the FCO.
