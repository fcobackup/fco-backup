The Cuban National Peso (CUP known as ‘moneda nacional’) is the official cash currency in Cuba but cannot be exchanged outside of the country. Some casas particulares (guest houses/ bed & breakfasts), and private bars and restaurants prefer cash payments in dollars or euros. It is advisable to exchange GBP for Euros or USD before you arrive in Cuba. Some hotels only accept bankcard payments. Check with your bank before you travel to confirm that your debit, credit and ATM cards will work in Cuba.
You should not take Cuban pesos (CUP) out of the country. At the end of your stay, you are advised to spend your CUP or exchange them to a foreign currency before reaching the airport on departure, as this service is not provided at the Cadeca money exchange counter there. Foreign currency in Euros, US or Canadian dollars can be used for cash payments in duty free shops or cafes in the departure area after passing immigration.
It is currently illegal to exchange money other than at Cadeca exchange houses. Opening times and the availability of currency at Cadecas may vary. Ignore individuals offering exchange facilities to avoid queues. Cadeca exchange houses at airports buy Euros, GBP, USD and some other currencies in exchange for CUP. However, as stated above, you cannot exchange your CUP back at airports.
CUP is also obtainable at ATMs using a bankcard. Currency available at ATMs and Cadeca exchange houses may be limited, so it is a good idea to bring cash to cover your stay. Euros and USD are accepted more widely than Sterling. Bank notes should be in good condition with no tears, rips or markings. Scottish bank notes cannot be exchanged.
Check with your hotel or tour operator for the most up to date information before you travel.
