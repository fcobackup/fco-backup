There are reports of an outbreak of a haemorrhagic fever in Kie Ntem Province, northern Equatorial Guinea. Travel is restricted in and around this area. You should be extremely vigilant in and near Kie Ntem in Equatorial Guinea, and in the neighbouring areas of Ambam, Kye-Ossi and Olamze in southern Cameroon, and Ntem and Woleu in Gabon. Check with local authorities before travelling.
If you have a health condition, or you are pregnant, you may need specialist healthcare abroad. Check whether your destination country can provide the healthcare you may need and ensure you have appropriate travel insurance for unexpected medical evacuation or local treatment.
See the Coronavirus travel health and Healthcare sections in the Coronavirus page for COVID-19 health information.
At least 8 weeks before your trip, check the latest country-specific health advice from the National Travel Health Network and Centre (NaTHNaC) on the TravelHealthPro website. Each country-specific page has information on vaccine recommendations, any current health risks or outbreaks, and factsheets with information on staying healthy abroad. Guidance is also available from NHS (Scotland) on the FitForTravel website.
General information on travel vaccinations and a travel health checklist is available on the NHS website. You may then wish to contact your health adviser or pharmacy for advice on other preventive measures and managing any pre-existing medical conditions while you’re abroad.
The legal status and regulation of some medicines prescribed or brought in the UK can be different in other countries. If you’re travelling with prescription or over-the-counter medicine, check this guidance from NaTHNaC on best practice when travelling with medicines. For further information on the legal status of a specific medicine, you’ll need to contact the embassy, high commission or consulate of the country or territory you’re travelling to.
While travel can be enjoyable, it can sometimes be challenging. There are clear links between mental and physical health, so looking after yourself during travel and when abroad is important. Information on travelling with mental health conditions is available in our guidance page. Further information is also available from the National Travel Health Network and Centre (NaTHNaC).
Medical facilities
Medical facilities in Cameroon are below UK standards. Emergency facilities are extremely limited. For serious medical treatment, medical evacuation to the UK or South Africa will be necessary. Make sure you have adequate travel health insurance and accessible funds to cover the cost of any medical treatment abroad and repatriation.
Pharmacies in Cameroon have a green cross outside. Most are extremely helpful to clients. Pharmacies in Cameroon tend to accept prescriptions drawn up in the UK. Not all pharmacies have full stocks so you should be prepared to have to visit more than one for some drugs – a pharmacy will usually advise you on other possibilities nearby. Most supermarkets do not have a pharmacy inside. If you are hospitalised in Cameroon and need drugs of any kind, you, or an accompanying person, will have to visit a pharmacy (usually in the hospital) to buy the drugs first and then return to the ward before you can be treated. Most facilities will require cash payments before medical services are administered.
Health risks
UK health authorities have classified Cameroon as having a risk of Zika virus transmission. For information and advice about the risks associated with Zika virus, visit the National Travel Health Network and Centre website.
In May 2016, the Cameroon Ministry of Livestock Fisheries and Animal Industries confirmed an outbreak of avian influenza (bird flu) at a government owned poultry complex at Mvog-Betsi, a suburb on the outskirts of Yaoundé. You should follow NHS advice on bird flu.
There is a high risk of malaria in Cameroon. There is a risk of yellow fever transmission in all areas of Cameroon. You should take steps to avoid being bitten by mosquitoes.
As of July 2022, there is a cholera outbreak in Cameroon, mainly in the South West. See information on cholera.
In the 2015 the UNAIDS/WHO Working Group estimated 620,000 people in Cameroon living with HIV of which 580,000 are aged 15 or over; the prevalence percentage was estimated at around 4.5 of the adult population compared to the prevalence percentage in adults in the UK of around 0.25%. You should exercise normal precautions to avoid exposure to HIV and AIDS.
If you need emergency medical assistance during your trip, dial 112 or 113 or 119 and ask for an ambulance. You should contact your insurance/medical assistance company promptly if you’re referred to a medical facility for treatment.
