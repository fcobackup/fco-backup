Warning
FCDO advises against all travel to parts of Venezuela.

This information is for people travelling on a full ‘British citizen’ passport from the UK. It is based on the UK government’s understanding of Venezuela’s current rules for the most common types of travel.
The authorities in Venezuela set and enforce entry rules. If you’re not sure how these requirements apply to you, contact the Venezuelan Embassy in the UK (in Spanish).
Passport validity requirements
To enter Venezuela, your passport must have an ‘expiry date’ at least 6 months after the date you plan to leave.
Check with your travel provider that your passport and other travel documents meet requirements. Renew your passport if you need to.
You will be denied entry if you do not have a travel document or try to use a passport that has been reported lost or stolen.
If you’re a resident in Venezuela, both your passport and resident visa or permit must be valid at the time of your arrival.
Visa requirements
If you arrive by air, you can stay for up to 90 days visa-free on a ‘tourist card’, issued on arrival. You must show your return or onward travel ticket.
If you’re arriving overland or by sea, you may need to get a visa in advance. Contact the nearest Venezuelan embassy or consulate for advice.
You can apply for an extension of up to 90 days before your tourist card and entry stamp expire. Apply and pay the fee at any SAIME (immigration service) office (in Spanish). If you live in Venezuela, you must apply at the main regional SAIME office of the state where you are living.
If you overstay your allowed time, you may be arrested and fined when trying to leave Venezuela.
If you aren’t visiting for tourism, you must get a visa before travelling to Venezuela. It must be related to the purpose and duration of your stay. This includes visits related to work of any nature, whether paid or unpaid, including for:
Non-governmental organisations (NGOs)
journalism
documentary or filmmaking
volunteering
You will also need a visa if you are coming to Venezuela to study or for an internship.
Contact the nearest Venezuelan embassy or consulate for information on how to obtain a visa.
Dual nationality
If you’re a Venezuelan dual national, you must use your Venezuelan identity documents for entry and departure of the country. The authorities may not allow you to depart Venezuela if you are not in possession of a valid Venezuelan passport, as required by law.
Travelling with children   
Children travelling unaccompanied, with a guardian, or with one parent, must provide a travel permit from the non-travelling parent(s). This permit is available from the nearest local SAREN (Servicio Autónomo de Registros y Notarías) office, or the respective Court for Children and Adolescents.
If the child is resident overseas, you can get the permit from the nearest Venezuelan embassy or consulate.
The child should carry this travel permit while travelling within the country and also at time of departure from Venezuela. Children may be denied exit from the country otherwise.
Vaccine requirements
To enter Venezuela from Brazil, you must have a certificate to prove you’ve had a yellow fever vaccination.
For full details about medical entry requirements and recommended vaccinations, see TravelHealthPro’s Venezuela guide.
Customs rules
There are strict rules about goods you can take into or out of Venezuela. You must declare anything that may be prohibited or subject to tax or duty.
You must declare any goods, including personal luggage, worth more than 1,000 US dollars. You may have to pay import tax if your goods appear to be new.
Taking money into Venezuela
Declare cash or travellers cheques worth 10,000 US dollars or more when entering Venezuela. You must pay tax on the excess.
Local banknotes are in short supply. Most people use card payments, bank transfers and US dollars instead. You may need to attempt debit or credit card transactions several times due to poor connectivity.  
If you find your bank cards do not work, you can arrange for friends and family overseas to deposit funds through Western Union and pick up the deposited funds at any Grupo Zoom branch.
