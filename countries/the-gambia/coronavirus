Be prepared for your plans to change
No travel is risk-free during COVID-19. Countries may further restrict travel or bring in new rules at short notice, for example due to a new COVID-19 variant. Check with your travel company or airline for any transport changes which may delay your journey home.
If you test positive for COVID-19 and are asymptomatic you will be expected to self-isolate. Self-isolating at your hotel will be at your own cost. If you develop symptoms you should call 1025. Depending on the severity of your symptoms, you may be asked to attend a medical facility.
Plan ahead and make sure you:
can access money
understand what your insurance will cover
can make arrangements to extend your stay and be away for longer than planned
