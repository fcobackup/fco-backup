International travel
Passengers who have been in the UK within the previous 14 days, including passengers who have passed through the UK in transit, are now permitted to enter Jordan during this period subject to pre-flight and on arrival PCR testing. This also applies if you transit from the UK through a third country to enter Jordan.
British nationals affected by flight cancellations should contact their airlines for further information and for advice on possible alternative flight options via a third country. Please be aware, however, that several third countries have themselves suspended flights to and from the UK and others may follow suit at very short notice.
British nationals who require consular assistance should call the British Embassy on + 962 6 5909200 and follow instructions for consular assistance.
All passengers arriving in Jordan will require a negative PCR test within 72hrs of departure to Jordan and complete a health declaration and passenger locator form.
All passengers need to register on the ‘visitjordan’ platform and follow instructions to either book a PCR test on arrival, or claim a waiver for testing on arrival by uploading evidence that they are fully vaccinated.
You do not need to wait at the airport for PCR test results. You should proceed to your accommodation. The PCR test results will be sent by SMS. Those who test positive with severe symptoms will need to go to a COVID-19 designated hospital for isolation and treatment if required.
