The Foreign and Commonwealth Office (FCO) advise against all travel to Syria. British nationals in Syria should leave by any practical means. Consular support is not available from the British government from within Syria, as all services of the British Embassy in Damascus are suspended and all diplomatic and consular staff have been withdrawn. If you need to speak to a consular officer in the UK, call the FCO in London on +44 (0)20 7008 1500.
The situation remains volatile and dangerous.The Syrian regime does not exercise control of significant parts of Syria, notably in the north west and north east of the country. The regime is conducting a military offensive in north west Syria which has displaced large numbers of civilians and caused significant civilian casualties. Though Daesh, formerly known as ISIL, no longer holds territory in Syria, the group continues to operate as an insurgency and conducts regular attacks, especially in north east Syria. Throughout Syria, local security situations are fragile and can deteriorate into fighting and clashes without warning. A number of chemical weapons attacks have taken place, and the UN estimates that over 400,000 people have been killed in the Syria conflict.
Fighting has at various times caused the temporary suspension of commercial flights, closed roads, impeded access to land border crossing points and led to the closure of some border crossings.
Terrorists are very likely to try to carry out attacks in Syria. See Terrorism. Continued attacks across Syria including in major cities, have left large numbers of people dead or injured.
There is a very high threat of kidnapping throughout Syria. There have been a number of kidnappings, including of British nationals and other Westerners, including by Daesh (formerly referred to as ISIL).
If you choose to travel to Syria against FCO advice, you should make sure you and any dependents have valid exit stamps on your travel documents if you need one and take out comprehensive travel and medical insurance.
