If you have a health condition, or you are pregnant, you may need specialist healthcare abroad. Check whether your destination country can provide the healthcare you may need and ensure you have appropriate travel insurance for unexpected medical evacuation or local treatment.
See the Coronavirus travel health and Healthcare sections in the Coronavirus page for COVID-19 health information.
Other health risks
Diarrhoeal diseases and other gastrointestinal infections are common causes of ill health, becoming worse in the hotter months. Outbreaks of acute watery diarrhoea, measles and other viral infections regularly occur around the year.
The dry dusty conditions in summer and winter can cause irritation to the eyes, throat, nose and skin.
Respiratory tuberculosis is common in the Afghan population.
Malaria is present except in the high mountainous regions of the country and in winter.
Altitude sickness is a risk in parts of Afghanistan. More information about altitude sickness is available from TravelHealthPro.
Local medical care
We advise against all travel to Afghanistan. Only very limited medical facilities are available in Afghanistan and there is no guarantee that any local health care will be available.
At present there is no public ambulance service offered in Kabul or the rest of the country. If you are in need of urgent attention you are advised to speak directly with a local medical practitioner and consider alternative transport options to hospital where safe to do so. You should contact your insurance/medical assistance company promptly if youâ€™re referred to a medical facility for treatment. Ambulance services may request payment or evidence of insurance before providing assistance.
