The cyclone season normally runs from December to April. You should monitor local and international weather updates from French Weather Service (in French) and follow any advice issued by the local authorities. You can also access the International Cyclone Centre for updates.  See our  Tropical cyclones page for advice about what to do if you are caught up in a tropical cyclone.
Volcanic activity is common and there are strict regulations on access to the Piton de la Fournaise volcano.
