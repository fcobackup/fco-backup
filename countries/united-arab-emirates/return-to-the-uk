Coronavirus guidance is being updated.
Read what you can and cannot do

The UAE suspended all inbound and outbound flights at 11:59pm local time on Tuesday 24 March. There are currently extremely limited commercial options available to return to the UK from the UAE.
If you live in the UK and are currently visiting the UAE, you’re strongly advised to return now by commercial means. Don’t run the risk of getting stranded.
You should monitor Emirates and Etihad Airways for details of commercial flights and continue to contact your airline or tour operator regarding any possible return flights. This will ensure any demand is logged in the airlines own assumptions about the number of people waiting to return to the UK.
The British Embassy is in constant contact with the local authorities, airlines and other diplomatic missions to explore all possible avenues.
Future travel options
You will need to pay for your return travel to the UK. If departure options are available but you cannot afford the travel costs and have exhausted all other options for getting funds, you may be eligible to apply for an emergency loan from the government. This is a last resort option and you would need to repay the loan when you are back in the UK.
For more information, you should contact Corporate Travel Management (CTM). CTM are a commercial partner of the FCO and are authorised to administer such loans on behalf of the FCO.
Your journey home
The National Travel Health Network and Centre (NaTHNaC) provides advice on how to stay safe as you travel by air.
When you arrive back in the UK, follow the guidance for when you return to the UK on steps you should take to protect yourself and others.
