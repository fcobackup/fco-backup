Cases of coronavirus (COVID-19) have been confirmed in Chile. The Chilean authorities have introduced a number of measures to limit the spread of the virus including placing movement restrictions and curfews in Santiago and towns and communes around the country.
Some airlines have begun to list certain flights the latter days of April and first weeks of May, mainly to the USA, from which onward flights to the UK are available. Latest flight updates are being posted on the Embassy Twitter and Facebook channels. For information on how to return to the UK from Chile once flights resume, see Return to the UK
Entry and borders
On 18 March 2020 the Chilean Government introduced a prohibition of the entry into the country for non-Chileans. This applies to all nationalities, with the exception of non-nationals with valid residency visas for Chile.
Since 0800 on 15 March, the Chilean authorities have closed all Ports to cruise liners.
Local measures
Chilean President Sebastian Piñera announced a 90-day ‘National State of Catastrophe’ on Wednesday 18 March 2020.
Information on zones in quarantine is available on the Google interactive map.
In those areas in quarantine, people are allowed to leave their residences only under certain circumstances, including for medical reasons, basic services, and public services. If you need to leave your residence for food supplies or medical reasons, you can apply online to the Comisaria Virtual for a permit. Foreigners may use their passport number to access the system. The pages are only in Spanish.
Health inspections
Checkpoints for health inspections are in force at various points around Santiago and elsewhere. In addition to checking the health of persons passing through, these checkpoints will be used to confirm that specific individuals who have been ordered to quarantine by medical authorities are not violating their quarantine. Travellers must obtain a “Health Passport” at www.c19.cl prior to travel and present it at any checkpoint. In addition, sanitary cordons are in place for a number of regions, principally in the south of Chile. It is not possible to leave or enter a sanitary cordon without a “salvoconducto” (police authorization), also obtained via the Comisaria Virtual.
Further information
More information (in Spanish) is available on the Ministry of Health (Ministerio de Salud) website.
