This advice reflects the UK government’s understanding of current rules for people travelling on a full ‘British citizen’ passport from the UK, for the most common types of travel.
The authorities in San Marino set and enforce entry rules. If you’re not sure how these requirements apply to you, contact San Marino’s consulate in the UK.
You will need to travel through Italy to enter San Marino. Read Italy’s travel advice before you visit.
COVID-19 rules
There are no COVID-19 testing or vaccination requirements for travellers entering San Marino.
Passport validity requirements
To travel to San Marino, you must follow the Schengen area passport requirements.
To enter San Marino (and all Schengen countries) your passport must:
have a ‘date of issue’ less than 10 years before the date you arrive. Passports issued after 1 October 2018 are now valid for only 10 years, but for passports issued before 1 October 2018, extra months may have been added if you renewed a passport early
have an ‘expiry date’ at least 3 months after the day you plan to leave
Check with your travel provider that your passport and other travel documents meet requirements. Renew your passport if you need to.
You will be denied entry if you do not have a valid travel document or try to use a passport that has been reported lost or stolen.
Passport stamping
Make sure you get your passport stamped.
If you’re a visitor, your passport must be stamped when you enter or leave the Schengen area (which includes San Marino). Border guards will use passport stamps to check you have not overstayed the 90-day visa-free limit for stays in the Schengen area. If your passport was not stamped, border guards will presume you have overstayed the visa-free limit.
If your passport was not stamped, show evidence of when and where you entered or left the Schengen area (for example, boarding passes or tickets) and ask the border guards to add the date and location in your passport.
At border control in San Marino, you may also need to:
show a return or onward ticket
show you have enough money for your stay
show proof of your accommodation, for example, a hotel booking confirmation or proof of address for a second home
Visa requirements
You will need to apply for a permit if you are staying for more than 30 days or are planning to work. Visit the San Marino website for more information.
Vaccination requirements
At least 8 weeks before your trip, check the vaccinations and certificates you need in TravelHealthPro’s San Marino guide.
Customs rules
The rules about goods that can be brought into and taken out of San Marino are the same as for Italy. You must declare anything that may be prohibited or subject to tax or duty.
