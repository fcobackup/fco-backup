FCDO advises against all but essential travel to parts of Brazil.

This guide also has safety advice for regions of Brazil.
Terrorism
There is a high threat of terrorist attack globally affecting UK interests and British nationals, including from groups and individuals who view the UK and British nationals as targets. Stay aware of your surroundings at all times.
UK Counter Terrorism Policing has information and advice on staying safe abroad and what to do in the event of a terrorist attack. Find out how to reduce your risk from terrorism while abroad.
Terrorism in Brazil
Terrorists are likely to try to carry out attacks in Brazil.
Attacks could be indiscriminate including in places visited by foreigners. You should remain aware of your surroundings, keep up to date with local media reports and follow the advice of local authorities. Targets could include: 
crowded places
public gatherings
On 13 November 2024, two explosions occurred at the Praça dos Três Poderes in central Brasilia. You should exercise caution around major sites in large Brazilian cities.
Protests and civil unrest
Protests, demonstrations and strikes take place regularly in cities across Brazil. Even peaceful events can sometimes turn confrontational and escalate into violence. Police have used rubber bullets and tear gas extensively to disperse protesters.
You should:
avoid political rallies or protests
follow local news reports
comply with the instructions of local authorities
If you encounter a protest or feel uncomfortable in a large gathering, leave the area immediately.
Favelas
Favelas (‘slum’ or ‘shanty town’) are urban neighbourhoods of high-density informal housing. They exist in all major Brazilian cities and can border areas used by tourists and visitors. 
The security situation in many favelas is unpredictable and can be dangerous. Tourists have been shot after accidentally entering favelas.
You should:
avoid all favelas, including favela tours marketed to tourists and any accommodation, restaurants or bars advertised as being within a favela
if you’re using GPS navigation, make sure the suggested route does not take you into a favela
If you’re unsure about a location, check with your hotel or the local authorities.
Crime
If you’re the victim of crime, contact the local police number 190 or the nearest British embassy or consulate.
Read our guidance if you’re the victim of a crime abroad.
Theft and robbery
Robberies are common in many cities, particularly on buses. Thieves target mobile phones, particularly between 4pm and 9pm. Attackers may be armed and under the influence of drugs. Do not resist attackers. If threatened, hand over your valuables without resistance.
Thefts are particularly common on public beaches and include ‘arrastões’ where large groups of thieves run through an area of the beach grabbing possessions. Keep your belongings close and avoid taking valuables to the beach. Do not go on to city beaches after dark.
Pickpocketing is common.
Criminals target large-scale celebrations in Brazil, such as the Carnival in major cities. Be aware of your personal security and surroundings. Be cautious about proposals from strangers that take you away from public areas.
To reduce your risk:
avoid wearing expensive jewellery and watches
avoid carrying large sums of money
avoid using a mobile phone in the street
leave your passport and valuables in a safe place
Criminal Kidnapping 
Short-term opportunistic kidnapping (called ‘express kidnapping’) can happen.  Victims have been kidnapped for a short period of time and driven to an ATM to withdraw money before being abandoned. Express kidnappers may use violence.
Scams
Bank and credit card scams are common, including card cloning from ATMs and in shops. Keep sight of your card and do not use an ATM if you notice anything suspicious.
If you withdraw cash at an ATM and the cash has pink marks on it, speak to the bank (or police) straight away to get it changed. It may have been marked as damaged or counterfeit.
Dating apps have been used by criminals to target foreign nationals in Brazil, leading to spiking of drinks, robbery and theft from bank accounts. Exercise caution when engaging with such apps, buy and keep hold of your own drinks, share your plans with friends or family, and be vigilant of your belongings including your mobile phone.
Sexual assault and drink spiking
Rape and other sexual offences against tourists are not common, but there have been attacks against both women and men. Some have involved date rape drugs. Buy your own drinks and keep them in sight.
If you begin to feel strange, sick or drunk after only a couple of drinks, tell a trusted friend or security staff. They should take you to a safe place, such as your hotel room or a hospital. You can phone the local police, a hospital or the nearest British embassy or consulate for advice.
Read our advice on what to do if you have been raped, sexually assaulted or drugged abroad.
Child sexual abuse
There are cases of sexual abuse of children in Brazil. All sexual activity with children (people under the age of 18) is illegal, regardless of the age of consent locally. If you commit sex offences against children abroad, you can be prosecuted in the UK.
Parental child abduction
Parental child abduction is not common but can happen in Brazil. Dial 190 to report a missing child or go to the nearest police station. Read the guidance on international parental child abduction if your child may be at risk of this.    
Carjacking
Theft from cars is common. Keep valuables out of sight.
Carjacking can happen, particularly on major roads and in tunnels. To reduce your risk:
approach your car with your keys in your hand so you can get into your car quickly
keep doors locked and windows closed
take particular care at traffic lights
be cautious of people approaching to ask for information, especially at night
if driving at night outside the city, avoid stopping at the roadside – if you must stop, try to stop in a well-lit area
Organised crime and militias 
Organised crime groups and militias operate in Brazil, including in many cities. Armed incidents, including police operations, can occur with little warning. Be aware of your surroundings. Avoid favelas and suburbs where possible.
Laws and cultural differences
Personal ID 
Always carry a copy of your passport and another form of photo ID if you have one.
Illegal drugs and trafficking scams
Drug trafficking is widespread in Brazil. Bringing drugs in to or out of Brazil in any quantity is illegal and the penalties are severe.
You should expect a long jail sentence and heavy fines for possessing, using or smuggling illegal drugs, including when transiting through the airport.
British nationals have been targeted through email scams where fraudsters offer a financial reward for travelling to Brazil, where they are then asked to carry items in to or out of Brazil, including to the UK. These items are often illegal drugs. Anyone caught will face detention for drug trafficking, regardless of the circumstances.
Airports in Brazil have excellent technology and security for detecting illegal items, including cannabis. This is also used to scan the baggage of transiting passengers.
Electronic smoking devices
All electronic cigarettes and vaping devices are illegal in Brazil, including refills, parts and accessories.
Customs officials have the authority to confiscate any vape products found in travellers’ luggage (both checked in and carry on) during inspections.
LGBT+ travellers
There is no legislation against same-sex sexual activity in Brazil. Same-sex marriage is legal and LGBT+ couples have equal rights in law.
São Paulo, Rio de Janeiro and other cities hold Pride events, which attract large numbers. These events are usually very peaceful.
Brazil is generally tolerant. However, Brazilian society is quite conservative, particularly outside the larger towns and cities. There are reports of discrimination, violence and harassment against the LGBT+ community. Urban areas are usually more accepting. 
Read more advice for LGBT+ travellers.
Outdoor activities and adventure tourism
Swimming safety
Strong currents can be a danger off some beaches. Get local advice before going in the water. Pay attention to warning flags and the location of lifeguards if present on the beach.
Shark attacks are a danger, particularly on the beaches around Recife in north-east Brazil. Pay attention to warning signs and consult lifeguards if unsure. Sharks have been known to attack in waist-deep water and deaths have occurred.
See water safety on holiday from the Royal Life Saving Society.
Transport risks
Road travel
If you are planning to drive in Brazil, see information on driving abroad.
You can use a UK photocard driving licence to drive in Brazil. If you still have a paper driving licence, you may need to update it to a photocard licence or get the 1968 version of the international driving permit (IDP) as well. You cannot buy an IDP outside the UK, so get one before you travel.
After 180 days, you need to apply for a Brazilian driving licence.
Driving standards
Brazil has a high road accident rate. Driving standards are poor. Take care on the roads and avoid riding bicycles. In many rural areas, roads are in poor condition away from the main highways. Bus and coach crashes are frequent.
Immediately report all accidents to the police: call 190 or go to a police station.
Contact the police if vehicles are obstructing traffic and you need help.
Drink-driving
Drink-driving is a serious offence in Brazil and checkpoints are often set up. If you’re caught driving under the influence of alcohol, you will be prosecuted. Penalties range from fines and a suspension from driving for 12 months, to up to 3 years in prison.
Air travel
If you have been a victim of a passport theft and you need to fly to Brasilia, São Paulo or Rio de Janeiro for consular services, you can travel on domestic flights with a valid photo ID or a police report.   
Check whether your tour operator has concerns about airlines in Brazil.
Sea travel
There have been armed and unarmed attacks on merchant vessels, including British flag vessels off the Brazilian coast and in some Brazilian ports.
Rail travel
There have been instances of theft and robbery on the rail network, including urban metro rail networks. Avoid wearing expensive jewellery and watches or using a mobile phone during train travel.
Extreme weather and natural disasters
Find out what you can do to prepare for and respond to extreme weather and natural hazards.
Heavy rainfall 
The rainy season runs from November until March in the south and south-east of Brazil (including Rio de Janeiro) and from April until July in the north-east of Brazil. However heavy rainfall and flooding can also occur outside of the designated rainy seasons, in any region of the country.
Heavy rainfall often disrupts infrastructure, particularly in rural areas. Flash floods and landslides are common in regions where mountains are close to the coast, such as Rio de Janeiro. This includes in tourist areas. People have drowned when swept away in fast flowing water. Cars and buses have been caught in landslides, resulting in deaths.
Monitor local media and follow local authority warnings which are displayed on digital street signs and sent to hotels and hostels. Follow any instructions given by the local authorities. Avoid travelling on the road during heavy rain. If you are outside when the rain starts, avoid walking in flooded areas, and do not cross fast flowing water, however shallow you think it is.
Forest fires
Forest fires are common from May to September, especially during July and August due to the dry season. They are highly dangerous and unpredictable. Check the latest alerts and weather forecast (in Portuguese) and follow the advice of local authorities if you’re considering travelling to affected areas.
