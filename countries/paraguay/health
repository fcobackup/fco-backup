Facilities for good private medical care exist but are limited to the major cities. Hospitals and GPs will expect immediate payment for medical services. The availability of certain types of medicines cannot be guaranteed. Elsewhere, facilities may not meet acceptable standards. If you need a regular prescription you should bring enough with you.  Make sure you have adequate travel health insurance and accessible funds to cover the cost of any medical treatment abroad and repatriation.

There are regular outbreaks of dengue fever. Rain and flooding can lead to an increase in dengue carrying mosquitoes, leaving affected areas more vulnerable to dengue outbreaks. There have also been reported cases of the chikungunya virus, mainly of local residents returning from affected countries. You should take precautions to avoid being bitten by mosquitoes.
If you need emergency medical assistance during your trip, dial 141 and ask for an ambulance. You should contact your insurance/medical assistance company promptly if you are referred to a medical facility for treatment.
