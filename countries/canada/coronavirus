Cases of coronavirus (COVID-19) have been confirmed in Canada. The Canadian authorities have introduced a number of measures to limit the spread of the virus.
These are likely to affect commercial flight schedules to the UK and we recommend that British travellers who wish to leave Canada make appropriate arrangements to ensure their travel plans can be met.
Non-resident British nationals already in Canada should consider contacting airlines and/or tour operators in order to arrange departure as soon as practicably possible.

Entry and borders
The Canadian authorities are now barring entry to Canada to most foreign nationals, including UK Nationals. This exclusion will not apply to: Canadian citizens and permanent residents or their immediate families, or diplomats.
The Government of Canada has announced that it will close its border with the US to non-essential travel from midnight EST on 20 March. If you need further information about entry requirements, contact the local immigration authorities or the nearest Canadian High Commission, Embassy or consulate. You should also check with your airline or travel company for the latest information.
From 18 March, international flights will be directed to only Toronto Pearson (YYZ); Montreal Pierre Elliott Trudeau (YUL); Calgary International Airport (YYC); and Vancouver International Airport (YVR) to allow for enhanced screening. Flights from the US, Mexico and the Caribbean, and Canadian domestic flights will not be affected by this change. You should check with your airline before you travel.
At the point of departure, air operators will be required to complete a basic health assessment of every passenger. No passengers (regardless of citizenship) who are showing symptoms of coronavirus, will be allowed to board.
All travellers arriving in Canada are being asked to self-isolate for 14 days as a precaution and will have to acknowledge that they have been asked to do so. You should comply with any additional screening measures put in place by the authorities.
Boats and cruise ships carrying more than 500 people will be banned from docking at Canadian ports until July 2020.
Local measures
This includes a ban on large social gatherings and closure of schools, colleges and many public facilities, museums, cinemas and theatres. Some public transport is offering only a limited service. The authorities are urging people to stay at home where possible. You should keep up to date with information from your tour operator, transport or accommodation provider on the impact of any measures introduced by the authorities on existing travel plans.
