Earthquakes
Small tremors are recorded several times a month throughout the year. Most pass without consequences. To learn more about what to do before, during and after an earthquake, visit the website of the US Federal Emergency Management Agency.
On 29 December 2020, a 6.4 magnitude earthquake hit the region of Petrinja near Sisak, in central Croatia, causing extensive damage to buildings and infrastructure and loss of life. Common sense should be used around damaged buildings, which may not always be signposted, to avoid any falling brickwork.
Forest fires
Forest fires are very common during Croatiaâ€™s hot and dry summers. Take care when visiting or driving through woodland and forest areas. If you see a wild fire, call the emergency services on 112. If affected, follow the advice of the local authorities.
In summer months there is a ban on outdoor fires, and barbecues outside of designated areas. Make sure cigarette ends are properly extinguished, do not light barbecues outside of designated areas and do not leave any rubbish, particularly empty bottles behind, as these are known to start fires. Causing a forest fire is considered a criminal offence in Croatia and can attract a prison sentence. Unintentionally causing a fire can result in a large fine.
Floods
Flash floods can occur with very little warning and can lead to dangerous water flows and disruption to transport and other networks. You should keep a close eye on weather forecasts and follow the advice of local authorities.
Monitor media reports and follow the advice of the local authorities if a forest fire, earthquake, floods or other natural disaster occurs in your area.
