This page reflects the UK government’s understanding of current rules for people travelling on a full ‘British Citizen’ passport, for the most common types of travel.
The authorities in Myanmar set and enforce entry rules. For further information contact the embassy, high commission or consulate of the country or territory you’re travelling to. You should also consider checking with your transport provider or travel company to make sure your passport and other travel documents meet their requirements.
Entry rules in response to coronavirus
Entry to Myanmar
New tourist visa applications are currently suspended.
If you are travelling to Myanmar for work, read the guidance on visas and permits as the rules have changed since 1 January 2021.
At present Myanmar authorities can offer business visas to foreign nationals with a compelling case. You or your employer must make your case to your nearest Myanmar Embassy and obtain permission.
These arrangements are subject to change at short notice.
Testing/Screening on arrival
Arrivals to Myanmar must complete and submit a health declaration when they arrive.
Arrivals must also provide evidence of a negative COVID-19 PCR test result. The test should be issued no more than 72 hours prior to the date of departure from the origin airport. You should not use the NHS testing service to get a test in order to facilitate your travel to another country. You should arrange to take a private test. Testing requirements ahead of entry to Myanmar are subject to change. Confirmation should be sought from the relevant Myanmar Embassy or Consulate well in advance of your departure.
Thermal screenings will be carried out on all arrivals by health officials at the airport. Arrivals found to have symptoms of COVID-19 during a screening will be immediately isolated and taken to a medical facility.
Quarantine requirements
Foreign nationals, who have been fully vaccinated by an approved vaccine in Myanmar (see list below) for more than 14 days prior to departure, will be subject to a seven day hotel quarantine on arrival in Myanmar, for which they will need to pay. Arrivals will need to present their vaccination card.

UK Emergency Travel Documents
UK Emergency Travel Documents (ETDs) are not valid for entry into Myanmar. They are accepted for exit from Myanmar but a valid visa has to be added to the ETD once the document is issued.

A visa can take several days to issue and some countries may not allow them on an ETD.
