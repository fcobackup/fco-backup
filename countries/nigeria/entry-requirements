This page reflects the UK government’s understanding of current rules for people travelling on a full ‘British Citizen’ passport, for the most common types of travel.
The authorities in Nigeria set and enforce entry rules. For further information contact the embassy, high commission or consulate of the country or territory you’re travelling to. You should also consider checking with your transport provider or travel company to make sure your passport and other travel documents meet their requirements.
The Nigerian High Commission have announced the resumption of all Immigration Services from 13 April. You should continue to monitor their website for further announcements.
Entry rules in response to coronavirus (COVID-19)
Entry to Nigeria
Contact your airline for the latest information on flights to and from Nigeria.
The Nigerian authorities have advised that British nationals who exceed their authorised visa stays because of travel restrictions linked to coronavirus, will not be penalised for overstaying when they depart. If your visa expired before the start of the lockdown, you will be penalised, for the period up to the start of lockdown.
Testing / Screening on arrival
On 14 September India was removed from the list of restricted countries for travellers arriving in Nigeria. On 15 October Brazil, South Africa and Turkey were also removed from the same list.
Prior to departure, all passengers travelling to Nigeria must register and complete the on-line pre-boarding health declaration at the Nigeria International Travel Portal. They must also have tested negative for COVID-19 within 72 hours of their departure to Nigeria, and have uploaded their PCR test certificate to the on-line Travel Portal. Passengers must carry evidence of the test and result when they travel. Only a COVID-19 PCR test is acceptable to the Nigerian authorities.
From 25 October, fully vaccinated passengers must book and pay for a repeat PCR test for day 2 of their arrival in Nigeria at the Nigeria International Travel Portal, and partially or unvaccinated passengers must book and pay for repeat PCR tests on day 2 and day 7 of arrival – evidence of the booking will be required on arrival. On arrival all passengers will be screened by Port Health Officials and be required to provide full contact details, including their address in Nigeria.
The Nigerian government has said it will closely monitor whether passengers are following the quarantine measures and conducting the repeat PCR test.
You should not use the NHS testing service to get a test in order to facilitate your travel to another country. You should arrange to take a private test.
Quarantine requirements
From 25 October fully vaccinated arrivals will not need to self-isolate, but will need to take a repeat PCR test on day 2. All unvaccinated or partially vaccinated arrivals are expected to self-isolate at one location in the city of their arrival until the result of their second and third PCR tests (which should be taken on day 2 and day 7 after arrival) are known. If both tests are negative individuals can exit self-isolation from day 8 onwards. Anyone that has developed symptoms of coronavirus during their travel or later tests positive will be managed according to national guidelines for COVID-19 treatment. This may require quarantine at a government-monitored treatment centre.
Regular entry requirements
Visas
You should get a valid visa before travelling.
Some business travellers might be eligible to apply for a visa on arrival. Applications for a visa on arrival must be made in advance and applicants must obtain a pre-approval letter from the Nigeria Immigration Service (NIS) before travelling. Guidance on applying for a visa on arrival is available on the NIS website.
If you have a valid Nigerian residence permit (CERPAC or Green Card) you don’t need a visa to enter Nigeria.
For further information on entry requirements, contact the Nigeria High Commission in London.
Passport validity
Your passport should be valid for a minimum period of 6 months from the date of entry into Nigeria.
UK Emergency Travel Documents
UK ETDs are accepted for entry, airside transit and exit from Nigeria providing they are endorsed with the appropriate visa.
