On 12 January, HM Yang di-Pertuan Agong announced a State of Emergency in Malaysia in response to the COVID situation and temporary flooding. This is not expected to have any additional impact on British nationals in Malaysia, but the position might change at short notice.
Visa overstays
On 12 April, the Malaysian Immigration Department announced that those who have overstayed on a social visit pass that has expired since 1 January 2020 must leave the country by 21 April 2021.
On 21 April, the Immigration Department further announced through social media channels that foreign nationals with an expired social visit pass will have to apply for a special pass to enable them to stay in Malaysia while waiting for a flight back to their country of origin. Applicants must make an appointment via the online appointment system (STO) and must attend in person.
British nationals must take a supporting letter from the High Commission, flight tickets, proof of financial ability to cover the cost of living, and proof of latest residential address in Malaysia.
The High Commission can issue a letter for British Nationals to present to Immigration if there are exceptional reasons why they did not leave the country by 21 April. You should email your name and passport number to VisitorSupport@fco.gov.uk.
If you are unable to meet these conditions, the Immigration Department recommends informing the enforcement division at the local immigration office urgently. You will have to provide a flight ticket dated within 30 days of doing so, and pay a fine based on the number of days from 22 April to your departure date. The Immigration Department will then issue the special pass and a ‘Check Out Memo’ (COM). The Immigration Department has noted that foreign nationals who do not obtain the special pass and COM can attempt to leave via exit points after 21 April, but they will be blacklisted. You can contact the Immigration Department on +603 8000 8000, by WhatsApp on +601162511223, use the Online Inquiry System, or email pls_g@imi.gov.my.
The British High Commission is unable to alter the letter issued, or take your case up with Immigration if you are refused an extension or cannot get an appointment. See our section on financial assistance if you are unable to leave the country due to lack of funds. When you return to the UK from Malaysia, you should make sure you follow the rules for entering the UK.

COVID-19 vaccines if you live in Malaysia
Wherever possible British nationals should aim to be vaccinated in the country where they live. As further information is available about the national vaccination programme, this page will be updated. Sign up to get email notifications.
The Malaysian Government has announced all foreign nationals will be included in the vaccine rollout, though details are limited at this point. There will be three phases – expected to be Feb-Apr for frontliners, Apr-Aug for at-risk people, and May-Feb for others. The Malaysian Prime Minister has announced it will be free of charge. If you are a resident in Malaysia you should contact your local healthcare provider for further advice.
The Medicines and Healthcare Products Regulatory Agency (MHRA) is the UK authority responsible for assessing the safety, quality and efficacy of vaccines. It has authorised the Pfizer/BioNTech, Oxford/AstraZeneca and Moderna vaccines for temporary supply and use in the UK. Find out more about MHRA approval for these vaccines.
British nationals living overseas should seek medical advice from their local healthcare provider in the country where they reside. Information about vaccines used in other national programmes, including regulatory status, should be available from the local authorities. This list of Stringent Regulatory Authorities recognised by the World Health Organisation may also be a useful source of additional information.
