From 9 March 2020, all passengers, regardless of nationality or travel history, need to present a medical certificate, issued less than 5 days before departure for French Polynesia, certifying their current state of health.
In the absence of a certificate, the airline will be asked to refuse boarding to the passenger. During the flight all passengers will be handed a Sanitary Control questionnaire by the airline to be handed in by the passenger on arrival to the medical team at the airport. All passengers arriving in French Polynesia on an international flight will undergo temperature control via a thermal camera.
See the TravelHealthPro website for further advice on travel abroad and reducing spread of respiratory viruses during the COVID-19 pandemic.
