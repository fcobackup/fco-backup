The Canadian authorities have introduced a number of travel restrictions in response to the coronavirus (COVID-19) pandemic. These are likely to affect commercial flight schedules to the UK and we recommend that British travellers who wish to leave by air make appropriate arrangements to ensure their travel plans can be met. Non-resident British nationals already in Canada should consider contacting airlines and/or tour operators in order to arrange departure as soon as practicably possible.
The Canadian authorities are now barring entry to Canada to most foreign nationals, including UK Nationals. You should also check with your airline or travel company for the latest information. See Health
Around 724,000 British nationals visit Canada each year. Most visits are trouble free.
Visitors travelling to Canada by air are now expected to get an electronic travel authorisation (eTA) to enter Canada. See Entry requirements
Terrorists are likely to try to carry out attacks in Canada. See Terrorism
Severe snow storms are a regular occurrence during winter. Monitor local news and weather reports and visit Environment Canada. See Local travel and Natural disasters
If youâ€™re abroad and you need emergency help from the UK government, contact the nearest British embassy, consulate or high commission.
Take out comprehensive travel and medical insurance before you travel.
