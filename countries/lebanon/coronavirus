Travel in Lebanon
A nationwide lockdown will come into effect in Lebanon from 5am on Saturday 14 November 2020, until 5am on 30 November to prevent the spread of COVID-19. Movement is prohibited between 5pm and 5am. Hospitality businesses will be closed and public and private gatherings banned. Supermarkets and food shops will remain open during the day and pharmacies and essential health services can continue their usual opening hours. Public institutions and schools will also close, though there are exemptions, including for banks and some ministries and security institutions. Movement of personal vehicles on roadways will be restricted to vehicles with registrations ending in odd numbers on Mondays, Wednesdays and Fridays and even numbers on Tuesday, Thursdays and Saturdays. Driving on Sundays is not permitted. Taxi services will remain open though you are advised to book ahead.
Beirut International airport will remain open, as well as sea and land borders. All passengers are required to have their tickets with them when transferring to and from the airport. Some exemptions to COVID-19 restrictions are applied to aid workers. For further clarification, aid workers should contact the United Nations for advice.
When traveling around Lebanon, including to and from the airport, private cars should have no more than three people in them (including the driver), unless they are all from the same household. Other vehicles should limit passenger numbers to a third of total capacity.
Public and private gatherings such as weddings and funerals have been banned throughout the country until further notice - you should check with organisers before attending any function.
Fabric masks covering the mouth and nose must be worn when outside the home and in vehicles (unless travelling alone, or exercising). Individuals must maintain a safe distance from one another and avoid crowded areas. Those over the age of 65 years old are advised to stay home and not go out unless absolutely necessary.
Lebanese authorities may issue fines, impose road blocks, or imprison those violating these measures for up to three years. You should comply with all measures introduced by the Lebanese authorities and obey the instructions of the security forces. These measures may be changed at short notice.
Keep up to date with information from your tour operator, transport or accommodation provider on the impact on any existing travel plans.
