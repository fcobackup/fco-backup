Crime
Petty crime is common.Take care of bags and valuables in popular tourist areas including Port Louis, Grand Baie and Flic en Flac. Use a hotel safe, where practical. Keep copies of important documents, including passports, separately.
There have been recent reports of burglaries at villas where tourists have been staying. Make sure accommodation and hotel rooms are secure. Avoid renting accommodation that isn’t registered with the Mauritius Tourism Authority. You should read the Safety and Security Measures if you’re staying in rented accommodation.
Most crime is non-violent, but weapons have been used in some burglaries. Although uncommon, there have been some instances of sexual assault on tourists. Avoid walking alone at night on beaches or in poorly lit areas especially in the back streets of the business district of Port Louis.
There have been reports of street robberies near or at ATMs. Take extra care when withdrawing cash.
In 2011, an Irish tourist was murdered in her hotel room at a resort in the north of the Island. The crime remains unsolved. Incidents like this are very rare, but you should remain vigilant.
Avoid doing business with street or beach vendors.

Road travel
You can drive using your UK driving licence, but you must have it with you at all times. The standard of driving varies and there are frequent accidents. Be particularly careful when driving after dark as pedestrians and unlit motorcyclists are serious hazards.
On 21 November 2015 a British tourist was assaulted by bystanders following a minor car accident. If you’re involved in a road accident report it to the police. If you’re worried about your safety at the scene of an accident you should go to the nearest police station straight away.
Water safety
In August 2014, a young British tourist drowned whilst swimming with the dolphins in Tamarin Bay. If you’re taking part in any type of water sports, make sure that the operator holds a valid permit issued by the Ministry of Tourism, there are life jackets on board and the captain has a means to contact the coastguard if necessary.
Sea travel
Recent piracy attacks off the coast of Somalia and in the Gulf of Aden highlight that the threat of piracy related activity and armed robbery in the Gulf of Aden and Indian Ocean remains significant. Reports of attacks on local fishing dhows in the area around the Gulf of Aden and Horn of Africa continue. The combined threat assessment of the international Naval Counter Piracy Forces remains that all sailing yachts under their own passage should remain out of the designated High Risk Area or face the risk of being hijacked and held hostage for ransom.
