Road travel
You can hire a car using a full, clean UK driving licence. Residents should obtain a Kiribati driving licence.
Road conditions are poor on Tarawa, but driving standards are reasonable. Minibuses can be dangerously overloaded at times.
Inter-island travel
Following an outbreak of COVID-19 announced on 22 January, Kiribati has moved to Alert Level 3 of its COVID protocols. This includes the suspension of all public transport and a ban on passengers travelling to or between Kiribati’s Outer islands.
Swimming
Do not swim in the lagoon in south Tarawa as it is highly polluted.
Take great care when swimming in the sea around Kiribati, as there are very strong rip tides along coast and reef areas.
You should wear safety equipment at all times during boating trips. Squalls can occur at very short notice. Some people have drowned in recent years.
Political situation
The Republic of Kiribati (pronounced Kiribas) is an independent republic within the Commonwealth. It is a full member of the United Nations and Pacific Islands Forum. Politics are stable.
Telecommunications
Internet and mobile phone services are available in some parts of Kiribati. Not all of the outer islands are connected however. Telecoms services can be unreliable and expensive due to the country’s remote location.
