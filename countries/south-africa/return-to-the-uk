South African airspace is currently closed to commercial airlines as part of further efforts to contain the spread of coronavirus (COVID-19). It is not yet clear when the South African authorities will permit normal commercial flights to start operating again.
The British High Commission is currently gathering information on British nationals who were planning to return to the UK after 1 May. You can register your details here. You should continue to follow our Travel Advice for the latest information about returning to the UK.
Future options
A programme of ten special charter flights operated between 9 and 17 April, based on demand from British travellers wanting to return to the UK. No further special flights are currently planned from South Africa.
It is not yet clear when the South African authorities will permit normal commercial flights to operate again. We will announce any resumption of commercial flights here. In the meantime, you should continue to follow any guidelines set out by the South African government during the lockdown.
You will need to pay for your return travel to the UK. If departure options are available but you cannot afford the travel costs and have exhausted all other options for getting funds, you may be eligible to apply for an emergency loan from the government. This is a last resort option only available to British nationals and you would need to repay the loan when you are back in the UK. For more information, you should contact contact Corporate Travel Management (CTM) CTM are a commercial partner of the FCO and are authorised to administer such loans on behalf of the FCO.
Accommodation
Those hotels which still have international guests should remain open until their guests are able to leave South Africa. You should ensure you have accommodation for the duration of the lock down, or until you have a confirmed ticket on a special charter flight.
We have published a list of hotels that have told us they can accept British people. We will keep this list up to date.
You can also ring a national hotline: +27 (0)800 029 999 to speak to a professional who will assess your individual need and advise on next steps.
