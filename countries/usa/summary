A number of unprecedented large-scale wildfires are burning across the West Coast states of the USA. California, Oregon and Washington have been particularly badly hit and currently are under a state of emergency. See the Californian Department of Forestry and Fire Protection website for a detailed fire incident map. Incident maps for Oregon and Washington can be found on the Northwest Interagency Coordination Centre website. Fires are also burning in Montana, Idaho and Alaska on a smaller scale. Those in affected areas should monitor local media and weather reports and follow the advice of local authorities, including any evacuation orders and guidance to remain indoors due to poor air quality.
Hurricane Sally is currently in the Gulf of Mexico, and is expected to make landfall in the early hours of Tuesday 15th September. The hurricane is expected to make landfall close to – or just east of – New Orleans (Louisiana), before moving in to Mississippi, Alabama and Georgia. Areas of the Florida panhandle may also be affected. Because Hurricane Sally is slow-moving, a significant amount of rainfall is expected, including storm surge in coastal areas – which will affect areas already impacted by recent storms. You should monitor the progress of approaching storms on the US National Hurricane Center website and follow instructions issued by the local authorities, including any evacuation orders.
