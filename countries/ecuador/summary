On 9 August a presidential candidate was assassinated following a campaign rally in QuitoExtra military personnel are deployed throughout the country to support the Ecuadorean national police to guarantee the security of citizens.

Since March 2023 there have been a series of small explosions and also false bomb threats in both Quito and Guayaquil, linked to organised crime. The explosions resulted in some property damage, but no injuries or deaths. Some threats have been detonated by security forces in controlled explosions. Should an incident occur near where you are, follow the instructions of police and local authorities..
The security situation in the areas of Esmeraldas, Carchi and Sucumbios provinces, which lie outside the 20km border zone can change quickly. If you are travelling to these areas, including Cuyabeno, the Napo river, and the El Angel ecological reserve where there are a number of eco lodges, you should take local advice, pay close attention to warnings issued by the Ecuadorean authorities and be particularly cautious and vigilant. Illegal armed groups and criminal gangs are present in these areas. Travelling during daylight hours and with a reputable operator with official guides, emergency plans and good communication systems will reduce risks. Some lodges are a long distance from the nearest major hospital and helicopter evacuation may be necessary in an emergency. See Local travel
It is more important than ever to get travel insurance and check it provides sufficient cover. See the FCDO’s guidance on foreign travel insurance.
