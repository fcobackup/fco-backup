Terrorists are very likely to try to carry out attacks in Mali, including kidnaps. Attacks could be indiscriminate, including in places visited by foreigners. You should be especially vigilant in places such as hotels, restaurants and places of worship. Be vigilant, keep a low profile and follow the advice of local authorities.
On 18 June 2017, there was a terrorist attack at Le Campement Resort, Kangaba, which resulted in multiple casualties.
On 9 June 2017, the US Embassy in Bamako issued a security message warning of an increased threat of attacks in Bamako.
In November 2015, there was a terrorist attack against the Radisson Hotel in Bamako in which a number of hostages were killed.
There’s a threat of terrorist attacks against large gatherings, including music festivals. The Festival au Désert in Timbuktu was cancelled in January 2017 due to security concerns. Festivals in other parts of the country are vulnerable to attack. See Terrorism
On 21 October 2017 the Malian government extended the state of emergency that has been in existence since November 2015 by a year, until 31 October 2018. You should expect a robust security presence including police patrols and possible police security checks on restaurants and hotels. There are likely to be more vehicle and personal security checks during this time and nobody will be exempt.
You should maintain several days’ stock of food and water in case disturbances take place. You can monitor daily developments in English through the BBC World Service (88.9 FM in Bamako).
If you’re abroad and you need emergency help from the UK government, contact the nearest British embassy, consulate or high commission.
The ability of the small British Embassy to deliver consular services is limited, especially outside Bamako.
Take out comprehensive travel and medical insurance before you travel.
