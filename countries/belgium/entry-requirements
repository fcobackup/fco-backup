The information on this page covers the most common types of travel and reflects the UK government’s understanding of the rules currently in place. Unless otherwise stated, this information is for travellers using a full ‘British Citizen’ passport.
The authorities in the country or territory you’re travelling to are responsible for setting and enforcing the rules for entry. If you’re unclear about any aspect of the entry requirements, or you need further reassurance, you’ll need to contact the embassy, high commission or consulate of the country or territory you’re travelling to.
You should also consider checking with your transport provider or travel company to make sure your passport and other travel documents meet their requirements.
Entry rules in response to coronavirus (COVID-19)
Entry to Belgium
Belgium has reopened its borders for travel to and from the United Kingdom, European Union countries, and the four non-EU Schengen countries (Switzerland, Liechtenstein, Iceland and Norway). Travellers arriving from the UK and non- Schengen EU countries (Ireland, Romania, Bulgaria, Croatia and Cyprus) are required to provide their contact details to the authorities using the Passenger Locator Form. If arriving by plane the form must be printed and filled in before boarding and handed to a border official at the point of entry. If arriving by train or road the form must be emailed to PLFBelgium@health.fgov.be on the day of arrival.
The Belgian Government has introduced a traffic light system of high, medium and low risk regions in the EU, UK and the four non-EU Schengen countries. Travellers entering Belgium from high risk (red) regions in these countries will be required to take a test and to self-isolate for 14 days. Non-essential travel is not permitted to these regions. Leicester is currently the only UK region in the ‘red’ category but you should check the Belgian Ministry of Foreign Affairs website (in English) for the latest information. It is recommended that travellers entering Belgium from ‘orange’ regions take a test and self-isolate for 14 days. The Midlands, North East England, Yorkshire, North West England and Northern Ireland are currently in the ‘orange’ category.
International arrivals from outside the EU, UK and the four non-EU Schengen countries remain subject to entry checks to prevent non-essential travel. UK and EU nationals will be able to enter Belgium from outside the EU, the four other Schengen countries or the UK but will be required to self-isolate for 14 days and provide their contact details to the authorities using the Passenger Locator Form.
Details of entry and exit restrictions are available from the Belgian government.
