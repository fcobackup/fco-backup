From 4 July, Slovenia is exempt from the FCO advice against all non-essential international travel. This is based on the current assessment of COVID-19 risks.
However, the requirement to self-isolate on return to the UK from Slovenia remains in place. See guidance on entering or returning to the UK.
Travel to Slovenia is subject to entry restrictions
There is a 14-day quarantine requirement for anyone of any nationality arriving into Slovenia from countries listed on the National Institute for Public Health “red list”. There are a number of countries on the Red List, including the UK.

Immigration controls may temporarily be in place at some road and rail border crossing points. Full immigration controls are in place at Slovenia’s border with Croatia. You must carry your passport with you at all times. You should monitor local media and check with your transport provider, the Slovenian Automobile Association (AMZS) or Slovenian Railways websites for updates.
All foreign nationals visiting Slovenia must register with the police within 3 days of arrival or risk paying a fine. Hotels and accommodation providers will usually do this as part of the check in procedures. See Local laws and customs
Although there’s no recent history of terrorism in Slovenia, attacks can’t be ruled out. See Terrorism
