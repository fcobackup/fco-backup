Coronavirus travel health
Check the latest information on risk from COVID-19 for Italy on the TravelHealthPro website
See the TravelHealthPro website for further advice on travel abroad and reducing spread of respiratory viruses during the COVID-19 pandemic.
Entry and borders
See Entry requirements to find out what you will need to do when you arrive in Italy.
Return to the UK
When you return, you must follow the rules for entering the UK.
You are responsible for organising your own COVID-19 test, in line with UK government testing requirements. You should contact local authorities for information on testing facilities and ensure the certificate is released in English, French or Spanish.
British Citizens who are unable to return to the UK before the expiry of their visa/permit or the end of their visa-free limit due to COVID-19 restrictions should contact their local immigration office (questura).
Be prepared for your plans to change
No travel is risk-free during COVID. Countries may further restrict travel or bring in new rules at short notice, for example due to a new COVID-19 variant. Check with your travel company or airline for any transport changes which may delay your journey home.
If you test positive for COVID-19, you may need to stay where you are until you test negative. You may also need to seek treatment there.
Plan ahead and make sure you:
can access money
understand what your insurance will cover
can make arrangements to extend your stay and be away for longer than planned
Travel in Italy
There are currently no “orange” or “red” regions but moving to and from “orange” and “red” regions will only be permitted for residents holding a “green certificate”, also known as an EU digital COVID certificate. Italy has not yet confirmed that it will accept the UK solutions for demonstrating your COVID status for entry however, your NHS certificate will be accepted to access leisure and hospitality facilities. Your NHS appointment card from vaccination centres is not designed to be used as proof of vaccination.
It is also possible to obtain a “green certificate” valid for 48 hours after testing negative to antigen or molecular swab tests.
Anyone falsifying a certificate is liable to face a fine of up to €3000 or a prison sentence.
All travellers entering Italy must comply with the regulations of the region they are visiting. Public transport links may be less frequent and seating limited to comply with social distancing measures. Masks must be worn on board public services.
Taxi and car hire options are widely available.
More information on all these requirements is available from the Ministry of Health or the Agency for National Tourism.
Consult the European Union’s Re-Open EU page for rules on travelling within the EU.
Public spaces and services
Many of the restrictive coronavirus measures have now been eased. The following restrictions remain:
The mandatory use of masks in all outdoor spaces where social distancing is not possible, and whilst indoors. Children, under the age of 6, do not need to wear a mask. You should pay close attention to signage when travelling and carry a mask with you at all times
Social distancing of one metre must be observed and gatherings should be avoided
Cinemas, theatres and concert venues are open with limited capacity and pre-assigned seating
Museums and exhibits should be pre-booked at least one day in advance
Limited attendance to outdoor competitive group sports
A “green certificate” is required to attend weddings and religious ceremonies and, from 6 August, a green certificate will be required to access many public spaces including, but not limited to, indoor seating in bars and restaurants, museums, exhibitions, well-being centres, swimming pools, fairs and large events. An NHS vaccination certificate will be accepted to access leisure and hospitality facilities.
Information on regional classifications, or on regional COVID zones is available on the Ministry of Health website (in English).
Regional and local authorities in Italy are empowered to adjust these measures where required, which may occur at short notice. You are strongly advised to consult the websites for the regions in which you are travelling for the latest information. You should also pay close attention to local signage.
You can find more information on measures on the Ministry of Health website (in English) and Frequently Asked Questions on the Ministry of Foreign Affairs website (in English).
Healthcare in Italy
If you need medical advice or believe you have symptoms of coronavirus you should contact your local GP, your local ASL (Azienda Sanitaria Locale) or one of the regional numbers listed on the Italian Ministry of Health website (in English) before visiting a health centre.
Tests for travel can be obtained from a private clinic as well as rapid testing in some pharmacies and, in some regions, drive-in testing is available. You are strongly advised to consult the website for the region from which you are travelling as test facilities vary across regions.
In some Italian regions, you may be required to take a coronavirus test if you spend 48 hours or two consecutive nights in a hospital for any reason. If you test positive, you will be required to quarantine, which may last from 10 days to 3 weeks.
In the case of an emergency you should call Italy’s 112 emergency number. English speaking operators are available.

COVID-19 vaccines if you live in Italy
Wherever possible British nationals should aim to be vaccinated in the country where they live. We will update this page when the Government of Italy announces new information on the national vaccination programme. You can sign up to get email notifications when this page is updated.
The Italian national vaccination programme started in December 2020 and is using the AstraZeneca, Moderna and Pfizer-BioNTech vaccines. British nationals resident in Italy are eligible for vaccination. The Italian Medicines Agency (AIFA) has issued comprehensive information, on the vaccine and the documentation required to book an appointment.
Many regional authorities have launched on-line booking platforms and opened call centres for bookings. Regional requirements vary, with booking platforms requiring you to enter the details of your tessera sanitaria (Italian health card), a codice fiscale or STP card. Some regions are now offering a dedicated vaccination service to those not registered with the Italian health system. You should consult the regional health pages where you live.
An interactive map (in Italian) details a list of vaccine administration points by region.
Find out more, including about vaccines that are authorised in the UK or approved by the World Health Organisation, on the COVID-19 vaccines if you live abroad.
If you’re a British national living in Italy, you should seek medical advice from your local healthcare provider. Information about COVID-19 vaccines used in the national programme where you live, including regulatory status, should be available from local authorities.
If you receive your COVID-19 vaccination in Italy, you can get an EU Digital COVID Certificate from the national authorities. The Certificate proves that you have been vaccinated against COVID-19, received a negative test result, or recovered from COVID-19. It will help facilitate your travel within the EU and, in some countries, you can use it to demonstrate your COVID-19 status to businesses and other organisations. For further information visit the European Commission’s EU Digital COVID Certificate page.
