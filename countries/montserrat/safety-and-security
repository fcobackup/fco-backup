Crime
Crime levels are low, but you should take the same sensible precautions as you would at home. If your hotel does not have a safe, you may need to keep valuables with you.
Air travel
There are two companies offering 4-6 scheduled flights per day, and charter flights from Antigua’s VC Bird International Airport to the John A. Osborne Airport on Montserrat: FLY MONTSERRAT and SVG Air. Flights are on small aircraft capable of carrying up to 9 passengers. Short notice cancellations or changes to the schedule are common, and we recommend you check with the airline in case of delay.
Oversized bags can’t be carried due limited baggage space. Baggage is frequently held on Antigua and travels separately on subsequent flights.
Sea travel
Currently there is no ferry service to Montserrat.
Road travel
Minibuses are available along a number of routes in Montserrat (fares range from EC$5 to EC$7 per journey), but with no regular schedules. Taxis are available and can be booked throughout the day and night. Taxis aren’t metered. Agree the fare in local currency before you set off.
To drive in Montserrat, you’ll need to get a temporary visitor’s driving licence on arrival at the airport or from any police station on production of a valid driving licence and payment of a fee of EC$50. The temporary licence is valid for 3 months. Driving is on the left, as in the UK. There is a speed limit of 20 mph due to multiple hairpin bends. Don’t drink and drive.
Emergency assistance
As Montserrat is a British Overseas Territory there’s no formal British diplomatic or consular representation. The local authorities deal with all requests for emergency assistance.
Emergency assistance is provided by the Office of the Deputy Governor. More information is available on the Government of Montserrat’s website.
