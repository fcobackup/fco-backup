There are still commercial options to return to the UK from Switzerland.
If you live in the UK and are currently visiting Switzerland, you’re strongly advised to return now by commercial means. Don’t risk getting stranded.
UK special charter flights will only operate for priority countries where commercial flights are not possible. You should not assume that these flights will become available in Switzerland because commercial routes are operating. Do not contact the contracted travel management company if no flight is advertised here.
If you’re trying to get back to the UK and need financial help, see the FCO’s guide on financial assistance.
Flights
SWISS are operating commercial flights to the UK. Flights to London and Dublin are available from Zurich and Geneva. Flights will be reinstated to Manchester from 15 June.
You should check the carrier’s website for the latest flight schedule and availability.
Transit
If you are transiting Switzerland from elsewhere in the world, you are strongly advised to have your onward travel booked in advance.
You should also check the travel advice for any country that you will transit on the way back to the UK.
Travelling to the airport
Rail
Swiss Federal Railways (SBB / CFF/ FFS) are operating standard timetables, including to airports.
International rail services from Switzerland to neighbouring countries have been suspended until further notice. You may be able to take cross-border regional connections as an alternative.
Road
If you plan to return to the UK by road, it is possible to transit through neighbouring countries if:
you have evidence of your onward journey and
do not show symptoms of illness that could indicate a coronavirus infection
An example of ‘acceptable evidence’ would include a confirmed ferry or Eurotunnel booking to the UK.
Travel via France
If you are planning on travelling through France to return to the UK, the French government have implemented their own measures, including required documents for travel into, and transit through, France. If you are planning to use this route, check the latest travel advice for France ahead of your journey.
As with other forms of transport, many cross-Channel operators are operating substantially reduced services for passenger traffic. Passengers should check with their operator before departing, and may still be subject to severe disruption.
Future travel options
You will need to pay for your return travel to the UK. If departure options are available but you cannot afford the travel costs and have exhausted all other options for getting funds, you may be eligible to apply for an emergency loan from the government. This is a last resort option and you would need to repay the loan when you are back in the UK.
For more information, you should contact Corporate Travel Management (CTM). CTM are a commercial partner of the FCO and are authorised to administer such loans on behalf of the FCO.
Your journey home
The National Travel Health Network and Centre (NaTHNaC) provides advice on how to stay safe as you travel by air.
If you’re returning home before 8 June, follow the guidance for when you return to the UK on steps you should take to protect yourself and others. From 8 June there will be new rules for entering the UK.
