Coronavirus travel health
Check the latest information on risk from COVID-19 for Azerbaijan on the TravelHealthPro website
See the TravelHealthPro website for further advice on travel abroad and reducing spread of respiratory viruses during the COVID-19 pandemic.
International travel
Azerbaijan does not require you to produce a negative COVID-19 test to depart the country. However, you should check any testing requirements of the airlines that you are boarding, the country you are travelling to, as well as any countries you may be transiting to see what testing requirement they may have to enable you to travel. You should seek to have any test results you need to produce to fly received via email and printed off, or a paper certificate.
A list of laboratories testing for Coronavirus accredited by the State Health Agency (TABIB) can be found on the Azerbaijan Airlines’ (AZAL) website.

Be prepared for your plans to change
No travel is risk-free during COVID-19. Countries may further restrict travel or bring in new rules at short notice, for example due to a new COVID-19 variant. Check with your travel company or airline for any transport changes which may delay your journey home.
If you test positive for COVID-19, you may need to stay where you are until you test negative. You may also need to seek treatment there.
Plan ahead and make sure you:
can access money
understand what your insurance will cover
can make arrangements to extend your stay and be away for longer than planned
Public places and services
There are currently no restrictions on travel around Azerbaijan. All businesses and services are open. Almost all public places are only accessible for those with a ‘COVID-19 Passport’ showing proof of vaccination or immunity. Supermarkets and chemists are exempt. British nationals vaccinated through the Azerbaijani vaccination programme can access a ‘COVID-19 Passport’ via the local medical authorities (TABIB). Travellers to Azerbaijan, who have a ‘COVID-19 passport’ issued from their country of residence, can also present this either in a digital format, or as a printed certificate, to gain access to public places. Azerbaijan classifies someone as being vaccinated only if they have had their second vaccination or booster vaccination within the past 6 months. If someone can prove they have contracted COVID within the past 6 months that is also acceptable. The detail and application of COVID-19 rules can change at short notice. You should regularly check the latest requirements and ensure you have documentation of full vaccination from either the local medical authorities or your country of residence.
There is no longer a requirement to wear masks either indoors or outdoors from 1 May.
The Baku Metro and public transport services within Baku are running as normal. Most long distance train services remain suspended.
Local lockdowns
Local lockdowns could be applied at very short notice. You should monitor local news outlets regularly for the latest updates.
Accommodation
Hotels are open in Azerbaijan.
Healthcare in Azerbaijan
A number of medical facilities are allocated specifically for coronavirus patients. Most people are given the option to self-isolate or be treated at home. Only those with the most serious symptoms are usually taken to hospital, but this will depend on individual circumstances. For instance, visitors to Azerbaijan who don’t have accommodation available for self-isolation may also be taken to hospital. If you think you might have symptoms of coronavirus you should call 103 or 804.
