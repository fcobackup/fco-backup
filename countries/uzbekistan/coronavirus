International travel
Commercial flights to and from Uzbekistan are currently suspended.
The only international flights currently operating are ad hoc special commercial flights. Foreign nationals currently resident in Uzbekistan are able to depart on these flights.
The British Embassy in Tashkent has been informed that a special commercial charter flight from Tashkent to Frankfurt may depart on 23 July (this is not confirmed). Any British nationals who wish to depart on this flight should contact the embassy using the following e-mail address: stayincontact.uzbekistan@fco.gov.uk
Travel in Uzbekistan
Civilian airports are open but scheduled international passenger flights are not operating at the present time. Some domestic flights are operating.
Public transport has been suspended until 1 August 2020 however taxis will operate to Tashkent International Airport.
Restrictive measures had previously been eased, with the country being divided into red, yellow and green zones with differing restrictions in each. However, following a second spike in infections, the entire country has been re-categorised as a ‘Red Zone’.
Use of private vehicles is permitted only between from 07:00 – 10:00 and from 17:00 – 20:00, and only for essential purposes such as going to/from work or buying food or medication. Permission is required for use of private vehicles outside of these hours, though private travel will be permitted in the case of medical emergencies.
Care should be taken if using taxis as some operators might not be fully complying with COVID-19 hygiene measures.
Inter-regional travel is prohibited other than for vehicles transporting agricultural produce and specifically authorised private vehicles. Exception made to travel from Tashkent to Tashkent region and vice versa for private vehicles only from 07:00-10:00 and from 17:00-20:00.
Under measures introduced by the Uzbek authorities, anyone subject to quarantine or self-isolation who breaches such controls is liable to a minimum fine of 11 Million UZS (approximately £900) or up to 10 years imprisonment.
Accommodation
Hotels (other than those designated for use as quarantine locations), motels and guest houses are closed.
Public places and services
Persons aged over 65 are banned from public spaces. Gatherings of more than three people in any public place are prohibited. Between 23:00 – 07:00 citizens are prohibited from any movement in public unless for medical reasons (this includes visits to pharmacies). The government has recommended that all citizens remain in their homes and self-isolate over the weekends of 18 to 19 July and 25 to 26 July. Further restrictions on transport will be in place over the course of these weekends.
Security force checkpoints are in place across the country. All shopping malls, clothing markets and larger shops have now been closed.
You must wear a face mask while outside – you may be fined (up to approximately £100) if you do not comply with this regulation.

Individuals who are showing COVID-19 symptoms will undergo testing at government facilities.
From 5 July, those testing positive for COVID-19 will be placed into Red, Yellow and Green categories. Those with a light form of coronavirus infection (asymptomatic) will be categorised as Green. Those with medium symptoms (e.g. high temperature) will be categorised as Yellow, and those with serious symptoms as Red.
Those categorised as Green or Yellow will be allowed to have treatment at home if this is approved by a doctor and will be required to comply with existing sanitary-hygiene rules. Those categorised as Green or Yellow and where treatment at home is not possible will be hospitalised in a dedicated government facility, but released after 10 days if no further symptoms are observed.
