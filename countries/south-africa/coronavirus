You can spread the virus even if you don’t have symptoms.

South Africa has put measures in place to limit the spread of coronavirus (COVID-19).
For information on how to return to the UK from South Africa, see Return to the UK
The South African authorities have published coronavirus advice and have introduced a number of measures to limit the spread of the virus, which particularly affect British nationals, and those travelling from the United Kingdom and other countries deemed ‘high risk’. Failure to do so could result in a fine or arrest.
Travel Restrictions
South African airspace is closed to commercial airlines as part of efforts to contain the spread of Coronavirus (COVID-19). It is not yet clear when normal commercial flights will be allowed to start operating again. See Return to the UK.
All ‘non-essential domestic travel’ continues to be prohibited. Internal flights are no longer running. You must wear a mask if using public transport, which will operate with strict hygiene requirements and reduced passenger numbers.
The South African authorities have told us that people who exceed their 90-day stay, or the duration of their temporary residence visas, as a result of travel restrictions linked to COVID-19 will not be penalised as over-stayers. See Entry Requirements.
Lockdown
On 23 April, President Ramaphosa announced that the South African government would be introducing a new risk-based, five-level approach to changes to lockdown restrictions. The President announced that on 1 May South Africa would move from the current level 5 to level 4. The level of restriction in place may differ by province and district. You should follow advice from the local authorities about what restrictions apply where you are.
Everybody in South Africa must currently stay at home, except to buy essential food or medicine. Only certain categories of workers are currently exempt. All social gatherings and inter-provincial travel are still prohibited. The President has encouraged everyone to wear a face mask in public.
You should continue to comply with any guidelines set out by the South African government during the lockdown.
Medical
If you take regular medication, you should ensure you have a sufficient supply for the full duration of South Africa’s lockdown period. Pharmacies are classified as an essential service, and will remain open. Most medicines that require a prescription from a doctor in the UK will require one in South Africa. If necessary, you should obtain an electronic prescription from your medical practitioner to enable a local doctor to write one. Ask your insurer, or your accommodation provider to help you find one. See Health
Visas
All British nationals are now required to apply for a visa to enter South Africa. Visas will not be issued for British nationals who have been in countries South Africa considers high risk for coronavirus since 15 February 2020. These include the UK, China, Germany, Iran, Italy, the Republic of Korea, Spain, the USA, France and Switzerland. This list of countries could change at short notice. No visas will be granted during the lockdown period.
The South African government has indicated that those British nationals who are currently in South Africa on a work, study, or other long-term visa may currently remain, under the terms of that visa. If they leave South Africa, they will not be permitted to return on the same visa, and will need to reapply for a new visa. British nationals with Permanent Residency in South Africa can leave and re-enter South Africa but must carry documentation with them proving their permanent residency rights. South African residents returning to South Africa from the UK or another high risk country will be placed under quarantine for 14 days on arrival.
If you entered South Africa on a 90-day stamp, which has not yet expired, you do not require a visa to leave South Africa.
Since the introduction of restrictions to international flights, the South African authorities have announced that people who exceed their 90 day stay, or the validity of their temporary residence visas, as a result of travel restrictions linked to COVID-19 will not be penalised as over-stayers when they depart. See Entry Requirements.
The South African authorities have told us that British travellers wishing to transit South African international airports en route back to the UK may do so without a visa, as long as they stay airside, unless they have been in the UK or another ‘high-risk’ country since 15 Feb 2020. UK nationals are no longer able transit South African airports en route to third countries, if travelling from the UK or another ‘high risk’ country.
Ask your nearest South African Embassy or High Commission if you are unsure whether this affects you.
Health screening at ports and airports
Screening processes have been introduced at all major ports of entry, including airports, for arrivals, departures and transit passengers. You should comply with any additional screening measures put in place by the authorities. Screening may include temperature measurements and checks on recent travel to affected areas.
If port health officials believe you should be tested for coronavirus, you will be taken to a nearby hospital designated for receiving and testing suspected cases. If tested positive, you may be placed into quarantine or asked to self-isolate depending on your circumstances.
If you are identified as in need of testing, or if quarantine or further treatment is required, you should contact your insurer, and speak to health officials, to understand where the quarantine or treatment should take place. Private hospitals in South Africa are prepared to treat coronavirus, and the standard of care may be higher than in government hospitals. See local medical care
Our experience suggests that only people who are showing symptoms of coronavirus are able to get a test, at both private and public hospitals.
