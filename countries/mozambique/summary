Terrorists are likely to try to carry out attacks in Mozambique. There has been an increasing intensity of attacks in areas of Cabo Delgado province dating back to January 2019. Militants have used explosives, machetes and firearms to conduct lethal attacks, as well as burning vehicles and homes. There are reports of an increased security presence in the province, including road blocks, and there are regular clashes between militants, armed vigilante groups and Mozambican security forces. There is also a threat of kidnap in Mozambique, which is particularly acute in northern districts of Cabo Delgado province. See Terrorism
Cabo Delgado Province was affected by heavy rains and flooding in late December 2019. Monitor local reports, check your routes before travelling and follow the advice of local authorities. You can monitor local and international weather updates from the World Meteorological Organisation.
Mozambique was affected by two major tropical cyclones during the 2018-19 rainy season, which had a major impact on the people and infrastructure of Sofala, Manica, Nampula, Tete, Zambezia and Cabo Delgado provinces. Critical infrastructure has been restored and main roads are open. However, not all bridges have been repaired and travel in the rainy season may therefore be restricted. If you’re travelling to affected areas, you should plan ahead, check routes before travelling and follow the advice of the local authorities.
Coastal areas have a risk of tropical cyclones during the rainy season (November to April). Widespread flooding can also occur around river basins, especially the Zambezi. See Natural disasters
Most visits to Mozambique are trouble-free, but violent crime does occur and there have been cases of criminal kidnappings. You should take extra care. See Crime
Traffic accidents are common due to the condition of the roads, poor driving and vehicle standards. Always drive carefully and be aware of pedestrians using the roads. If you’re travelling by road make sure you have relevant documents with you at all times and monitor local media for traffic updates. See Road travel
Piracy remains a significant threat in the Gulf of Aden and Indian Ocean. See Sea travel
Consular support is limited in parts of Mozambique where the FCO has existing advice against all but essential travel (see above). If you’re abroad and you need emergency help from the UK government, contact the nearest British embassy, consulate or high commission.
