The information on this page covers the most common types of travel and reflects the UK government’s understanding of the rules currently in place. Unless otherwise stated, this information is for travellers using a full ‘British Citizen’ passport.
The authorities in the country or territory you’re travelling to are responsible for setting and enforcing the rules for entry. If you’re unclear about any aspect of the entry requirements, or you need further reassurance, you’ll need to contact the embassy, high commission or consulate of the country or territory you’re travelling to.
You should also consider checking with your transport provider or travel company to make sure your passport and other travel documents meet their requirements.
Entry rules in response to coronavirus (COVID-19)
Entry to Hungary
From 1 September, Hungary has closed its border to most foreign nationals due to the coronavirus pandemic. There are some limited circumstances in which foreign nationals, including UK nationals, may be allowed entry.
Residents or family
UK nationals may enter Hungary if they hold a permanent residence permit or a permit allowing them to stay in Hungary for at least 90 days, and can present their documents to the authorities at the border. UK nationals travelling with a family member who is a Hungarian citizen or resident should also be allowed entry.
Others
UK nationals may also enter Hungary if they are travelling in the following circumstances:
transiting through Hungary through travel corridors – see below,
operating cargo transport,
people able to prove credibly that have recovered from Covid-19 within six months of their travel,
as part of a military convoy,
people travelling on diplomatic or official passports.
Transiting through Hungary
You must be able to prove your destination, the reason you are travelling and that you are able to transit to your final destination. Throughout the transit you can only use specified routes (more information is available in Hungarian), dedicated petrol and rest stations and specific border crossing points.
Pre-travel exemption
It is also possible to apply to the authorities for an exemption to enter Hungary in a further set of specific circumstances. To enter on this basis, you must gain permission in advance of travelling. You will need to show that you are travelling to Hungary for:
court proceedings,
business activities justified by central government, demonstrated with a letter of invitation issued by an administrative body, an independent regulatory body or an autonomous public administration body,
accessing healthcare with a referral,
studying or taking an exam, with certification from an education institution,
travelling to the point of departure for cargo-related transit,
participation in family events, e.g. marriage, baptism, funeral,
care of a relative,
participation in a sporting, cultural or church event of major international importance,
any other justifiable reason.
You should apply for an exemption in advance using the online form on the police website. While the forms are in the Hungarian, you may complete your submission in Hungarian or English.
Entry rules may change at short notice. You can find the latest announcements on the Hungarian government website (in English).
Testing / screening on arrival
All people entering Hungary will be subject to a temperature check on arrival. Unless resident in Hungary, foreign nationals will be denied entry should they show signs of Covid-19.
Most people entering Hungary must agree to enter mandatory quarantine, usually at home. If the person has no place of residence in Hungary, they must enter quarantine at a government-designated location. Quarantine is legally enforceable and fines can be levied for breaking the rules.
It is possible to leave quarantine early following two negative Covid-19 within 5 days of each other but at least 48 hours apart. Your local environmental health office will need to give permission for you to leave quarantine for testing, and also to end quarantine early once you can show evidence of two negative test results. A list of environmental health offices in Budapest can be found here (in Hungarian); you must contact the office covering your place of residence. There is no single registry of environmental health offices outside Budapest; you will need to carry out an internet search for your local ‘Népegészségügyi Osztály’.
The government’s webpage (in Hungarian) has a list of medical centres where testing is available. Some offer home testing.
Regular entry requirements
Visas
If you hold a British Citizen passport, you don’t need a visa to enter Hungary. If you’re planning a stay of longer than 3 months, see our Living in Hungary guide and contact the Hungarian Embassy if you have further questions.
The rules on travel will stay the same until 31 December 2020.
Passport validity
Your passport should be valid for the proposed duration of your stay; you do not need any additional period of validity on your passport beyond this.
The rules on travel will stay the same until 31 December 2020.
UK Emergency Travel Documents
UK Emergency Travel Documents are accepted for entry, airside transit and exit from Hungary.
Fines
Entry into Hungary can be barred if you have failed to pay a previous fine in Hungary. Contact the Hungarian Embassy in London for guidance on paying any outstanding fines before you next enter Hungary.
Customs regulations
Community regulations ensure the free movement of goods between EU member states. This means that no customs procedures are required for exporting goods from Hungary to another EU member state and/or for importing goods from a member state to Hungary. The export and import of goods purchased for non-commercial purposes (for personal use or as gifts) while travelling is not restricted, however, the transport of certain goods (such as: pets, hunting weapons, alcohol and tobacco products, medicines containing drugs, etc.) within the European Union is restricted or subject to special permissions.
Check the customs regulations before entering or leaving Hungary on the National Tax and Customs Administration of Hungary website.
