Honduras has closed its land, air and maritime borders for the transit of people.
UK special flight
On 1 May, the FCO operated a special flight from Honduras to help British tourists, short-term visitors and their direct dependents return to the UK. There are currently no further special flights organised from Honduras. The British Embassy continues to work closely with the Honduran authorities, international governments, and airlines on all possible options for British Nationals still in Honduras who wish to return to the UK.
