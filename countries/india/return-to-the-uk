Coronavirus guidance is being updated.
Read what you can and cannot do

India’s land borders are closed and international flights are suspended until at least 17 May 2020. There are currently no commercial options available to leave India. There is no guarantee that flights will begin straight away once the lockdown is lifted, so if you have booked a flight with a commercial airline during May 2020 you should be prepared for the possibility that the flight will not operate.
UK special flights
The UK government has arranged charter flights until 15 May. There are currently no further flights planned, but we will keep this under review.
British nationals normally resident in the UK, and non-British nationals who are immediate dependent family members of British nationals they will be travelling with, are currently being prioritised for these flights.
Your eligibility, including your UK address, will be checked before your tickets are issued.
Vulnerable British nationals will continue to be prioritised for these flights.
Vulnerable non-British UK residents with Indefinite Leave to Remain (ILR), and other foreign nationals, may be accommodated if there is sufficient capacity.
The CTM booking websites have now closed. If you registered for a flight before the booking website closed, you have been placed on a waiting list. Those on the waiting list who are eligible to fly will be contacted directly by our travel partner CTM when their booking is confirmed and sent information on how to get to airports and flight itineraries.

Medical clearance
The state Government of Kerala has advised any foreign nationals who have been in quarantine or self-isolation must have a medical clearance certificate before they can board outbound international flights. You must contact your local COVID 19 District Cell to begin the medical clearance process.
Travel to the airport
Do not travel to the airport without a confirmed ticket, as tickets will not be on sale at the airport.
Once you have a ticket for a UK government charter flight, you will receive guidance on how to travel to the airport:
The British High Commission will provide transport to the airport for passengers of UK government charter flights where possible, and submit the necessary permissions to the Indian government. The address that you provide will be where you are picked up from (unless you are asked to meet at a muster point), so you must provide accurate information.
Due to ongoing restrictions in India, do not make your own way to the airport for a UK government charter flight, unless in exceptional circumstances we are not able to arrange transport for you.
You should allow plenty of time to get to the airport or your muster point as travelling may be more difficult than normal. You should make sure you are able to show authorities proof of a booked flight (a boarding pass if possible) and your passport.
It may not be possible to buy food or water on the way to the airport, so get these before you travel.
At the airport
You will not be able to travel if you are currently showing coronavirus symptoms (you will need to self-isolate and travel later). There will be mandatory healthcare screening at the airport. You should comply with any additional screening measures put in place by the authorities prior to your departure. If you travel to the airport when you have symptoms, you may be moved to a mandatory quarantine facility for further testing.
Your journey home
If passengers present symptoms on the plane, cabin crew will follow Public Health England guidance on how to manage the risks to others. The National Travel Health Network and Centre (NaTHNaC) provides advice on how to stay safe as you travel by air.
When you arrive back in the UK, follow the guidance for when you return to the UK on steps you should take to protect yourself and others.
