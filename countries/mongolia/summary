The Foreign, Commonwealth & Development Office (FCDO) advises against all but essential travel to the whole of Mongolia based on the current assessment of COVID-19 risks.
Travel to Mongolia is subject to entry restrictions
Entry to Mongolia for foreign nationals is restricted, including by the current ban on commercial flights, though there are occasional charter flights. Anyone entering Mongolia must hold a valid long-stay visa (such as a work permit), permanent residency, or obtain a short-term (up to 60-day) business visa. You must also abide by local rules on COVID-19 testing, vaccinations, quarantine and self-isolation. You should contact your nearest Mongolian Embassy for the latest information and details on charter flight availability.
See Entry requirements for more information before you plan to travel.

During the COVID-19 pandemic, it is more important than ever to get travel insurance and check it provides sufficient cover. See the FCDO guidance on foreign travel insurance.
For information about COVID-19 vaccines, see the Coronavirus page.
All scheduled commercial flights have been cancelled but there are occasional charter flights leaving Mongolia. See Return to the UK
Around 6,500 British nationals visit Mongolia annually. Most visits are trouble-free.
Mongolia takes border security very seriously and foreign nationals aren’t routinely permitted access to border areas. The authorities can regard zones of up to 100km inside the border as a border area. If you wish to travel in these areas, you must get permission from the State Frontier Guard Authority. Only a few specified land border crossings are open to foreigners. See Border crossings
Although there’s no recent history of terrorism in Mongolia, attacks can not be ruled out. See Terrorism
Avoid going out on foot alone at night. Foreigners stand out and can be targeted for attack because of their comparative wealth. See Crime.
If you’re abroad and you need emergency help from the UK government, contact the nearest British embassy, consulate or high commission.
