This page gives you guidance on how to stay safely in Vietnam as a visitor, if you are unable to return to the UK.
Everyone should comply with the measures put in place in Vietnam to limit the spread of coronavirus (COVID-19).
Moving around in Vietnam
Local measures
On 7 May the Vietnamese Prime Minister announced the further relaxation of COVID-19 restrictions . The principles of social distancing remain including people being required to wear masks in outside offices and schools. Most shops and services are now open. Schools are reopening.
Travel within Vietnam is getting back to normal, although there are still occasional health checks entering some provinces. Larger gatherings, such as sports and religious events are now allowed subject to all preventative measures being applied.
Internal flights are increasing in number but remain below pre-COVID-19 levels.
There may be some variation of relaxation of lock down measures between cities and provinces and also within parts of some cities.
You should be alert to local variations, take a precautionary approach and be ready to comply with local authorities.
Quarantine and testing
Widespread quarantine requirements are in place for anyone who may have come in to contact with coronavirus. The Vietnamese government has confirmed that it will cover quarantine costs, but foreign nationals will be personally responsible for paying for any coronavirus hospital treatment costs, and hotel costs from periods of self-isolation.
Vietnamese quarantine centres are basic, and most do not meet Public Health England standards.
If you come in to contact with someone who has tested positive for coronavirus you must expect to undergo quarantine in a government centre. It lasts a minimum of 14 days and longer if you test positive at any point. In addition, if you test positive, you will be treated in a Vietnamese hospital, following which you will be expected to undertake a period of self-isolation. You should expect to be tested at least 5 times prior to release, and will be required to produce 3 consecutive negative tests during quarantine and a further two consecutive negative tests during self-isolation.
Once you have completed quarantine and self-isolation you should receive a document specifying this. You should keep this, as you may need to present it customs/airport officials when you leave Vietnam.
Vietnam’s quarantine requirements are mandated by the Vietnamese Ministry of Health. The British Embassy and Consulate General are unable to intervene in having these requirements waived, shortened or changed. Violations carry strict penalties. Should you have serious reservations about undertaking quarantine in Vietnam, if required for health or other reasons, you are strongly advised to return to the UK as soon as possible.
Vietnam is increasingly using community testing as a means to provide assurance that COVID-19 is not being transmitted undetected. Should you be asked to undertake testing, you should comply. Failure to comply can be an offence with significant punishments.
You are strongly advised to familiarise yourself with these risks before travelling.
Accommodation
There have been some instances of British nationals being turned away from, or asked to leave, hotels in Vietnam.
Visas
Vietnamese authorities have shown flexibility in extending visit visas (or visa waivers) for people who have been unable to leave Vietnam due to the COVID-19 situation (e.g. because of hospitalisation or being in quarantine), and who have rebooked to leave Vietnam in the immediate future.
The Embassy and Consulate General can assist if you have been directly impacted by COVID-19 problems (e.g. hospitalisation or being in quarantine) and are returning imminently to the UK. The Embassy will not be able to assist with individual visit visa extensions should you wish to stay in Vietnam, nor sponsor individual applications or sign NA5 forms (which has the same effect) as this involves legal and financial obligations.
The British Government has agreed with the Vietnamese Immigration Department that any passport held by a British national with an expiry date of 1 January 2020 onwards, or with less than 6 months validity, will now be recognised as expiring on 31 December 2021 when submitted for the purpose of renewing a visa or residence permit. See Recognition of extended expiry of passports.
