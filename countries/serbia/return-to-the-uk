All airports in Serbia are currently closed to scheduled international passenger flights, but it is currently planned for airports to reopen for commercial flights on 18th May (subject to change). All border crossings for road, rail and river transport are formally closed, but it is possible to cross borders under certain conditions (including freight traffic). These measures, and those taken by neighbouring countries, mean there are no commercial means of leaving Serbia to return to the UK by air, road, rail or river until 18th May at the earliest.
We know this is concerning for British people trying to leave Serbia. The UK government is working closely with airlines, the Serbian authorities and other governments. We expect some commercial flights to the UK to resume on reduced schedules once airports reopen, currently planned from 18th May, but these plans remain subject to change.
General advice about flights
If you have booked, or are looking to book, flights between Serbia and the UK in May, you should be aware that there is no guarantee of when flights will resume and cancellations are possible. We recommend that you contact your airline for the latest information.

You will need to pay for your return travel to the UK. If departure options are available but you cannot afford the travel costs and have exhausted all other options for getting funds, you may be eligible to apply for an emergency loan from the government. This is a last resort option and you would need to repay the loan when you are back in the UK.
For more information, you should contact Corporate Travel Management (CTM). CTM are a commercial partner of the FCO and are authorised to administer such loans on behalf of the FCO.
