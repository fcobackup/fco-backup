At least 8 weeks before your trip, check the latest country-specific health advice from the National Travel Health Network and Centre (NaTHNaC) on the TravelHealthPro website. Each country-specific page has information on vaccine recommendations, any current health risks or outbreaks, and factsheets with information on staying healthy abroad. Guidance is also available from NHS (Scotland) on the FitForTravel website.
General information on travel vaccinations and a travel health checklist is available on the NHS website. You may then wish to contact your health adviser or pharmacy for advice on other preventive measures and managing any pre-existing medical conditions while you’re abroad.
The legal status and regulation of some medicines prescribed or purchased in the UK can be different in other countries. If you’re travelling with prescription or over-the-counter medicine, read this guidance from NaTHNaC on best practice when travelling with medicines. For further information on the legal status of a specific medicine, you’ll need to contact the embassy, high commission or consulate of the country or territory you’re travelling to.
While travel can be enjoyable, it can sometimes be challenging. There are clear links between mental and physical health, so looking after yourself during travel and when abroad is important. Information on travelling with mental health conditions is available in our guidance page. Further information is also available from the National Travel Health Network and Centre (NaTHNaC).
Coronavirus
There is an ongoing outbreak of coronavirus (COVID-19) in China, some other countries in the region and elsewhere. The Lesotho authorities have introduced a number of precautionary measures to limit the spread of the virus.
All travellers arriving in Lesotho will be screened for coronavirus. Anyone showing symptoms of coronavirus may be placed in an isolation facility. You should comply with any additional screening measures by the authorities if asked to go through extra checks.
Individuals who have been in coronavirus affected areas within the past 14 days, including the UK, may be required to self-isolate for 14 days.
If you need further information about entry requirements, contact the local immigration authorities or the nearest Lesotho High Commission. You should also check with your airline or travel company for the latest information.
Further information on coronavirus, including advice on preparing for foreign travel and helping reduce the spread of the virus, is available from Public Health England and on the TravelHealthPro website.
Medical treatment
Lesotho has basic medical facilities. Expatriates use medical facilities in Bloemfontein, South Africa, a 90-minute drive (140km) from Maseru. Make sure you have adequate travel health insurance and accessible funds to cover the cost of any medical treatment abroad, including evacuation by air and repatriation.
If you need emergency medical assistance during your trip, dial 121 and ask for an ambulance. You should contact your insurance/medical assistance company promptly if you are referred to a medical facility for treatment.
