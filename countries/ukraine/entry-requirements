The information on this page covers the most common types of travel and reflects the UK government’s understanding of the rules currently in place. Unless otherwise stated, this information is for travellers using a full ‘British Citizen’ passport.
The authorities in the country or territory you’re travelling to are responsible for setting and enforcing the rules for entry. If you’re unclear about any aspect of the entry requirements, or you need further reassurance, you’ll need to contact the embassy, high commission or consulate of the country or territory you’re travelling to.
You should also consider checking with your transport provider or travel company to make sure your passport and other travel documents meet their requirements.
Restrictions in response to coronavirus
Entry and borders
Upon arrival, all non-exempt foreign nationals are required to provide proof of health insurance that covers COVID-19 observation and treatment for the duration of their stay. Insurance must be purchased from a company registered in Ukraine or a foreign company that has a representative office or an insurance partner in Ukraine.
From 8 June 2021, all non-exempt foreign nationals must also provide proof of one of the following in order to enter Ukraine:
A negative PCR test, taken no more than 72 hours in advance of their arrival in Ukraine.
A rapid test for COVID-19 antigens (RAT), taken no more than 72 hours in advance of their arrival in Ukraine.
An official document confirming the receipt of a full course of vaccination against COVID-19 with vaccines included in the WHO list of approved vaccines for emergency situations.
Ukraine’s State Border Service has said that the document confirming vaccination can be in digital or paper form and must contain:
the full name and surname, date of birth, gender, citizenship, passport or ID card number, and signature of the recipient of the vaccine;
the name of the vaccine, date of administration, name of the producer and serial number;
the name of the illness against which the person is vaccinated
the signature and stamp of doctor who carried out the vaccination.
Demonstrating your vaccination status from the UK is not formalised for entry into Ukraine, so you should follow alternative advice for entry into Ukraine. Your NHS appointment card from vaccination centres is not designed to be used as proof of vaccination and should not be used to demonstrate your vaccine status.
These requirements do not apply to children under 12 years of age.
It is not possible for non-exempted foreign nationals to take a PCR test once inside Ukraine, or self-isolate, in order to avoid the requirement for a pre-arrival negative PCR/RAT test or prior vaccination. Foreign nationals do not therefore need to self-isolate on arrival and do not need to download the Diia Vdoma app.
According to the resolution 1236 (9 December 2020) of the Ukrainian Government (Cabinet of Ministers), as updated on 22 March 2021, certain categories of foreign nationals are exempt from the insurance and PCR/RAT testing or vaccination requirements: foreign nationals who are: residents of Ukraine; recognised as refugees; accredited diplomats in Ukraine, or members of accredited diplomats’ families; air, sea, and land transport crews; or military personnel from NATO or “Partnership for Peace” countries taking part in exercises with the Ukrainian military.
From 2 May 2021, Ukraine is restricting entry from India. Foreign nationals will not be permitted to enter Ukraine if they arrive from India or have spent more than 7 of the preceding 14 days in India. There are exemptions for permanent residents of Ukraine, spouses or children of Ukrainian citizens, and diplomats and their families. See the VisitUkraine website and type India into the list of countries box for more details.
The final decision on a person’s eligibility to enter Ukraine rests with the Ukrainian State Border Service. The entry requirement policies of foreign governments are imposed and enforced at their discretion.
Transiting Ukraine
Foreign nationals transiting Ukraine are required to provide proof of health insurance that covers COVID-19 observation and treatment for the duration of their stay. Insurance must be purchased from a company registered in Ukraine or a foreign company that has a representative office or an insurance partner in Ukraine.
Quarantine requirements
Foreign nationals with a valid negative PCR test do not have to self-isolate on arrival in Ukraine. It is not possible to self-isolate as an alternative to the requirement to take a PCR test before arrival.
Ukrainian citizens (including those with dual nationality) and foreign residents of Ukraine must self-isolate on arrival for 14 days, unless they take a PCR test and receive a negative result no more than 48 (not 72) hours before arrival in Ukraine. Residents or Ukrainian nationals arriving in Ukraine without a negative PCR test must install the Dii Vdoma tracking app for their 14-day self-isolation. The 14 day self-isolation can be terminated early by taking a PCR test and receiving a negative result
Self-isolation on entry to Ukraine can be completed at your chosen address using the “Dii Vdoma” mobile app. You need to have a Ukrainian mobile phone number with the SIM card activated before you arrive in the country, though the SIM does not need to be in your phone on arrival. When using the app, you must respond promptly to notifications sent to your mobile (in Ukrainian).
More information about the app is available on the Cabinet of Ministers website or the Visit Ukraine webpage. Make sure that you understand the regular reporting requirements before taking up this option. People who do not register with the Dii Vdoma app, or who do not abide by its terms, are required to complete quarantine at a government-approved observation centre.
Travellers arriving in Ukraine or crossing the administrative points from non-government-controlled parts of Donetsk and Luhansk oblasts and Crimea will be subject to health monitoring on arrival. You should comply with any additional screening measures put in place by the authorities.
Further information about visiting Ukraine during the quarantine period can be found at the Ukrainian authorities’ Visit Ukraine webpage.
Regular entry requirements
Visas
British Citizen passport holders can enter Ukraine without a visa for visits of up to 90 days within a 180-day period. Ukraine has confirmed that this policy will continue to apply to British citizens until 30 January 2022.
Although there are no penalties for British citizens overstaying under the visa-free regime during quarantine (providing they leave within 30 days of quarantine ending), anyone who has overstayed will not be able to return to Ukraine for 90 days after leaving the country.
If you’re planning to stay in Ukraine for longer than 90 days in a 180 day period, you need to get a visa. For more advice on entry requirements contact the Ukrainian Embassy in London or Consulate General in Edinburgh.
You don’t need to complete an immigration card. Immigration officials may require you to scan your fingerprints as part of biometric data collection at border crossing points. For more details, visit the website of the State Border Guard Service of Ukraine
Proof of financial means
You may be asked to provide evidence that you have sufficient funds to support you during your stay. The Ukrainian authorities accept the following as a proof of sufficient funds: cash, bank cards along with bank statements, accommodation bookings, tourist vouchers, a letter from the person or company you’re visiting stating that they will cover your expenses, a return ticket or onward travel ticket. You can find more information on the websites of the Ukrainian Embassy in the UK and State Border Service of Ukraine.
Passport validity
If you’re travelling without a visa, your passport should be valid for the proposed duration of your stay. No additional period of validity beyond this is required.
If you’re applying for a visa, your passport may need to have an additional period of validity. Check with the Ukrainian Embassy in London for further details.
Borders
It’s illegal under Ukrainian law to enter internationally recognised Ukrainian territory through a border point that isn’t currently controlled by the Ukrainian authorities. If you do so, you risk arrest or a fine, and you may be subject to a travel ban.
International border crossings that aren’t currently under the control of the Ukrainian authorities include all land border crossings into Donetsk oblast, many of the land border crossings into Luhansk oblast, all air and sea ports in Crimea and the Kerch Bridge road and rail crossing into Crimea.
If you intend to visit any of the areas not controlled by the Ukrainian authorities, you should apply to the State Migration Service of Ukraine for a special entry permit. Information on border crossing procedure, entry/exit regulations and checkpoints are provided at the State Border Guard Service of Ukraine website.
UK Emergency Travel Documents
UK Emergency Travel Documents are accepted for entry, airside transit and exit from Ukraine.
Customs regulations
You can find general information about importing and exporting items on the website of the State Fiscal Service of Ukraine (in Ukrainian).
There are strict customs regulations governing the export from Ukraine of antiques and items of historical interest. If in doubt seek prior permission from the customs authorities: telephone: (+38 044) 454 16 13, e-mail: idd@sfs.gov.ua
