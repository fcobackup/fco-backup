Travelling from and returning to the UK
Check what you must do to travel abroad and return to England, Scotland, Wales or Northern Ireland.
If you plan to pass through another country to return to the UK, check the travel advice for the country you’re transiting. If you will pass through a red list country, book your hotel quarantine package before travelling to the UK.
Air carriers are free to operate direct flights to the UK from their usual airports in Turkey. Check their websites for the latest flight schedules.
You are responsible for organising your own COVID-19 test, in line with UK government testing requirements. You should contact local authorities for information on testing facilities.
If you test positive on your pre-departure test, as soon as you receive the result, you will be directed to a state-run quarantine facility by the local health administration.
Be prepared for your plans to change
No travel is risk-free during COVID. Countries may further restrict travel or bring in new rules at short notice, for example due to a new COVID-19 variant. Check with your travel company or airline for any transport changes which may delay your journey home.
If you test positive for COVID-19, you may need to stay where you are until you test negative. You may also need to seek treatment there.
Plan ahead and make sure you:
can access money
understand what your insurance will cover
can make arrangements to extend your stay and be away for longer than planned

Travel in Turkey
HES codes for intercity travel and lodging
From 6 September, Turkish citizens and residents must have proof of either two Covid vaccinations or recent Covid recovery (linked to the HES code) or a negative PCR test (within 48 hours) for all domestic travel by planes, and inter-provincial travel, including buses, trains or other public transportation vehicles. The above does not apply to those without Turkish citizenship or residency in Turkey, although it is advisable to carry your NHS COVID Pass (or similar official evidence of full vaccination) with you, in case of confusion. An HES (Hayat Eve Sigar) Code for domestic and international flights, train and ferry travel is also required.
In addition, the HES code will be required when checking into accommodation including hotels, motels, boarding houses, pensions, camps etc. Some provinces also require submission of a HES code upon entry to public buildings, shopping malls and banks. This does not apply to foreign tourists. This can be done through the e-Devlet system, the ‘Hayat Eve Sığar’ smartphone application and by SMS.
IF YOU HAVE A TURKISH RESIDENT ID: Send a text message to phone number 2023 that includes (a) the letters “HES”, (b) your Turkish kimlik number (c) your year of birth, and (d) the number of days you will be traveling, plus 7 days. Put a single space between each item.
IF YOU HAVE TURKISH CITIZENSHIP: Send a text message to phone number 2023 that includes (a) the letters “HES”, (b) your Turkish kimlik number (c) the last four digits of the series number of your ID, and (d) surname, the number of days you will be traveling, plus 7 days should be used. Put a single space between each item.
Airlines also have information on their websites in English about the HES code, including:
SunExpress
Turkish Airlines
Pegasus
Public spaces and services
Provinces in Turkey are split into four tiers by COVID-19 risk: low, medium, high and very high. A map of Turkey illustrating these tiers is available from the Ministry of Health. This information will be updated regularly and you should check the status of your intended destination before travelling.
The wearing of masks is mandatory at all times outside the home throughout Turkey. This includes, but is not limited to, all public places, including streets, side streets, parks, gardens, picnic areas, markets, sea side and public transportation including Metro, buses, taxis and ferries. Masks are also mandatory in all shops, restaurants, hairdressers and barber shops.
From 6 September, Turkish citizens and residents must have proof of either two Covid vaccinations or recent Covid recovery (linked to the HES code) or a negative PCR test (within 48 hours) for entry to cinemas, concerts and events, as well as for intercity or inter-provincial domestic travel.
Turkish citizens and residents need HES codes (see the ‘Travel in Turkey’ section) to enter shopping centres.
Turkey will accept the UK’s proof of COVID-19 recovery and vaccination record. If you are travelling with a printed PDF proof of vaccination status, it must date from 1 November to ensure that the certificate can be scanned successfully, if domestic certification is required. Your NHS appointment card from vaccination centres is not designed to be used as proof of vaccination and should not be used to demonstrate your vaccine status.
Healthcare in Turkey
You should ensure that you are prepared for any unplanned or extended stays due to changes in COVID-related restrictions or your travel arrangements. If you take regular medication, make sure you have adequate supplies to cover you in case you are required to quarantine as a result of a positive COVID test.
British-issued prescriptions are not accepted in pharmacies in Turkey, although some medicines may be available over the counter.
If your medical supplies do run out whilst in Turkey it may be possible, in some cases, to liaise with Turkish hospitals and your GP to arrange for a Turkish prescription for the equivalent medicine. For contact details for English speaking doctors visit our list of healthcare providers.
Your emotional and mental wellbeing is important. Read guidance on how to look after your mental wellbeing and mental health.

COVID-19 vaccines if you live in Turkey
We will update this page when the Government of Turkey announces new information on the national vaccination programme. You can sign up to get email notifications when this page is updated.
The Turkish national vaccination programme started in January 2021 and is using the Pfizer-BioNTech and Sinovac vaccines. The Government of Turkey has stated that British nationals resident in Turkey are eligible for vaccination if they choose to join the programme. If you have not yet registered with the Turkish health service you should do so through the Enabiz website.
The details of foreign nationals may not automatically be included in the system which sends out automatic appointments. Even if you are already registered on the Enabiz system, you may still need to request a vaccine through the Enabiz website.
Find out more, including about vaccines that are authorised in the UK or approved by the World Health Organisation, on the COVID-19 vaccines if you live abroad.
If you’re a British national living in Turkey, you should seek medical advice from your local healthcare provider. Information about COVID-19 vaccines used in the national programme where you live, including regulatory status, should be available from local authorities.
