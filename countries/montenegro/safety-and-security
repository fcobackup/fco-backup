Terrorism
There is a high threat of terrorist attack globally affecting UK interests and British nationals, including from groups and individuals who view the UK and British nationals as targets. You should remain vigilant at all times.
UK Counter Terrorism Policing has information and advice on staying safe abroad and what to do in the event of a terrorist attack. Find out how to reduce your risk from terrorism while abroad.
Terrorism in Montenegro
Terrorist attacks in Montenegro cannot be ruled out. Attacks could be indiscriminate, including in places visited by foreigners. Terrorists may target religious sites, including churches.
Political demonstrations
Protests and demonstrations sometimes take place in Montenegro, often in front of government or religious buildings. They are mostly peaceful but can lead to traffic disruption, clashes with police and the potential for violent incidents.
Crime
Protecting your belongings
Take sensible precautions to protect yourself and your belongings from street crime. Do not leave valuables unattended. Use a hotel safe if possible.
Violent crime
Incidents of violent crime between organised criminal groups can happen. Be cautious, remain vigilant and aware of your surroundings. In the event of any incidents, follow all advice given by the local authorities.
Laws and cultural differences
Personal ID
You must always carry a valid form of ID e.g. a driving licence, passport or equivalent, otherwise you may be fined. Keep a photocopy of your passport in a safe place.
Illegal drugs and prison sentences
Drugs laws are similar to the UK. There are strict penalties and lengthy prison sentences for possession of or trafficking of drugs.
Using cameras in secure areas
Taking photographs of police or military installations, personnel or vehicles is illegal and could lead to arrest and prosecution by the local authorities.
LGBT+ travellers
While there is a general tolerance towards same-sex couples in Montenegro, LGBT+ travellers should be aware that showing affection in public, for example, could result in unwanted attention due to the conservative nature of society in Montenegro. Read more advice for LGBT+ travellers.
Outdoor activities and adventure tourism
Take precautions to prevent injuries and use protective equipment. Before signing up with paragliding instructors, ask to see their training licence for tandem flights. Make sure you have the appropriate licence and insurance when renting outdoor activity vehicles, such as jet skis and quad bikes. Insurance should cover your itinerary, planned activities and expenses in an emergency.
Hiking and mountaineering
If you’re hiking in the mountains:
get expert advice from local guides
don’t underestimate the hike, factors like weather, landscape, distance and elevation
take a fully charged mobile phone and enough supplies with you
Hikers have got lost in the mountains when they have left marked paths. If you get into trouble, call the emergency number 112
Transport risks
Road travel
If you are planning to drive in Montenegro, see information on driving abroad and read the RAC guide.
Road standards
The standard of roads is fair to poor with conditions worsening in rural areas, especially in the winter and after bad weather. The 2-lane Moraca Canyon in Montenegro can be dangerous when conditions are poor and there is overcrowding. Roads leading to Montenegro’s coastal areas are in better condition but can be overcrowded during the summer season.
Traffic laws
Exceeding the speed limit by 10kph will get you a fine, while excessive speeding (30kph over the limit in towns and 50kph on motorways) and overtaking under dangerous conditions will lead to automatic confiscation of your driving licence. Fines for traffic offences range from 20 to 6,000 euros. Prison sentences can also be imposed.
If you are issued with a fine, you may be able to pay the police officer by credit card, if the police vehicle is equipped with a POS terminal. If not, you should go to a bank or post office to pay the fine within 8 days and before leaving the country. Unpaid fines for foreign nationals are recorded on a database. If you wish to appeal, you have the right to appear in court. All fine receipts have serial numbers and can be monitored in a central register for 3 years.
If you are involved in a small traffic accident, you can request a police investigation at a cost of 50 euros. This fee is reimbursable from the person found guilty of causing the accident after completion of the court proceedings. Drivers can opt to complete a European accident report and submit it to their insurance company without a police investigation.
Sea travel
If you are sailing to Montenegro, enter only at a designated port or harbour. If this is not possible, contact the local harbour master (in Montenegrin only) or the police before entering.
If you have experienced an accident at sea, call 129, the emergency number of the rescue unit within the Maritime Safety Department (in Montenegrin).
Extreme weather and natural disasters
Forest fires
Wildfires are common in Montenegro from April to October due to the dry/hot weather. Wildfires are highly dangerous and unpredictable. You should:
take care when visiting or driving through woodland areas
make sure cigarette ends are properly extinguished
not light fires or barbecues
not leave any rubbish
If you see a forest fire, call the emergency services on 112.
Flooding
Flooding can be a problem when there is heavy rain and snow melts, causing rivers to flood in winter and spring.
Earthquakes
Montenegro lies in a seismically active zone and small tremors are recorded throughout the year. Serious earthquakes are less frequent but do happen. The last serious earthquake was in 1979. The US Federal Emergency Management Agency’s website tells you about what to do before, during and after an earthquake.
Monitor media reports and follow the advice of the local authorities if forest fire, earthquake or flood occurs in your area.
