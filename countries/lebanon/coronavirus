Travel in Lebanon
When traveling around Lebanon, including to and from the airport, private cars should have no more than three people in them (including the driver), unless they are all from the same household. Other vehicles should limit passenger numbers to a third of total capacity.
Fabric masks covering the mouth and nose must be worn when outside the home and in vehicles (unless travelling alone, or exercising). Individuals must maintain a safe distance from one another and avoid crowded areas. Those over the age of 65 years old are advised to stay home and not go out unless absolutely necessary.
Lebanese authorities may issue fines, impose road blocks, or imprison those violating these measures for up to three years. You should comply with all local measures introduced by the Lebanese authorities and obey the instructions of the security forces. These measures may be changed at short notice and localised lockdowns may be introduced.
Keep up to date with information from your tour operator, transport or accommodation provider on the impact on any existing travel plans.

Some public markets, banks, pharmacies, hotels, restaurants, beaches, swimming pools, nurseries, gyms, public parks and gardens, pubs and nightclubs, summer camps and other facilities are starting to re-open but you should check in advance.
