There are currently limited commercial options available to return to the UK from Pakistan. The government of Pakistan has extended the suspension of scheduled international flights until 11:59pm PST on 15 May.
We know this is concerning for British people trying to leave Pakistan. The UK government is working closely with airlines, the Pakistan authorities and other governments to make sure options are available for you to return to the UK as soon as possible.
UK special charter flights
The UK government is currently operating special charter flights from Pakistan for British nationals who normally live in the UK, and their direct dependants, to return to the UK. Our commercial partner Corporate Travel Management (CTM) is managing flight bookings.
Following the 20 to 27 April flights, there will be a second round of direct charter flights from 30 April to 7 May, including a flight from Karachi. The cost of a ticket from Islamabad and Lahore is £522 and from Karachi is £498.
If you are a British national on a short-term visit to Pakistan and you wish to return to the UK, you should register on the registration portals below now, if you have not already done so. All registration portals will close on 1 May and there is no guarantee that there will be further flights after these.
The 30 April Karachi flight has departed. No further flights from Karachi are currently planned. If you require urgent consular assistance, please contact us as set out in the ‘Travel advice help and support’ section.

How to register
To register, you will need:
a valid passport, and to be able to meet the entry requirements of the UK
contact details for each traveller you are registering
your UK home address and postcode
your means of payment, such as credit or debit card details
You must pay in advance to confirm that you are definitely planning to travel to the UK.
Payment does not guarantee you have a confirmed seat, only that there is availability on the route. Before payment, read carefully the eligibility criteria for the charter flights. If you have already paid but are not eligible, or if you are not allocated a seat, you will receive a full refund.
If you are eligible and have paid, you will receive a confirmation email with your flight times at least 24 hours before the flight. Do not travel to the airport without a confirmed ticket, as tickets will not be on sale at the airport.
