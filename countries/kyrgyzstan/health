Before you travel check that:
your destination can provide the healthcare you may need
you have appropriate travel insurance for local treatment or unexpected medical evacuation
This is particularly important if you have a health condition or are pregnant.
Air quality 
Air quality in Bishkek has deteriorated due to pollutants into the air, particularly during the winter months. Try to minimise your exposure to outside air by staying in an air-conditioned indoor place as much as possible, with windows and doors closed and well-sealed.
Regularly damp-dust all indoor surfaces, washing your hands afterwards. Monitor local reports and weather forecasts for the latest information and advice.
Emergency medical number
Call 103 and ask for an ambulance.
Contact your insurance company quickly if you’re referred to a medical facility for treatment.
Vaccine recommendations and health risks
At least 8 weeks before your trip:
check the latest vaccine recommendations for Kyrgyzstan
see where to get vaccines and whether you have to pay on the NHS travel vaccinations page
See what health risks you’ll face in Kyrgyzstan.
Altitude sickness is a risk in parts of Kyrgyzstan. Read more about altitude sickness on TravelHealthPro.
There have been several cases of anthrax, mainly in the south due to insufficient vaccination of animals. 
Medication
The legal status and regulation of some medicines prescribed or bought in the UK can be different in other countries.
Read best practice when travelling with medicines on TravelHealthPro.
Basic medicines including painkillers are available without a prescription. Most UK prescriptions are accepted in Kyrgyzstan, but you should phone a Kyrgyz pharmacy in advance to check. You may need to get your UK prescription translated into Russian or Kyrgyz. You can get a translation in Kyrgyzstan – find an interpreter or translator.
Some prescription medications are not widely available. Medications often come under different brand names, so ask for the drug’s generic name. If your medication is not available, you may be able to get it couriered from Russia or Turkey, though this could take time.
You may need to pay cash for medication.
Healthcare in Kyrgyzstan
The quality of medical care in Kyrgyzstan is not as high as the UK. Medical facilities are often badly equipped and unhygienic, with a limited supply of drugs. There is no guarantee that equipment will have been properly sterilised, especially in rural hospitals. Avoid all but basic or essential treatment in the event of an emergency. Make sure you have adequate travel health insurance and accessible funds to cover the cost of any medical treatment abroad and repatriation.
There is no reciprocal healthcare agreement between the UK and Kyrgyzstan.
FCDO has a list of medical providers in Kyrgyzstan where some staff will speak English.
