This page reflects the UK government’s understanding of current rules for people travelling on a full ‘British Citizen’ passport, for the most common types of travel.
The authorities in St Kitts and Nevis set and enforce entry rules. For further information contact the embassy, high commission or consulate of the country or territory you’re travelling to. You should also consider checking with your transport provider or travel company to make sure your passport and other travel documents meet their requirements.
Entry rules in response to coronavirus (COVID-19)
If you are not a St Kitts & Nevis national or resident, you must be fully vaccinated to enter St Kitts and Nevis. “Fully vaccinated” means having received two doses of the vaccine more than 14 days prior to arrival (or one dose for one-dose vaccines).
All travellers, including returning nationals, tourists or international travellers must submit a COVID-19 Reverse Transcription Polymerase Chain reaction Laboratory-Based Molecular Test (RT-PCR Test) done within 72 hours of travel at an ISO 17025/CLIA accredited laboratory. On receiving a negative result, travellers should visit https://www.knatravelform.kn/, complete the embarkation form and upload their test results and evidence of vaccination.
Travellers will be able to take a PCR test on arrival at their Travel Approved hotel (cost $US150 for non-nationals, $US for nationals). The list of approved hotels can be found on the St Kitts Tourism travel requirements page. Results are usually available within 24 hours. Whilst waiting for results, visitors are allowed to move freely around the hotel. On receipt of a negative test result, travellers will be free from quarantine and will be able to visit attractions and travel around St Kitts and Nevis normally.
The above also applies to non-vaccinated children under 18 travelling with vaccinated parents or guardians.
Unvaccinated nationals and residents must quarantine for 9 days and be administered a COVID-19 test on the 9th day with a negative result before being released into the general public. If you’re unvaccinated, you must use the COVID-19 approved taxis at the airport for transport to your quarantine site. This also applies to children between the ages of 12 and 17. Children under 12 who are travelling with their parents will be subject to the same rules as their parents. Travellers should regularly check the St Kitts Tourism Authority websites, St Kitts Tourism and Nevis Tourism Authority for updates and information on pre-travel authorisation, documentation required, permitted hotels and other travel requirements. Changes may take effect at short notice.
Demonstrating your COVID-19 status
