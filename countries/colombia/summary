The second round of the presidential election will take place in Colombia on Sunday 19 June 2022.  Colombian authorities will deploy large number of security personnel throughout the country in an effort to ensure a peaceful electoral process. The Colombian National Police Director General announced on 14 June that the police will be on “maximum alert” after detecting plans by radical groups to reject the results of the election vote and commit acts of violence across the country (including major cities).
There is the potential for demonstrations and visible police presence during the campaigns leading up to, on the day and in the days immediately following the election. These demonstrations can be confrontational and may turn violent. A number of people have been killed and injured in recent protests.
