Travel in Portugal
The state of emergency declared on 18 March in response to the coronavirus outbreak ended on 2 May. Portugal now uses a system of regional states of alert in response to the changing situation.
Confinement is mandatory if you are:
suffering from or infected with coronavirus (COVID-19), or
being actively monitored by the health authorities for COVID-19 symptoms
You must observe the rules on social distancing and hygiene:
Social distancing of 2 metres
Obligatory use of face masks in enclosed spaces
Good hand hygiene
Observance of the rules on maximum capacity
Local and inter-regional travel is permitted in Portugal.
If you use public transport, avoid travelling at peak times and ensure you disinfect your hands before and after your journey. Buy your ticket in advance online or from a vending machine at the station. Maintain your distance from other passengers as much as possible.
Taxis are operating. Use the back seat, open the window, if possible, and respect the rules on maximum capacity. Avoid paying in cash, where possible. Facemasks are mandatory for everyone over the age of 10 on all forms of public transport and private hire.
You can be fined up to €500 if you breach the regulations
Public spaces and services
Mainland Portugal
Except for the Greater Lisbon Metropolitan Area, mainland Portugal is currently in a state of alert. Subject to the rules on social distancing and hygiene, most shops and services, restaurants, cultural venues, leisure parks and sports facilities are open.
Beaches are subject to measures on capacity and social distancing. Check these measures and beach occupancy levels on the Portuguese Environment Agency website or download the “Info Praia” app.
Drinking alcohol in public places, except for pavement cafés and restaurants, is banned. Restaurants close at 1am; last orders are at midnight.
Gatherings are limited to 20 people, except for religious ceremonies and family events, such as weddings and christenings. Attendance at funerals is limited to the space available at each cemetery or crematorium.
Greater Lisbon Metropolitan Area
The Greater Lisbon area is in a state of contingency. In addition to the above measures, tighter restrictions are currently in place:
private and public gatherings are limited to 10 people
shops and services open at 10am and close at 8pm, with the exception of restaurants, supermarkets, chemists, sports facilities, petrol stations, health and veterinary clinics
the sale of alcohol is banned at service stations and after 8pm in shops and supermarkets
On 13 August, the government devolved authority to individual municipalities in the Lisbon Metropolitan area to decide on opening and closing times for shops and services in their area of responsibility. You may therefore find that shops and services in some of the 18 Lisbon municipalities open before 10am and close after 8pm.
Changes to the state of alert from 15 September
From 15 September, mainland Portugal will enter a state of contingency. This will bring the country in line with the measures currently in place in the Greater Lisbon Metropolitan area.
Madeira and the Azores
The regional governments of Madeira and the Azores have implemented similar de-escalation measures. You can consult full details (in Portuguese) of the regional governments’ de-escalation plans on the Government of the Azores and Government of Madeira websites.
The use of a face mask is obligatory in enclosed spaces, such as the airport, shops, supermarkets, restaurants and on public transport.
On the islands of Madeira and Porto Santo, face masks must also be worn in both enclosed public spaces and while outdoors. This applies to everyone over the age of 10. You will not be required to use a face mask when driving, exercising, while on the beach or walking the recommended routes in forest and mountain areas. For more information, see the Madeiran Tourist Office website.
The Azores
The regional government has extended its regional states of alert until 1 September. The islands of Santa Maria, São Miguel, Terceira, Pico and Faial are in a state of calamity. The islands of Graciosa, São Jorge, Flores and Corvo are in a state of alert.
On the island of São Miguel, tighter restrictions are in place until further notice due to localised outbreaks of COVID-19:
Nightclubs are closed
Bars and pubs close at 10pm
Between 10pm and 6am, service stations can remain open only for the sale of fuel.
Accommodation
Most hotels, holiday apartments, private villas and campsites have reopened. If you are booking accommodation, check it meets the required hygiene and cleaning standards and look out for the Portuguese Tourist Board’s “clean and safe” certification.
