This page reflects the UK government’s understanding of current rules for people travelling on a full ‘British Citizen’ passport, for the most common types of travel.
The authorities in Argentina set and enforce entry rules. For further information contact the embassy, high commission or consulate of the country or territory you’re travelling to. You should also consider checking with your transport provider or travel company to make sure your passport and other travel documents meet their requirements.
Restrictions in response to coronavirus
Borders and travel
Argentina’s borders are closed to non-resident foreign nationals. Some exceptions apply to this rule. Exemptions based on humanitarian grounds may be granted by the Argentine Migrations Office. If you believe you might fall into this category, you must contact the Argentine Migrations Office (Migraciones) to seek approval for your trip.
Direct family members of Argentine nationals and of residents of Argentina can be allowed into the country for a temporary visit (for a permanent stay you must apply for a visa at your nearest Argentine Consulate). If this applies to you, you will have to show a copy of your Argentine/resident relative’s ID (DNI) and a legalised (apostilled) birth or marriage certificate, or common law partnership documentation, to the airline or Buquebus authorities before boarding and will have to pay a fee of ARS 9000 at the point of entry.
Ezeiza International Airport, San Fernando Airport, Jorge Newbery Airport and Buquebus Port Terminal are the only approved entry points to Argentina.
All travellers who are authorised to enter Argentina must comply with the requirements set out below.
All travellers to Argentina (including those in transit to another country) must fill in an electronic ‘sworn statement’ form within 48 hours of travelling.
All travellers to Argentina (children under 6 are exempted) must present a negative COVID-19 PCR test taken within 72 hours of travelling, unless you are: a crew member, transiting the country through an international airport for less than 24 hours; or have had coronavirus confirmed by a lab test within 90 days of your trip. If you have had coronavirus confirmed by a lab test within 90 days of your trip you don’t need to take a COVID-19 PCR test again. Instead, you will need to show evidence of your diagnosis and a medical certificate issued at least 10 days after being diagnosed, confirming that you have a clean bill of health.
From 24 September 2021, Argentine nationals and residents of Argentina will not need to quarantine after arrival in Argentina if they are fully vaccinated and test negative for COVID-19. They must have received a complete course of a vaccine at least 14 days before arrival in Argentina. They must be able to prove full vaccination status via the App Mi Argentina, or via a document from a national or state-level public health body if vaccinated abroad. They must be prepared to show this document when required by the authorities and also take a COVID-19 test on arrival. If the test is negative, they will have to take a further test between the 5th and 7th day post arrival in Argentina. They must comply with preventive measures for 10 days, starting from the time of the negative COVID-19 test taken within 72 hours of travelling. During this time, arrivals are not allowed to attend large gatherings or use public transport, unless given express permission to do so. These rules also apply to non-resident foreign nationals who are travelling for business, commercial or sporting purposes, for whom the Argentine Migrations Office has given permission to enter the country.
Argentine nationals and residents of Argentina who do not qualify as fully vaccinated, including groups of people for whom there is no vaccine currently approved, will need to self-isolate for 7 days, take a COVID-19 test on arrival, and take a further test on the 7th day after arrival to end quarantine. The local authority will determine whether they must isolate at home or at a designated quarantine hotel.
Regardless of an individual’s vaccination status, if their test on arrival is positive, they will have to take a second test to determine the strain carried. Individuals must cover the costs of all tests and of managed quarantine.
All non-resident foreign nationals with authorisation from the Argentine Migrations Office to enter the country must have medical insurance with comprehensive cover for coronavirus, including hospitalisation and the costs of self-isolation if required.
Visas
The 90-day permission to visit Argentina for those who entered the country before 17 March 2020 and whose original 90 days expired after 17 March 2020, is no longer being automatically extended. If you have any questions about your immigration status, you should contact the Argentine Migrations Office (Migraciones).
Regular entry requirements
Visas
You don’t need a visa to enter Argentina as a tourist unless you’re travelling on an Emergency Travel Document. On presentation of a valid British passport you will normally be given an entry stamp permitting you to stay in the country for a period of up to 90 days.
If you wish to extend your stay for another 90-day period, seek advice from the Argentine Migrations Office.
If you’re travelling to Argentina for any purpose other than tourism, contact the Embassy of the Argentine Republic in London.
Passport validity
Your passport should be valid for the proposed duration of your stay. No additional period of validity beyond this is required.
Proof of onward travel
You may need to provide proof of onward or return travel. You should make all flight reservations before departing for Argentina. Airlines have sometimes refused to board passengers travelling to Argentina without proof of onward travel.
UK Emergency Travel Documents
UK Emergency Travel Documents (ETDs) are accepted for entry, airside transit and exit from Argentina. However, holders of an ETD must apply for the appropriate Argentine visa to enter the country.
For entry into Argentina, your ETD should be valid for the proposed duration of your stay. No additional period of validity beyond this is required.
