There are currently limited commercial options available to return to the UK from Jakarta and all commercial options to return from Bali require transit through Jakarta.
We know this is concerning for British people trying to leave Indonesia. The UK government is working closely with airlines, the Indonesian authorities and other governments to make sure options are available for you to return to the UK as soon as possible.
International Flights
Remaining flight options from Jakarta are:
Qatar Airways from Jakarta via Doha. This service currently operates four times a week.
Garuda Indonesia from Jakarta to Amsterdam. This service currently operates every Thursday. Onward transfers are available from Amsterdam to the UK.
Garuda Indonesia/JAL from Jakarta via Tokyo Haneda. This service currently operates every Sunday.
Korean Airlines from Jakarta via Seoul. This service currently operates every Tuesday.
Emirates Airlines from Jakarta via Dubai. This service will resume on 19 June and will operate three times a week (and daily from 1 July).
Etihad from Jakarta via Dubai. This service will resume on 11 June and will operate four times a week (and daily from 1 July).
Before booking seats on any flights, check the entry and transit restrictions in place for countries on your proposed flight route. You should also check with your airline regularly ahead of your scheduled flight. The number of flights operating is reducing and continuing to change at short notice.
You will need to pay for your return travel to the UK. If departure options are available but you cannot afford the travel costs and have exhausted all other options for getting funds you may be eligible to apply for an emergency loan from the government. This is a last resort option and you would need to repay the loan when you are back in the UK. For more information, contact Corporate Travel Management (CTM). CTM is a commercial partner of the FCO and authorised to administer such loans on behalf of the FCO.
Domestic flights
Public health measures by the Indonesian authorities to restrict domestic travel connected with the Eid holiday, announced on 23 April, include a ban on most in-country air travel until 1 June.
There are some very limited exceptions. The exceptions currently include a small number of domestic flights, including from Bali to Jakarta, to enable foreign tourists to catch connecting international flights from Jakarta.
Passengers travelling on domestic flights will need:
a certificate to confirm that they are free of COVID-19
a completed airline travel declaration form
a letter from the British Embassy confirming that they are returning home
The Garuda airlines travel declaration form and our confirmation letter are available on our social media channels.
