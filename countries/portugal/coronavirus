Cases of coronavirus (COVID-19) have been confirmed in Portugal. The Portuguese authorities have put in place a series of measures to limit the spread of the virus. If you are currently in Portugal, follow the advice of local authorities. Anyone planning to travel to Portugal should consult their airline or tour operator.
Portugal declared a state of emergency on 18 March. This activated a series of measures including significant restrictions on movement throughout the country in response to the corornavirus outbreak. These measures (available in Portuguese) affect:
Public places and transport
Public gatherings are banned, most shops other than those selling food or other essential items such as pharmacies will be closed. All citizens have been instructed to remain at home unless they need to carry out one of the following activities:
• To buy food or other essential items
• To go to work if unable to work from home
• To go to hospital or health centres
• To carry out caring or similar duties or in case of real need
• To return to their primary residence
Public transport services will be operating at reduced levels.
Land Borders
From 16 March until 15 April, there will be border controls on the land border with Spain. Cross border workers, goods traffic and people entering or leaving Portugal to return to their place of residence will be allowed to travel.
British nationals can still drive through Spain and France to return to the UK. While driving through France, they will need to complete an ‘attestation’ (declaration) specifying the reason for being outside.
If you are planning to use this route, check the latest travel advice for Spain and France ahead of your journey.
Since 19 March flights from Portugal to countries outside the EU/EEA, with the exception of the UK, USA, Canada, Venezuela, South Africa and Portuguese speaking countries have been suspended. Flights to Brazil are limited to Rio de Janeiro and São Paulo. Flights to and from Italy and Spain remain suspended.
While flights to the UK are not affected by these measures, airlines have cancelled a number of flights between the UK and Portugal. If your travel plans are likely to be affected or you want to check on the status of your flight, contact your airline or travel company for the latest information.
British Nationals who wish to leave the country should make arrangements to do so as soon as possible as transport options to leave Portugal may not be available indefinitely.
The Algarve
The Algarve Regional Health Authority announced on 21 March that, with effect from 22 March, all citizens arriving into Faro District from abroad will be subject to mandatory self-quarantine for a period of 14 days.
Madeira and the Azores
On 15 March, the regional governments of Madeira and the Azores recommended against all but essential travel to and from the archipelagos until further notice. Travellers arriving in the regions will be subject to health screening and mandatory self-quarantine for a period of 14 days.
Cruise ships and yachts will not be permitted to dock at any of the ports in Madeira, Porto Santo or the Azores. Cruise ships can berth at ports on mainland Portugal, but passengers can only disembark if they are Portuguese nationals or residents.
