Coronavirus guidance is being updated.
Read the Prime Minister’s statement for the latest information.

There are commercial options available to return to the UK from Thailand.
If you live in the UK and are currently visiting Thailand, you’re strongly advised to return now by commercial means. Don’t risk getting stranded.
UK special charter flights will only operate for priority countries where commercial flights are not possible. You should not assume that these flights will become available in Thailand because commercial routes are operating.
Flights
Seats are regularly available on flights from Bangkok to the UK. You can get weekly updates on these by registering with the British Embassy at Thailand.Registration@fco.gov.uk. To allow resources to be focused on those who need it, please email this address to de-register once you are safely back in the UK.
You should aim to get to the airport at least 2 hours before the flight is due to depart, earlier if you are on standby.
Check the policies your airline and insurance provider have about coronavirus, including whether special requirements are in place such as providing a medical health certificate during the check-in procedure.
You will need to pay for your return travel to the UK. If you cannot afford the travel costs and have exhausted all other options for getting funds, you may be eligible to apply for an emergency loan from the government. This is a last resort option and you would need to repay the loan when you are back in the UK. For more information, contact Corporate Travel Management (CTM). CTM are a commercial partner of the FCO and are authorised to administer such loans on behalf of the FCO.
Travelling to the airport
Domestic air travel options within Thailand are opening up but remain more limited than before. If you intend to leave Thailand and need to take a domestic flight to reach your international airport, you should check with your provider and and plan accordingly.
Bus, train and boat routes are opening up but may be subject to restrictions. Make sure that you can get to your international departure airport. If you’re having difficulties and need help to reach your international departure airport, register at Bangkok.documentaryservices@fco.gov.uk.
Your journey home: re-entering the UK
When you return, you must follow the rules for entering the UK. You:
need to provide your journey and contact details up to 48 hours before you’re due to arrive in the UK
are not allowed to leave the place you’re staying for the first 14 days you’re in the UK except in very limited situations (known as ‘self-isolating’)
See also the list of people who are exempt from the border rules.
The National Travel Health Network and Centre (NaTHNaC) also provides advice on how to stay safe as you travel by air.
Staying in Thailand
The current disruption is likely to last for some time, so if you decide to remain in Thailand you should plan for this. See guidance on staying in Thailand during coronavirus
