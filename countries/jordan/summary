There’s a heightened risk of terrorism against aviation. Additional security measures have been in place on flights departing from Jordan to the UK since March 2017. You should co-operate fully with security officials. Restrictions on carrying large electronic devices in the aircraft cabin, introduced as part of these measures, have now been lifted for the vast majority of airlines operating from airports in Jordan. However, some airlines have decided to maintain the restrictions for operational reasons. For more information and advice about what items you can take into the cabin on your flight from Jordan to the UK, contact your airline or travel company.
You can contact the emergency services by calling 911.
If you’re abroad and you need emergency help from the UK government, contact the nearest British embassy, consulate or high commission. Consular support is limited in parts of Jordan where we advise against all but essential travel.
