This information is for people travelling on a full ‘British citizen’ passport from the UK. It is based on the UK government’s understanding of Turkmenistan’s current rules for the most common types of travel.
The authorities in Turkmenistan set and enforce entry rules. If you’re not sure how these requirements apply to you, contact the Embassy of Turkmenistan in the UK.
COVID-19 rules
You do not require a COVID-19 vaccination to enter Turkmenistan. All travellers by air must undergo a COVID-19 test upon arrival at Ashgabat airport, which costs 31 US dollars cash. There is no test if you enter by land or sea.
Confirm the latest requirements with your Turkmen sponsor, or with the embassy that issued your visa if you have one. Check with your travel company or airline for changes.
Passport validity requirements
To enter Turkmenistan, your passport must have an ‘expiry date’ at least 6 months after the date you plan to leave Turkmenistan.
Check with your travel provider that your passport and other travel documents meet requirements. Renew your passport if you need to.
You will be denied entry if you do not have a valid travel document or try to use a passport that has been reported lost or stolen.
Visa requirements
You must have a visa to visit Turkmenistan.
If you have the wrong visa or if you overstay your visa, you could be prosecuted and possibly imprisoned.
Applying for a visa
You need a letter of invitation to support your visa application. For tourist visits, authorised travel agents can provide these letters. If you are travelling on business, you will need letters from the relevant government ministries or companies you want to do business with. If you want to attend an exhibition or event, the organiser normally provides visa support. 
Once you have your letter of invitation you can either apply for a visa at your nearest Embassy of Turkmenistan or purchase a visa on arrival. The visa on arrival option is available at Ashgabat International Airport and some land borders. Check with your sponsoring tour agency for latest details on land border crossings.
Visas applications to an Embassy of Turkmenistan are referred to Ashgabat for a decision, which can take up to a month.  
The cost of a visa is dependent on the length of stay in Turkmenistan, whether you are applying for a single or multiple entry visa and whether or not you are opting for the “Express Service” from the Embassy or visa on arrival option at Ashgabat airport. For a full list of prices for visas visit the Embassy of Turkmenistan website of the Embassy of Turkmenistan in London where a PDF document called “Visa Fees” outlines the range of prices for visas.
Transit visas and travelling through Turkmenistan by car
If you will be in Turkmenistan for fewer than 5 days you may also be able to use a transit visa. These are most commonly used for entry to Turkmenistan through a land border, for example if travelling overland from Uzbekistan.
Transit visas follow the same letter of invitation process as visit visas and you must secure the visa before you travel. Transit visas can’t be obtained on arrival at the border crossing.
The website of the Embassy of Turkmenistan in London sets out the eligibility criteria for a transit visa. You cannot change your transit visa to a tourist visa, and you must notify the authorities if you intend to change your route.
You cannot buy a transit visa for Turkmenistan at Baku seaport. You must secure it ahead of time. If you want to travel from Turkmenistan to Azerbaijan by sea, you need to have visas for both Turkmenistan and Azerbaijan.
You will be charged up to 150 US dollars to bring a car into Turkmenistan by land or sea.
A transit visa is not usually required for layover flights where you will remain airside. You should contact the Embassy of Turkmenistan in London or your airline with further questions.
Border officials may close Turkmen border crossings without notice.
Vaccine requirements
For details about medical entry requirements and recommended vaccinations, see TravelHealthPro’s Turkmenistan guide.
Registering with the authorities
If you’re staying in the country for more than 3 working days, you must register with the State Migration Service of Turkmenistan within 3 days of your arrival. Your hotel or sponsor will usually register you. Confirm this with them before you travel, including what documentation is required.
To register, you will usually need:
your passport
2 passport-size photos, and
written confirmation of where you are staying from your sponsor
Taxes for foreign nationals
On arrival, you must pay a migration fee of 14 US dollars. All foreign visitors must also pay a ‘tourism tax’ of 2 US dollars for each day of their stay in Turkmenistan. Hotels include the tax as a separate item on your bill.
You may be charged additional taxes on entry, bring enough cash (US dollars) to cover unexpected charges.
Customs rules
There are strict rules about goods you can take into or out of Turkmenistan. You must declare anything that may be prohibited or subject to tax or duty.
‘Tobacco products to the amount of 2 packs’ means you can bring one of:
2 packets of cigarettes – a total of 40 cigarettes
2 cigars
2 packs of tobacco each weighing no more than a packet of cigarettes
It is illegal to give tobacco products as a gift. If you are caught, you could get a fine.
Taking money into Turkmenistan
Turkmenistan is largely a cash-based society. Carry cash and pay in the Turkmen currency, manat. Some larger hotels and restaurants accept US dollars - you should check before purchasing. Other outlets are only allowed to accept manat.
You can exchange US dollars and euros at the official manat rate easily at a bank or money exchange. Bring new, clean notes as exchanges will reject damaged or marked notes. An increasing number of establishments also refuse to accept $100 bills produced before 2009. You can check which version of dollar notes you have on the US government website. Other currencies are difficult to exchange. Manat cannot be re-converted, so exchange only as much as you need.
There are a limited number of international ATMs in Ashgabat, but they can run out of manat notes. There’s a 3% withdrawal charge for each transaction. You are strongly recommended to bring enough dollars for your entire trip.
