This page reflects the UK government’s understanding of current rules for people travelling on a full ‘British Citizen’ passport, for the most common types of travel.
The authorities in Gabon set and enforce entry rules. For further information contact the embassy, high commission or consulate of the country or territory you’re travelling to. You should also consider checking with your transport provider or travel company to make sure your passport and other travel documents meet their requirements.
Entry rules in response to coronavirus (COVID-19)
Entry to Gabon
The Gabonese government has introduced a ban on flights from Botswana, Zimbabwe, Namibia, Lesotho, Eswatini, Mozambique, Angola and South Africa, until further notice, in response to the Omicron variant of COVID-19.
In relation to other countries, flight restrictions have eased to allow five flights per airline, per week. Land and sea borders are closed.
UK nationals must receive authorisation from the Gabonese Ministry of Foreign Affairs before travelling to Gabon. Authorisation can be obtained through the inviting party dropping the request in person at Gabon Foreign Ministry and following up with them.
All passengers travelling to Gabon must present a valid negative polymerase chain reaction (PCR) test no older than 3 days or a valid COVID-19 vaccination certificate for entry into Gabon. See ‘Demonstrating your COVID-19 status’
On arrival, all passengers must take a compulsory test for COVID-19 at Libreville Airport. Vaccinated passengers are allowed to proceed out of the airport without observing a quarantine. Non vaccinated passengers are required to self-isolate for 5 days in designated hotels at their own expense whilst the COVID-19 test is being processed. Passports will be retained by the immigration authorities during this time and returned after successful completion of the isolation time. If the COVID-19 test is negative, passengers will be issued a test certificate, which is valid for 14 days and can be renewed at the end of this period after another test is undertaken. Holders of vaccination certificates are exempt from the compulsory testing and self-isolation. Holders of vaccination certificates still have to undergo the compulsory testing but can self-isolate in the facility of their choice and do not have to leave their passport.
Travellers holding a diplomatic passport and their travel orders must comply with the mandatory PCR testing at the airport (CFA 20,000), but do not quarantine in a government-designated hotel and do not leave their passport at the airport. This applies whether the diplomat is vaccinated or not.
If a COVID-19 test taken at the airport is positive, then passengers are required to continue self-isolation and await specific instructions from Gabonese health authorities. Visitors to Gabon will have to go to one of the hotels which the government of Gabon has nominated for isolation. British nationals resident in Gabon who test positive are required to isolate at home and dial the toll free number 1410 for further instructions. All COVID-19 tests taken in Gabon supersede any that were taken before arrival in Gabon.
Demonstrating your COVID-19 status
Gabon will accept the UK’s proof of COVID-19 recovery and vaccination record. Your NHS appointment card from vaccination centres is not designed to be used as proof of vaccination and should not be used to demonstrate your vaccine status.
Visas
On 16 March 2020, the Government of Gabon announced the suspension of tourist visas for British nationals. All Gabon diplomatic missions abroad are prohibited from issuing entry visas to Gabon without special authorisation. For full information on the visa application process, visit the website of the Gabonese Embassy in the UK.
The Government of Gabon confirmed it would not penalise British nationals whose visas have expired while they were unable to leave the country whilst borders were closed. Now that commercial flights are running, if your visa has expired, you should consider leaving the country.
