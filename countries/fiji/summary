Tropical Cyclone: The Fiji Met Office forecasts that there is a HIGH probability of TD 13F becoming a Tropical Cyclone in the next few days. This weather system is forecast to pass to the south of Fiji’s main island of Viti Levu, bringing heavy rain and high winds. This will lead to rising river levels and a potential of flash flooding - especially in the West. Monitor weather updates from the Fiji Meteorological Service, in local newspapers and on Radio Fiji 2 on 105 FM, and follow the advice of the local authorities including any evacuation orders. See our Tropical Cyclones page for further advice about what to do if you’re caught up in a storm
