Before you travel, check the ‘Entry requirements’ section for Dominica’s current entry restrictions and requirements. These may change with little warning. Monitor this advice for the latest updates and stay in contact with your travel provider.
If you plan to pass through another country to return to the UK, check the travel advice for the country you’re transiting.
It is more important than ever to get travel insurance and check it provides sufficient cover. See the FCDO’s guidance on foreign travel insurance.
The hurricane season normally runs from June to November. You should follow and monitor local and international weather updates from the US National Hurricane Center and follow the advice of local authorities, including any evacuation orders. See Natural disasters.
Hurricane Maria passed over Dominica in September 2017, causing widespread damage to communications, buildings and infrastructure. Life in Dominica has largely returned to a state of normality. Water and electricity have been restored, but some homes remain damaged. Communications can be intermittent in some parts of the island. All the main roads have been cleared, although heightened care is needed when navigating roads that were badly damaged by the hurricane and in the more remote areas of the island.
Consular support may be limited in Dominica as there is no British High Commission office.  However, the British High Commission in Bridgetown, Barbados, can provide consular support.
Most visits to Dominica are trouble-free but incidents of crime do occur. See Crime
