The information on this page covers the most common types of travel and reflects the UK government’s understanding of the rules currently in place. Unless otherwise stated, this information is for travellers using a full ‘British Citizen’ passport.
The authorities in the country or territory you’re travelling to are responsible for setting and enforcing the rules for entry. If you’re unclear about any aspect of the entry requirements, or you need further reassurance, you’ll need to contact the embassy, high commission or consulate of the country or territory you’re travelling to.
You should also consider checking with your transport provider or travel company to make sure your passport and other travel documents meet their requirements.
Visas
With immediate effect, the Government of the Lao PDR has suspended the visa on arrival service at all international entry points for a period of 30 days.
Lao Diplomatic Missions Overseas have suspended issuing tourist visas and will issue visas for visitors with non tourist purposes only. Visitors will have to submit requisite information on their health and related documents to the Lao diplomatic mission in the country they are resident for approval before intended date of travel. Visitors who arrive in the Lao PDR without the necessary approval will be denied entry into the country. The application form for the health declaration is available on the official website for the Ministry of Foreign Affairs.
Visa conditions change regularly. For the most up to date information, contact the nearest Lao Embassy or Consulate.
If you are eligible for a visa when you enter Laos, make sure you get an entry stamp in your passport. Not having a legitimate entry stamp could lead to arrest or a large fine.
Overstaying your visa is a serious offence in Laos and the police are likely to issue heavy fines and detain those who are caught. Tourist visas can be extended 2 times and up to a total of 90 days. Tourists are required to check in with the immigration every 30 days in order to obtain this extension.
Regional travel
Thailand currently allows only two crossings per annum at the land border between Laos and Thailand. See travel advice for Thailand for further information.
Passport validity
Your passport should have at least 6 months’ validity remaining on your date of entry into Laos.
Additionally, be aware that a number of airlines will now only allow boarding of flights to Laos if you have two blank pages in your passport.
Yellow fever certificate requirements
Check whether you need a yellow fever certificate by visiting the National Travel Health Network and Centre’s TravelHealthPro website.
UK Emergency Travel Documents
UK Emergency Travel Documents (ETDs) are accepted for entry, airside transit and exit from Laos. If you’re planning to enter Laos using a UK ETD you should contact the nearest Lao embassy or consulate to get the appropriate visa before you travel.
If your passport has been lost or stolen, you must report the loss or theft to the nearest police station and get a police report. You’ll then need to get a certificate of loss from the Immigration Department in Vientiane which usually takes 1 to 2 working days.
After getting an ETD from the British Embassy, you’ll need to get an exit visa from the Lao Ministry of Foreign Affairs which takes up to 3 days.
