The Government declared a State of Emergency on the evening of 18 October following civil unrest around metro stations in the downtown Santiago area. This is expected to last 15 days. On 19 October this State of Emergency was expanded to include Valparaiso, Concepcion, La Serena, Coquimbo and Rancagua following protests in Valparaiso, Viña del Mar, Temuco, La Serena, Punta Arenas, Antofagasta, and Concepcion. You should expect to see a heavy military presence in these cities during this time. Monday 21 October is the ‘Day of Protest’. We expect further demonstrations in some areas of Santiago and other cities across Chile on Monday 21 and possibly through to Tuesday 22 October.
All of Santiago’s public transport – including the metro and buses - will have a very limited service on Monday 21 October. Other cities may close their public transport system. Some banks, shopping malls and supermarkets in Santiago will be closed on Monday 21 October. The Military has confirmed curfews will be in place in Valparaiso and Concepcion from 6.00pm Monday 21 October to 6.00am Tuesday 22 October; Santiago, Rancagua, Antofagasta, La Serena and Coquimbo from 8.00pm Monday to 6.00am Tuesday and in Valdivia from 9.00pm Monday 21 October to 6.00am Tuesday 22 October. You should observe a curfew where it is in place, remain vigilant, monitor local media for updates and avoid protests and demonstrations.
There have been reports of domestic and international flights being delayed or cancelled. You should contact your airline prior to travel. If you need to travel from Santiago airport during curfew, show your boarding pass to the authorities as this should ensure safe passage to the airport. If you arrive at Santiago airport during the curfew the airport authorities will give you a “salvoconducto” (safe conduct pass) to be able to leave the airport. Airline crews should show their official credentials to be able to travel to and from the airport during curfew.
The land border crossing point between Chile and Mendoza in Argentina will be closed from 6.00pm on Monday 21 October to Tuesday 22 October morning (exact time not specified).
