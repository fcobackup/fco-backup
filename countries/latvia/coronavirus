Returning to the UK
Travelling from and returning to the UK
If you plan to pass through another country to return to the UK, check the travel advice for the country you’re transiting.
Be prepared for your plans to change
No travel is risk-free during COVID. Countries may further restrict travel or bring in new rules at short notice, for example due to a new COVID-19 variant. Check with your travel company or airline for any transport changes which may delay your journey home.
If you test positive for COVID-19, you may need to stay where you are until you test negative. You may also need to seek treatment there.
Plan ahead and make sure you:
can access money
understand what your insurance will cover
can make arrangements to extend your stay and be away for longer than planned
Public spaces and services
Some measures remain in place to limit transmission of COVID-19. See the Latvian government’s COVID-19 website for full details.
Wearing of face masks is mandatory at social care homes, hospitals and other medical institutions. People must use a medical face mask or unvalved respirator with a safety level of FFP2 - FFP3 or KN95. Children between the ages of 7 and 12 can use non-medical (fabric) masks. Wearing a face mask is not obligatory for:
children under 7 years of age;
anyone with certain medical conditions, for example, if a person has difficulty wearing a mask due to a movement disorder or if the person has a mental health disorder.
The fine for not wearing a face mask when required is 50 Euros.
Latvia will accept the UK’s proof of COVID-19 recovery and vaccination record. If you are travelling with a printed PDF proof of vaccination status, it must date from 1 November to ensure that the certificate can be scanned successfully, if domestic certification is required. If you are entering premises that require a COVID-19 certificate in Latvia, please download and use the QR code designed for travel. Your NHS appointment card from vaccination centres is not designed to be used as proof of vaccination and should not be used to demonstrate your vaccine status.
It is not mandatory to show proof of your vaccination status to receive services or attend venues (museums, cafes, bars etc.) or events. However, it remains at the discretion of the service provider or the event organiser to ask for your vaccination certificate or enforce any other epidemiological safety rules. If you intend to attend events, contact the organiser to enquire about the COVID-19 rules which they have in place.
Healthcare in Latvia
The latest information and advice from the Latvian authorities is available on the Latvian government’s COVID-19 website.
What to do if your COVID-19 test is positive:
Stay or return to the premises where you will be self-quarantining. Avoid any direct or indirect physical contact with other people.
Call the Latvian National Health Service on 80001234 for a local doctor to be assigned to you. Be aware that not all operators are English speaking, keep trying until you reach one who is.
Wait for a call from your assigned doctor with further instructions. You may be contacted by an epidemiologist to trace back your steps and identify potential contact persons.
If your health deteriorates and you experience severe COVID-19 symptoms, call 113 immediately.
Do not exit self-quarantine until your doctor has allowed it.
Be aware that not all hotels provide self-quarantining facilities. It means you might be required to move to another hotel. If you have already checked out of your hotel, check the Riga City Council Welfare Department website with the list of hotels for self-quarantining. Travellers with COVID-19 infection must self-quarantine at their own expense. For contact details for English speaking doctors visit our list of healthcare providers.
Your emotional and mental wellbeing is important. Read guidance on how to look after your mental wellbeing and mental health

COVID-19 vaccines if you live in Latvia
Wherever possible British nationals should aim to be vaccinated in the country where they live. We will update this page when the Government of Latvia announces new information on the national vaccination programme. You can sign up to get email notifications when this page is updated.
The Latvian national vaccination programme started in January 2021 and is using the AstraZeneca, Pfizer-BioNTech, Janssen (Johnson and Johnson), Moderna and Nuvaxovid vaccines. The Government of Latvia has stated that British nationals resident in Latvia are eligible for vaccination. Information about the Latvian national COVID-19 vaccination programme is available on the Latvian government’s COVID-19 website.
Find out more, including about vaccines that are authorised in the UK or approved by the World Health Organisation, on the COVID-19 vaccines if you live abroad.
If you’re a British national living in Latvia, you should seek medical advice from your local healthcare provider. Information about COVID-19 vaccines used in the national programme where you live, including regulatory status, should be available from local authorities.
If you receive your COVID-19 vaccination in Latvia, you can get an EU Digital COVID Certificate from the national authorities. The Certificate proves that you have been vaccinated against COVID-19, received a negative test result, or recovered from COVID-19. It will help facilitate your travel within the EU and, in some countries, you can use it to demonstrate your COVID-19 status to businesses and other organisations. For further information visit the European Commission’s EU Digital COVID Certificate page.
