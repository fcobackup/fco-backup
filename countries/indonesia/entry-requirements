Entry rules in response to coronavirus
Entry to Indonesia
Indonesia is implementing a series of changes to admission for foreign nationals in response to developments in the Covid pandemic. While these are being rolled out, in addition to meeting the categories below, you should reconfirm your eligibility to enter Indonesia with your travel agent/airline and the Indonesian Embassy. This can be done by contacting the Consular Section of the Indonesian Embassy on: consular@indonesianembassy.org.uk.
Visit Visa
Foreigners can now apply for a visitor or limited stay visa, including visas on compassionate grounds. The application should be made by the sponsor to the Director General of Immigration.
A full list of visas is available on the Indonesian Immigration website
The requirements include:
a. Proof of full COVID-19 vaccination
b. Letter stating willingness to obey Indonesia’s health protocol including quarantine requirements
c. Proof of health insurance (minimum $25,000)/travel insurance including specific COVID-19 health coverage and a letter stating willingness to pay for own treatment should the person be or become infected with COVID-19
d. Proof of USD 1500 or equivalent by showing last 3 months bank statements
e. Proof of accommodation including payment
Additional entry requirements you must satisfy are:
you must be in possession of a health certificate confirming a negative COVID-19 PCR test (swab test) result, which can be checked by a QR code or barcode. From 1 January, your certificate must be issued a maximum of 48 hours prior to your departure for Indonesia. The certificate must be in English
evidence of having received two full doses of a COVID-19 vaccine. (See ‘Demonstrating your COVID-19 status’). The following 4 categories are exempt from this requirement:
travellers below 18 years old
foreign nationals who cannot be vaccinated due to their medical condition. They must show confirmation via a health certificate issued by a medical professional
Diplomatic/Service Visa holder for the purposes of a Ministerial/Official visit
active flight or ship crew
Note
The British Embassy understands from the latest Regulation update that foreign nationals aged 12 to 17 and holders of Diplomatic or Service visas who have not been vaccinated may be expected to undergo vaccination during their quarantine period.
you are required to download and install the Peduli Lindungi app to perform the e-Hac registration
you must submit a letter in English stating that you are willing to enter quarantine facilities for the appropriate period of time based on your vaccination record. Quarantine times are currently 3 x 24 hours if you have received a full course of vaccination or full course of vaccination and a booster. 7 x 24 for those who have not completed a full course of vaccination (i.e. those who have only received the first vaccination in a course of 2). If you are unvaccinated you are not allowed to enter Indonesia unless you can produce a doctor’s letter with a statement showing why you cannot be vaccinated. This letter will also be assessed by the Indonesian health authorities before entry is permitted.
you are required to hold valid travel and health insurance that covers your visit
you are required to take PCR tests upon arrival at the airport and on the day before quarantine ends. If you test positive with mild or asymptomatic symptoms on test 1, you will be taken to a government isolation hotel – your prepaid quarantine hotel will be refunded. Those who show moderate or severe symptoms will be isolated in a COVID-19 referral hospital and will have to bear all related costs.
if your final test is negative, you will be allowed to proceed with your journey. If the final test is positive, you will be referred to hospital at your own expense. If you cannot pay the hospital bills, your sponsor (Ministries, agencies, or state-owned enterprise) supporting your visit can be asked to take responsibility. If you receive a positive COVID-19 result and wish to have another independent test for confirmation, you can do so at your own expense by filling out a form at the Port Health Office or Ministry of Health offices. This independent COVID-19 test can be taken at Cipto Mangunkusumo hospital, Gatot Soebroto hospital, and Raden Said Sukanto Bhayangkara hospital
Visa scams
Beware of visa scams by fraudulent visa agents who, having taken your money, may fail to provide a visa or supply the wrong kind. This could result in your overstaying and a fine of IDR 1million/day, detention, deportation and possible re-entry ban. You should use the Indonesian Immigration self-service portal
Visa scams are on the rise in Indonesia. The British Embassy is aware of numerous foreign nationals in Bali who have been the victim of visa scams at this time. Many have lost significant sums of money, some have been deported despite paying large fees to their agent to secure the correct visa or extension to stay.
If you wish to use to use an agent, do thorough due diligence and check for reviews and recommendations.

Regular entry requirements
Visas
In normal circumstances, if you’re travelling on a British Citizen passport you do not need a visa to enter Indonesia for visits of up to 30 days, calculated to include your date of arrival and date of departure. Visa-free visits can not be extended or transferred to another type of visa. For a list of airports, seaports and land border crossings for entering/exiting Indonesia under this visa waiver scheme, and more information about entry requirements, visit the Indonesian Embassy in London website or your nearest Indonesian embassy.
If you’re travelling to Indonesia and intend to stay for more than 30 days (up to a maximum of 60 days), you should apply for a visa before you travel, or apply for a visa on arrival at a cost of US$35, or the equivalent in Indonesian rupiah, at the visa on arrival desk within the airport. These types of visa are valid for 30 days, and can be extended once (for a maximum of 30 days) by making an application for an extension to an immigration office within Indonesia. Ensure that you extend your visa within the initial 30 days to avoid an overstay fine.
The Indonesian embassy has introduced a new e-visa system. You should submit your visa application online. The embassy will no longer accept a handwritten visa application form unless you’re a British Overseas Territories citizen, British National (Overseas), or if you’re applying for a diplomatic visa. If you fall into this category you should send a written request to obtain the visa form at: consular@indonesianembassy.org.
The visa waiver scheme and visas on arrival aren’t available if you’re travelling on a British Overseas Citizen, British Subject, British National (Overseas) or British Overseas Territory citizen passport. Instead, you must apply for a visa before you travel.
These options are also not available if you’re travelling to Indonesia for journalistic purposes. Instead, you must apply for a visa before you travel, and should make sure that you have the correct permits for local travel within Indonesia as some areas may need special permits in addition to your visa. You should seek advice from your nearest Indonesian Embassy.
Passport validity
Your passport should be valid for a minimum period of 6 months from the date of your departure from Indonesia.
Indonesian law doesn’t allow dual nationality for adults over 18 years of age. If you’re a British national who has retained Indonesian nationality, you may experience immigration difficulties in Indonesia.
UK Emergency Travel Documents
UK Emergency Travel Documents (ETDs) are accepted for airside transit and exit from Indonesia. ETDs may also be accepted for entry into Indonesia. If you’re entering Indonesia using an ETD you must apply for a visit visa before travelling. You won’t be able to get a visa on arrival. The processing time for an Indonesian visa can vary depending on where you apply. Some Indonesian embassies do not issue Indonesian visas in ETDs. Contact your nearest Indonesian Embassy to check before you apply.
Entry requirements may differ if you live in Indonesia. Contact your nearest Indonesian Embassy to confirm whether you need to apply for a visit visa before you travel to Indonesia using an ETD.
If you apply for an ETD whilst in Indonesia, you may need to get an exit permit from Immigration to leave the country. We will advise you to contact the nearest Immigration office to check before travelling.
Proof of onward travel
Immigration officials in Indonesia may ask you for proof of onward travel (such as a return or onward air ticket). You should make all reservations before leaving for Indonesia. Some airlines have refused to board passengers without evidence of onward travel.
Departure and airport tax
Airport tax is included in the cost your ticket for all domestic flights within Indonesia. For some international flights departing Indonesia, airport tax may not be included in the price of the ticket. You should check with your airline or travel agent before you travel.
Overstaying your visa
Overstaying without the proper authority is a serious matter and visitors can be held in detention or refused permission to leave the country until a fine of Rp 1 million per day is paid. After overstaying for 60 days, you will be detained and possibly imprisoned.
Registering
If you stay in private accommodation in Indonesia (not a hotel) you must register your presence with the local police or you could face a fine of Rp 5 million. If you stay in a hotel you will be registered automatically.
Travelling with medication
If you bring any prescription medication into Indonesia, make sure you have a copy of the prescription with you. The prescription must cover the quantity of medication you bring. Be aware that some prescription or other medication available in the UK, including some psychotropic medicines, may be illegal in Indonesia. If you’re unsure, speak to your doctor and the Indonesian Embassy for advice before you travel.
