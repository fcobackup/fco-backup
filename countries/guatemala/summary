Guatemala has active volcanoes, some prone to heightened activity. From 12 February, local authorities have reported an increase in activity associated with the Fuego and Pacaya volcanoes. La Aurora International Airport is subject to closures at short notice due to volcanic ash affecting the airport operations. You should check with your airline or travel agent ahead of your travel date for the most up to date information. More details can also be found on the websites of the Guatemalan Meteorological Office (INSIVUMEH, in Spanish only) and La Aurora International Airport. Local authorities will continue monitoring the volcanic activity. You should be mindful of the greater risk when in the vicinity of these volcanoes. See Volcanoes
