Drug taking and smuggling is an offence. Punishments can be severe.
Homosexuality is not illegal in Namibia. Some sexual relations between men are criminalised, but generally not enforced. There are no legal protections against discrimination based on sexual orientation. Conservative attitudes towards LGBT individuals persist, especially in rural regions, and many people in Namibia consider LGBT relationships to be taboo. It is advisable to avoid public displays of affection such as kissing and hand-holding and avoid discussing LGBT topics in public. See our information and advice page for the LGBT community before you travel.
It’s illegal to buy, sell, kill or capture any protected wild animal or trade its parts without a licence. Namibia is a signatory to the Convention on International Trade in Endangered Species of Wild Fauna and Flora (CITES), which bans trade in ivory and rhino horn. Anyone caught buying or trafficking these goods will be prosecuted and could receive a prison sentence or fine.
There are no formal rules limiting photography by tourists in Namibia, but some people have been detained for taking pictures of State House and properties where the President is residing. Parts of Namibia require a permit to enter (eg the Cape Cross Seal Colony) and you should check about photography when applying for permits. If the army or police are protecting a building or place, check before taking any photographs. If in doubt, don’t take pictures.
