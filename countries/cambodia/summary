If you’re visiting or living in Cambodia and intend to leave, you should do so as soon as possible. The number of international flights out of Cambodia is reducing rapidly. The Cambodia-Vietnam land border is closed and the Cambodia-Thailand land border is closing. Contact your airline or travel company and your insurance provider as soon as you are able, and keep up to date with the latest developments.
There are restrictions on transit through Thailand including Bangkok airport, which came into effect on Sunday 22 March. All passengers will need to present a medical certificate signed by a medical professional confirming no evidence of the coronavirus infection in the previous 72 hours, and also present evidence of medical insurance of no less than US$100,000 which covers COVID-19. Failure to meet these requirements will mean passengers are not permitted to board their flight even if they are transiting airside to another international destination. Contact your airline or insurance company for more details. The Cambodia-Vietnam land border is closed. The Cambodia-Thai border crossings are now closed with the exception of the crossing between Klong Leuk and Poipet, which will close from Monday 23 March. The border crossings will remain closed until at least, Sunday 5 April.
It is currently still possible to leave Cambodia by some international air routes and the land borders with Laos, but there is no guarantee this will continue.
If you choose to remain, you must follow the advice of local authorities.
