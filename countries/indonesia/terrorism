Terrorists are very likely to try to carry out attacks in Indonesia.
UK Counter Terrorism Policing has information and advice on staying safe abroad and what to do in the event of a terrorist attack. Find out more about the global threat from terrorism.
Terrorist groups have the capacity and intent to carry out attacks at anytime and anywhere in the country. Types of attacks have included suicide bombings and small-arms fire, targeting public and crowded places.
The threat from Islamist extremism remains high, though the Indonesian authorities continue to disrupt attack planning, including arresting alleged terrorists reportedly in the advanced stages of preparation.
In Central Sulawesi, there is on-going conflict between the Indonesian security forces and terrorists, including attacks upon police and civilians most recently in March 2021. This conflict is predominantly concentrated in the Poso region.
Indonesian government and law enforcement interests and places of worship are regularly targeted by extremists. Western interests are also at risk. Small-scale attacks occur on a regular basis and further incidents are likely. Attacks could be indiscriminate, including in places frequented by foreigners. Beach resorts, bars and restaurants, hotels, markets, shopping malls hosting major international brand outlets, tourist attractions, places of worship, foreign embassies, polling stations, ferry terminals and airports are all potential targets.
Thereâ€™s a heightened risk during holiday periods. Exercise extra caution around:
Christmas, New Year and Easter period
Chinese New Year
Nyepi (Balinese New Year)
Islamic celebrations and holidays such as Ramadan
local elections
presidential inaugurations
annual Independence Day celebrations (17 August)
You should follow the advice of the local authorities, remaining particularly vigilant and maintaining a high level of security awareness in crowded places and at large gatherings.

There is considered to be a heightened threat of terrorist attack globally against UK interests and British nationals, from groups or individuals motivated by the conflict in Iraq and Syria. You should be vigilant at this time.
Kidnap
There is a risk of kidnapping at sea in and around the waters of Indonesia. This risk is higher in the Sulu and Celebes seas.
The long-standing policy of the British government is not to make substantive concessions to hostage takers. The British government considers that paying ransoms and releasing prisoners increases the risk of further hostage taking.
