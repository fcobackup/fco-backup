Political and security situation
Regional tensions have increased in the run up to the first anniversary of the killing by the United States of senior Iranian and Iraqi security leaders Qasim Soleimani and Abu-Mahdi al-Muhandis outside Baghdad International Airport on 3 January. It is possible that the security situation could deteriorate in the period around this date. The situation remains uncertain and could worsen at short notice. You should avoid any rallies, marches or processions, and follow the instructions of local authorities. See Political and security situation.
Large protests occur regularly across Iraq. While many of these demonstrations are peaceful, there have been frequent violent clashes between Iraqi security forces and protesters, resulting in significant casualties including loss of life. You should avoid any rallies, marches and / or processions, and follow the instructions of local authorities.
There may be restrictions on movement, and the Iraqi authorities have discretion to impose curfews as they deem necessary. Curfews and vehicle bans can be enforced at short notice, particularly during protests and civil unrest, but also around religious holidays, pilgrimages and key political dates like elections. Religious gatherings have previously been targeted by terrorists.
British government officials serving in Iraq live and work under strict security rules. Depending on the threat level, they may be prevented from travelling to certain areas of Iraq.
If you’re travelling or moving to Iraq, you should take appropriate security precautions before travelling. Outside of the Kurdistan Region you are strongly advised to employ a private security company, make arrangements for secure accommodation and transport and consider pre-deployment training.
Local travel
Northern and western Iraq
Global Coalition forces, including the UK, continue to carry out targeted airstrikes against Daesh in northern and western Iraq. Areas liberated from Daesh are likely to contain remnants of war and improvised explosive devices.
Mosul Dam
The government of Iraq has begun to take measures to improve the structural integrity of the Mosul Dam as there is a risk the dam could fail. It’s currently impossible to accurately predict if or when this might occur. A failure could lead to major flooding in the Tigris river valley, from Mosul to Baghdad. As there’s likely to be little warning of a failure, it will be logistically impossible for the British Government to evacuate you. You should make sure you have contingency plans in place and monitor media reporting and this travel advice.
Baghdad
Routes in and out of Baghdad may become blocked and airports closed or inaccessible at little or no notice. You should plan and check your routes in advance of travelling.
There remains a threat to hotels in Baghdad, which could be targeted by terrorist groups. You should remain vigilant and follow the advice of the local authorities.
You should avoid political gatherings and large crowds, and minimise your movement around banks, restaurants and shopping malls. Observe instructions given by the local security authorities.
Kurdistan Region of Iraq
The Kurdistan Region of Iraq (KRI) is currently subject to strict travel restrictions between provinces which are often changed at short notice. These are published through local media and on www.moi.gov.krd. You should remain alert, monitor media reports and this travel advice.
While the Kurdistan Region has a different security environment to the rest of Iraq, there remains a risk of attacks by Da’esh.
Turkey conducts regular military action in the north of the Kurdistan Region and on occasion, further south. There is particular risk in mountainous areas, particularly around Qandil, Makhmur, and near the border with Turkey. Crossing points along the Iraq-Turkey border may also be affected.
Foreign nationals crossing the border from Syria into the KRI have been arrested for immigration offences in recent months. If prosecuted offenders could face a prison sentence of up to 5 years.
Basra
Protests are ongoing in Basra. You should remain alert, monitor media reports and keep up to date with this travel advice.
Land borders
Border crossing points with countries neighbouring Iraq may close with little or no notice.
On 22 December the Government of Iraq declared that land borders would be closed for a 14 day period. Check whether border crossings will be open before travelling.
Air travel
Do not leave airports without taking adequate security precautions. You should also take care within all terminal buildings.
The FCDO cannot offer advice on the safety of individual airlines. However, the International Air Transport Association publishes a list of registered airlines that have been audited and found to meet a number of operational safety standards and recommended practices. This list is not exhaustive and the absence of an airline from this list does not necessarily mean that it is unsafe.
The International Civil Aviation Organisation has carried out an audit of the level of implementation of the critical elements of safety oversight in Iraq.
A list of incidents and accidents in Iraq can be found on the website of the Aviation Safety network.
Iraqi Airways’ permission to operate to/from the EU has been suspended. This is because Iraqi Airways has been unable to satisfy the European Aviation Safety Agency that the airline meets the requirements for non-EU airlines operating to/from the EU.
Flight schedules may change without notice. Contact your airline or travel company for the latest information before travelling.
On 22 December the Government of Iraq announced that a travel ban would come into force for nine countries, including the United Kingdom. Please consult your airline before travelling.
Sea travel
Maritime facilities are under a high risk of attack. Maritime and sailing craft should take great care in the northern Persian Gulf. Vessels transiting the Gulf of Oman, Northern Arabian Sea, Gulf of Aden and Bab El Mandeb regions may be at increased risk of attack. You should consider any regional tensions that may affect your route.
On 22 December the Government of Iraq declared that sea borders would be closed for a 14 day period.
Road travel
You need to have a 1968 International Driving Permit to drive in Iraq. 1926 IDPs previously issued by the UK may no longer be accepted. You can get IDPs over the counter from 2,500 UK Post Offices. You will not be able to buy an IDP outside the UK, so get one before you travel.
Road travel within Iraq remains highly dangerous. Driving standards are low compared to those is the UK. Road traffic accidents are frequent and often result in fatalities. False vehicle checkpoints have been used to launch terrorist attacks. There is also a risk of carjacking and robbery.
Consular assistance
UK Consular support is severely limited in Iraq. The Baghdad Embassy and Erbil Consulate-General’s ability to visit locations across Iraq is limited and travel to unsecure areas to deliver consular services may not be possible. This is further impacted due to COVID-19 measures.
If you need urgent consular assistance, call the FCDO in London on +44 (0)20 7008 5000. Depending on your location please email baghdad.consular@fcdo.gov.uk or erbil.consular@fcdo.gov.uk for all enquiries.
Advice to business
A number of UK companies visit and operate successfully in Iraq. However, movement is restricted and companies nearly always travel with close protection security teams. Specific guidance for companies seeking to do business in Iraq can be found on the Department for International Trade (DIT) website. DIT are also able to put you in touch with companies operating in Iraq who offer security services. For more information see Operating in high-risk environments: Advice for business
