If you plan to pass through another country to return to the UK, check the travel advice for the country you’re transiting. If you will pass through a red list country, book your hotel quarantine package before travelling to the UK.
You are responsible for organising your own COVID-19 test, in line with UK government testing requirements.
Be prepared for your plans to change
No travel is risk-free during COVID. Countries may further restrict travel or bring in new rules at short notice, for example due to a new COVID-19 variant. Check with your travel company or airline for any transport changes which may delay your journey home.
Both adult and children travellers must present a negative COVID-19 PCR or Antigen test before boarding a flight to Panama.
If you test positive for COVID-19 while in Panama, you will be expected to self-isolate at a government approved quarantine facility until you test negative. The local authorities will follow up with you to ensure you are carrying out the mandatory quarantine.
The local health authorities have made it clear that travellers will have to cover the expenses associated with quarantining at a government approved quarantine facility.
Minors travelling alone will be expected to comply with the COVID-19 guidelines/restrictions within the country, including the mandatory quarantine.
Plan ahead and make sure you:
can access money
understand what your insurance will cover
can make arrangements to extend your stay and be away for longer than planned
Travel in Panama
Panama is currently under a state of emergency.
Measures in place to combat the spread of COVID-19 vary by province. Sanitary cordons may be imposed at short notice to restrict travel between provinces.
Domestic flights are operating.
Nationwide measures
Since September 27, access to beaches is permitted at all times. Many venues – such as restaurants, bars, museums and other social events - have reduced capacity, although the consumption of alcohol is now permitted. Restrictions may be amended based on vaccination status. Respect the limits posted on signs at venues.
Some sporting events may require you to complete a QR code for “Safe Mobility” before entering the event. You must adhere to biosafety measures including the use of facemasks and maintaining the designated distance between individual groups or each person.
Panama will accept the UK’s proof of COVID-19 recovery and vaccination record. If you are travelling with a printed PDF proof of vaccination status, it must date from 1 November to ensure that the certificate can be scanned successfully, if domestic certification is required. Your NHS appointment card from vaccination centres is not designed to be used as proof of vaccination and should not be used to demonstrate your vaccine status.
Sanitary Cordons and Checkpoints
Sanitary cordons and checkpoints can be introduced with little or no notice. You may be randomly tested for COVID-19 if you are stopped.
Provincial COVID-19 Restrictions
Each province operates different regulations, including curfew measures. Make sure you check the local guidance from Panamanian authorities in your area. See the Ministry of Tourism website (in Spanish), Ministry of Health Twitter page (in Spanish) and Visit Panama website (in English)
Travel to and from the airport
Airports, ports and borders remain open; proof of good health will be required at these entry points.
Public spaces and services
Face masks
The wearing of masks outside of your accommodation is compulsory nationwide.
Transport
Rideshare apps such as “Uber” have resumed services in Panama. Yellow taxis are available too.
The police and security forces are empowered to enforce restrictions on movements and events due to the current state of emergency. You must follow their instructions.
The wearing of masks and face shields/visors is mandatory on all public transport.
Healthcare in Panama
If you are concerned that you may be unwell as a result of coronavirus, you should call the national hotline on 169, or use the Panamanian Government’s “R.O.S.A” (virtual clinic) to send a WhatsApp message, and follow their advice.
You can access the Panamanian public healthcare system on the same terms as Panamanians. Coronavirus tests in the public system, for those who meet the clinical requirement to be tested, will be free of charge.
From 6 March 2021, Panamanian authorities granted access to routine medical care and elective surgeries, provided medical facilities comply with the protocol established by the Panamanian Ministry of Health.
You should verify service availability with medical facilities, as most public and private centres do not accept walk-ins and require you to book an appointment prior to arrival.

COVID-19 vaccines if you live in Panama
Wherever possible British nationals should aim to be vaccinated in the country where they live. We will update this page when the Government of Panama announces new information on the national vaccination programme. You can sign up to get email notifications when this page is updated.
Panama’s national vaccination programme started in January 2021 and is using the Pfizer-BioNTech and AstraZeneca vaccines. British nationals resident in Panama are eligible for vaccination. The Panamanian authorities have created a portal to register for inclusion in the national vaccination programme. This is available for all Panamanian residents over the age of 16, including British nationals.
Find out more, including about vaccines that are authorised in the UK or approved by the World Health Organisation, on the COVID-19 vaccines if you live abroad.
If you’re a British national living in Panama, you should seek medical advice from your local healthcare provider. Information about COVID-19 vaccines used in the national programme where you live, including regulatory status, should be available from local authorities.
