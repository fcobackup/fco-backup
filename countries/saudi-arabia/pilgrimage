Warning
FCDO advises against all travel to parts of Saudi Arabia.

Many British nationals travel to Saudi Arabia each year for Umrah or Hajj pilgrimage.
Entry requirements for pilgrimage  
You should also read the main section on entry requirements. 
Hajj and Umrah
See the official Ministry of Hajj Twitter and the Nusuk Hajj platform for more information on Hajj 2024 and performing Umrah. 
Health risks and vaccination requirements  
You must have a valid certificate of vaccination against the ACWY strains of meningitis 10 days before arriving for Hajj and Umrah. For more information on health risks and vaccination requirements, read the TravelHealthPro Hajj and Umrah guide.
Scams 
UK-based organised crime groups target people planning Hajj or Umrah trips. Criminals pick people of any age, gender or location for their scams. Many victims are over the age of 65.  
To avoid scams: 
be aware you can only book a Hajj place on the Nusuk Hajj platform 
check Saudi Ministry of Hajj information for the procedures you must follow 
make sure your travel agent or operator is ATOL protected when booking Umrah  
research the travel company before you book, even if family or friends recommended it 
be wary of offers too good to be true – criminals advertise fraudulent deals through licensed travel companies 
Paying for trips 
When paying for your Hajj or Umrah visit: 
use a credit card where possible 
have an audit trail and keep a record of any transactions 
get everything confirmed in writing 
always ask for written terms and conditions 
Reporting fraud  
If you have been a victim of Hajj fraud in the UK, contact: 
your local police 
City of London Police Fraud Desk
