The information on this page covers the most common types of travel and reflects the UK government’s understanding of the rules currently in place. Unless otherwise stated, this information is for travellers using a full ‘British Citizen’ passport.
The authorities in the country or territory you’re travelling to are responsible for setting and enforcing the rules for entry. If you’re unclear about any aspect of the entry requirements, or you need further reassurance, you’ll need to contact the embassy, high commission or consulate of the country or territory you’re travelling to.
You should also consider checking with your transport provider or travel company to make sure your passport and other travel documents meet their requirements.
Coronavirus restrictions
Many travellers arriving in Italy are no longer required to self-isolate or report their address to health authorities.
You will only need to self-isolate if:
you are arriving in Italy from outside the EU, the UK or other countries listed on the Ministry of Foreign Affairs website, or;
you have spent less than 14 consecutive days physically located in your country of departure.
If these conditions apply to you, then you must;
arrive in Italy with a completed ‘Self-Declaration Form for Travel’ stating the purpose of your trip to Italy
report promptly to local health authorities
self-isolate for 14 days
More information on these requirements is available on the Ministry of Foreign Affairs frequently asked questions page. Note that there are additional measures in place for arrivals to the island of Sardinia, details of which can be found on the regional website (in Italian).
Many airports in Italy are closed, or operating a significantly reduced schedule. The only daily flights between Italy and the UK are between Rome Fiumicino and London Heathrow. See Return to the UK.
All travellers entering Italy must avoid using public transport and must arrange to be collected, take a taxi or hire a car.
Train companies have reduced domestic services and international travel is limited. Some cross-border bus companies are also cancelling their services.
Ports remain open for ships to disembark passengers. Passenger ferry schedules remain subject to change and cancellations. Speak to your tour operator or transport provider for the latest information.
More information on all these requirements is available from the Ministry of Foreign Affairs.
