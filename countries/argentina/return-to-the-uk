Borders remain open for departure. Commercial flights to the UK are available.
UK special flights
The UK operated two special flights from Argentina to help British travellers most at risk from the effects of COVID-19 to return to the UK. The flights departed on 7 and 12 May. There are currently no further UK special flights from Argentina.
Commercial flights
Every month the Argentine authorities approve a certain number of exceptional international commercial flights.
British Airways has flights which have been approved from Buenos Aires to London every Monday, Tuesday, Friday and Saturday in November. To book, visit the BA’s website.
Several indirect flights have also been approved for November. Check with your airline or travel company for the latest information.
Travelling to the airport
You can travel from your accommodation to the airport if you have a valid plane ticket and are not showing any symptoms of coronavirus.
You need to complete an electronic ‘sworn statement’ form within 48 hours of leaving, self-certifying that you are not suffering from symptoms associated with coronavirus and that you have not been in contact with confirmed cases in the preceding fortnight.
You are only allowed to arrive at the airport within 5 hours of your flight departing.
On 15 October the government of Argentina announced the resumption of limited domestic commercial flights and long distance buses. At present these are restricted to essential workers and those in need of medical treatment. Those who qualify must have a valid permit to circulate, known as a “Certificado Único Habilitante Para Circulación”. There may be other options for travelling overland, such as taking a taxi or hiring a car, but you are only permitted to travel to Buenos Aires if you have a valid ticket for an international flight which departs within 24 hours of your arrival. Please also note that vehicles are unable to stop overnight so there must be a minimum of two drivers for long journeys.
If you need to spend a night in Buenos Aires, you will need to find accommodation to meet the requirements of the nationwide quarantine, which prohibits you from leaving your accommodation without justification. See Moving around in Argentina
If you are planning to travel overland to Buenos Aires, you will need:
a copy of the letter issued by the Ministry of Health confirming that foreign nationals travelling to return to their country of origin are exempt from the nationwide quarantine rules
a letter issued from the British Embassy confirming that you should be allowed to travel.
proof that you have a confirmed international flight departing within 24 hours of your arrival in Buenos Aires.
possible additional permissions depending on your route and means of travel. Check this with the British Embassy, as far in advance as possible, and at least 2 working days ahead of your departure to allow enough time for the Argentine authorities to process any request. Please email returnfrom.argentina@fcdo.gov.uk with the following details:
confirmed flight details (airline, flight number, date and time)
if using a remise/taxi company, provide the name of the company and CUIT number
name of driver/s and their DNI (ID)
make and model of vehicle
license plate number
address of departure
date and time of departure
exact route to Buenos Aires
If you are being driven, your drivers must also have the relevant permits allowing them to make the journey.
Your journey home: re-entering the UK
When you return, you must follow the rules for entering the UK. You:
need to provide your journey and contact details up to 48 hours before you’re due to arrive in the UK
are not allowed to leave the place you’re staying for the first 14 days you’re in the UK except in very limited situations (known as ‘self-isolating’)

The National Travel Health Network and Centre (NaTHNaC) also provides advice on how to stay safe as you travel by air.
