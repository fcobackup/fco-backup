Government measures
Restrictive measures are in place until 31 May to combat the spread of COVID-19, with some restrictions being relaxed from 27 April and further restrictions lifted on 4 May. A list of additional services which can be accessed from 27 April can be found here and from the 4 May here.
The easing of restrictive measures will take place in stages across the country but at a slower pace in Baku, Sumgayit, Ganja and Lankaran and the Absheron Peninsula (where many restrictions still apply) and the rest of the country (where there are hardly any restrictions, and where SMS text approval is not needed).
In these towns and the Absheron Peninsula, people should only leave their residence to access one of the listed services, to obtain food or medicine, to work in an identified key sector, to seek medical treatment, or if in danger. Use of private cars should be only be for a serious necessity in order to limit movement.

If you work in a government identified key sector or in a permitted business your employer will register your details with the authorities so that you can travel freely on working days. If you work in a key sector ID cards or other identification documents, service cards or an official certificate should be carried when you need to leave your place of residence. This permission to travel freely is only valid on weekdays. Those not working in key sectors or permitted businesses must gain prior permission to leave their residence through the SMS permission system. Those working in key sectors must also use this system during weekends and on non-working days. A list of key sectors identified by the authorities and instructions how to use the SMS permission system can be found in English here.
Quarantine
The Azerbaijani authorities have informed that as of 25 March all nationals arriving from abroad will be placed in to state-run quarantine facilities for 14 days. These facilities include Baku based hotels, hospitals or the Olympic Village. You may be quarantined with someone you do not know, and families could be separated in different rooms. It is unlikely you will have direct access to one another during the period of time you spend in quarantine if this is the case. Similar procedures are also in place for British nationals who show signs of potential COVID-19 infection while staying in Azerbaijan.
If you or a British national you know is quarantined and needs consular assistance, contact the British Embassy. Call: +994 12 437 7878. You may hear a message stating that our offices are closed, however, we are available 24/7 – please stay on the line to select the option for ‘calling about an emergency involving a British National’ to speak to a Consular duty officer.” You can also reach us via Facebook.
