Montserrat is a separate legal jurisdiction to the United Kingdom and has its own laws.
There are harsh penalties if you are caught with drugs of any kind. You should observe the customs regulations on the importation and exportation of agricultural products and the protection of marine and animal life. There are a number of marine and animal specimens that may not be taken from the island. If in doubt check with the local customs authorities prior to the purchase, importation or exportation of such items.
Beach wear (swimwear) isn’t acceptable away from beach areas.
LGBT+
Homosexuality is legal under Montserrat law, but there’s no provision for marriage or civil partnerships between same-sex couples, and they aren’t recognised in law. Throughout the island, the general public is very conservative. In general people are tolerant of homosexual couples but don’t approve of public displays of affection between same-sex couples. Hotels don’t discriminate against same-sex couples and are generally welcoming to all, regardless of sexual orientation. See our information and advice page for the LGBT community before you travel.
