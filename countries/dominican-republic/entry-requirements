The information on this page covers the most common types of travel and reflects the UK government’s understanding of the rules currently in place. Unless otherwise stated, this information is for travellers using a full ‘British Citizen’ passport.
The authorities in the country or territory you’re travelling to are responsible for setting and enforcing the rules for entry. If you’re unclear about any aspect of the entry requirements, or you need further reassurance, you’ll need to contact the embassy, high commission or consulate of the country or territory you’re travelling to.
You should also consider checking with your transport provider or travel company to make sure your passport and other travel documents meet their requirements.
Restrictions in response to coronavirus
The Dominican Republic reopened its air borders on 1 July 2020. Land and sea borders are closed. This applies to journeys both to and from the Dominican Republic.
From 30 July until the end of September, anyone arriving in the Dominican Republic must provide evidence of a negative Polymerase Chain Reaction (PCR) test result, taken no more than 5 days prior to their arrival date. Dominican authorities will conduct tests on arrival for all individuals who do not provide their own negative test result. Should an individual test positive or exhibit coronavirus symptoms, then they will be isolated in specially prepared centres. As part of the immigration and customs process, you will be asked to fill out a Travellers Health Affidavit, confirming that you have not had any coronavirus symptoms and providing contact details.
You should comply with additional screening and other social distancing measures put in place by the authorities and follow instructions from the airport authorities. These regulations may be subject to change at short notice and you should check with your travel provider before your journey.
For further information please consult the Dominican Republic Travel Center.
Cruise ships are not being allowed to dock in Dominican ports.
Information is available (in Spanish) from the Ministry of the Presidency.
Regular entry requirements
Visas
British Citizens travelling to the Dominican Republic for tourism don’t need a visa.
As of April 2018, the tourism entry tax (previously known as a tourist card) is no longer collected upon arrival and should be included in your air fare. Contact your airline or tour operator if you’re unsure whether you have already paid this fee. The Dominican Republic Embassy website has more information.
On arrival you will normally be granted a 30-day stay. This can be extended to 90 days by paying for an extension when you leave the country. During the coronavirus (COVID-19) crisis, the tourist visa can be extended up to a total of 120 days: i.e. the 30 day original visa plus an extension of up to 90 days. If you’re planning to stay for longer, seek advice from a local lawyer or contact the local Immigration authorities.
As a foreign national you will be required to give your fingerprints and have a photograph taken in order to enter the Dominican Republic.
You must carry a photocopy of your identification (such as a passport), a copy of your entry stamp and proof of onward or return travel at all times, so that you can produce them if you’re asked to do so by the authorities.
Proof of onward or return travel
You may be refused entry if you don’t have proof of onward or return travel.
Passport validity
If you’re entering the Dominican Republic your passport should have at least 6 months’ validity remaining.
Departure tax
Departure tax is US$20. Scheduled airlines often include this charge in the price of the ticket. Check with your tour operator or travel provider.
Travelling with children
According to the Dominican Republic authorities, visitors under 18 travelling to the Dominican Republic don’t need written authorisation from their parents as long as they enter and leave with the same person or people. If visitors between the ages of 13 and 18 are travelling alone, or in a group with no one over 18, then parental authorisation is not required as long as the group remains the same on entry and exit.
Otherwise, a visitor under the age of 18 must carry a sworn affidavit drawn up by a solicitor and signed by the child’s parents or legal guardian(s) authorising their travel. The affidavit will need to be legalised by the  Foreign and Commonwealth Office (FCO) and the Dominican Republic Embassy   
UK Emergency Travel Documents
UK Emergency travel documents (ETDs) are accepted for entry, transit and exit from the Dominican Republic. Any travel document must have at least 6 months’ validity remaining to enter the Dominican Republic.
