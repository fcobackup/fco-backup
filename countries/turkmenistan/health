Before you travel check that:
your destination can provide the healthcare you may need
you have appropriate travel insurance for local treatment or unexpected medical evacuation
This is particularly important if you have a health condition or are pregnant.
Emergency medical number
Call 03 from a landline or 003 from a mobile and ask for an ambulance.
Contact your insurance or medical assistance company quickly if you’re referred to a medical facility for treatment.

See what health risks you’ll face in Turkmenistan.
Air quality in cities in Turkmenistan can deteriorate from time to time. Minimise your exposure by staying indoors in an air-conditioned environment. Wash all fruit, vegetables and other foods that might have been exposed, and regularly damp-dust indoor surfaces.
Typhoid and hepatitis A are endemic. You should drink or use only boiled and filtered or bottled water and avoid ice in drinks.
In the summer temperatures regularly reach 45°C in the shade, so drink plenty of water in the summer and avoid sunburn.
Medication
If you intend to enter Turkmenistan with medicines, whether prescription or non-prescription, check with your tour company or the Turkmenistan Embassy in London in advance whether there are any legal restrictions on those medicines.
You could be prosecuted for possession of some drugs that Turkmenistan may classify as narcotics, such as morphine or even strong painkillers, if you do not have a prescription, or if you’re carrying more than you need for your visit and do not declare them on arrival.
TravelHealthPro explains best practice when travelling with medicines.
Healthcare in Turkmenistan
There is no reciprocal healthcare agreement between the UK and Turkmenistan.
The quality of medical care is poor, and it is a lot more expensive than in the UK. Anything other than basic or emergency treatment, particularly outside Ashgabat, is usually best avoided. Make sure you have adequate travel health insurance and accessible funds to cover the cost of any medical treatment abroad and repatriation.
