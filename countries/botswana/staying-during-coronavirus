This page gives you guidance on how to stay safely in Botswana as a visitor, if you are unable to return to the UK.
Everyone should comply with the measures put in place in Botswana to limit the spread of coronavirus (COVID-19).
Moving around in Botswana
The government of Botswana declared a State of Public Emergency on 31 March, which has since been extended to six months.
The lockdown in the Greater Gaborone COVID-19 Zone was lifted from midnight Monday 15 June 2020.
A number of measures in response to the coronavirus pandemic are still in place, including legislation that makes it compulsory to wear masks / face coverings in public places, businesses and common areas of residential buildings.
The country is divided in to nine coronavirus zones. A travel permit is not required to travel within these coronavirus zones. However, you still require an individual travel permit to travel between these coronavirus zones.
You should comply with these requirements wherever you are staying in Botswana and continue to follow the advice of the Government of Botswana and local authorities.
You can find the latest updates about the coronavirus zones, masks/face coverings guidance and travel permit forms on the Government of Botswana’s Facebook page.

Finance
There is a range of financial support from the government that you can access while you are unable to return due to coronavirus restrictions.
If you’re in Botswana, and have exhausted all other options to cover essential living costs while you wait to return home, you could apply for an emergency loan for your living costs from the UK government. You can only apply if you normally live in the UK and you cannot return home. This last-resort option is for those most in need, and you would need to repay the loan when you are back in the UK. Apply for an emergency loan.
