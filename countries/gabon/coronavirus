No travel is risk-free during COVID. Countries may further restrict travel or bring in new rules at short notice, for example due to a new COVID-19 variant. Check with your travel company or airline for any transport changes which may delay your journey home.
If you test positive for COVID-19 while in Gabon you will be contacted by local authorities. If visiting, you will have to go to one of the hotels which the government of Gabon has nominated for isolation. This applies to all visitors aged 6 and over. There is no assistance available from the government for people who need to leave these hotels for any reason.
Holders of vaccination certificates can self-isolate in a facility of their choice and do not have to leave their passport. In addition, British nationals resident in Gabon who test positive are required to isolate at home and dial the toll free number 1410 for further instructions.
Plan ahead and make sure you:
