This page gives you guidance on how to stay safely in Hong Kong as a visitor, if you are unable to return to the UK.
Everyone should comply with the measures put in place in Hong Kong to limit the spread of coronavirus (COVID-19).
Moving around in Hong Kong
There are local travel restrictions in place in Hong Kong.
Social distancing measures
From Friday 8 May, the Hong Kong government prohibited group gatherings with more than eight people in public places. Failure to comply with the prohibition may result in a six month prison sentence and a substantial fine. If eating at a restaurant, no more than eight people can sit at a table.
Hospital isolation
Coronavirus patients are kept in isolation wards in Hong Kong hospitals until they twice test negative for coronavirus. You may be separated from your child if one of you tests positive for coronavirus. If this happens to you, you can call +(852) 2901 3000 for 24/7 urgent consular assistance. Non-residents may be charged for their care.
Quarantine measures
The Hong Kong SAR Government have implemented a range of quarantine measures in recent weeks.
Quarantine is usually spent at home or a residential address, but arrivals may be placed in a Hong Kong government quarantine centre. Family members of someone who tests positive, or those who have been in close contact, will also be required to go in to a government quarantine centre. Hong Kong residents who have been to Daegu or Gyeongsangbuk-do in Korea; Iran; or Emilia-Romagna, Lombardo or Veneto in Italy within the last 14 days will be allocated a government quarantine facility.
For all quarantine arrangements in Hong Kong:
you are not allowed to leave your designated quarantine location for 14 days. This means you are also unable to leave Hong Kong for the duration of the quarantine
you are not able to serve your 14 day quarantine in a hotel
if you are allocated a government quarantine centre, you may be asked to contribute around £20 (HK$200) per night towards the cost
items that can be taken in to government quarantine are restricted. There is no smoking allowed and no alcohol. Depending on your centre, facilities may be basic: there may be no fridge and no air-conditioning
if you are quarantined at your home address you will be expected to activate sharing of your real-time location with the Hong Kong government, or be tagged electronically
if you are arriving in Hong Kong from Europe and the US, during an initial trial of the technology, you will be issued with a bluetooth-enabled wristband which will be activated at the airport and linked to a mobile app ‘StayHomeSafe’ on your phone. The bluetooth-enabled wristbands will alert the authorities if the wearer leaves home with or without their phone
arrivals from other destinations may be issued with non-bluetooth wristbands
Failure to comply with the quarantine conditions may result in you being immediately taken to Government quarantine facilities. You could face a 6-month prison sentence and a substantial fine. You should comply with the requirements of your quarantine arrangements.
