See the TravelHealthPro website for further advice on travel abroad and reducing spread of respiratory viruses during the COVID-19 pandemic.
International travel
International air travel to South Africa has resumed, but strict health protocols are in place. You will need to show a paper copy of a negative PCR (polymerase chain reaction) COVID-19 test to border officials upon arrival in South Africa. The test must have taken place no more than 72 hours before your departure. It should be conducted by a certified medical practitioner, and should have the name and signature of the practitioner who conducted the test. You should carry several paper copies of your test, as you may need to present it more than once during your journey. If you do not present proof of a test upon arrival, you may be required to enter a government quarantine facility at your own cost. You will need to complete and produce an online travel health questionnaire on your personal device before arriving in South Africa. The questionnaire is available from the South Africa Department of Health See Entry requirements
Entry and borders
See Entry requirements to find out what you will need to do before and when you arrive in South Africa.
Travel in South Africa
Some internal flights are operating.
You must wear a mask if using public transport, which is operating with strict hygiene requirements and reduced passenger numbers.
You are required to wear a face mask when in public. Children aged 24 months or younger are not required to wear a face mask. However, regulations state that children aged two to five years should be ‘encouraged’ to wear a face mask while in public.
Failure to comply with South African government regulations could result in a fine or arrest.
Accommodation
Hotels, guest houses and private rental accommodation are allowed to open, with protective measures in place. Upon arrival at your accommodation, you will normally be subjected to a temperature test and asked to declare that you do not have coronavirus symptoms. Some accommodation providers will request your travel history. You should contact your accommodation provider for more information.
Public spaces and services
The South African authorities have published COVID-19 guidelines and advice and have introduced a number of measures to limit the spread of the virus. Failure to comply could result in a fine or arrest.
South Africa has introduced a risk-based, five-level approach to lockdown restrictions. Level one restrictions are in place across the country, but they may be enhanced in different provinces or districts (see additional local restrictions below).
National restrictions
Level one lockdown restrictions are in place across the country. There is a curfew between 11pm and 4am (with some regional variations). Consumption of alcohol in public spaces has been banned. You should ensure you are in your accommodation before the curfew begins. Road blocks are used to enforce curfew in some places.
Some beaches and public parks are temporarily closed (see below). Others are open from 9am to 6pm and are subject to strict health protocols. There are rules limiting the number of people who can gather in groups, and concerning the capacity of public places. More details on these can be found in the regulations published by the South African government.
Additional local restrictions
The Western Cape’s Garden Route district, as well as the Eastern Cape’s Nelson Mandela Bay metropolitan and Sarah Baartman district have been declared ‘hotspots’ by the government and have been placed under additional restrictions.
In these districts additional restrictions have been introduced to slow the spread of coronavirus. Curfew starts at 10pm (as opposed to beginning at 11pm elsewhere), and further restrictions are in place on alcohol sales. All beaches and public parks in the Eastern Cape and on the Garden Route are closed from 16 December until 03 January. Other level one restrictions continue to apply.
Beaches and public parks in KwaZulu-Natal are open from 9am to 6pm but will be closed on 16, 25, 26 and 31 December as well as from 01-03 January. Beach festivals, Christmas Eve and New Year’s Eve parties have been prohibited.
You should comply with any regulations set out by the South African government. See details on guidelines and relief.
Healthcare in South Africa
If you take regular medication, make sure you can access a repeat prescription if you need to. Most medicines that require a prescription from a doctor in the UK will require a ‘script’ in South Africa (‘script’ is the widely used term in South Africa for ‘prescription’). If you need a prescription in advance, you can visit a local doctor. The doctor might prescribe on the basis of your visit, or they may ask you to obtain an electronic prescription from your medical practitioner in the UK to allow them to write a script. Pharmacies are readily available, with larger pharmacy groups Dis-Chem and Clicks having stores across the country. Some (but not all) of these stores have medical practitioners on site who can write prescriptions.
Private hospitals in South Africa are prepared to treat COVID-19, and the standard of care may be higher than in government hospitals. Our experience suggests that only people who are showing symptoms of COVID-19 are able to get a test, at both private and public healthcare facilities.
For contact details for English speaking doctors, visit our list of doctors.
If you think you have COVID-19 symptoms, you should contact your health insurer for advice. You can also call the South African government local emergency hotline (0800029 999) or consult the online advice.
