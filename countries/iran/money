Accessing cash in Iran is difficult. Present currency volatility is making it even more so. Non-Iranian debit and cash cards will not work in Iran. It’s usually not possible to change travellers’ cheques.
It’s illegal to change money on the street. It is possible to exchange selected foreign currencies in some exchange bureaux, though you may experience difficulties changing money. Euros and USD are more commonly accepted. You should be clear before travelling how you will obtain enough Iranian Rials for your visit legally, and, if unsure, you may need to reconsider your travel plans.
