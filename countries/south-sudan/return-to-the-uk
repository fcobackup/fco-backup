There are currently extremely limited and no routine commercial options available to return to the UK from South Sudan. We know this is concerning for British people trying to leave South Sudan. On 24 March, the government of South Sudan announced the closure of all land borders (except for cargo) and suspended all international passenger flights.
Flights
Since 24 March, the South Sudan government has authorised special permission for a limited number of flights, but some of these flights did not happen.
We continue to work closely with airlines, the South Sudanese authorities and other embassies to make sure options are available for you to return to the UK as soon as possible.
This page will be updated when departure options become available.
Ethiopian Airlines flights
Ethiopian Airlines has approval to run flights between Addis Ababa and Juba every Thursday in May. These flights do not get confirmed until the last minute, and recent experience suggests they only happen if demand is high enough.
British nationals wishing to leave South Sudan should check Ethiopian airline’s website for information and to book. If a flight is listed, you can also contact the airline’s office in Juba to book.
The next flight due to depart Juba for Addis Ababa on Monday 1 June. Please book directly with Ethiopian airlines through their website or their country office in Juba. Also, ensure you have a confirmed ticket for an onward flight from Addis Ababa within 72hrs of arrival to avoid an obligatory (14 days) quarantine in Ethiopia.
You should check travel advice for guidance on transiting via Ethiopia.
If you cannot leave South Sudan
If you cannot leave South Sudan at this time, see advice on staying in South Sudan during coronavirus.

You will need to pay for your return travel to the UK. If departure options are available but you cannot afford the travel costs and have exhausted all other options for getting funds, you may be eligible to apply for an emergency loan from the government. This is a last resort option and you would need to repay the loan when you are back in the UK.
For more information, you should contact Corporate Travel Management (CTM). CTM are a commercial partner of the FCO and are authorised to administer such loans on behalf of the FCO.

The National Travel Health Network and Centre (NaTHNaC) provides advice on how to stay safe as you travel by air.
