The Foreign and Commonwealth Office (FCO) advise against all travel to the Parc du W and the contiguous hunting zones of Meêkrou and Djona. The Parc is tri-national and shares an open border with Burkina Faso and Niger. There is a risk of terrorist attacks throughout the Parc. See Terrorism
The FCO advise against all travel to the Pendjari National Park and adjacent hunting grounds; the area between the Parc du W National Park and the border with Niger; and to all other areas within 5km of the border with Burkina Faso.
The FCO advise against all but essential travel to the area between the Interstate Highway (RNIE) 2 (Tchaourou to Malanville) and the Nigerian border, due to increasing criminality in that area.
