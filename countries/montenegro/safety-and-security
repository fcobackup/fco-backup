Crime
Take sensible precautions to protect yourself and your belongings from street crime, particularly in larger towns. Don not leave valuables unattended and watch out for pick pockets in public places like tourist hot spots, beaches, airports and on public transport. Use a hotel safe if possible. Report all incidents of crime to the local police and get a police report. If you lose your passport, you should also contact the British Embassy Podgorica.
Incidents of violent crime between organised criminal groups can occur. You should exercise caution, remain vigilant and be aware of your surroundings. In the event of any incidents, you should follow the advice of local authorities.
The main emergency numbers are: 112 (general emergencies), 122 (police), 123 (fire department) and 124 (ambulance service).
Local travel 
Information on local road closures is available on the Auto-Moto Association of Montenegro website or by telephoning 19807, +382 20 234 999 or +382 63 239 987. You can also use these numbers to ask for roadside assistance.
Coronavirus
In light of the ongoing coronavirus (COVID-19) pandemic, the Montenegrin authorities have introduced severe restrictions on travel. See Coronavirus
Road travel
See the AA guide on driving in Montenegro.
Licences and documents
To drive you must have a valid driving licence and International Driving Permit (IDP). The correct IDP is the one issued in accordance with the 1968 UN Convention on Road Traffic. 1949 IDPs previously issued by the UK may no longer be accepted in Montenegro. You can get the IDP over the counter from 2,500 UK Post Offices. You will not be able to buy an IDP outside the UK, so get one before you travel.
If you bring your own or a rented vehicle into the country, you must have the original vehicle registration/ownership documents and a locally valid insurance policy with you. If you fail to carry the right documents, you will be refused entry and the car may be impounded until you can prove ownership. The FCO cannot assist you in confirming the validity of photocopied and/or emailed registration logbooks (V5C) nor obtain originals for you.
Check if your insurance provides European Green Card vehicle insurance valid in Montenegro. Drivers of cars registered on foreign plates and without a valid green card will be asked to buy temporary insurance valid for Montenegro, and available for purchase at all official border crossings (“granichno osiguranje” in Montenegrin).
Road standards
The standard of roads is fair to poor with conditions worsening in rural areas, especially in the winter and after bad weather. In particular, the two-lane Moraca Canyon in Montenegro can be dangerous when conditions are poor and there is overcrowding. Roads leading to Montenegro’s coastal areas are in better condition, but can be overcrowded during the summer season.
Driving regulations
By law you must wear a seatbelt. Riders of scooters, mopeds or motorcycles must wear a crash helmet.
You must drive with dipped headlights on during the day and must not use a mobile phone while driving. You must equip your car for winter conditions when the weather requires it.
Montenegrin traffic law defines intoxication as a blood alcohol level higher than 0.3 g/kg, or 0.1 g/kg for drivers younger than 24 or with less than 12 months of driving experience.
Exceeding the speed limit by just 10kph will get you a fine in Montenegro, while excessive speeding (30kph over the limit in towns and 50kph on motorways) and overtaking under dangerous conditions will lead to automatic confiscation of your driving licence. Fines for traffic offences range from €20 to €6,000. Prison sentences can also be imposed.
If you are issued with a fine, the issuing police officer will usually request payment is made to a bank account within a reasonable time. In certain circumstances your passport may be seized. If you deny the charge you have the right to appear in court. All fine receipts have serial numbers and can be monitored in a central register for 3 years.
If you are involved in a small traffic accident, you can request a police investigation at a cost of 50 euros. This fee is reimbursable from the person found guilty for causing the accident after completion of the court proceedings. Drivers can opt to complete a European accident report and submit it to their insurance company without a police investigation.
The only toll in Montenegro is the Sozina tunnel between Lake Skadar and the sea.

Extreme and adventure sports
A wide range of outdoor activities are on offer for tourists. Take precautions to prevent injuries and use protective equipment. Before signing up with paragliding instructors, for example, ask to see their training licence for tandem flights. Make sure you have a correct licence when renting vehicles, particularly jet ski. Take particular care when hiking in the Montenegrin mountains. Do not underestimate the hike: factors like weather, landscape, distance and elevation can increase the risks. Ask your guide about the required hiking equipment according to landscape and season; take fully charged mobile phone and enough supplies with you.
If you get into trouble, call the emergency number 112.
Political situation
In early 2020 there have been a series of largely peaceful protests over a new law on religion, which caused some disruption and road closures. You should exercise caution, keep up to date with local developments, check local media and avoid any demonstrations or large gatherings. In the event of any incidents, you should follow the advice of local authorities.
