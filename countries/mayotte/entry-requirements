Entry rules in response to coronavirus (COVID-19)
On 12 May 2022, the French government announced that travel restrictions between France and French Guiana would be relaxed. If you’re unvaccinated, you no longer need a compelling reason for travel or proof of a negative COVID-19 test before travel.
You may still face restrictions for entry to Mayotte depending on your vaccination status and your country of departure. You should check the status of your country of departure and relevant restrictions on the French government’s website, and the local Prefecture’s website (in French) for details on any remaining local restrictions. For more information on specific entry measures, you should consult the French government website and this French government COVID-19 website (in French).
