Residents of Malta are eligible for the vaccine. Further details can be found on the Ministry Health website https://deputyprimeminister.gov.mt/en/health-promotion/covid-19/Pages/vaccines.aspx.

Check with the provider that results will be available in time for your flight. If you test positive, you will have to self-isolate for 14 days. Make sure your travel insurance covers this eventuality.
You can schedule a test at any private testing clinic in Malta. The Malta Tourism Authority has collated a list of some of the possible providers.
