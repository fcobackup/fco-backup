The Brazilian government has stated that the public health system should not be used for pre-departure tests. Travellers should obtain a test from a private provider.
Be prepared for your plans to change
No travel is risk-free during COVID-19. Countries may further restrict travel or bring in new rules at short notice, for example due to a new COVID-19 variant. Check with your travel company or airline for any transport changes which may delay your journey home.
If you test positive for COVID-19, you may need to stay where you are until you test negative. You may also need to seek treatment there.
Plan ahead and make sure you:
can access money
understand what your insurance will cover
can make arrangements to extend your stay and be away for longer than planned
Travel in Brazil
On 23 November 2022 the Brazilian government reinstated the requirement to use face masks inside airports and on flights as a safety precaution to limit the spread of COVID-19. You should check the website of the airport you are flying into or transiting through to see how this could affect you.
A number of Brazilian states no longer mandate the use of face masks and face coverings while in public. However, the guidance may vary from state to state and there can often be different rules within different cities. You should refer to official guidance in your location for details of what preventative measures are in place and how you can comply with them.
There are additional local requirements to show proof of vaccination in order to access certain places, such private venues, including hotels, restaurants and gyms. The precise requirements may vary from venue to venue so you should check on compliancy requirements in advance.
Accommodation
Hotels are operating at capacities dictated by local rules and regulations.
Public spaces and services
Some states and cities have reinstated the requirement to wear a mask on public transport. The situation varies around Brazil. Each state will determine local measures to limit the spread of COVID-19, and this includes regulation on public transport and on the opening of non-essential services (shops, restaurants, bars, beaches and other leisure activities). You should refer to official guidance in your location for details of what preventative measures are in place and how you can comply with them.
Healthcare in Brazil
If you think you have COVID-19 symptoms, you should self isolate for 14 days. You should only go to hospital if you are feeling breathless.
The public healthcare system varies across the country, and in some states in Brazil the additional burden of treating COVID-19 patients might affect services such as accident & emergency care. Some private hospitals are no longer accepting credit card payments for admissions and only accepting patients with valid health insurance.
Check if your travel or health insurance has comprehensive cover for coronavirus and refer to official channels in your location for further details.
