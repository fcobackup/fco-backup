Although there have been no recent attacks in Trinidad and Tobago, more than 100 Trinidad and Tobago nationals travelled to Syria and Iraq to fight along with Daesh (formerly referred to as ISIL). In February 2018, the local authorities arrested some individuals who had planned to carry out attacks against Carnival 2018.
There’s also a threat from individuals who may have been inspired by terrorist groups, including Daesh and al Qaeda, to carry out so-called ‘lone actor’ attacks targeting public events or places.
On 1 November 2017, the Government of Trinidad and Tobago announced that it had approved a national counter-terrorism strategy, and that an action plan to address violent extremism had been drafted. The Minister of National Security has spoken publically about Trinidad and Tobago’s efforts to tackle terrorism and violent extremism, including through co-operation with the UK.
There’s a heightened threat of terrorist attack globally against UK interests and British nationals, from groups or individuals motivated by the conflict in Iraq and Syria. You should be vigilant at this time.
