The hurricane season in the Dutch Caribbean normally runs from June to November. You should monitor local and international weather updates from the Meteorological department of Curacao (servicing all Islands within the Dutch Kingdom) and the National Hurricane Centre, and follow the advice of the local authorities.
See our Tropical cyclones page for advice about how to prepare effectively and what to do if you’re likely to be affected by a hurricane or tropical cyclone.
Most hurricanes pass well to the north of Bonaire, which has no record of a recent major hurricane; there are occasional tropical storms. Statia and Saba, and many other islands in the northern and eastern Caribbean have experienced some quite severe hurricanes.
