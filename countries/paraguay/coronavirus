Cases of coronavirus (COVID-19) have been confirmed in Paraguay. The Paraguayan authorities have introduced measures to limit the spread of the virus.
These regulations are subject to change and the situation is changing rapidly. Please follow the instructions of the Paraguayan authorities as new measures may be brought in with short notice.
Borders and travel
The Paraguayan government has closed the country’s airports for all arrivals except Paraguayan citizens and resident foreign nationals effective from 18 March until 30 March, and closed the bridge between the city of Ciudad del Este and Foz de Iguacu (Brazil).
On 12 March, the government announced a suspension of direct flights to and from Spain from 13 - 26 March. Air Europa provide the only direct service between Europe and Paraguay.
The Paraguayan government has announced that they expect all flights to stop operating out of Paraguay from Saturday 21 March. The FCO strongly encourage non-resident British nationals in Paraguay to consider leaving to avoid difficulties they will face if flights out of the country and the region are further restricted and they are unable to get home.
Non-resident British nationals in Paraguay who wish to leave should contact their airline or tour operator. We suggest you look at booking flights through other countries such as Brazil while it is still a possibility.
Those who have arrived in Paraguay within the last 14 days must comply with the self-isolation requirement for 14 days or leave the country immediately.
If you present symptoms after having entered the country, you should contact the Paraguayan Ministry of Health at 154 / 911 or INERAM hospital at (021) 290 838. British nationals in Paraguay should follow the advice of the Paraguayan authorities.
Local measures
Paraguayan authorities have declared a nationwide State of Sanitary Emergency.
There is a ban on all non-essential movement nationwide until 28 March. There are exceptions to buy food, go to the pharmacy, take someone to hospital and for key workers.
Freedom of movement is restricted from 8pm to 4am. Further details can be found on the Paraguayan Ministry of Interior’s website (in Spanish).
The Paraguayan authorities have implemented measures such as the temporary closure of schools, universities and public parks, and are asking people to stay at home. This measure also includes the cancellation of mass events (public and private) such as concerts, religious, sports, leisure and political activities plus gatherings in closed theatres such as cinemas and conventions. The measures are in place since 11 March and will last for 15 days.
All British nationals in Paraguay should follow the advice of the Paraguayan authorities.
