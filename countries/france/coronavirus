Travel in France
France has put measures in place to limit the spread of COVID-19.
France began progressive deconfinement from 11 May. Each départment was categorised ‘red’, ‘orange’ or ‘green’, dictating the extent to which measures could be relaxed. Currently all départments in mainland France are categorised as ‘green’. Certain confinement measures may still apply, however, depending on the department you are in. For more information see the government website.
Public spaces and services
Since 11 May, wearing masks on public transport is compulsory for all users aged 11 and over, with fines for those who are not compliant. Masks are also compulsory in taxis and private hire vehicles without a plexiglass screen.
Healthcare in France
The French government advises those with possible coronavirus symptoms to call 112. You should not go directly to the doctor or emergency services.
