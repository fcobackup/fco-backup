There remain commercial options to return to the UK from Australia.
If you live in the UK and are currently visiting Australia, you are strongly advised to return now by commercial means. Don’t run the risk of getting stranded.
You should contact your airline, travel provider or tour operator and insurance company now to make arrangements to return as soon as possible.
UK special charter flights will only operate for priority countries where commercial flights are not possible. You should not assume that these flights will become available in countries where commercial routes are operating.
See more information and advice about staying where you are if you cannot return to the UK.
Flights
Flight options from Australia to the UK and within Australia are becoming increasingly restricted following the tightening of entry restrictions for Australia and for countries through which flights transit.
The following airlines are advising that they are currently flying to the UK: • Qatar Airways (via Doha) - one flight per day from each of Sydney, Melbourne and Perth until further notice; one flight per day from Brisbane until 15 April • Qantas - one flight per week from Melbourne to London from 19 April for 3 weeks
British Airways, Emirates and Etihad are amongst the airlines which have advised that they have currently temporarily suspended flights to and from Australia.
Qantas and Jetstar are running domestic flights within Australia. Virgin Australia and Tigerair have currently suspended their domestic flights.
Given the fast changing situation, you should contact airlines and tour operators directly on availability and current status of flights, or to discuss alternative arrangements if you have bookings for suspended flights.
You will need to pay for your return travel to the UK. If you cannot afford travel costs and have exhausted all other options for getting funds, you may be eligible to apply for an emergency loan from the government. This is a last resort option and you would need to repay the loan when you are back in the UK. For more information, call CTM toll free on 1800 105 334 or, if outside Australia, on +61 2 8268 4100, or email them at UKrepatriationsaust@travelctm.com. CTM is authorised to administer such loans on behalf of the FCO.
Travelling to the airport
If you are already in Australia, you may travel by air to another Australian State to transit to an international flight as long as you hold a confirmed booking for that flight. You do not need to seek an exemption. You will be required to stay within the airport for the duration of your transit, or if transiting overnight, you will need to self-isolate in a hotel. In Western Australia, your transit time must be no more than 24 hours.
There are currently no restrictions if you are travelling by road to an airport within the same State. Some States require you to apply for an exemption to cross their borders. Given the fast changing situation, you should check State and Territory websites for the latest information. Links can be found on the Australian Government Coronavirus website.
Arrival in the UK
When you arrive back in the UK, follow the guidance for when you return to the UK on steps you should take to protect yourself and others.
