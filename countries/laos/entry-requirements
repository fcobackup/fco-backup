The information on this page covers the most common types of travel and reflects the UK government’s understanding of the rules currently in place. Unless otherwise stated, this information is for travellers using a full ‘British Citizen’ passport.
The authorities in the country or territory you’re travelling to are responsible for setting and enforcing the rules for entry. If you’re unclear about any aspect of the entry requirements, or you need further reassurance, you’ll need to contact the embassy, high commission or consulate of the country or territory you’re travelling to.
You should also consider checking with your transport provider or travel company to make sure your passport and other travel documents meet their requirements.
Visas
With immediate effect, the Government of the Lao PDR has suspended the visa on arrival service at all international entry points. No visas are being issued to people travelling from a country with COVID-19. However, the Lao authorities may consider granting entry permission for foreigners (experts, technicians and foreign nationals that are required for essential projects) who wish to come to Laos:
All foreigners must present a Certificate of Entry (issued by the MFA); a completed Declaration form; and a ‘Fit to Fly’ Certificate issued no more than 72 hours prior to travel.
All arrivals will be subject to a free COVID-19 test. Positive cases will be admitted to hospital for quarantine.
All negative cases have to undergo 14 days quarantine at designated locations (with all expenses covered by individuals or their organisations/companies). The application form for the health declaration is available on the official website for the Ministry of Foreign Affairs.
Visa conditions change regularly. For the most up to date information, contact the nearest Lao Embassy or Consulate.
If you are eligible for a visa when you enter Laos, make sure you get an entry stamp in your passport. Not having a legitimate entry stamp could lead to arrest or a large fine.
In normal circumstances, overstaying your visa is a serious offence in Laos and the police are likely to issue heavy fines and detain those who are caught. Tourist visas can be extended 2 times and up to a total of 90 days. Tourists are required to check in with the immigration every 30 days in order to obtain this extension. However due to the impacts of coronavirus the Ministry of Foreign affairs will continue to extend visas in country and be flexible if visas cannot be extended before the due date for operational reasons because of the new regulations.
Regional travel
Border crossings remain closed, however the use of the Lao-Thai Friendship Bridge for non-COVID 19 related medical emergencies is permitted by ambulance. Thailand currently allows only two crossings per annum at the land border between Laos and Thailand. See travel advice for Thailand for further information.
Passport validity
Your passport should have at least 6 months’ validity remaining on your date of entry into Laos.
Additionally, be aware that a number of airlines will now only allow boarding of flights to Laos if you have two blank pages in your passport.
Yellow fever certificate requirements
Check whether you need a yellow fever certificate by visiting the National Travel Health Network and Centre’s TravelHealthPro website.
Health screening
Enhanced health screening is in place and border crossings between Laos, Thailand, Cambodia, and Vietnam are closed. You should allow additional time to include this possibility and check with your airline if travelling by air.
Anybody travelling to Laos with a fever, cough or difficulty breathing, and a travel history from coronavirus affected countries, will be isolated in hospital and tested. The hospitals being used are Mittaphab, Mahosot, Setthathirath and the National Military Hospital (103).
Local medical care
If you have a travel history to an outbreak area and develop symptoms after entering Laos, call +856 20 5406 6777 to speak to a duty officer in Laos or English, or the free hotline numbers 155 and 166.
UK Emergency Travel Documents
UK Emergency Travel Documents (ETDs) are accepted for entry, airside transit and exit from Laos. If you’re planning to enter Laos using a UK ETD you should contact the nearest Lao embassy or consulate to get the appropriate visa before you travel.
If your passport has been lost or stolen, you must report the loss or theft to the nearest police station and get a police report. You’ll then need to get a certificate of loss from the Immigration Department in Vientiane which usually takes 1 to 2 working days.
After getting an ETD from the British Embassy, you’ll need to get an exit visa from the Lao Ministry of Foreign Affairs which takes up to 3 days.
