Cases of coronavirus (COVID-19) have been confirmed in Hong-Kong. The authorities have introduced a number of measures to limit the spread of the virus.
Transit through Hong Kong Airport
From Wednesday 25 March, transit services will be suspended at Hong Kong International Airport.
Entry restrictions
Travellers arriving in Hong Kong on flights from overseas countries/territories, who are not Hong Kong residents, will be denied entry to Hong Kong. Non-Hong Kong residents travelling to Hong Kong from mainland China, Macao or Taiwan will also be denied entry if they have been to any overseas country/territory in the past 14 days.
All travellers entering Hong Kong, including Hong Kong residents, will have to take a mandatory medical test for coronavirus and will be required to undergo 14-day compulsory quarantine. Quarantine is usually spent at a residential address, but arrivals may be placed in a Hong Kong government quarantine centre.
All border crossings with mainland China remain closed indefinitely, with the exception of the Shenzhen Bay Checkpoint and the Hong Kong-Zhuhai-Macau Bridge. All ferry crossings between Hong Kong and mainland China, and Hong Kong and Macao have ceased. Kai Tak Cruise and Ocean Terminals are also closed to passengers indefinitely.
Health Declaration form
All inbound travellers via Hong Kong International Airport are required to submit a health declaration form.
Health screening and coronavirus testing
All arrivals will be subject to advanced screening measures, including temperature checks. Those deemed to have a high temperature will undergo further checks by the Port Health Office at the airport. If they meet further risk criteria, they will be transferred to a Hong Kong public hospital for mandatory checks/treatment.
From 8 April, all asymptomatic arrivals at Hong Kong International Airport will have to provide a saliva sample which will be tested for coronavirus. After collecting baggage, travellers will be taken by shuttle bus to the AsiaWorld Expo centre, adjacent to the airport, where a temporary testing facility has been set up.
From 9 April, if you are arriving in Hong Kong from the UK, you need to wait in the testing facility until you receive your results. The Hong Kong government advise that this process should take around 8 hours to complete, though you should be prepared for it to last significantly longer. If you are arriving in Hong Kong from destinations other than the UK, you are permitted to travel to your mandatory quarantine location after you have provided a saliva sample to be tested.
If the sample tests positive, the Hong Kong authorities will notify you and arrange for admission to a public hospital. If you do not receive notification that you have tested positive within three working days, you should assume that the test result is negative. All arrivals, including those who test negative for coronavirus, are required to undergo 14-day compulsory quarantine. See “Quarantine measures” above.
See the Hong Kong Government coronavirus website for further details.
Hospital Isolation
Coronavirus patients are kept in isolation wards in Hong Kong hospitals until they test negative for coronavirus twice. You may be separated from your child if one of you tests positive for coronavirus. If this happens to you, you can call +(852) 2901 3000 for 24/7 urgent consular assistance.
Quarantine measures
The Hong Kong SAR Government have implemented a range of quarantine measures in recent weeks.
Quarantine is usually spent at home or a residential address, but arrivals may be placed in a Hong Kong government quarantine centre. Hong Kong residents who have been to Daegu or Gyeongsangbuk-do in Korea; Iran; or Emilia-Romagna, Lombardo or Veneto in Italy within the last 14 days will be allocated a government quarantine facility.
From 11 April, if you are spending your quarantine in a government quarantine centre, you may be asked to move to home quarantine for the final four days of your quarantine when necessary due to limited space in quarantine centres.
For all quarantine arrangements in Hong Kong:
You are not allowed to leave your designated quarantine location for 14 days. This means you are also unable to leave Hong Kong for the duration of the quarantine.
You are not able to serve your 14 day quarantine in a hotel.
If you are allocated a government quarantine centre, it is likely that you will have to contribute around £20 (HK$200) per night towards the cost.
You will be expected to activate sharing of your real-time location with the Hong Kong government, or be tagged electronically.
If you are arriving in Hong Kong from Europe and the US, during an initial trial of the technology, you will be issued with a bluetooth-enabled wristband which will be activated at the airport and linked to a mobile app ‘StayHomeSafe’ on your phone.
Arrivals from other destinations may be issued with non-bluetooth wristbands.
The bluetooth-enabled wristbands will alert the authorities if the wearer leaves home with or without their phone.
Failure to comply with the quarantine conditions may result in a six month prison sentence and a substantial fine. You should comply with the requirements of your quarantine arrangements.
Social distancing measures
From Sunday 29 March, the Hong Kong government will prohibit group gatherings with more than four people in public places. Failure to comply with the prohibition may result in a six month prison sentence and a substantial fine.
