Healthcare in Tanzania
A rise in the number of coronavirus cases in Tanzania may have an adverse effect on the availability of medical facilities and personnel throughout the country. Access to treatment for non-coronavirus-related illnesses, particularly for non-urgent care, may be adversely limited.
There have been instances during the COVID-19 outbreak when hospitals in Dar es Salaam reached full capacity due to the high volume of COVID-19 cases. Limited hospital capacity throughout Tanzania could result in life-threatening delays for emergency medical care.
