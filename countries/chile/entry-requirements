This page has information on travelling to Chile.
This page reflects the UK government’s understanding of current rules for people travelling on a full ‘British Citizen’ passport from the UK, for the most common types of travel.
The authorities in Chile set and enforce entry rules. The British Embassy cannot intervene on Chilean entry rules. If you’re unsure how Chile’s entry requirements apply to you, contact its UK embassy, high commission or consulate.
All travellers
All travellers should familiarise themselves with the entry rules for Chile before travel.
If you are a British passport holder visiting Chile for less than 90 days, you do not need a visa. Your passport should be valid for the proposed duration of your stay. No additional period of validity beyond this is required.
Review the entry requirements into Chile very carefully. These change depending on the COVID ‘Alert Level’ in Chile, at the time of your entry. Chile is currently in Alert Level 1.
a pre-departure test is recommended for all travellers arriving in Alert Level 1, but is not mandatory only in this alert level
at Alert Levels 2 and 3, all travellers are required to have a negative pre-departure PCR test SARS-COV-2 (rapid and antigen tests are not accepted), taken no more than 72 hours before boarding the final flight into Santiago. Children under 2 years old do not need to meet this requirement
non-resident foreigners are recommended to have a valid Mobility Pass (‘Pase de movilidad’). This is optional only in the lowest alert level (Alert Level 1) but is mandatory for entry into Chile in Alert levels 2 and 3. You must validate your vaccinations in order to obtain a valid Mobility Pass with Chilean authorities
Mobility Pass requirements:
to apply for a Mobility Pass visit ‘MeVacuno website’. Foreign visitors can create an account linked to their email address to access the site
you should request your Mobility Pass well in advance of your travel. After registering your vaccines, and once approved, a mobility pass document with a QR code will be issued
Chilean authorities and/or travel companies will request a Mobility Pass in order to travel between regions in trips of more than 200 kilometres. The only alternative to this requirement for interregional trips is providing proof of a negative PCR test taken in Chile no more than 48 hours before the interregional trip. This alternative only applies to people that do not have a Mobility Pass; it is not an option for people who have had their Mobility Pass disabled
Arrival at airport:
non-resident foreigners need to hold proof of travel insurance covering a minimum of $30,000 USD for COVID-related issues for the entire duration of your stay
All travellers need to complete an affidavit (Declaración Jurada) up to 48 hours before boarding. This will generate a QR-code document (sent by e-mail), which you must show to the airline when checking-in and during the health screening process on arrival in Chile.
Upon arrival, you should follow the instructions of airport authorities regarding testing requirements. You might need to undergo an antigen or PCR test SARS-COV-2, either in the airport or at an external laboratory outside the airport. If the latter, you will need to do this within 24 hours of arrival. If you undergo an antigen test, you will need to wait for the results in the airport. If the result is positive, non-resident foreigners will be denied entry into the country.
Non-resident foreign nationals with two vaccinations will be entitled to a Mobility Pass valid for 30 days and those with a booster shot will be entitled to 90 days.
Please bear in mind that you will be required to show your Mobility Pass to enter many private and public places in Chile.
More information about what you need to do when you enter Chile can be found on the Chilean government website, selecting ‘Plan Fronteras Protegidas’.
Validation of vaccinations for foreign citizens:
Foreign citizens can request validation of their vaccinations for the Mobility Pass within a maximum of 48 business hours. If the process takes more than 48 business hours, the applicant will automatically receive a Temporary Mobility Pass. This temporary pass has the same validity as a Mobility Pass and is valid for 96 hours, even if the application for a mobility pass is eventually rejected. Minors under 18 years old can enter Chile without a Mobility Pass when accompanied by their parents or guardians who do hold a Mobility Pass.
If the application for a Mobility Pass is rejected after 96 hours, holders of a Temporary Mobility Pass will be able to take a PCR test or antigen test for SARS-CoV-2 in an ISP (Instituto de Salud Publica) certified laboratory. The test result will be valid for 24 hours and will be accepted as a Mobility Pass substitute in all activities that require a Mobility Pass.
Current information on the process can be found on the Ministry of Health website. Many establishments in Chile will still require a valid mobility pass for entry.
Proof of vaccination status
Chile will accept the UK’s proof of COVID-19 recovery and vaccination record and proof of COVID-19 vaccination issued in the Crown Dependencies, but only for the purpose of applying for a Mobility Pass. Your NHS appointment card from vaccination centres cannot be used to demonstrate your vaccine status. The UK’s proof of COVID-19 recovery and vaccination record will not be accepted in lieu of a Mobility Pass.
You must validate your vaccination status with Chilean authorities to receive a Mobility Pass. To apply for a Mobility Pass visit ‘MeVacuno website’. Foreign visitors can create an account with an email to access the site.
If you’ve had COVID-19 in the past month
If you test positive for COVID-19 a month preceding your boarding to Chile, and if 72 hours prior to boarding, you continue to test positive, you can replace the negative PCR result by showing Chilean authorities the two positive PCR test results. One of the positive PCR tests must have been taken up to 72 hours prior to boarding, the other positive PCR test must have been taken more than 10 days prior to the date of boarding but less than one month before boarding.
Children and young people
If you travel with children under 18 years old, you must review the documents you will need to show upon entry on the Chilean Ministry of Foreign Affairs website.
Children under 18 years old
All children under 18 years old (including non-resident foreigners) are allowed to enter Chile without a mobility pass if they comply with all of the following requirements:
present a negative PCR test SARS-COV-2 (rapid and antigen tests are not acceptable), taken no more than 72 hours before boarding the final flight into Santiago. Children under 2 years old do not need to meet this requirement
complete an affidavit (Declaración Jurada) up to 48 hours before boarding. This will generate a QR-code document (sent by e-mail), which you must show to the airline in check-in and during the health screening process on arrival in Chile. Health authorities at Santiago Airport will request all travellers complete a daily ‘self-report’ – for 7 days – via an online form or ‘C19 AutoReporte’ application. The health authorities will provide the detail of this process by email following the health screening.
accompanied by a parent or guardian who has a valid mobility pass. Many establishments in Chile will still require children over 12 years old to have a valid mobility pass for entry into their facility e.g. a restaurant or cinema
Children under 18 years old travelling alone (without a parent or guardian) will require a valid Mobility Pass.
If you’re transiting through Chile
Transiting through Chile on your way to another country without exiting the airport premises and without transiting to a domestic flight is permitted. Nevertheless, if you wish to exit the airport or if your transit comprises flying to another city within Chile, Chilean authorities will require you to meet all the current entry requirements.
A Mobility Pass will be requested by Chilean authorities or travel companies when travelling between regions in trips of more than 200 kilometres. An alternative to this requirement for interregional trips will be a negative PCR test result taken in Chile no more than 48 hours before the trip. This alternative will only apply to people that do not have a Mobility Pass and will not apply to people who have had their Mobility Pass disabled.
Check your passport and travel documents before you travel
Passport validity
Your passport should be valid for the proposed duration of your stay. No additional period of validity beyond this is required.
If you are a resident in Chile, your passport must be valid when entering the country.
Check with your travel provider to make sure your passport and other travel documents meet their requirements.
Visas
If you are a British passport holder visiting Chile for less than 90 days, you do not need a visa.
On arrival in Chile the immigration authorities will issue you with a ‘Tarjeta de Turismo - Tourist Card’, an A5 sized white form. You must keep this document on a safe place and present it to immigration when you leave the country. If you lose it, you should request a copy of the Tourist card on the PDI website choosing the option ‘Duplicado de Tarjeta de Turismo’, at the nearest PDI office or at the office at Santiago airport.
Please note that the official website for digital procedures for Chilean immigration is in the process of being changed as a result of the approval of the Regulation of Law No. 21.325 (‘El portal oficial de trámites digitales del Servicio de Migraciones se encuentra en proceso de cambio producto de la aprobación del Reglamento de la Ley N° 21.325’.) This change is likely to affect any visa extension or ‘Prorroga de Turismo’.
Closely review the Chilean Immigration Department (Extranjeria) website for any updates regarding visas. Telephone: 600 626 4222.

British-Chilean dual nationals must enter and leave Chile using their Chilean passport. Chilean entry and exit requirements for dual nationals may change without notice. For further information check with the nearest Chilean Embassy.
Travelling with children
Chile has strict requirements for the entry and exit of minors under the age of 18.
Children born in Chile require a Chilean passport to leave.
Children under 18 years old, who are leaving Chile alone, with only one parent/guardian, with friends or relatives, must get authorisation to travel from a Chilean notary (“notaría”) before travelling.
UK Emergency Travel Documents
UK Emergency Travel Documents (ETD) are accepted for entry, airside transit and exit from Chile. Your ETD must be valid for the proposed duration of your stay. Dual British/Chilean nationals must have a Chilean travel document (passport) to be allowed to depart - UK ETDs cannot substitute this requirement.
