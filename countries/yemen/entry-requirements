Warning
FCDO advises against all travel to Yemen.

This information is for people travelling on a full ‘British citizen’ passport from the UK who choose to travel against FCDO advice. It is based on the UK government’s understanding of the current rules for the most common types of travel. 
The authorities in Yemen set and enforce entry rules. If you’re not sure how these requirements apply to you, contact the Yemeni Embassy in the UK.  
COVID-19 rules 
There are no COVID-19 testing or vaccination requirements for travellers entering Yemen. 
Passport validity requirements 
To enter Yemen, your passport must have an ‘expiry date’ at least 6 months after the date you arrive.  
Check with your travel provider that your passport and other travel documents meet requirements. Renew your passport if you need to.  
You will be denied entry if you do not have a valid travel document or try to use a passport that has been reported lost or stolen. 
Visa requirements 
You must have a visa to enter Yemen.  
Applying for a visa 
Apply for a visa through the Yemeni Embassy in the UK.   
Vaccine requirements  
For details about medical entry requirements and recommended vaccinations, see TravelHealthPro’s Yemen guide.   
Registering with the authorities 
If you visit Yemen for more than 14 days, you must register your passport with the Yemen immigration authorities after you arrive.  
Customs rules 
There are strict rules about goods you can take into or out of Yemen. You must declare anything that may be prohibited or subject to tax or duty. 
Taking money into and out of Yemen 
Import and export of local currency is illegal. There are no restrictions on the import of foreign currencies, but you must declare amounts higher than 3,000 US dollars. Export of foreign currencies must not exceed the amount imported. 
There are not many ATMs outside of Sana’a. US dollars in cash is the most easily convertible currency.
