Cases of coronavirus (COVID-19) have been confirmed in Sri Lanka. The Sri Lankan Government is taking measures to prevent the spread of the virus. You should comply with screening measures put in place by the authorities.
Entry and borders
Flights to Sri Lanka have been suspended since 19 March. If you’re visiting Sri Lanka, you’re strongly advised to leave now, while commercial departure options are available. See Return to the UK
The Sri Lankan government has announced that people who arrived in Sri Lanka after 1 March should register with the police by telephone via the emergency 119 service or by calling the local station. Speak to your hotel or tour company for assistance.
Cruise ship passengers will not be allowed to disembark in the country, including for temporary shore visits. You should speak to your tour operator for further information on the impact on any existing travel plans.
Local measures
A nationwide curfew is in place. There have been reports of food distribution problems in some areas. In addition, the authorities have quarantined a number of towns where they judge the immediate risk to be highest. Curfews are subject to last-minute changes. Checkpoints have been introduced in a number of places, and those not adhering to the restrictions risk arrest. Speak to your hotel or travel agent for the latest information, and follow the instructions of the security forces at all times.
Visas
No new visas will be issued to British nationals currently outside Sri Lanka, and any British nationals arriving in Sri Lanka are now subject to mandatory 14-day quarantine period in military-run quarantine camps.
Hotel bookings
A small number of tourists have reported problems with hotels trying to cancel bookings made by foreign visitors, and some incidents of harassment. Speak to your travel agent about any accommodation booking problems, and report any incidents of harassment to the police first and then to the British High Commission.
Further information
Further information on coronavirus, including advice on preparing for foreign travel and helping reduce the spread of the virus, is available from Public Health England and on the TravelHealthPro website.
