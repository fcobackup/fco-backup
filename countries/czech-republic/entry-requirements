Entry rules in response to coronavirus (COVID-19)
Entry to the Czech Republic
From 18 December, you are only allowed to enter the Czech Republic for essential purposes, such as work, essential health or family trips or to attend a funeral. Entry for tourism is not permitted. Border controls have not been reintroduced, but you may be asked to prove that the purpose of your visit is essential. Hotels and accommodation providers are closed in the Czech Republic.
On 20 December, the Czech Government introduced a mandatory quarantine period for those who have travelled from the UK, or spent more than 24 hours in the UK during the past 14 days. If this applies to you, you should self-isolate, and take a Covid-19 PCR test between 5 and 7 days after your arrival into the Czech Republic from the UK. This is in response to evidence of a new variant of Covid-19.
The Czech government have classified countries as either ‘high’, or ‘low’ risk. The UK is as ‘high’ risk. Travellers coming from the UK are required to either present a negative RT-PCR. When undergoing a PCR test in the Czech Republic, you should avoid all but essential movements until a negative test result is presented. In all cases, passengers from the UK should complete a Public Health Passenger Locator Form for presentation on arrival. Details on regulations in place for travellers and more information on entry requirements and local restrictions can be found on the website of the Czech Ministry of Interior.
You should not use the NHS testing service to get a test in order to facilitate your travel to another country. You should arrange to take a private test.
Regular entry requirements
The information on this part of the page covers the most common types of travel and reflects the UK government’s understanding of the rules currently in place. Unless otherwise stated, this information is for travellers using a full ‘British Citizen’ passport.
The authorities in the country or territory you’re travelling to are responsible for setting and enforcing the rules for entry. If you’re unclear about any aspect of the entry requirements, or you need further reassurance, you’ll need to contact the embassy, high commission or consulate of the country or territory you’re travelling to.
You should also consider checking with your transport provider or travel company to make sure your passport and other travel documents meet their requirements.
Visas
If you hold a British Citizen passport, you don’t need a visa to enter Czech Republic. If you’re planning a stay of longer than 3 months, see our Living in Czech Republic guide and contact the Embassy of the Czech Republic if you have further questions.
The rules on travel will stay the same until 31 December 2020.
Visas from 1 January 2021
The rules for travelling or working in Europe will change from 1 January 2021:
you will be able to travel to countries in the Schengen area for up to 90 days in any 180-day period without a visa as a tourist, to visit family or friends, to attend business meetings, cultural or sports events, or for short-term studies or training
if you are travelling to the Czech Republic and other Schengen countries without a visa, make sure your whole visit is within the limit. Visits to Schengen countries within the previous 180 days before you travel would count towards the 90-day limit
To stay for longer, to work or study, for business or for other reasons, you will need to meet the entry requirements set out by the Czech Republic. This could mean applying for a visa and/or work permit. You should check with the Embassy of the Czech Republic what type of visa and/or work permit, if any, you will need.
if you are in the Czech Republic with a visa or permit, your stay will not count towards the 90-day limit.
The 90-day limit for visa-free travel will begin on 1 January 2021. Any days you stay in the Czech Republic or other Schengen countries before 1 January 2021 will not count towards the 90-day limit.
At border control for the Czech Republic, you may need to:
show a return or onward ticket
show you have enough money for your stay, and
use separate lanes from EU, EEA and Swiss citizens when queueing
Your passport may be stamped on entry and exit.
Passport validity
The rules on travel will stay the same until 31 December 2020.
Your passport should be valid for the proposed duration of your stay; you do not need any additional period of validity on your passport beyond this.
Passport validity from 1 January 2021
From 1 January 2021, you must have at least 6 months left on an adult or child passport to travel to most countries in Europe (not including Ireland).
If you renewed your current passport before the previous one expired, extra months may have been added to its expiry date. Any extra months on your passport over 10 years may not count towards the 6 months needed.
Check your passport is valid for travel before you book your trip. You will need to renew your passport before travelling if you do not have enough time left on your passport.
UK Emergency Travel Documents
UK Emergency Travel Documents (ETDs) are accepted for entry, airside transit and exit from the Czech Republic.
