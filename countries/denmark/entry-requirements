Entry rules in response to coronavirus (COVID-19)
From 21 April, entry to Denmark is assessed by risk level of the particular country/region you are travelling from. This is categorised by yellow, orange and red ratings. The risk level will determine whether you need to self-isolate on entry and whether you need a worthy purpose to enter. This risk level will be reviewed weekly. The UK currently has an orange rating.
Entry to Denmark
If you are resident in the UK, you will be able to enter Denmark if you have a worthy purpose. You can see the list of worthy purposes on the Danish coronavirus website. You will need to provide evidence of your worthy purpose.
UK resident travellers must also present proof of a negative COVID-19 test taken no more than 48 hours before entry.
Danish citizens, UK nationals resident in Denmark, or other persons resident in Denmark will continue to be able to enter Denmark. If travelling by air, you will also need proof of a negative COVID-19 test taken no more than 48 hours before check-in.
The Danish authorities also require you take a test on arrival and to self-isolate for 10 days. There is an option to test to release after 4 days with a PCR test. There are some exemptions including those delivering goods and services in /out of Denmark.
Children under 15 and previously infected travellers are exempt from the Danish testing and self-isolation requirements. For details of exemptions for eligible travellers, see the Danish authorities’ coronavirus website.

Regular entry requirements
The Danish authorities increased border controls at the land border with Germany in January 2016. Border controls were also introduced in November 2019 for travellers from Rønne, Helsingør, Frederikshavn, Grenaa and those using the Øresund Bridge, including all train traffic from Sweden. These checks are temporary but will be in place for an unspecified period of time.
If you’re travelling using the land border, or by rail, road, or ferry you should make sure you have your passport with you. Allow additional time, be vigilant and follow the instructions of local authorities. Check with local media, your carrier, ferry operator or Danish State Railways (DSB) for more information.
When crossing from Denmark to Sweden various forms of ID are accepted, but must include a photograph, the holder’s full name, social security number or date of birth, holders signature, a stated validity and information on the issuing authority. Children under 18 accompanied by an adult with the appropriate ID are not required to carry ID themselves.
Visas
Greenland and the Faroe Islands aren’t members of the European Union. You don’t need a visa to enter for tourism, but you should get a work and residence permit before entry if you intend to live and work there.
The rules for travelling or working in European countries changed on 1 January 2021:
you can travel to countries in the Schengen area for up to 90 days in any 180-day period without a visa. This applies if you travel as a tourist, to visit family or friends, to attend business meetings, cultural or sports events, or for short-term studies or training
if you are travelling to Denmark and other Schengen countries without a visa, make sure your whole visit is within the 90-day limit. Visits to Schengen countries within the previous 180 days before you travel count towards your 90 days
to stay longer, to work or study, for business travel or for other reasons, you will need to meet the Danish government’s entry requirements. Check with the Danish Embassy what type of visa, if any, you will need
if you are in Denmark with a visa or permit, this does not count towards your 90-day visa free limit
Any time you spent in Denmark or other Schengen countries before 1 January 2021 does not count towards your 90-day visa-free limit.
At Danish border control, you may need to use separate lanes from EU, EEA and Swiss citizens when queueing. Your passport may be stamped on entry and exit. You may also need to:
show a return or onward ticket
show you have enough money for your stay
There are separate requirements for those who are resident in Denmark. If you are resident in Denmark, you should carry proof of residence as well as your valid passport when you travel. For further information on these requirements, see our Living in Denmark guide.
Passport validity
Check your passport is valid for travel before you book your trip, and renew your passport if you do not have enough time left on it.
You must have at least 6 months left on an adult or child passport to travel to most countries in Europe (not including Ireland).
If you renewed your current passport before the previous one expired, extra months may have been added to its expiry date. Any extra months on your passport over 10 years may not count towards the 6 months needed.
UK Emergency Travel Documents
UK Emergency Travel Documents (ETDs) are accepted for entry, airside transit and exit from Denmark. Your ETD must be valid for the proposed duration of your stay.
