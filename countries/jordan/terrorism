Terrorists are very likely to try to carry out attacks in Jordan. Attacks could be indiscriminate including in places visited by foreigners, particularly hotels, shopping malls and tourist sites.
There were a number of incidents in 2016, most of which have targeted local security forces. The most high profile of these included:
On 18 December 2016, 10 people were killed, including 3 civilians, and at least 29 injured in a terrorist attack in Kerak; it’s not clear if tourists were deliberately targeted.
In June 2016, 5 people were killed after a Daesh (formerly referred to as ISIL) -inspired gunman gained access to the General Intelligence Directorate’s base in Baqa’a, 10km north of Amman city centre. There was also an explosion near Rukban on the north-eastern border resulting in some 20 casualties.
The authorities in Jordan have successfully disrupted a number of planned attacks and made a number of arrests.

Kidnap
Terrorist groups operating in Syria, who routinely use kidnapping as a tactic, are present in the Syrian border areas.
The long-standing policy of the British government is not to make substantive concessions to hostage takers. The British government considers that paying ransoms and releasing prisoners increases the risk of further hostage taking.
