Thailand is experiencing a drought that has led to some sea water entering the fresh water supply and tap water. This issue may continue for several months. Thailand’s Metropolitan Waterworks Authority advise that there is no risk to public health from drinking tap water but salty water can affect people in higher risk groups, such as those with kidney disease. If you are concerned about the risks to your personal health, you should drink bottled water and/or get medical advice.
