Entry rules in response to coronavirus (COVID-19)
Entry to Cyprus
The UK entered Cyprus’ Amber category on 29 April.
Passengers coming from Amber Category countries are required to undergo a PCR test within 72 hours prior to departure and provide proof of a negative result. The following categories of passengers may opt to take a laboratory test only upon their arrival in the Republic of Cyprus, at their own expense and subject to self-isolation until a negative result is obtained:
Cypriot citizens and family members (alien spouses and their underage children),
Persons legally residing in the Republic,
Persons entitled to enter the Republic under the Vienna Convention.
Results from the PCR test taken before travel can be in the form of an email or SMS, but the result itself and/or appointment letter must include the date and time when the test was taken. You should not use the NHS testing service to get a test in order to facilitate your travel to another country. You should arrange to take a private test.
All permitted travellers must complete a Cyprus Flight Pass before their journey, available on the Cyprus Flight Pass website. Where relevant, you will be responsible for ensuring your PCR test result is uploaded to Cyprus Flight Pass within 24 hours of your departure. If you need to provide your appointment letter you can upload both documents in a single photo. In addition to obtaining the Cyprus Flight Pass, passengers are required to carry with them, in hard copy or electronically, copies of these documents. You will be asked to present your flight pass prior to boarding and on arrival at immigration. The Cyprus government have a help desk to assist travellers with queries regarding the use of the Cyprus Flight Pass. This service is accessible by telephone +(357) 2484 1234 and through the Cyprus Flight Pass e-platform. You should continue to track developments through the Republic of Cyprus Information Office.
For those travelling to the north of Cyprus, if you have been in the UK within 14 days before your travel to Cyprus, you will be required to quarantine for 14 days at authority-designated accommodation.

Passport validity
Check your passport is valid for travel before you book your trip, and renew your passport if you do not have enough time left on it.

If you renewed your current passport before the previous one expired, extra months may have been added to its expiry date. Any extra months on your passport over 10 years may not count towards the 6 months needed.
