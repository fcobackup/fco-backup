UK government support
Support for British nationals is severely limited in Mali, especially outside Bamako. If the security situation deteriorates, the British Embassy may be increasingly limited in the help it can provide. Do not rely on FCDO being able to help you to evacuate in an emergency.
If you are in Mali and need emergency help from the UK government, contact the British Embassy in Bamako.  
Travel insurance
If you choose to travel, research your destinations and get appropriate travel insurance. Insurance should cover your itinerary, planned activities and expenses in an emergency.
