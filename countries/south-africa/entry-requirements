The information on this page covers the most common types of travel and reflects the UK government’s understanding of the rules currently in place. Unless otherwise stated, this information is for travellers using a full ‘British Citizen’ passport.
The authorities in the country or territory you’re travelling to are responsible for setting and enforcing the rules for entry. If you’re unclear about any aspect of the entry requirements, or you need further reassurance, you’ll need to contact the embassy, high commission or consulate of the country or territory you’re travelling to.
You should also consider checking with your transport provider or travel company to make sure your passport and other travel documents meet their requirements.
South Africa has implemented biometric capturing at all ports of entry. This may result in some delays at land borders. You should allow additional time for border crossings.
Passport validity
Technically, your passport should be valid for a minimum period of 30 days (page 9) from the date of exit from South Africa. However, some immigration officials still request that a passport should have at least 6 months validity on the date of entry to South Africa. To avoid problems at the airport on arrival we recommend you meet this requirement.
Your passport should have at least 2 blank pages when you present it at immigration to enter or leave South Africa.
Visas
If you’re visiting South Africa for tourism or business purposes for a period of up to 90 days, you don’t need a visa.
For more information on visas contact the South African High Commission or the South African Department of Home Affairs.
Dual citizenship
If you hold South African citizenship, you must enter and exit South Africa on your South African passport. It is an offence under South African law for a citizen aged 18 or over to enter or leave the country on a foreign passport.
Travelling with children (under 18)
The new immigration rules introduced by South Africa in June 2015 relating to travelling with children remain in force. Parents travelling with children (under 18) may be asked to show the child’s full unabridged birth certificate. The full unabridged birth certificate should list the child’s details and both parents’ details. The abridged (short) birth certificate which only lists the child’s particulars won’t be accepted. The South African Department of Home Affairs are not accepting uncertified copies of birth certificates or copies of the parents/guardians identification. We recommend that you comply with these requirements.
The South African Department of Home Affairs have confirmed that no supporting documents will be required by people in direct transit through a South African International Airport. Check with your airline to see whether you need to go through immigration on arrival in South Africa, collect luggage and check in again. If you do go through immigration you’ll need to provide the correct documentation.
There are additional requirements if the child is travelling with only one parent, with neither biological parent, or unaccompanied. See this information sheet, this statement by the South African Department of Home Affairs and this leaflet produced by the South African Department of Home Affairs. School groups should use this consent form in addition to the documents referred to above. This special dispensation applies to all schools registered with the Department of Basic Education and its equivalent abroad.
Contact your nearest South African High Commission if you have any specific questions about your trip.
You can order a full unabridged birth certificate online via GOV.UK if your child was born in the UK, or the South African Department of Home Affairs website if your child was born in South Africa.
If you’re travelling with copies of documents, make sure you get them certified. The South African Department of Home Affairs won’t accept photocopies of birth certificates or passports.
Residence permits
New rules were introduced in May 2014. If you live in South Africa, you must have valid residence permit in your passport when entering and leaving the country. Receipts issued by the Department of Home Affairs for applications to renew a permit will not be accepted by the immigration authorities. For more information, contact the South African High Commission or the South African Department of Home Affairs.
Overstay Appeals
Instead of fining individuals whose permits have expired, you may be declared undesirable and prevented from applying for a visa to re-enter South Africa for a period from 12 months to 5 years. For more information, contact the South African High Commission or the South African Department of Home Affairs.
If you’re issued a Form 19 ‘declaration of undesirability’ at the port of entry/exit and you wish to appeal against the decision you should email overstayappeals@dha.gov.za and include a copy of your current passport, copy of your last valid visa, copy of the Form 19 and proof of application for a residence permit.
UK Emergency Travel Documents
UK Emergency Travel Documents (ETDs) are generally accepted for entry into South Africa on emergency medical grounds only. If you’re planning to enter the country on an ETD, you’re advised to check requirements with the nearest South African embassy, high commission or consulate before confirming your travel plans. ETDs are accepted for airside transit and exit from South Africa but should have a minimum of 6 months validity.
