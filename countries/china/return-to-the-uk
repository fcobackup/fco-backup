You can spread the virus even if you don’t have symptoms.

A large number of airlines, including British Airways and Virgin Atlantic, have suspended flights to and from mainland China.
Chinese authorities are asking airlines to further reduce international flights from 29 March. Each domestic airline may only operate one route to any specific country, with no more than one flight per week. International airlines may only maintain one route to China, operating one flight per week. This will severely restrict options to return to the UK. You should also note the above restrictions on foreign nationals entering China, including transit passengers.
For up to date information please follow the Civil Aviation Administration of China’s website: http://www.caac.gov.cn/en/
