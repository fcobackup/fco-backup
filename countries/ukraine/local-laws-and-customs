Penalties for being caught in possession of drugs are severe.
Smoking and drinking alcoholic drinks in public places is officially banned. Public places include transport, bus stops, underground crossings, cultural, sports and governmental establishments, playgrounds and parks.
Carry your passport at all times for ID purposes. Police may carry out passport checks on foreign nationals, particularly in the central area of Kyiv. Police officers should introduce themselves (name, post, rank, reason for ID check) and present a document verifying their position. Your original passport is required since no other document can provide information on your legal status in Ukraine. If you’re detained because you have been unable to present your passport, you should ask for an official report.
Ukrainian officials generally only speak Ukrainian and Russian.
Don’t take photographs near government or military establishments.
Although homosexuality is not prohibited by law, public attitudes are less tolerant than in the UK and public displays of affection may attract negative attention. There’s no provision under Ukrainian legislation guaranteeing freedom from discrimination on the grounds of sexual orientation.
See our information and advice page for the LGBT+ community before you travel.
Surrogacy
We are encouraging British nationals with current surrogacy arrangements in Ukraine to contact the FCDO on 01908 51 6666 if they haven’t already.
The FCDO advises against all travel to Ukraine. If you’re considering commissioning a surrogacy arrangement in Ukraine, you should consider the potential risks and challenges involved in pursuing international surrogacy at this time, including limitations to consular support and FCDO advice which advises against all travel to Ukraine.
The Visa Application Centre in Kyiv has now closed. Embassy staff are operating from the British Embassy office in Lviv. The in-person consular service that the British Embassy office in Lviv can provide is extremely limited and may be further affected by Russian military action.
Information for British nationals who have surrogacy arrangements in foreign countries is available on the gov.uk website. British nationals with surrogacy arrangements should ensure they have sought UK legal advice regarding Parental Orders and the documentation required for nationality determinations and travel documents. Also seek in-country lawyers on legalisation and document processing and the maximum period of visa-free stay allowed by the relevant authorities. Prospective clinics should be researched in detail to ensure they are reputable.
