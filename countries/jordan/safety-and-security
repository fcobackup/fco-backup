This guide also has safety advice for regions of Jordan.
Terrorism
There is a high threat of terrorist attack globally affecting UK interests and British nationals, including from groups and individuals who view the UK and British nationals as targets. Stay aware of your surroundings at all times.    
UK Counter Terrorism Policing has information and advice on staying safe abroad and what to do in the event of a terrorist attack. Find out how to reduce your risk from terrorism while abroad.
Terrorism in Jordan
Terrorists are likely to try to carry out attacks in Jordan.
Terrorism attacks could be indiscriminate, including in places visited by foreign nationals, such as:
hotels
shopping malls
restaurants
tourist sites
Stay aware of your surroundings, keep up to date with local media reports and follow the advice of local authorities.
Examples of significant attacks include:
in 2019, 8 people injured in a knife attack in the Roman site in Jerash
in 2018, 2 officers killed and several others injured in Fuheis when an explosive device destroyed a gendarmerie vehicle
Situation in Israel, Lebanon, and the Occupied Palestinian Territories
Following recent developments in Israel, Lebanon, the West Bank and the Gaza Strip, the security situation could change suddenly.
On 1 October, ballistic missiles targeted at Israel were intercepted over Jordan, including over Amman. On 26 October, Israel carried out military action against Iran. Flight cancellations, diversions and potential disturbances to Global Positioning System (GPS) signals may occur at short notice, as may temporarily closure of airspace.
The interception of missiles may result in falling fragments and debris. If you encounter any projectile debris or fragments you should move away from them immediately and contact local authorities. 
Monitor this travel advice and other media as the situation is changing fast. Follow and contact FCDO travel on X, Facebook and Instagram. You can also get email notifications when this travel advice is updated.
Read FCDO advice if you’re affected by a crisis abroad.
Political situation
The political situation in Jordan is stable but sometimes there are protests in Amman and other cities. There have been recent protests about the Gaza conflict near the Israeli and US embassies and downtown. You should:
take particular care near these areas
take care when travelling outside Amman, especially at night
be aware of the possibility of large, spontaneous demonstrations
There is a heavy security presence and roadblocks can happen. Most protests are peaceful, but they can become confrontational. There may be heightened anti-western sentiment. You should:
take sensible precautions
follow news reports
avoid all political gatherings and demonstrations
follow the advice of local authorities
Tribal violence
Tribal and social disputes may start without notice and become violent. You should:
follow news reports
leave the area if caught in an incident
follow any police instructions
Crime
Protecting yourself and your belongings
Crime levels are generally low, but there is a risk of pickpocketing, bag-snatching and theft from cars. Stay alert and keep your money, passport and valuables secure.
Street begging can be aggressive, particularly in areas frequented by foreigners. Do not engage with beggars.
Sexual assault
Take care when walking or travelling alone. Maintain at least the same level of personal security awareness as you would in the UK. See advice for women travelling abroad.
You should not accept lifts from strangers. If you must use a taxi , you should:
ask your hotel to recommend a reliable driver
not ride in the front seat, particularly when travelling alone
use Uber or Careem which are safer than yellow taxis
Laws and cultural differences
Jordan is a predominantly Islamic country. Always respect local traditions, customs, laws and religions so you do not cause offence.
Personal ID
The police carry out random security checks. Keep ID (passport or driving licence) with you to show at checkpoints. 
Alcohol laws
It’s illegal to drink alcohol on the street, but you can drink in bars, clubs, hotels and private homes.
Illegal drugs and prison sentences
It is illegal to possess, use or traffic drugs. If convicted, you can get a lengthy prison sentence and heavy fine.
LGBT+ travellers
Same-sex sexual relations are not illegal, but same-sex couples showing affection in public may cause offence. You could be arrested under other Jordanian laws. Read more advice for LGBT+ travellers.
Unmarried couples living together
It is socially unacceptable for unmarried foreign couples to live together. Some landlords may ask if you are married or request a marriage certificate.
Converting people to Christianity
It is illegal to encourage someone to convert to Christianity. You could face a prison sentence or a fine.
Visiting Petra 
The Petra Archaeological Park has strict visitor opening and closing hours. You risk arrest and prosecution if you are in the park outside of these hours. Tourists have been locked in Petra overnight.
Ask the tourist office staff if you’re unclear about ticket prices and before agreeing to additional charges.
Money
Cash machines are only widely available in Amman and other major towns and cities. Most places accept card payments.
Outdoor activities and adventure tourism
For all activities, bring appropriate clothing and enough food and water for extreme temperatures.
Tour operators
The quality of tour operators providing outdoor activities varies. A list of all tour operators is available on the Visit Jordan website. Research tour operators and choose one with suitable safety mitigations and insurance in place.

Transport risks
Road travel
If you are planning to drive in Jordan, see information on driving abroad.
You’ll need to have both the 1949 version of the international driving permit (IDP) and your UK driving licence with you in the car. You cannot buy an IDP outside the UK, so get one before you travel.
Driving standards
Driving standards differ from those in the UK. Stray animals, broken-down vehicles and unmarked roadworks are common. There have been fatal accidents on the Desert Highway. Drive with care at night and avoid unlit roads.
Rules of the road
If you have an accident, do not leave the scene before the police arrive and take a statement. Call 911 to contact police.
The speed limit in urban areas is 40kph, 80kph on rural roads and 120kph on highways. The police issue 15 to 150 Jordanian dinar on-the-spot fines.
It is illegal to drive or ride in a front seat without a seatbelt or use a mobile phone while driving. You could get a fine. All cars must carry a fire extinguisher and warning triangle.
Driving in winter
Heavy snow can trap vehicles and block mountain roads, including around Petra. Take care and follow local restrictions.
Extreme weather and natural disasters
Find out what you can do to prepare for and respond to extreme weather and natural hazards.
Flooding
In the rainy season from November to March, the Jordanian government sometimes issues flood alerts, particularly along the Jordan Valley. Flood alerts can cause diversions and road closures, affecting drivers and hikers. There is a risk of flash flooding. Be alert to advisories and co-operate with the authorities.
