If you have a health condition, or you are pregnant, you may need specialist healthcare abroad. Check whether your destination country can provide the healthcare you may need and ensure you have appropriate travel insurance for unexpected medical evacuation or local treatment.
See the Coronavirus travel health and Healthcare sections in the Coronavirus page for COVID-19 health information.
At least 8 weeks before your trip, check the latest country-specific health advice from the National Travel Health Network and Centre (NaTHNaC) on the TravelHealthPro website. Each country-specific page has information on vaccine recommendations, any current health risks or outbreaks, and factsheets with information on staying healthy abroad. Guidance is also available from NHS (Scotland) on the FitForTravel website.
General information on travel vaccinations and a travel health checklist is available on the NHS website. You may then wish to contact your health adviser or pharmacy for advice on other preventive measures and managing any pre-existing medical conditions while you’re abroad.
The legal status and regulation of some medicines prescribed or bought in the UK can be different in other countries. You’re only allowed to bring medicines for personal use into Mongolia. These include medicines for urgent aid for up to 7 days or for the treatment of diabetes, cancer, mental illness or HIV/AIDS for which you have a doctor’s prescription. If you’re arriving by plane, you should carry all medicines in your checked baggage. Guidance is available from NaTHNaC on best practice when travelling with medicines. For further information on the legal status of a specific medicine, you’ll need to contact the embassy, high commission or consulate of the country or territory you’re travelling to.
While travel can be enjoyable, it can sometimes be challenging. There are clear links between mental and physical health, so looking after yourself during travel and when abroad is important. Information on travelling with mental health conditions is available in our guidance page. Further information is also available from the National Travel Health Network and Centre (NaTHNaC).
Air pollution
The high levels of air pollution in Ulaanbaatar, especially in winter, may aggravate bronchial, sinus or asthma conditions. Children, the elderly and those with pre-existing medical conditions may be especially affected. You can check the pollution index levels for many cities on the AQICN website.
Health risks
There have been isolated incidents of bubonic plague in some rural areas of Mongolia, caught by consuming marmot meat. The meat is a delicacy in some rural areas although it is illegal to hunt for marmot in Mongolia. When travelling in rural areas, you should avoid marmot meat and follow the latest advice from the local authorities.
If you think you have been exposed to Bubonic Plague whilst travelling in Mongolia, you should immediately report to the nearest hospital and call the National Infectious Disease Centre on +976 100. You should contact the British Embassy if you or your group is quarantined due to an incident involving Bubonic Plague.
Medical treatment
You should always have medical insurance arranged before travelling to Mongolia. Medical bills, especially when a medical evacuation is needed, can be substantial. Make sure you have adequate travel health insurance and accessible funds to cover the cost of any medical treatment abroad and repatriation.
Foreign nationals requiring medical treatment in Mongolia, are required to pay 80% of the total cost when receiving treatment. The remaining balance paid after treatment.
We advise you wear a helmet when riding animals.
If you need emergency medical assistance during your trip, dial +976 103 and ask for an ambulance. You should contact your insurance/medical assistance company as soon as possible to inform them of what has happened.
The standard of healthcare is variable in Mongolia. In Ulaanbaatar the quality and access can differ, and some private clinics operating in the city. Once outside Ulaanbaatar, the level of care will vary with limited options available to receive treatment.
Due to the size of the county those injured in remote parts of the country may have long travel times before reaching the nearest medical facility.
The cost of treatment is fixed, and most procedure are costed so you should be able to confirm cost before treatment. Medical supplies are mainly from China and Russia, so you may not recognise the medicine you are being offered.
You should always carry a first aid kit, have supplies of over-the-counter medicines you may require for your trip.
You should always bring any regular prescription drugs you may need with you, and spare, just in case.
If a patient’s injury is life threatening the doctors will treat that patient without individual/family permission.
