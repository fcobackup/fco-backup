Entry rules in response to coronavirus (COVID-19)
Entry to Zambia
Zambia’s borders are open, but under tight screening.
Tourist and business visit visas are available in advance and on arrival in Zambia.
All visitors to Zambia must have proof that they have tested negative for COVID-19 in the 72 hours before their arrival. Visitors are responsible for monitoring their condition for 14 days after arrival, and should report any occurrence of COVID-19 symptoms to medical authorities. There is no requirement for visitors or residents to self-isolate.
Returning residents must have proof that they have tested negative for COVID-19 in the 72 hours before their arrival.
You should not use the NHS testing service to get a test in order to facilitate your travel to another country. You should arrange to take a private test.
All airports are open to flights, though availability of international flights remains limited. Please check before booking.
International train and bus services are suspended.
Testing on arrival
From 24 May, any travellers coming from a country designated ‘high risk’ by the Government of Zambia must take a COVID-19 test at their own cost on arrival in Zambia. They must also self-isolate for 14 days. The Government of Zambia has not stated whether travellers who have transited through a “high risk” country are required to self-isolate or not
The current list of “high risk” countries is Argentina, Brazil, Egypt, Ethiopia, France, Germany, India, Iran, Italy, Kenya, Russia, South Africa, Tanzania, Tunisia and Turkey. This list is liable to change at short notice and with minimal publication
Anyone entering Zambia with a body temperature equal to, or above 38.0 C will be tested for COVID-19 on arrival, as will anyone with COVID-19 related symptoms. Any other arrivals may be randomly selected for testing. These tests are in addition to the requirement for visitors to show proof that they have tested negative for COVID-19 in the 72 hours before their arrival.
Quarantine requirements
If your body temperature is equal to, or above 38.0, or you have a COVID-19 related symptom (a cough, shortness of breath, a headache, loss of taste or smell, or a sore throat), you will be tested and taken to either your home or a government facility for treatment and quarantine until your tests results are known.
Data collection
Traveller Health Questionnaires are provided on incoming flights for passengers to complete before disembarkation. These should be completed in English and handed in on arrival.
Exit requirements
As of 20 October, all travellers wishing to leave Zambia to travel to a country that requires a negative COVID-19 test will be required to produce a medical certificate stating that they have tested negative for COVID-19 in the previous 14 days.
This requirement does not apply to travellers to a destination that does not require a negative test but, travellers are advised to check with their airline on their requirements prior to travel.
To obtain a certificate, travellers must take their negative test result to UTH Hospital, the Zambia National Health Public Institute, the District Health Office or the Public Health Office and pay a 200 Kwacha fee. COVID-19 tests must have been taken in Zambia.
Holders of tests taken outside Zambia are not exempt from this requirement, even if the test was taken within the previous 14 days.
There are no direct flights between Zambia and the UK.

Regular entry requirements
Visas
British passport holders need a visa to enter Zambia. You can get a visa from the Zambian High Commission in London before you travel. Single and double entry visit visas are available on arrival at all ports of entry, but multi-entry visas are not. If you plan to get a visa on arrival, make sure you have the correct amount of cash (US dollars) as change may not be available. If you enter through Kenneth Kaunda International Airport, you can make payment for single and double entry visas via credit or debit card at the Zambian Immigration desks.
You should check your visa endorsement for the period of your stay in Zambia. Although you are allowed 90 days per calendar year, the immigration officer will not normally endorse the full length of time upon entry and you will be required to extend the stay at the nearest immigration office.
For further information about entry requirements contact the Zambian High Commission in London at info@zambiahc.org.uk or visit Zambia Department of Immigration.
The KAZA visa is valid for travel between Zambia and Zimbabwe and day trips into Botswana. It’s available at the international airports in Lusaka and Livingstone and at the land borders at Livingstone (Zimbabwe border) and Kazungula (Botswana border). It costs US$50 and it is valid for 30 days.
On leaving Zambia, all air passengers must pay a departure tax of US$25. This is normally included in the cost of an air ticket, you will be asked to pay separately in Zambian Kwacha if it is not.
There is also a Security Charge payable by all departing air passengers. The cost is US$3 per person for domestic flights and US$5 per person for international flights. As above, this is normally included in the cost of an air ticket but you will be asked to pay separately in Zambian Kwacha if it is not.
Passport validity
Your passport should be valid for a minimum period of 6 months from the date of entry into Zambia and have 2 blank pages.
UK Emergency Travel Documents
UK Emergency Travel Documents (ETDs) are accepted for entry, airside transit, and exit from Zambia. ETDs must be valid for 6 months for entry into Zambia if the holder is not a returning resident.
Dual nationals
