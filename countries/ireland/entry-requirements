The authorities in Ireland set and enforce entry rules. For further information contact the embassy, high commission or consulate of the country or territory you’re travelling to.

Entry rules in response to coronavirus (COVID-19) for passengers travelling to Ireland from Great Britain
Travellers arriving into Ireland from Great Britain or from all other non-EU/EEA countries, should follow the Irish Government guidance for travellers arriving from non-EU/EEA countries.
Passenger Locator Form
All travellers to Ireland must fill out a Passenger Locator Form before departure. Failure to complete this form is an offence. See Irish Government guidance on completing the form online, who is exempt, and penalties for failure to submit an online form. The Passenger Locator Form will be checked by air or sea carriers before departure. Passengers will also be asked for proof of vaccination or recovery, or to present evidence of a negative RT-PCR test taken within 72 hours prior to arrival in the country. Individuals travelling from Great Britain to Ireland via Northern Ireland should also complete a Passenger Locator Form.
Travelling when fully vaccinated
Travellers arriving into Ireland from Great Britain with valid proof of full vaccination, or with proof of recovery from COVID-19 within 180 days, will not require travel-related testing or quarantine.
Fully vaccinated or recovered passengers travelling from Great Britain to Ireland will need to have proof of their full vaccination or recovery record. (See ‘Demonstrating your COVID-19 status’).
For more information on the Irish Government’s definition of fully vaccinated, see the Irish Government website.
Demonstrating your COVID-19 status
Ireland will accept the UK’s proof of COVID-19 recovery and vaccination record. If you are travelling with a printed PDF proof of vaccination status, it must date from 1 November to ensure that the certificate can be scanned successfully. Your NHS appointment card from vaccination centres is not designed to be used as proof of vaccination and should not be used to demonstrate your vaccine status.
Travelling when not fully vaccinated
Passengers without proof of full vaccination or recovery will require evidence of a pre-departure negative RT-PCR test result within 72 hours prior of arrival in Ireland.
Non RT-PCR tests are not accepted when travelling to Ireland and passengers with a Digital COVID Certificate based on a non RT-PCR test (for example, antigen tests) require proof of an additional negative RT-PCR test taken no more than 72 hours before arrival.
There are specific exemptions to the above. You should visit the Irish Government website for more details.
Travelling with children
Children under the age of 12 will not need to take a PCR test prior to travelling to Ireland or to undergo self-quarantine.
Children between the ages of 12 and 17 will be required to have a negative RT-PCR test, taken within 72 hours prior to arrival to travel into the country, unless they have valid proof of vaccination or recovery.
Entry rules in response to coronavirus (COVID-19) for passengers travelling to Ireland from Northern Ireland
Travellers whose journey originated in Northern Ireland and have not been overseas in the past 14-days are not obliged to complete a Passenger Locator Form or provide proof of vaccination, recovery or test results upon arrival into Ireland. However travellers who have been overseas in the past 14 days are subject to the requirements based on their travel history, and according to their health status.

Regular entry requirements
ID
Ireland, along with the UK, is a member of the Common Travel Area. British nationals travelling from the UK don’t need a passport to visit Ireland. However, Irish immigration officers will check the ID of all passengers arriving by air from the UK and may ask for proof of nationality, particularly if you were born outside the UK. You are therefore advised to take your British passport with you.
For more information about the types of ID you might be asked to present, see the website of the Ireland Citizens Information Board.
Before travelling, check with your carrier about their ID requirements, as most airlines and other transport providers won’t carry passengers to and from Ireland unless they’ve seen satisfactory photographic ID.
Passport validity
If you’re using a passport to enter Ireland, it should be valid and in date. You should also checking your air or sea carrier’s terms and conditions of travel. For journeys on the island of Ireland, British and Irish citizens do not require any travel documents when crossing the land border.
