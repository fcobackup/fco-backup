Entry and borders
See Entry requirements to find out what you will need to do when you arrive in Myanmar.
Travel in Myanmar
In some areas there may be local requirements for visitors from other parts of the country to quarantine or self-isolate for 28 days on arrival.
Additional movement restrictions may be imposed in specific townships if COVID-19 cases are found.
Since 13 May it has been compulsory for anyone going out in public to wear a facemask. Failure to wear one will result in a fine of MMK 5000. This requirement is being enforced strictly and has led to the arrest of offenders in some districts of Yangon.
It is recommended that foreigners carry:
passport
Form C (immigration document)
Foreigner’s Registration Certificate
Myanmar Driver’s Licence (if you own a car)
a copy of your passport information page
a copy of your Myanmar visa
a copy of your immigration stamp showing when you last entered Myanmar.
Accommodation
There have been reports that some local authorities are carrying out checks to make sure all foreign tourists are staying in registered hotels and guest houses, not in private apartments. If you are on a tourist visa and are not currently staying in a registered hotel or guest house, you should move into one now. This is a requirement under Myanmar law and is a condition of your visa.
Some hotels have reopened but many tourist resorts remain closed.
Public places and services
Some restaurants, bars and shops have reopened with temperature checks and social distancing measures in place. Some shopping centres may require customers to register their details upon entry. You must wear a facemask in public places.
Myanmar visa extensions / renewals and UK passport / UK visa applications
For those with tourist/social visit visas the Myanmar government has agreed that overstays will be permitted with no legal penalty. You will be required to pay an overstay fee of US $3 per day of overstay when you leave Myanmar. This is payable in cash to the Immigration Department at Yangon Airport.
British Nationals usually resident in Myanmar but currently away with expired business visas should apply for a single entry business visa at your nearest Myanmar Embassy (with a sponsorship letter from your employer). You should then apply for a long term multi-entry visa in Myanmar when you return.
New tourist visa applications are currently suspended until 31 July.
Applications for UK passports and UK visas are normally processed on Gov.uk with papers submitted at the VFS office at the Hledan Centre in Yangon. The VFS office has now reopened. For further information please see the VFS website.
Healthcare
If you are currently in Myanmar and are displaying symptoms of coronavirus, you should consult your healthcare provider. You may then be asked to notify the Myanmar National Hotline for Coronavirus (+95 67 3420268) and be transferred to a public health facility for testing.
If you test positive for the virus, you are highly likely to be transferred to a Government quarantine hospital until you have recovered. Patients are obliged to use a government facility even if they have private insurance. Patients in government hospitals are expected to make their own arrangements for bringing in food and other essential supplies. Lone travellers will not be allowed out of isolation to purchase food or make phone calls.
The coronavirus pandemic is expected to put significant pressure on Myanmar’s medical facilities. They may not be able to offer routine care.
It may be difficult for you to travel to a neighbouring country for medical attention. You should check your personal arrangements with your healthcare provider.
