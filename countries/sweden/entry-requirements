This information is for people travelling on a full ‘British citizen’ passport from the UK. It is based on the UK government’s understanding of the current rules for the most common types of travel.
The authorities in Sweden set and enforce entry rules. If you’re not sure how these requirements apply to you, contact the Swedish Embassy in the UK.
Passport validity requirements
Sweden follows Schengen area rules. Your passport must:
have a ‘date of issue’ less than 10 years before the date you arrive – if you renewed your passport before 1 October 2018, it may have a date of issue that is more than 10 years ago
have an ‘expiry date’ at least 3 months after the day you plan to leave the Schengen area
Check with your travel provider that your passport and other travel documents meet requirements. Renew your passport if you need to.
You will be denied entry if you do not have a valid travel document or try to use a passport that has been reported lost or stolen.
Visa requirements
You can travel without a visa to the Schengen area, which includes Sweden, for up to 90 days in any 180-day period. This applies if you travel:
as a tourist
to visit family or friends
to attend business meetings, cultural or sports events
for short-term studies or training
The requirements for working in Sweden are different.
If you’re travelling to other Schengen countries as well, make sure your whole visit is within the 90-day visa-free limit. Visits to Schengen countries in the 180 days before you travel count towards your 90 days. If you overstay the 90-day visa-free limit, you may be banned from entering Schengen countries for up to 3 years.
Make sure you get your passport stamped on entry and exit. 
If you’re a visitor, border guards will look at your entry and exit stamps to check you have not overstayed the 90-day visa-free limit for the Schengen area.
If your passport is missing a stamp, show evidence of when and where you entered or left the Schengen area (for example, boarding passes or tickets) and ask the border guards to add the date and location in your passport.
At Swedish border control, you may also need to:
show a return or onward ticket
show proof of your accommodation, for example, a hotel booking
show proof of your travel insurance
prove that you have enough money for your stay
Staying longer than 90 days in a 180-day period
To stay longer, you must meet the Swedish government’s entry requirements. Check which type of visa or work permit you need with the Swedish Embassy in the UK.
If you stay in Sweden with a residence permit or long-stay visa, this does not count towards your 90-day visa-free limit.
See passport stamping if you live in Sweden.
Border controls on arrival from Denmark and Germany
Border controls are in place in Sweden for people travelling from Denmark via the Öresund crossing and arriving on ferries from Denmark and Germany.
New Schengen entry requirements
Plans for the introduction of the new EU Entry/Exit System (EES) for all non-EU nationals, including British nationals, travelling in or out of the Schengen area has been delayed. Information will be updated when available.
Read more information on the EU Entry/Exit System.
Travelling with children
Carry a letter of consent from the parent or guardian of children aged 17 and under who are travelling with you.
Vaccine requirements
For details about medical entry requirements and recommended vaccinations, see TravelHealthPro’s Sweden guide.
Customs rules
There are strict rules about goods that you can take into and out of Sweden. You must declare anything that may be prohibited or subject to tax or duty.
Taking food and drink into Sweden
You cannot take meat, milk or products containing them into EU countries. There are some exceptions such as powdered baby milk, baby food and special foods or pet feed required for medical reasons. 
Taking money into Sweden
Declare cash or travellers cheques if the value is 10,000 euros or more. You will get a certified declaration to show you brought it in with you. If you do not, your money could be seized when you leave.
Many shops, cafes and restaurants do not accept cash, so make sure you have a debit or credit card with you.
