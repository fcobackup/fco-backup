Cases of coronavirus (COVID-19) have been confirmed in Moldova. The Moldovan authorities have declared a state of emergency and introduced a number of measures intended to limit the spread of the virus.
Travel restrictions
Foreigners who do not hold Moldovan residency are currently not permitted to enter Moldova. Since 17 March all scheduled international passenger flights to and from Chisinau International Airport have been suspended.
The Moldovan government has closed most border crossings to Ukraine and Romania (for details, check the Moldovan government website). The Romanian government has introduced restrictions, including quarantine requirements, for all people entering the country. It has also announced a ban on flights to several countries, including UK and Ireland, from 2300 on Sunday 5 April. For full details on these restrictions, you should refer to our Travel Advice for Romania.
You should contact your travel operator and air carrier for more information before travelling to Moldova.
