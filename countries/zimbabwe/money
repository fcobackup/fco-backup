Financial transactions are mainly conducted in the official local currency known as RTGS Dollars. This includes Zimbabwean bond notes, bond coins and mobile money such as ECOCASH. Prices and transactions will mainly be in RTGS dollars but US dollars also remain legal tender and are widely accepted. You should check before making a transaction whether the price quoted is in RTGS or US dollars as the symbol for both is $, and it is recommended to check exchange rates prior to any transaction. Zimbabwe is currently experiencing a severe shortage of cash. It’s not currently possible to make cash withdrawals with an international bank card. Credit and debit cards are increasingly being used for transactions, although a growing number of imported items such as fuel may require payment in US dollars in cash.
Banks are experiencing challenges dispensing foreign currency cash including for international transfers from outside of Zimbabwe.
You should check in advance if a restaurant or hotel will accept cards, especially outside Harare. Make sure you have sufficient funds in US dollar notes for your visit, or check with your tour operator that card payments will be accepted.
Zimbabwe introduced bond notes in November 2016 as legal tender alongside the US dollar and other currencies. RTGS Dollars, including bond notes, bond coins and mobile money are only legal tender within Zimbabwe.The bond notes are in $2 and $5 denominations and bond coins at $1, 50c, 25c, 10c, 5c, 1c denominations. Bond notes are in short supply and may not always be available.
It’s illegal to leave Zimbabwe with more than $2,000 (or equivalent) in cash. It’s illegal to exchange foreign currency anywhere other than at officially licensed dealers (eg banks or bureau de change). Carry small denomination notes as change is rarely available in smaller businesses.
