There are direct flights from Bahrain to London Heathrow operated by Gulf Air, but at a reduced service. The schedule is under regular review and flights are subject to change or cancellation at short notice.
You should check with your airline or travel company for the latest information. If you are travelling in Bahrain, or otherwise wish to return to the UK, you are strongly advised to return now, where and while there are still commercial routes available.

You will need to pay for your return travel to the UK. If departure options are available but you cannot afford the travel costs and have exhausted all other options for getting funds, you may be eligible to apply for an emergency loan from the government. This is a last resort option and you would need to repay the loan when you are back in the UK.
For more information, you should contact Corporate Travel Management (CTM). CTM are a commercial partner of the FCO and are authorised to administer such loans on behalf of the FCO.
