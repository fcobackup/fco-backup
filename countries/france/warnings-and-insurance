Botulism
French health authorities released a public warning on 13 September following an outbreak of botulism (severe food poisoning) at a restaurant in Bordeaux, France. The UK Health Security Agency is urging anyone who ate at the Tchin Tchin Wine Bar between 4 and 10 September to contact their local emergency department urgently. If you are in France, contact a healthcare professional or emergency services number 15 if you ate at this restaurant between these dates. Botulism does not spread from person to person. Read more NHS guidance on botulism.
