The information on this page covers the most common types of travel and reflects the UK government’s understanding of the rules currently in place. Unless otherwise stated, this information is for travellers using a full ‘British Citizen’ passport.
The authorities in the country or territory you’re travelling to are responsible for setting and enforcing the rules for entry. If you’re unclear about any aspect of the entry requirements, or you need further reassurance, you’ll need to contact the embassy, high commission or consulate of the country or territory you’re travelling to.
You should also consider checking with your transport provider or travel company to make sure your passport and other travel documents meet their requirements.
Visas
If you have a UK passport endorsed British Citizen, British National Overseas or British Overseas Territory Citizen you do not need a visa for stays of up to 3 months. Other types of British national will need a valid Schengen visa to enter Iceland. 
Iceland is a member country of the European Economic Area. British Citizens are entitled to live and work in Iceland with a residence/work permit, which you can get from the Directorate of Immigration, Útlendingastofnun, Skogarhlid 6, 105 Reykjavík. Telephone: 510-5400.
In the event of changes to entry requirements after the UK leaves the EU on 29 March 2019, this page will be updated as soon as information is available.
Passport validity
Your passport should be valid for the proposed duration of your stay. You don’t need any additional period of validity on your passport beyond this.
However, if the UK leaves the European Union with no deal, the passport validity rules for travel to most countries in Europe will change from 29 March 2019. Before booking travel, you should check that your passport will meet these new rules and find out whether you need to renew it.
UK Emergency Travel Documents
UK Emergency Travel Documents are accepted for entry, airside transit and exit from Iceland.
