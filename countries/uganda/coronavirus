Entry and borders
All international passenger flights to and from Uganda have been suspended. Cargo flights are permitted, but crew must observe strict guidelines including screening measures. Land borders and lake ports (except for truck drivers and a crew of one person) are also closed. No date has yet been given for the re-opening of the airport or the land borders.
We continue to work with the Government of Uganda, other Embassies and airlines to determine options for helping British nationals who wish to return home. However, you should not expect any additional flights immediately. See Return to the UK
All arrivals will be subject to 14 days mandatory quarantine, and will be placed in a government designated hospital or hotel at their own expense. At the end of this period they will be tested for coronavirus (COVID-19) and if negative will be required to self-isolate at home.
You should comply with any additional screening measures put in place by the authorities.
Keep up to date with information from your tour operator, transport or accommodation provider on the impact on any existing travel plans.
