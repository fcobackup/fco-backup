COVID-19 entry restrictions for Afghanistan
Before you travel, check the ‘Entry requirements’ section for Afghanistan’s current entry restrictions and requirements. These may change with little warning. Monitor this advice for the latest updates and stay in contact with your travel provider.
Returning to the UK
Afghanistan is on the red list for entering England. Check what you must do to enter England, Scotland, Wales or Northern Ireland.
The level of consular assistance the British Embassy can provide in Afghanistan is extremely limited, including in a crisis. Do not rely on the FCDO being able to evacuate you from Afghanistan in an emergency. In arranging your departure from Afghanistan, ensure your travel documents are up to date and that you have the necessary visas for onward travel.
The British Embassy is not able to accept registrations from British nationals in Afghanistan or monitor their safety when they are in country. Staff from the British Embassy will not be able to travel outside of Kabul due to the security situation; this severely limits the consular assistance that can be offered. Travel by road throughout the country, but particularly outside the capital Kabul, is extremely dangerous. Seek professional security advice for all travel and consider using armoured vehicles.
If you plan to travel to Afghanistan against FCDO advice, then find out what you need to know about coronavirus in Afghanistan in the Coronavirus section.
During the COVID-19 pandemic, it is more important than ever to get travel insurance and check it provides sufficient cover. See the FCDO’s guidance on foreign travel insurance.
