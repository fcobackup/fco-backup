The Foreign, Commonwealth & Development Office (FCDO) advises against all but essential travel to:
the whole of Seychelles based on the current assessment of COVID-19 risks
From 4am on Saturday 9 January, visitors arriving into England who have been in or transited through Seychelles in the previous 10 days will not be permitted entry. British and Irish nationals, and third country nationals with residence rights in the UK arriving in England from Seychelles will be required to quarantine in a hotel. Different rules apply for arrivals into Scotland, Wales and Northern Ireland.
The FCDO is not advising those already travelling in Seychelles to leave at this time. Travellers should follow the advice of the local authorities on how best to protect themselves and others, including any measures that they bring in to control the virus. You should contact your tour operator or airline if you have any questions about your return journey.
From 1 January onwards those with residence rights includes: holders of Indefinite Leave to Remain; holders of existing leave to enter or remain (i.e those with biometric Residence permits) or an entry clearance/visa that grants such leave e.g. students, workers, etc (excluding visit visas); holders of EU Settlement Scheme (“EUSS”) leave; those who have rights of entry under the Withdrawal Agreements (including returning residents with a right of residence under the EEA Regulations and EEA frontier workers); family members of EEA nationals with rights under the Withdrawal Agreement.
Travel to Seychelles is subject to entry restrictions
The Government of Seychelles has announced that, with effect from 28 December, the United Kingdom will no longer feature on the list of countries from which visitors may travel to Seychelles.
There is an exception to this rule for individuals who have been vaccinated against COVID-19. If you have received a complete course of COVID-19 vaccination at least two weeks before travelling, you may enter Seychelles as a visitor. Visitors must stay at approved accommodation, and provide both an authentic vaccination certificate and a negative PCR test result conducted within 72 hours of travel.
Dual nationals, permanent residents and approved work permit holders may continue to travel from the United Kingdom to Seychelles without having received a vaccine, but most will be required to quarantine or self-isolate on arrival for seven days in accommodation approved by the Public Health Authority. This can include home quarantine for Seychellois and residents or a private quarantine facility for Gainful Occupational Permit (GOP) holders.
Seychellois nationals, residents and GOP holders who have received a complete course of a COVID-19 vaccine will not face quarantine.
Anyone entering Seychelles must have proof of a negative COVID-19 test, performed no more than 72 hours before departure.
All arrivals by sea on pleasure crafts / yachts must apply for entry but may only come to shore 10 days after their last port of call and must have a negative PCR test.
Cruise ships from any country worldwide will not be permitted to berth in Seychelles until further notice.
Seychelles International Airport may allow private jets and commercial charter flights to land if they are carrying passengers who will then be transferred to authorised yachts, or to specifically authorised tourist facilities. All passengers must have proof of a negative COVID-19 test performed in the 48 hours prior to boarding. You should contact your airline and the Seychelles Department of Health to understand when and if you will be permitted entry to Seychelles.
These measures will remain in effect until further notice.

You should exercise caution when swimming, especially with children. Currents can be strong and drownings occur. Beaches which are safer at certain times of the year can be dangerous for swimming at other times. See Swimming
There is a problem with drugs in Seychelles, in particular heroin. Crime levels have risen as a result; there has been an increase in break-ins, robberies, burglaries and opportunist thefts against residents, expatriates and tourists. There were robberies and attacks at, and around, Cote D’Or beach on the island of Praslin in late 2017. Police responded with increased foot patrols and lighting. They advise visitors to take care when walking in this area, particularly at night. You should take sensible precautions to safeguard yourself and your possessions. See Crime
Piracy remains a significant threat in the Gulf of Aden and Indian Ocean. See Sea travel
