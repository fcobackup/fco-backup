This advice reflects the UK government’s understanding of current rules for people travelling on a full ‘British citizen’ passport from the UK, for the most common types of travel.
The authorities in Monaco set and enforce entry rules. If you’re not sure how these requirements apply to you, contact the Monaco Embassy in the UK.
COVID-19 rules
There are no COVID-19 testing or vaccination requirements for travellers entering Monaco.
Passport validity requirements
To enter Monaco your passport must:
have a ‘date of issue’ less than 10 years before the date you arrive. Passports issued after 1 October 2018 are now valid for only 10 years, but for passports issued before 1 October 2018, extra months may have been added if you renewed a passport early
have an ‘expiry date’ at least 3 months after the day you plan to leave
Contact the Monaco Embassy in the UK if your passport does not meet both these requirements.
Check with your travel provider that your passport and other travel documents meet requirements. Renew your passport if you need to.
You will be denied entry if you do not have a valid travel document, or try to use a passport that has been reported lost or stolen.
Visa requirements
France handles immigration matters for Monaco. If your passport describes you as a British Citizen you will not need a visa to enter Monaco for stays of less than 90 days. To stay longer, you will need to meet entry requirements. Check which type of visa you may need on the France Visas website.
Other British passport holders should check the current entry requirements on the website of the French Foreign Ministry and if necessary confirm with the nearest French Diplomatic mission.
Vaccination requirements (other than COVID-19)
