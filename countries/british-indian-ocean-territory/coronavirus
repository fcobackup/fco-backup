Local Measures
All new arrivals to Diego Garcia are subject to Restriction of Movement (ROM). ROM will see all arrivals isolated in their accommodation for 14 days.
Social distancing protocols are in place on Diego Garcia with the population advised to maintain 6ft social distancing and avoid groups of more than 10 persons. Public venues are restricted from hosting large gatherings. Work and social activities have been restricted to limit large groupings of personnel wherever practicable.
Entry requirements
Visiting vessel permits for yachts will not be issued until further notice. Those who have applied or have been issued permits will be contacted separately. If you have any questions please contact biotadmin@fco.gov.uk. BIOT has very limited medical and emergency response facilities, limited further by coronavirus. We will only be able to assist with serious and life-threatening emergencies. These should be reported through normal SOLAS processes as set out in Visiting Vessels Guidance. The British Indian Ocean Territoryâ€™s website has useful information and further guidance.
Departure options
Currently the options to depart Diego Garcia are extremely limited with flights to both Bahrain and Singapore suspended.
