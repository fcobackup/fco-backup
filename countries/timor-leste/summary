The FCDO advises against all but essential travel to:
the whole of Timor-Leste based on the current assessment of COVID-19 risks.
Travel to Timor-Leste is subject to entry restrictions
The Government of Timor-Leste has re-imposed the temporary closure of its airports, ports and land borders from 3 May 2021 to 1 June 2021. The decision has been made under the State of Emergency, due to an increase in the community transmission of COVID-19
On arrival in Timor-Leste you will need to present a negative COVID test. You will need to quarantine for 14 days either in a government facility or in your own accommodation, subject to the approval of the Ministry of Health. Those who have been fully vaccinated and hold a valid vaccination certificate will be exempt from mandatory quarantine
Those who present symptoms of COVID-19, including a fever greater than 37.5°C, cough and/or breathing difficulties will be prevented from travelling, and taken to a health facility for a COVID-19 test. Positive cases will be subject to isolation.
