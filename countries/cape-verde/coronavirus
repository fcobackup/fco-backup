Travel in Cape Verde
Inter-island travel
Internal inter-island flights and passenger ferries are operational. If you’re travelling between islands, you’ll need to complete an online health surveillance form and for some of the islands you’ll need to present a COVID-19 (rapid antigen test) done in the last 72 hours before you travel.
Check if you need to present a COVID 19 (rapid antigen test) done in the last 72 hours before you travel between some of the islands. You can check the testing requirements between inter-island flights and ferries in the FAQs on the Cabo Verde Safe site. Children under the age of 7 are not required to present a test.
You can have a COVID-19 (rapid antigen test) done in a local municipal health facility or in a certified private laboratory no later than 72 hours prior to travel. You can book your test online on some of the islands.
You’ll need to pay 1,000 CV Escudos (around £8-£10) for the COVID-19 (rapid antigen) test, a health declaration and result certificate. You need to ensure that the fee you pay includes the health declaration and test result.
International travel
For international travel out of Cape Verde, you’ll need to present a COVID-19 test (RT-PCR or Ag-RDT) done in the last 72 hours before you travel. You can book your test online on some of the islands. This does not apply to children under the age of 12.
Tests are available at health centres and cost 6500CV Escudos (around £55). You can find a list of health centres online.
If you are travelling to or from Cape Verde and transiting other countries, you will need to check the travel advice pages of that country. You should also check with your airline or travel provider about entry requirements when transiting other countries.

Healthcare in Cape Verde
If you’ve got COVID-19 symptoms you must self-isolate for 14 days. The government of Cape Verde has set up a free helpline, which you can call if you have any concerns about coronavirus: +238 (0)800 1112. This helpline is only available in Portuguese.
If you need medicine, you will only be able to buy it from a pharmacy. Unlike in the UK, non-prescription medication is not available in supermarkets or other shops. There are a limited number of Pharmacies on each island and they are usually identified by a green cross. Find a pharmacy near you on the Pharmacy Network website.
If you have a UK prescription, take it to a pharmacy and ask the pharmacist whether they can dispense your medication for you. Remember the pharmacist will have to apply national rules so may not be able to give you the same strength or dosage. Some medicines may not be available or may not be authorised for sale in Cape Verde. In some cases, the medicine might not be in stock so they will need to order it. This can take up to a week or more.
If you need a repeat prescription, go to the nearest health centre or hospital A&E.

COVID-19 vaccines if you live in Cape Verde
Wherever possible British nationals should aim to be vaccinated in the country where they live. As further information is available about the national vaccination programme, this page will be updated. Sign up to get email notifications.
Cape Verde has published its national vaccination plan (in Portuguese), which will include resident UK nationals. The first phase started on 19 March. The first phase includes health professionals; people over 60 years of age; people with chronic illnesses (e.g. diabetes, lung or heart disease); tourism professionals; international border officers; police, fire brigade, army and teachers and support staff in schools.
If you are aged over 60, you’ll need to call the free helpline (+238) (0) 800 11 12 (lines open from 8am to 8pm every day) to enrol in the vaccination programme.
The Medicines and Healthcare Products Regulatory Agency (MHRA) is the UK authority responsible for assessing the safety, quality and efficacy of vaccines. It has authorised the Pfizer/BioNTech, Oxford/AstraZeneca and Moderna vaccines for temporary supply and use in the UK. Find out more about MHRA approval for these vaccines.
British nationals living overseas should seek medical advice from their local healthcare provider in the country where they reside. Information about vaccines used in other national programmes, including regulatory status, should be available from the local authorities. This list of Stringent Regulatory Authorities recognised by the World Health Organisation may also be a useful source of additional information. Find out more about COVID-19 vaccines on the World Health Organisation COVID-19 vaccines page.
