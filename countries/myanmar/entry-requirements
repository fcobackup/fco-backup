The information on this page covers the most common types of travel and reflects the UK government’s understanding of the rules currently in place. Unless otherwise stated, this information is for travellers using a full ‘British Citizen’ passport.
The authorities in the country or territory you’re travelling to are responsible for setting and enforcing the rules for entry. If you’re unclear about any aspect of the entry requirements, or you need further reassurance, you’ll need to contact the embassy, high commission or consulate of the country or territory you’re travelling to.
You should also consider checking with your transport provider or travel company to make sure your passport and other travel documents meet their requirements.
As of 15 March, the Foreign and Commonwealth Office (FCO) advise against all but essential travel to Myanmar due to the risk of quarantine for British nationals arriving in country. If you are in Myanmar and able to leave, you should do so.
There is an ongoing outbreak of coronavirus (COVID-19) around the world. Travel restrictions can be imposed at short notice.
Myanmar has imposed new restrictions: travellers who have recently visited Italy, Iran, France, Spain and Germany will be required to present a valid medical certificate issued by a medical facility recognised by their home country before being allowed to board their flights. On arrival they will be placed in government quarantine facilities for 14 days before being allowed to travel freely.. Travellers who have visited high risk areas of China (such as Hubei Province) or the Republic of Korea (such as Daugu and Gyeongbuk Regions) will not be permitted entry. This may also apply to passport holders from these countries even if they are travelling from elsewhere. This list of countries, and the nature of the restrictions, could change without warning.
Visas
You will need to get a visa before you travel. You should apply at the nearest Myanmar Embassy or Consulate well in advance of travelling. You can also apply online. For more information about entry requirements, contact the Myanmar Embassy.
Passport validity
Your passport should be valid for a minimum period of 6 months from the date of entry into Myanmar.
Restrictions on entering and exiting Myanmar at the same border crossing
Restrictions on exiting Myanmar at the same border crossing from which you entered have been partially relaxed. If you enter the country through the Tachilek (Myanmar Shan State), KawThoung (Myanmar Tanintharyi), Myawaddy (Myanmar Karen State) or Htee Khee-Sunaron (Myanmar Dawei District) border crossings you are able to depart via Yangon or Mandalay International Airport. However, if you enter via the Muse (Myanmar Shan State) or Tamu (Myanmar Chin State) border crossings you must exit at the crossing from which you entered.
Yellow fever
Check whether you need a yellow fever certificate by visiting the National Travel Health Network and Centre’s TravelHealthPro website.
UK Emergency Travel Documents
UK Emergency Travel Documents (ETDs) are not valid for entry into Myanmar. However, ETDs are accepted for exit from Myanmar.
