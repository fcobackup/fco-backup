Terrorists are very likely to try to carry out attacks in Bangladesh. The threat extends across the country. There is a risk that future attacks could also target public gatherings.
The last terrorist attack was the murder of Shahzahan Bachchu on 11 June 2018 when he was attacked and killed in the Munshiganj area of Dhaka Division.
Crowded areas and places where foreign nationals are known to gather may be at higher risk of attack. You should minimise your exposure to these areas, consider your movements carefully and follow any specific advice of the local security authorities.
The Bangladeshi authorities continue to disrupt planned attacks and have made a number of arrests. Some operations against suspected militants have also resulted in fatalities. The Bangladeshi authorities remain at high alert following previous incidents: there may be increases in security force presence and restrictions on movement may be put in place at short notice.
Since September 2015 Daesh (formerly referred to as ISIL) has claimed responsibility for a number of terrorist attacks in Bangladesh including:
The 1 July 2016 attack at the Holey Artisan Bakery in the Gulshan 2 district of Dhaka, which resulted in the death of 20 hostages, mainly foreign nationals, and 2 police officers.
The murders of 2 foreign nationals and sporadic attacks against minority religious communities and law the security forces, including attacks using suicide bombers.
Groups affiliated to Al Qaeda in the Indian Sub-continent (AQIS) have also claimed responsibility for the murder of a number people who they consider to have views and lifestyles contrary to Islam.
Online activists, including secular bloggers and 2 members of the LGBTI community, have been murdered most recently in June 2018.
Thereâ€™s a heightened threat of terrorist attack globally against UK interests and British nationals, from groups or individuals motivated by the conflict in Iraq and Syria. You should be vigilant at this time.
