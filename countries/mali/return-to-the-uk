There are currently no commercial flight options available to return to the UK from Mali.
Mali’s borders and international airports remain closed until further notice.
We know this is concerning for British nationals trying to leave Mali. The British Government is working closely with the Malian authorities and other governments to explore options for British nationals to return to the UK as soon as possible.
Flights
Malian borders remain open to those departing on special charter flights, but there have to date been only a limited number of exceptional international flights (run by overseas government charter). These flights could diminish in coming weeks. The British Government is not planning a commercial charter flight from Mali to the UK.
If you have been visiting Mali, you should plan to take up any options available to you to depart as soon as possible. Keep up to date with the latest information, including by signing up for email alerts for this travel advice and follow the British Embassy on Facebook.
You will probably need to pay for your return travel to the UK. If departure options become available but you cannot afford the travel costs and have exhausted all other options for getting funds, you may be eligible to apply for an emergency loan from the British Government. This is a last resort option and you would need to repay the loan when you are back in the UK. For more information, contact Corporate Travel Management (CTM). CTM are a commercial partner of the FCO and are authorised to administer such loans on behalf of the FCO.
Your journey home: re-entering the UK

are not allowed to leave the place you’re staying for the first 14 days you’re in the UK except in very limited situations (known as ‘self-isolating’)
See also the list of people who are exempt from the border rules.
The National Travel Health Network and Centre (NaTHNaC) also provides advice on how to stay safe as you travel by air.
