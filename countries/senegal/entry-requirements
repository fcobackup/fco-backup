The information on this page covers the most common types of travel and reflects the UK government’s understanding of the rules currently in place. Unless otherwise stated, this information is for travellers using a full ‘British Citizen’ passport.
The authorities in the country or territory you’re travelling to are responsible for setting and enforcing the rules for entry. If you’re unclear about any aspect of the entry requirements, or you need further reassurance, you’ll need to contact the embassy, high commission or consulate of the country or territory you’re travelling to.
You should also consider checking with your transport provider or travel company to make sure your passport and other travel documents meet their requirements.
Entry rules in response to coronavirus (COVID-19)
Entry to Senegal
The government of Senegal has said airlines are not allowed to carry foreign nationals from countries who have put in place travel restrictions for Senegal unless they are ordinarily resident in Senegal, diplomats, military, health professionals and other specific professional categories. Senegalese authorities have confirmed that British nationals are not subject to these entry restrictions.
Despite this, some airlines are only allowing foreign nationals with proof of residency in Senegal to travel. It is important to note that some airlines only accept a full residency card, and not a ‘recipice’, although the government of Senegal have confirmed that a ‘recipice’ is proof of residency. You should check with your airline before travelling.
To enter Senegal, you must provide a negative test dated no more than 7 days earlier, issued in the country where you started your trip and authorised by that country or a recognised health organisation. If this is not possible, you will need to declare that you have no symptoms and accept having a test done on arrival, if deemed necessary. This would be at your cost. If you have symptoms of COVID-19 or test positive, you will be taken into Senegalese health care.
If you are entering or leaving Senegal, you can pay for a COVID-19 test, at a cost of 40,000 CFA, at the following locations:
