There have been extensive protests across Ecuador since 3 October following new economic measures announced by the Government on 1 October. This has caused nationwide disruption, with demonstrations and road blockages in many provinces.
On that basis, the FCO advises against all but essential travel to Ecuador. The Galapagos Islands have not been significantly affected, nor has transit through Quito and Guayaquil airports to Galapagos.
Tensions remain high. The President moved the seat of government from the capital to Guayaquil and a State of Emergency was declared on 3 October, which will remain in force till 3 November. The Government decreed a curfew on 8 October and then 12 October, which has now been lifted. You should avoid all demonstrations, as these have turned violent in recent days and resulted in injuries and several fatalities. The Historic Centre in Quito and the vicinity of the National Assembly have been a particular focus for protests.
Travellers should consider carefully the practicalities and security implications of their travel plans. You should avoid inter-city travel by land where possible. Allow extra time to reach your destination and check travel plans regularly - you may need to change your plans. If your travel is affected by roadblocks, remain where you are until you have identified a safe route and means to travel. National supply chains are also being affected. You should ensure you have adequate essential supplies (food, water, fuel and medicine).
Monitor official sources via the ECU 911 emergency services - be wary of unverified, unofficial information. Updates on transport disruption are available on the ECU 911 website, from the Municipal Transport Agency for Quito and the Municipal Transport Agency for Guayaquil. If you need urgent consular assistance, contact the British Embassy Quito on +593 (0)2 397 2200.
Access to Quito airport has been blocked intermittently since 3 October. Some international and domestic flights have been cancelled. You should check your flight status with your airline before travelling to the airport. For live updates on all flights, monitor the Quito International Airport and Guayaquil International Airport websites (in Spanish).
