The security situation throughout Iraq remains uncertain, and could deteriorate quickly. On 8 January 2020, Iran fired missiles against two military bases in Iraq containing US personnel, one close to Erbil International Airport. No foreign casualties have been reported and Erbil Airport has resumed normal operations.
Early on 3 January, the US conducted a strike against a vehicle convoy in Baghdad. The Pentagon confirmed the death of Qasem Soleimani, Commander of Islamic Revolutionary Guards Corps-Quds Force and Abu Mehdi Muhandis, a senior commander in the Iraqi Popular Mobilisation Forces. A number of others were killed in the attack.
Large protests have been taking place in central Baghdad and across Iraq since October 2019. On 31 December and 1 January, violent demonstrations took place outside the US Embassy in Baghdad. There is a possibility of further protests in Baghdad.
There may be increased attention on Western nationals and interests in Iraq. If you’re in Iraq or decide to travel, make sure you have robust security arrangements and contingency plans in place and keep these under review. You should keep up to date with the latest developments across the country, including via the media and this travel advice, avoid any rallies, marches or processions, and follow the instructions of local authorities.

Flight schedules are currently subject to cancellation at short notice. Available departure options could reduce further and this could affect your ability to depart by air. If you are planning to depart Iraq by air, contact your airline or travel company for the latest information before travelling.
In the event of a sudden deterioration in the security station, there may be limits to the assistance the FCO can provide, depending on the security and transport situation. You should not assume that the FCO will be able to provide assistance to leave the country.
