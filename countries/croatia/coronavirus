International travel
In line with the treatment of non-EU/EEA nationals, from 1 January 2021 UK nationals travelling to Croatia from the UK, or any other non-EU/EEA country, are not permitted to enter the country for the duration of these COVID-19 restrictions. Limited exemptions will apply for Croatian residents and those travelling for urgent personal, family or business reasons (but are still subject to the requirement to present a negative PCR test result, not older than 48 hours on arrival, or isolate until a negative test result has been obtained locally at their own expense). Rapid antigen tests or serological tests will not be accepted. See information from the Croatian government for further details. If you were due to travel to Croatia from the United Kingdom, you should contact your travel operator. If you need to travel according to one of the limited exceptions listed above, check our advice on things to consider, and be prepared to stay overseas longer than planned.
