The information on this page covers the most common types of travel and reflects the UK government’s understanding of the rules currently in place. Unless otherwise stated, this information is for travellers using a full ‘British Citizen’ passport.
The authorities in the country or territory you’re travelling to are responsible for setting and enforcing the rules for entry. If you’re unclear about any aspect of the entry requirements, or you need further reassurance, you’ll need to contact the embassy, high commission or consulate of the country or territory you’re travelling to.
You should also consider checking with your transport provider or travel company to make sure your passport and other travel documents meet their requirements.
Entry rules in response to coronavirus
Before you travel
You must have a valid visa before you travel. Visas cannot currently be issued on arrival. To enter Oman, you will need evidence of a negative PCR test, taken 96 hours or less before your arrival in Oman. You should not use the NHS testing service to get a test in order to facilitate your travel to another country. You should arrange to take a private test. You should check with your airline what documentation they require you to produce.
You will also need to have downloaded the Tarassud+ and HMushrif track and trace applications (available on iOS and Android phones). While you can do this on arrival in Muscat, you should aim to download it before you leave the UK.
When checking in at the airport, residents returning to Oman must present either proof of their accommodation (such as a rental agreement) or have a letter from their sponsor confirming that they have accommodation. Travellers with tourist, business ‘express’ or family visit visas should also have proof of their accommodation. You must also be able to show you have travel/health insurance for the duration of your stay, covering at least 30 days of coronavirus treatment.
Travel by air
British nationals with valid residence, tourist, business ‘express’ or family visit visas can enter Oman. Any other travellers should seek approval via their airline. Alternatively, their sponsors can email the Omani MFA at consular@mofa.gov.om. All permissions to return to Oman are subject to the government of Oman’s approval.
Travel by land
In exceptional circumstances, British nationals with residency status in Oman can enter through the land border from UAE but must have prior permission from the Omani authorities (Royal Oman Police immigration) and meet UAE covid-testing exit criteria. British nationals can also cross the land border from Oman into the UAE but they must have prior permission from the Emirati immigration authorities and meet UAE covid-testing entry criteria. For more details check the Federal Authority for Identity and Citizenship website and our Travel Advice for the UAE.
Screening on arrival
On arrival in Oman you will have your temperature checked. If you show symptoms of coronavirus you may be sent to a testing centre and/or a quarantine facility.
All arrivals (over the age of 15) will be required to have a PCR test (nasal swab) at Muscat International Airport. There is a charge of 19 Omani Riyals for this test. You can pay for this test through the Tarassud+ App before you arrive in Oman. You will then receive a QR code that you can show at the screening point.
If you are staying in Oman for more than 7 days, you will also be required (if you are over the age of 15) to wear a tracking bracelet for the period of your self-isolation. There is a charge (also payable through the Tarassud+ application) of 6 Omani Riyals for the bracelet. Bracelets must be returned once you have completed your self-isolation. Some health clinics have established drop off points for this purpose.
Quarantine requirements
The results of the PCR test undertaken at the airport will be sent to your registered phone (usually within 24 hours). You should self-isolate until you receive the result.
If your PCR test result was negative, and you are staying in Oman for less than 7 days, you can end your self-isolation.
If you are staying in Oman for more than 7 days, regardless of the result of the PCR test taken at the airport, you must continue to self-isolate until you have done so for 7 days. On the eighth day you must have another PCR test. These can be taken at some hospitals, private health clinics or at a drive through testing facility at Muscat airport. If the result is negative you can have your tracking bracelet removed and end your self-isolation. You may be charged a small additional fee to have the bracelet removed.
Foreign nationals with resident status can self-isolate either at their home in Oman or other in other accommodation (eg hotels) with proof of their ability to cover living costs during that period.
Data collection
Prior to travelling, you should download the Tarassud+ track and trace application. Through that app, or on arrival, you will need to pay 19 Omani Riyals for a PCR test (testing on arrival) and, if you are staying more than 7 days, an additional 6 Omani Riyals for a tracking bracelet.
Testing on departure
On departure you will have your temperature checked. If you show symptoms of coronavirus, you may be prevented from travelling.
Regular entry requirements
Visas
See ‘entry rules in response to coronavirus’ section.
Passport validity
Your passport should have at least 6 months’ validity remaining on your date of entry to Oman.
Oman doesn’t recognise dual nationality. If you hold both British and Oman nationalities and this becomes known to the Omani authorities, they may confiscate your Omani or British passport.
Yellow fever certificate requirements
Check whether you need a yellow fever certificate by visiting the National Travel Health Network and Centre’s TravelHealthPro website.
UK Emergency Travel Documents
UK Emergency Travel Documents (ETDs) are valid for entry, exit and transit in Oman however they must have at least 6 months’ remaining validity. Residents and tourists will need to get an exit stamp before leaving. This can cause delays and may prevent you from leaving on your booked flight. Check your passport carefully to make sure it’s legal and valid so that you don’t need an ETD.
Travelling with medication
Some prescribed and over the counter medicines available in the UK are banned substances in Oman. If you’re travelling to Oman with prescription drugs, carry a copy of the prescription. For further information, check with Oman’s Ministry of Health well in advance of travel.
