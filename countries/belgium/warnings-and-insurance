The Foreign, Commonwealth & Development Office (FCDO) provides advice about risks of travel to help British nationals make informed decisions. Find out more about FCDO travel advice.
A shooting on Boulevard d’Ypres in central Brussels on 16 October2023 caused two fatalities. In response to the terrorist attack, the Belgian authorities raised the threat level for the Brussels-Capital Region to the maximum level 4 and advised people to refrain from unnecessary travel.
The threat level has now been lowered to level 3 ‘Serious’ for the whole of Belgium. You can expect to see an increased police presence, and additional safety measures may be in place. Be aware of your surroundings, and follow the advice of local authorities.
