The legal status and regulation of some medicines prescribed or bought in the UK can be different in other countries.
Read best practice when travelling with medicines on TravelHealthPro.
Vietnam has restrictions on medicines it classifies as ‘addictive’ or ‘psychotropic’. These include medicine used to treat of addiction, anxiety, depression, insomnia and other conditions.
It is illegal to have more than the amount prescribed by a doctor for 7 days (addictive medicine) or 10 days (psychotropic medicine). You should carry the prescription with your medication and a letter from your doctor stating how much of the medication you need during your trip.
The letter can be in English and should:
include your name and age
list the medicine name, volume and dosage
include the doctor’s signature and address
If you’re unsure if your medication falls within these categories or you need to bring more medication than is usually allowed, contact the Vietnamese Embassy in the UK before travelling.
