Entry and borders
With effect from 16 March, and until at least 5 April, international arrival flights have been suspended, and foreign nationals are no longer admitted by air, land or sea. The same restriction applied to Ecuadorean nationals and foreign residents from midnight on 16 March. Land borders have also been closed following decisions from the Peruvian and Colombian authorities.
All passengers arriving from abroad before midnight on 15 March were required to fill in a declaration form with their itinerary and specific local contact details, and are subject to mandatory self-isolation for 14 days. This will be at the individual’s own expense, in hotels or private accommodation. The Ministry of Health has published more information on coronavirus protocols that also allows direct messaging with the Ministry (Spanish only).
Guayaquil airport was closed on the evening of 18 March and 19 March. However, the National Emergency Operations Committee has confirmed that all airports will be operative for pre-authorised international flights with humanitarian purposes and cargo. If you need to go to the airport in Guayaquil, we strongly advise that you do so well in advance of curfew hours. Curfew in Guayas province runs from 4pm to 5am, until 23 March.
Travel to the Galapagos
All travel to the Galapagos has been suspended with effect from 16 March. However, the Government is working to arrange flights from Galapagos to mainland Ecuador.

Visas
The Ministry of Foreign Affairs has confirmed that all tourist visas will be granted automatic extension if they expire while the state of emergency is in place.
Safe passage documents
Authorities are requiring individuals to have a safe passage document when travelling between provinces and to the airport. Email BritishEmbassy.Quito@fco.gov.uk to get a safe passage document. A consular officer will respond as quickly as possible. It is very important that you carry documents that justify your movement, including a confirmed booking, your passport and the safe passage document referred above.
Local measures
President Moreno declared a state of emergency on 16 March that will last for 60 days.
All public gatherings are prohibited. All public services, except health, security and risk management, are closed nationwide. Only supermarkets, pharmacies, take-away restaurants, petrol stations and some banks will be open.
All national parks, museums and entertainment centres have been closed until further notice. All school and universities classes are suspended.
The Government announced that a stricter nationwide curfew will apply from 21 March. This restricts all movement from 7pm to 5am, except for the province of Guayas where curfew will continue to start at 4pm.
Journeys should be limited to essential trips, for example to buy food or medicine. Vehicles with number plates ending in an even number or zero will only be allowed to circulate on Mondays, Wednesdays, Fridays and Sundays. Vehicles with number plates ending in an odd number will be allowed to circulate on Tuesdays, Thursday and Saturdays.
The Mayor of Quito announced additional restrictions on 16 March. Within Quito, all movement in public spaces will be prohibited from 5am on 17 March – except for those people buying essential supplies and medicines, health workers and emergency service personnel.
All buses, private vehicles and bicycles will be prohibited from circulating, except for the delivery of food and medicines. These measures will apply for 15 days. A safe passage document is not required if you need to buy food and medicine.
You should find secure accommodation while these restrictions remain in force. The Government has emphasised that these measures will be enforced robustly and infringements will be sanctioned. You should ensure you comply, including with self-isolation measures. Check specific details on self-isolation (Spanish only).
