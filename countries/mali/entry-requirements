This page has information on travelling to Mali.
This page reflects the UK government’s understanding of current rules for people travelling on a full ‘British Citizen’ passport from the UK, for the most common types of travel.
The authorities in Mali set and enforce entry rules. If you’re unsure how Mali’s entry requirements apply to you, contact its UK embassy, high commission or consulate.
All Travellers
You need a visa to enter Mali. You can apply for single and multiple entry visas from the Embassy in Brussels or via the Malian Honorary Consulate in London.
To enter Mali you will need proof of a “complete COVID vaccination” (i.e. usually at least two doses). If you do not have proof of a complete vaccination, you need to present a negative COVID test (PCR) certificate less than 72 hours old.
You should not use the NHS testing service to get a test in order to facilitate your travel to another country. You should arrange to take a private test.
Provided you meet the above requirements, you are not required to quarantine on arrival.
If you test positive whilst you are in Mali, you are expected to self-isolate for 14 days.
Children and young people
British Embassy Bamako has been informed that children under 5 are not required to provide a negative Covid test on arrival at Bamako airport. You should check with your airline before travelling for the most up to date guidance.
If you’re transiting through Mali
Transiting is when you pass through one country on the way to your final destination.
Check with your airline before departing.
