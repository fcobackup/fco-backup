Crime
Crime levels are generally low, but pickpockets and bag-snatchers operate in crowded areas mainly around Copenhagen.
Be aware that thieves can use a variety of methods to distract you, particularly when getting on and off from crowded public transport. Thieves are also known to operate opportunistically around hotel lobby areas and in cafes and restaurants.
Keep your personal belongings, including passports and money secure. You should also keep an eye on luggage, including in the overhead baggage compartment when travelling on trains to and from the airport.
This kind of crime is more common at the central station, Nørreport Station and on the main shopping street called Strøget and other areas popular with tourists such as Christiania, Nyhavn and Kongens Nytorv. Pickpockets are also known to operate inside Kastrup airport.
You should take extra care in Christiania and Nørrebro, particularly late at night. There have been some instances of gang violence in these areas.
Local travel
Public transport is generally of a very high standard. Always buy a ticket before boarding the train or metro. You can buy your ticket in ticket machines, which accept Danish cash and the most common credit cards, or 7 Eleven kiosks at the train and metro stations. In Copenhagen Airport arrival hall and at Copenhagen Central Station there is a DSB ticket office as well as ticket machines. Please note that not all ticket types/travel cards are for sale via machines. Onboard the buses in Copenhagen, you also have the possibility to buy your ticket from the driver, if you bring small change.
The same ticket can be used in the metro, bus, train and harbour bus. Always have your ticket with you in case a conductor wants to see it. Travelling without a valid ticket will result in a fine of up to DKK 1000.
Download the app ”DOT Billetter” in App Store and Google Play and pay for your tickets on the go. Click “Indstillinger” (settings) followed by “Sprog” (language) to select English version. From there you can select the fare you need and enter your credit card details.
You can also buy your bus, train and metro tickets online.

Bicycles are widely used in Denmark and cycle lanes are commonplace. Many accidents occur when pedestrians don’t give the right of way to bicycles. Guides on cycling in Denmark have been published in English on the websites of Visit Copenhagen and Cyklistforbundet (Danish Cyclists’ Federation).
Electric scooters are available as a means of transport in and around Copenhagen and other locations in Denmark. Electric scooters are subject to road traffic rules; hiring and using these scooters under the influence of alcohol could result in a drink driver offence and a fine.
Ferries are available to transport you to Denmark’s many islands.

Driving standards
Road conditions in Denmark are good and driving standards are fairly high. In 2019 there were 199 road deaths in Denmark (source: Department for Transport). This equates to 3.40 road deaths per 100,000 of the population and compares to the UK average of 2.6 road deaths per 100,000 of population in 2019.
Driving regulations
Always wear seatbelts.
You must drive with dipped headlights at all times and they should be masked with special European opaque material available from most garages in the UK and Ireland. It is now law in Denmark to indicate before changing lanes on a motorway. You should carry a warning triangle in case of breakdowns.
Sanctions for speeding have become tougher. Those caught driving 100km/h in a 50km/h zone or past road works with a 50km/h restriction may immediately lose their licence.
You must give due consideration to the many cyclists present in Danish cities. Cyclists often have the right of way. It is particularly important that you check cycle lanes before turning right. See the European Commission, AA and RAC guides on driving in Denmark.
Employment
You should check carefully whether any offers of employment for asphalting or seasonal work are genuine, as there have been examples of people being misled Information on working in Denmark is available at newtodenmark.dk.
