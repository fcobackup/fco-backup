There is a general threat from terrorism. There may be increased security in place over the festive period, including at Christmas markets and other major events that might attract large crowds. You should remain vigilant and follow the advice of local authorities.
Farmers have announced that they plan protests across France on 27 November. In the Paris region, protests will begin early in the morning and are expected to include road blockades on motorways and main roads into the city. Protests are also taking place in the Champs-Elysées area. Similar protests can be expected elsewhere in France. You should plan your travel accordingly.
From Thursday 5 December, strikes are expected across France which will primarily affect public transport with cancellations and severe delays expected on trains, metros, buses and trams. Disruption and cancellations to Eurostar services between London St. Pancras and Gare du Nord are expected. Other international rail services such as those to the Netherlands and Belgium could also be affected. You should check services before travelling.
Demonstrations by hauliers on some major roads may also cause delays or blockages. Strike action by Air France workers and air traffic controllers may also cause disruption to air travel. You should check services before travelling. Additional protests may also be held linked to the yellow vest (gilets jaunes) movement. In all cases, you should avoid demonstrations wherever possible and follow the advice of the local authorities.
If you’re crossing the Channel, check the website of your chosen operator before you set off. In the event of any disruption, information about alternative routes and operators is available via this interactive map.
There remain some migrants around Calais, who may seek to enter the UK illegally. There have been instances of migrants seeking to slow down traffic on approach roads to ports, including by placing obstacles on the Calais Port approach road. If this happens you should keep moving where it’s safe to do so, or stop and call 112 if isn’t safe to proceed (keeping car doors locked).
Terrorists are very likely to try to carry out attacks in France. Due to ongoing threats to France by Islamist terrorist groups, and recent French military intervention against Daesh (formerly referred to as ISIL), the French government has warned the public to be especially vigilant and has reinforced its security measures. Check the French government’s advice about what to do if a terrorist attack occurs. See Terrorism
