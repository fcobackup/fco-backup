The information on this page covers the most common types of travel and reflects the UK government’s understanding of the rules currently in place. Unless otherwise stated, this information is for travellers using a full ‘British Citizen’ passport.
The authorities in the country or territory you’re travelling to are responsible for setting and enforcing the rules for entry. If you’re unclear about any aspect of the entry requirements, or you need further reassurance, you’ll need to contact the embassy, high commission or consulate of the country or territory you’re travelling to.
You should also consider checking with your transport provider or travel company to make sure your passport and other travel documents meet their requirements.
Entry rules in response to coronavirus
Entry to Norway
The Norwegian Government has announced that from 1 January UK nationals/travellers who have passed through the UK/non-EU and EEA nationals resident in the UK may not be permitted entry to Norway for non-essential purposes due to EEA COVID-19 restrictions. Essential travel is still permitted and a list of exemptions for entering Norway can be found here.
These restrictions do not apply to UK nationals who are legally resident in Norway. You will be allowed to re-enter the country, but may need to show proof of residence.
UK nationals who arrive from a red country must present a negative COVID-19 test certificate upon arrival in Norway. There are some exemptions to this requirement, which you can read on the UDI website. The test must have been taken less than 72 hours before entry and be in English, Norwegian, Swedish, Danish, French of German. The approved testing methods are PCR or Rapid antigen test. You may be denied entry at the Norwegian border, or boarding at the airport, if you do not have a test certificate when required. You should not use the NHS testing service to get a test in order to facilitate your travel to another country. You should arrange to take a private test.
All travellers from red countries must spend the first ten days in Norway in quarantine and must complete a self-declaration form confirming where you will be completing your quarantine period. This period must be spent in a quarantine hotel, unless you meet one of the exemptions as outlined by UDI. Those exempt from hotel quarantine are required to travel directly to an appropriate place of quarantine, preferably using private transportation. If you must use public transport, you should use a facemask during the journey.
These requirements do not apply to UK nationals resident in Norway or those transiting the country. For more details, read the information from the Norwegian government.
For those resident outside the UK, Nordics, Schengen or EU/EEA, stricter restrictions apply. For more details on which countries and regions are exempt, see the Norwegian Institute of Public Health website. The list of countries is being reviewed at least every 14 days with amendments made as the transmission situation changes.
A free coronavirus testing service is available at many international airports in Norway. Taking a test at an airport is not mandatory and a negative result does not exempt you from quarantine or other recently introduced restrictions.
For more information, contact the Norwegian Embassy in London. Detailed guidance is available on the UDI website.
Visiting from 1 January
The Norwegian government has stated that from 1 January 2021 UK nationals will no longer be classified as EU/EEA nationals. New restrictions will apply that may affect your ability to enter the country. Please see the UDI website for more detail.
These restrictions will not apply to UK nationals legally resident in Norway by 31 December 2020. Those who are legally resident in Norway will be allowed to re-enter the country when travelling but may need to show evidence of residency. This could happen at the Norwegian border or at an airport outside of Norway. The Norwegian authorities will soon introduce a residency card for eligible UK nationals living in Norway to help prove their status when travelling. The application process is due to open in January 2021.
Transiting Norway
Non-residents are still able to transit via Norwegian airports as long as the final destination is not within Norway, but please check with your airline before departing.
Cruises
The Foreign, Commonwealth & Development Office (FCDO) advises against cruise ship travel at this time. This is due to the ongoing pandemic and is based on medical advice from Public Health England.
A number of Norwegian ports are restricting passenger embarkation and disembarkation. The situation can change rapidly so check with your cruise provider for the latest information.
Visas
The Norwegian authorities have confirmed that if your visa has expired or is at risk of expiring, you will be not punished if you overstay as a result of COVID-19 or airline cancellations.. You are not required to notify UDI or the police, but are asked to try to leave as quickly as possible.
Regular entry requirements
Visas
If you hold a British Citizen passport, you don’t need a visa to enter Norway. If you’re planning to stay longer than 3 months, see our Living in Norway guide and contact the Norwegian Embassy with any further questions.
The rules on travel will stay the same until 31 December 2020.
Visas from 1 January 2021
The rules for travelling or working in Europe will change from 1 January 2021:
you will be able to travel to countries in the Schengen area for up to 90 days in any 180-day period without a visa as a tourist, to visit family or friends, to attend business meetings, cultural or sports events, or for short-term studies or training.
if you are travelling to Norway and other Schengen countries without a visa, make sure your whole visit is within the limit. Visits to Schengen countries within the previous 180 days before you travel would count towards the 90-day limit
to stay for longer, to work or study, for business travel or for other reasons, you will need to meet the entry requirements set out by Norway. This could mean applying for a visa and/or work permit. You should check with the Norwegian Embassy what type of visa and/or work permit, if any, you will need
if you are in Norway with a visa or permit, your stay will not count towards the 90-day limit
The 90-day limit for visa-free travel will begin on 1 January 2021. Any days you stay in Norway or other Schengen countries before 1 January 2021 will not count towards the 90-day limit.
At border control for Norway, you may need to:
show a return or onward ticket
show you have enough money for your stay, and
use separate lanes from EU, EEA and Swiss citizens when queueing
Your passport may be stamped on entry and exit.
Passport validity
Your passport should be valid for a minimum period of 3 months beyond your intended period of stay. Further details on entering Norway can be found on the UDI website.
Passport validity from 1 January 2021
From 1 January 2021, you must have at least 6 months left on an adult or child passport to travel to most countries in Europe (not including Ireland).
If you renewed your current passport before the previous one expired, extra months may have been added to its expiry date. Any extra months on your passport over 10 years may not count towards the 6 months needed.
Check your passport is valid for travel before you book your trip. You will need to renew your passport before travelling if you do not have enough time left on your passport.
Svalbard
You’ll need your passport with you to travel to and enter Svalbard.
UK Emergency Travel Documents (ETDs)
UK ETDs are accepted for entry, airside transit and exit from Norway.
Pets
Check with the Norwegian Embassy in London before travelling with pets.
