This page gives you guidance on how to stay safely in Chile as a visitor, if you are unable to return to the UK.
Everyone should comply with the measures put in place in Chile to limit the spread of coronavirus (COVID-19).
Moving around in Chile
For information on entering Chile, see Entry Requirements.
Chilean President Sebastian Piñera announced a 90-day ‘National State of Catastrophe’ on Wednesday 18 March 2020. A nationwide curfew (10pm to 5am) has been in place since 22 March.
Quarantine and sanitary cordons
Quarantine orders and sanitary cordons are in place in Santiago and in other parts of the country.
Chile is deploying a flexible approach to bringing municipal areas in and out of quarantine/sanitary cordons. New measures can be announced by the government at any time and come into force shortly after, although changes are typically announced every Wednesday and are applied from Fridays onwards.
All of the metropolitan region of Santiago and six neighbouring municipalities (San Bernardo, Buin, Puente Alto, Padre Hurtado, Lampa y Colina) remain under quarantine until at least 26 June (inclusive). In addition, the urban areas of Melipilla, Curacaví, Til Til and San José de Maipo are under quarantine orders until at least 26 June (inclusive).
Full quarantine is also in place until at least 26 June (inclusive) in Iquique (Tarapacá), Alto Hospicio (Tarapacá), Pozo Almonte (Tarapaca), Valparaíso, Viña del Mar, San Antonio (Valparaíso) and Calama (Antofagasta). In addition, from 10 pm on 19 June until at least 26 June (inclusive) Los Andes (Valparaíso), San Felipe (Valparaíso), Rancagua (O’Higgins Region), Machalí (O’Higgins Region) and Curicó (Maule) will be in quarantine.
Sanitary cordons are in place in the Santiago metropolitan region, Pirque, Valparaíso, Viña del Mar, Chiloé, Alto Biobío, Osorno, Puerto Williams, Punta Arenas and San Antonio (Valparaíso).
Information on zones in quarantine is available on this Google interactive map.
In those areas in quarantine, people are allowed to leave their residences only under certain circumstances, including for medical reasons, basic services, and public services. If you need to leave your residence for food supplies or medical reasons, you must get a permit from the Comisaria Virtual.
Foreigners may use their passport number to access the system. The pages are only in Spanish. It is not possible to leave or enter a sanitary cordon without a “salvoconducto” (police authorization), also obtained via the Comisaria Virtual.
Checkpoints for health inspections are in force at various points around Santiago and elsewhere. In addition to checking the health of persons passing through, these checkpoints will be used to confirm that specific individuals who have been ordered to quarantine by medical authorities are not violating their quarantine. You will need to get a “Health Passport” prior to travel and present it at any checkpoint.

Finance
There is a range of financial support from the government that you can access while you are unable to return due to coronavirus restrictions.
If you’re in Chile, and have exhausted all other options to cover essential living costs while you wait to return home, you could apply for an emergency loan for your living costs from the UK government. You can only apply if you normally live in the UK and you cannot return home. This last-resort option is for those most in need, and you would need to repay the loan when you are back in the UK. Apply for an emergency loan.

Help and support
If you need urgent consular assistance, contact your nearest British embassy, high commission or consulate. All telephone numbers are available 24/7.
