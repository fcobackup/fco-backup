The information on this page covers the most common types of travel and reflects the UK government’s understanding of the rules currently in place. Unless otherwise stated, this information is for travellers using a full ‘British Citizen’ passport.
The authorities in the country or territory you’re travelling to are responsible for setting and enforcing the rules for entry. If you’re unclear about any aspect of the entry requirements, or you need further reassurance, you’ll need to contact the embassy, high commission or consulate of the country or territory you’re travelling to.
You should also consider checking with your transport provider or travel company to make sure your passport and other travel documents meet their requirements.
Restrictions in response to coronavirus
The Portuguese authorities have introduced a series of measures in relation to coronavirus. See Staying during coronavirus.
Land
Land border controls with Spain were lifted on 1 July. Check travel advice for Spain before travelling.
Air - Mainland Portugal
You will be subject to health screening on arrival. Your temperature will be checked and if it is high or you show signs of being unwell, you will be referred to the health authorities.
Air - Madeira and the Azores
If you are travelling to Madeira or Porto Santo, complete and submit this form 24-48 hours before you arrive in the archipelago. On arrival, you will be required to:
Show proof of a negative COVID-19 test, carried out 72 hours before you arrive, or
Take a test on arrival and await the results within 12 hours at your accommodation
If you are travelling to the Azores, you will be required to:
show proof of a negative COVID-19 test carried out 72 hours before arrival. If you are staying for more than 7 days, you will have to repeat the test locally 6 days after the date of the first test, or
take a test on arrival and await the results within 48 hours in voluntary quarantine. If you are staying for more than 7 days, you will have to repeat the test after 6 days, If you cannot fulfil the entry requirements, you will be required to return to your country of origin.
Ports and vessels
Cruise ships can berth at ports on mainland Portugal, but passengers can only disembark if they are Portuguese nationals or residents. Recreational vessels and private yachts are still not permitted to dock, except for refuelling or taking on supplies. Passengers may only disembark to return to their country of origin and once they have completed 14 days’ self-quarantine on board, starting from the day the vessel entered Portuguese territorial waters.
Cruise ships are allowed to dock in Madeira and Porto Santo for a maximum period of 48 hours, but passengers and crew are not allowed to embark or disembark.
Yachts are permitted to dock in the Azores, but crew members will be subject to the same health screening and voluntary quarantine measures as airline passengers.

Regular entry requirements
Passport validity
Your passport should be valid for the proposed duration of your stay; you do not need any additional period of validity on your passport beyond this.
The rules on travel will stay the same until 31 December 2020.
Visas
If you hold a British Citizen passport, you don’t need a visa to enter Portugal. If you’re planning a stay of longer than 3 months, see our Living in Portugal guide and contact the Portuguese Embassy if you have further questions.
The rules on travel will stay the same until 31 December 2020.
Travelling with children
Portuguese Border Control (SEF) advise that a child under the age of 18 who is travelling to Portugal alone or without a parent or legal guardian should either:
be met at the airport or point of entry by their parent or guardian, or
carry a letter of authorisation to travel from their parent or guardian. The letter should name the adult in Portugal who will be responsible for them during their stay. There is no legal requirement for the letter to be notarised. However, the onus is on the parent or legal guardian to provide reasonable evidence, including contact details, to confirm that adequate care arrangements are in place.
Resident minors leaving Portugal
A child under the age of 18 who is resident in Portugal must carry a notarised letter of authority from their parent or guardian if they’re travelling out of the country alone or without a parent or legal guardian. The letter of authority can be issued by:
one of the child’s parents (if the parents are married)
the parent the child lives with (if the parents are separated or divorced)
one of the adoptive parents (if the child is adopted) or
the child’s legal guardian
Further information in English, together with a standard form of words (in Portuguese), are available on the Portuguese immigration service website
UK Emergency Travel Documents (ETDs)
