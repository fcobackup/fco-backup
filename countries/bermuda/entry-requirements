Entry rules in response to coronavirus (COVID-19)
Entry to Bermuda
All visitors from a country classified by the WHO as having community transmission of COVID-19 (including the UK) will need to apply for a Bermuda COVID-19 Travel Authorisation 1 to 3 days before departure. By applying for a Travel Authorisation, visitors and residents agree to comply with Bermuda’s quarantine and public health laws instructions at all times. As of 20 June 2021, all travellers who are unimmunised and arrive in Bermuda must quarantine at a designated Quarantine Hotel at their own expense. Travellers may apply for an exemption. If you receive an approved exemption from the hotel, you must quarantine at a residence for 14 days and test on day 14.
From 23rd August 2021, unvaccinated travellers with a valid pre-arrival test will be required to quarantine for 14 days upon arrival in Bermuda. The requirements for a valid test can be found at https://www.gov.bm/are-you-unimmunised. They will quarantine at a designated hotel facility for the first four days of their holiday. Following the receipt of a negative day 4 test, they will then be allowed to complete the remaining 10 days of their quarantine at home, fitted with an electronic monitoring device. They will need to test on days 4 and 14. If the traveller who is allowed to quarantine at home does not live alone, all other members of the household will be required to quarantine as well and must also test out of quarantine on day 14.
From 23rd August 2021, unvaccinated travellers without a valid pre-arrival test will be required to quarantine for 14 days. They will spend the first week in a designated hotel facility. Following receipt of a negative Day 8 test, they will be allowed to complete the final days of quarantine at home fitted with an electronic monitoring device. These travellers will test on days 8 and 14. If they do not live alone, all other members of their household will be required to quarantine as well, and all members of the household must test out of quarantine on day 14.
Travellers not willing to quarantine at a Quarantine Hotel or who do not have an approved exemption will not be allowed entry into Bermuda.
Immunised travellers with a valid negative, pre-arrival Covid-19 PCR test result must quarantine until they receive a negative result from their arrival Covid-19 PCR test. Immunised travellers without a valid negative, pre-arrival Covid-19 test result must quarantine until they receive a negative day 4 Covid-19 test.

All travellers to Bermuda who are arriving from Brazil, India or South Africa or who have visited Brazil, India or South Africa in the 14 days before they arrive in Bermuda must quarantine in their accommodation for 14 days. They may only be released from quarantine after receiving a negative result from the Day 14 COVID-19 test. In this case, if the traveller is immunised, they are able to make use of the whole property in which they are staying whilst they are quarantining. However, if the traveller is not immunised they must stay in their room.
You must wear face masks when travelling to the departure airport and practise social distancing at the departure airport.
Upon arrival, you must show a copy of your Travel Authorisation and present a copy of the pre-departure PCR COVID-19 negative test result to health officers on request.
All travellers will undergo PCR COVID-19 testing at the Bermuda L.F. Wade International Airport. It is important that you adhere to the COVID-19 guidance and quarantine in your accommodation until airport test results are ready. Failure to adhere to guidelines could result in a fine of up to $25,000 and/or up to six months imprisonment.
