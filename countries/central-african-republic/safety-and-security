Local travel
Bangui remains fragile with periodic instances of killings, looting, house burglaries and gunfire. There are also armed patrols in Bangui and you will encounter several roadblocks (official and unofficial) that are likely to be manned by armed personnel. Take particular care when approaching these and travel in groups if possible.
Security conditions outside of Bangui are extremely unstable. There have been recent incidents of rebel activity, banditry and hostage-taking across the country.
Crime
Worsening inflation, fuel shortages and food insecurity are aggravating causes of crime. Incidents of theft and robbery occur regularly and armed gangs are known to operate in the outlying areas of Bangui. Take personal security precautions and be vigilant in public places. Avoid carrying valuables or wearing jewellery in public. Do not walk alone at night. Avoid isolated or poorer areas.
Road travel
You need to have a 1968 International Driving Permit (IDP) to drive in CAR, please note that 1926 and 1949 IDPs will not be accepted. From 1 February 2019, you can only get IDPs over the counter from 2,500 UK Post Offices. It may be extremely difficult to obtain an IDP in CAR. FCDO recommends buying one in the UK before departure.
Roads are poorly maintained and most need a four-wheel drive vehicle. Road travel is particularly difficult during the wet season (May to November). If you do decide to travel by road, you should keep a private supply of fuel if possible and carry supplies with you if travelling outside Bangui.
Illegal roadblocks operate in remote areas. You may be forced to hand over money or possessions in order to continue your journey. There have been indiscriminate and violent attacks on travellers in remote areas. Vehicles have been fired on, and passengers killed or injured. In many of these cases, victims have been robbed or taken hostage and vehicles taken or burnt.
Seek local advice before travelling and FCDO recommends that you do not travel after dark.
Political situation
Following the constitutional referendum which took place in July 2023, there is an increased risk of social unrest.
Consular assistance
Consular support is severely limited in the CAR as there is no British Embassy. However, the British Embassy Kinshasa, in the Democratic Republic of Congo can provide limited remote consular support to British nationals. In an emergency, British nationals should contact the British Embassy Kinshasa, in the Democratic Republic of Congo. The French Embassy in Bangui may also be able to offer some consular assistance (telephone: +236 613 000 or +236 610 584) to those requiring urgent help.
