The movement of goods is not restricted.
Health screening
British nationals without Lithuanian residency are not permitted to enter the country whilst quarantine measures are in place.
British nationals with Lithuanian residency or the right to study in Lithuania may enter the country, but will be required to self-isolate for 14 days. While in self-isolation, you must:
Not leave your accommodation without medical permission;
Not have guests/visitors;
Organise for essential provisions to be delivered by municipal authorities, friends, family or delivery services;
Consult with a GP by phone/email to arrange extensions to prescriptions;
Measure your temperature on a daily basis; and
Call the Emergency Response Centre on 112, or Covid-19 hotline on 1808, if you develop a fever, cough or experience difficulty breathing.
All people arriving from overseas will be screened and tested for coronavirus at the border checkpoint, and will be asked to sign a commitment to comply with self-isolation requirements for 14 days. Those refusing to sign or without suitable accommodation will stay in municipal accommodation for the duration of the self-isolation period. Municipal transportation will be provided to all who have no transport of their own and those staying in municipal accommodation.
Individuals staying in municipal accommodation will have their own room or one room per family (if travelling as a family unit) and at least one bathroom for every two rooms. Municipal premises will include means for cleaning and disinfection, waste disposal, bedding and facilities for collecting unclean clothing, where a laundry service is not available.
Municipalities will also be responsible for providing high quality and proper meals (taking into account dietary requirements), as well as delivering essential supplies (medicine, hygiene items, clothing), or will allow them to be provided by relatives.
British nationals who are already in isolation in Lithuania will be able to continue to self-isolate in their place of residence, if they live alone or are able to isolate themselves from others in the household. They will also have to sign a commitment to comply with self-isolation requirements.
Breaches of isolation requirements will result in a fine and a requirement to move to municipal accommodation for the remainder of the self-isolation period.
