You can spread the virus even if you don’t have symptoms.

Cases of coronavirus (COVID-19) have been confirmed in Germany. The German authorities have introduced a number of temporary enforceable rules to limit the spread of the virus.
British nationals in Germany should follow the advice of the German authorities. British nationals in Germany who wish to leave should contact their travel operator to make arrangements to do so as soon as possible. There are now only limited commercial means of leaving Germany to return to the UK by air, from just a few major airports in Germany. This is subject to change, and availability may reduce further, see Return to the UK
Entry and borders
Germany has intensified border controls at airports and land borders. Unless travellers are resident in Germany, can demonstrate a compelling reason for their travel to Germany, or are border workers commuting between Germany and neighbouring countries, they will be refused entry. If you intend to fly to Germany, check with your airline before you travel and ensure you bring any supporting documents you need to justify your travel. If you are transiting through an airport in Germany in order to travel to the UK, you will need to have onward travel, and, if necessary, temporary accommodation booked before you will be permitted to enter Germany.
Resident British nationals are permitted to return as long as their habitual place of residence is Germany and they are able to provide proof of this. Proof of residence might include:
Certificate of registration of address (also available online)
Payslip (with German address)
Free movement certificate (not issued any longer)
Other official documents evidencing residence in Germany
You should bear in mind that the situation is changing quickly and that border police in some regions may take a more strict approach.
Germany imposed temporary border checks on its land borders with France, Austria, Switzerland, Luxembourg and Denmark on Monday 16 March. Those without a good reason for travelling will not be permitted entry. Frontier workers and goods traffic are not currently affected. German nationals and residents will be allowed to return to Germany. Germany is advising its own citizens against all unnecessary travel abroad.
Local measures
On 22 March, nationwide rules were introduced furthering restrictions on people’s movement and limiting activity. These are being enforced by the police and regulatory authorities. On April 15, the German federal government announced that these restrictions would remain in place until at least 3 May, although states are gradually relaxing these. Please check the latest local guidance..
Gatherings of more than two people are prohibited, excluding families and members of the same household.
All contact with other individuals should be kept to a minimum, and a distance of 1.5m should be maintained at all times.
Under the new rules, commuting, exercising outdoors or offering assistance to others are permitted. Meetings deemed absolutely necessary for business and official purposes are also allowed
Restaurants may only offer takeaway or delivery services. Body care services, such as hairdressers, nail and tattoo salons remain closed, though treatments deemed medically necessary such as therapeutic massages and rehab centres remain permissible. Workplaces must have specific hygiene rules for staff and visitors.
Visits to hospitals and care homes may also be restricted.
There are plans to implement the requirement to wear face masks on public transport and in shops in 10 of Germany’s 16 states. Please check the latest local guidance.
Further restrictions vary by region, so you should follow the latest local guidance, much of which is available in English.
