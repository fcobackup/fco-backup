Terrorism
There is a high threat of terrorist attack globally affecting UK interests and British nationals, including from groups and individuals who view the UK and British nationals as targets. You should remain vigilant at all times.
UK Counter Terrorism Policing has information and advice on staying safe abroad and what to do in the event of a terrorist attack. Find out how to reduce your risk from terrorism while abroad.
Terrorism in Malta
Terrorist attacks can’t be ruled out.
You should be aware of the global risk of indiscriminate terrorist attacks, which could be in public places, including those visited by foreigners.
Crime
Protecting your belongings
Crime against tourists is rare but robberies, handbag snatching, pickpocketing and theft from parked cars can occur. Be vigilant when exchanging money and using ATMs, and avoid carrying large amounts of cash. Do not carry all your valuables in one place, and remember to keep a photocopy or scanned copy of your passport somewhere safe.
Pickpocketing has happened on bus routes between Valletta and St Julian’s. Thieves target crowded buses during the summer season. Always keep sight of valuables.
Drink and food spiking
Individuals have been drugged and forced into spending large amounts of money or assaulted in some bars and gentlemen’s clubs in the Paceville district. You should:
be careful who you buy drinks from
keep drinks in sight to make sure they are not spiked
check your bill to make sure you are not being overcharged
Assault
Attacks, including rape and sexual assault, occur. Avoid splitting up from your friends and do not go off with people you do not know. If you drink, take sensible precautions including buying your own drinks and keeping sight of them at all times.
Scams
Scams targeting British nationals are increasing. These come in many forms (romance and friendship, business ventures, work and employment opportunities) and can pose financial risk to victims.
Be cautious about any requests for money, a job offer, a business venture or a face to face meeting from someone you have been in correspondence with over the internet.

Laws and cultural differences
Bird hunting season
Bird hunting takes place in the spring and autumn. The Maltese government decides the dates at the start of each season. See local print and online media for the dates and times when hunting is allowed.
Hunting with firearms is common. It is normally allowed from 2 hours before sunrise until 2 hours after sunset. Hunting areas are rarely marked and can overlap with camping areas, country walkways and other public areas. Although not common, there have been incidents involving members of the public. Be aware of your surroundings when visiting rural areas and nature spots during the hunting seasons.
Illegal drugs and prison sentences
Penalties for possession, use, or trafficking in illegal drugs are strict. Convicted offenders can expect jail sentences and heavy fines.
Outdoor activities and adventure tourism
Swimming safety
During the summer, most beaches are patrolled by lifeguards with a flag safety system. Make sure you understand the system and follow any warnings; red flags indicate dangerous or hazardous conditions. Swim within designated zones and take extra care if there are no lifeguards, flags or signs.
Follow local advice if there are jellyfish.
See more information from the Malta Tourism Authority.
