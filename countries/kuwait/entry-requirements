Entry rules in response to coronavirus
The Kuwait Government has announced the partial reopening of the International Airport from 1 August. British citizens are allowed to enter Kuwait if they hold valid Kuwait residency visas and a negative PCR test, conducted no more than 96 hours before acceptance on the flight to Kuwait. The test result should be in English. For further information please refer to the guidance on getting a COVID-19 test or an accredited private facility. On entry to Kuwait you will need to self-isolate for 14 days in your home.
Regular entry requirements
The information on this page covers the most common types of travel and reflects the UK government’s understanding of the rules currently in place. Unless otherwise stated, this information is for travellers using a full ‘British Citizen’ passport.
The authorities in the country or territory you’re travelling to are responsible for setting and enforcing the rules for entry. If you’re unclear about any aspect of the entry requirements, or you need further reassurance, you’ll need to contact the embassy, high commission or consulate of the country or territory you’re travelling to.
You should also consider checking with your transport provider or travel company to make sure your passport and other travel documents meet their requirements.
Visas
The Kuwaiti Government has automatically extended visit visas and residency visas that expired after 1 March 2020 until 30 November 2020. This only applies to visa holders already in Kuwait. If you hold valid Kuwaiti residency and are outside Kuwait, your residency is now valid until its expiry date, and does not automatically expire after 6 months outside Kuwait.
The Kuwaiti Government has suspended the visa on arrival and e-visa service. You should get a visa in advance from the Kuwaiti Embassy in London when this service reopens. On arrival in Kuwait, the immigration authorities may ask to see evidence of return or onward travel, a sponsor’s letter and hotel confirmation. For further information, contact the Embassy of Kuwait, 2 Albert Gate, London, SW1X 7JU (telephone 020 7590 3400).
Passport validity
For visit visas, obtained on arrival or in advance, your passport should be valid for a minimum period of 6 months from the date of entry into Kuwait.
For residency visas, your passport should be valid for a minimum of 2 years.
UK Emergency Travel Documents
UK Emergency Travel Documents (ETDs) are not valid for entry into Kuwait. However, ETDs are accepted for airside transit and exit from Kuwait. Residents and tourists will need to get an exit stamp before leaving. Kuwait residency permits are cancelled when an ETD is issued.
Previous travel to Israel
If you have an Israeli stamp in your passport you may be refused a visa and/or entry into Kuwait.
Living and working in Kuwait
For work or residency visas, apply to the Kuwaiti Embassy in London.
If you intend to use UK documents like academic records, marriage certificates, or your driving licence in your application, you should have all such documents authenticated by the Foreign and Commonwealth Office in the UK or by the Ministry of Foreign Affairs of the country in which they were awarded and the nearest Kuwaiti Embassy. The same procedure is necessary for children’s birth certificates.
Your employers should not retain your passport.
