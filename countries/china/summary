The Foreign and Commonwealth Office (FCO) advise against all travel to Hubei Province due to the ongoing coronavirus (COVID-19) outbreak. The FCO advise against all but essential travel to the rest of mainland China (not including Hong Kong and Macao). The British Consulates-General in Wuhan and Chongqing are currently closed. The elderly and those with pre-existing medical conditions may be at heightened risk.
The Chinese authorities continue to impose various control and quarantine measures across the country, including restrictions on movement, reduced transport, entry and exit controls for towns and villages, and isolation requirements for travel between different parts of the country. Beijing Municipal Government has announced that, as of Monday 16 March, all people arriving into Beijing from overseas (including those without symptoms of coronavirus) must undertake 14 days of centralised observation (quarantine) at places designated by the Beijing authorities. Those undergoing observation will be asked to cover the fees for their period of quarantine. This announcement will affect all British Nationals irrespective of their departure point. Those undergoing observation in Beijing (and potentially other locations) will be asked to cover the fees for their period of quarantine.
As of 16 March, local authorities in a number of other cities and provinces have announced 14 days of mandatory centralised observation (quarantine) for people who have visited or transited through multiple countries over the preceding 14 days before arriving in China. Regulations for arrivals from overseas have changed repeatedly and the number of provinces and cities implementing such restrictions is likely to increase. Restrictions in place may also effect travel to Hong Kong and entry to other countries if travelling from China. See Health
Since 31 January, some staff and dependants from the British Embassy and Consulates have been withdrawn. Essential staff needed to continue critical work, including consular assistance, remain. British Consulates-General in Shanghai and Guangzhou will – for the immediate future – continue to provide essential travel documentary services to British nationals wishing to leave China (but no other consular assistance). The ability of the British Embassy and Consulates to provide face-to-face assistance within China is currently limited, and would be even more limited in the event that the situation deteriorates further. If you’re in in China and need consular support, call +86 (0)10 8529 6600 or the FCO in London on +44 (0) 207 008 1500.

You should take particular care during national holidays or when transiting public transport hubs, and always follow the advice of the local authorities. Previous attacks have targeted public places including on one occasion at a railway station and an open air market in 2014. There have been no recent attacks in the main tourist areas.

If you’ve formally renounced Chinese citizenship, you should carry evidence that you have done so. See Local laws and customs
