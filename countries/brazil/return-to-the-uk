The COVID-19 global pandemic has greatly reduced travel routes between Brazil and the UK.
If you live in the UK and are currently visiting Brazil, you’re strongly advised to return now by commercial means. Don’t run the risk of getting stranded.
Commercial flight options
Direct commercial flights to the UK ceased on 3 April. There are still a number of scheduled indirect flights via mainland Europe or the US, but capacity is limited.
The following airlines are still operating indirect routes back to the UK from Brazil:
Air France
KLM
Lufthansa
Other options may be available. Details are subject to change and there could be travel restrictions if you are connecting. The US has introduced a ban on entry to the US of non-resident travellers that have been to Brazil fourteen days prior to the arrival in the US. Check directly with your airline. Check directly with your airline.
You will need to pay for your return travel to the UK. If departure options are available but you cannot afford the travel costs and have exhausted all other options for getting funds, you may be eligible to apply for an emergency loan from the government. This is a last resort option and you would need to repay the loan when you are back in the UK. For more information, contact Corporate Travel Management (CTM). CTM are a commercial partner of the FCO and are authorised to administer such loans on behalf of the FCO.
Registering with the British Embassy
If you’re visiting Brazil and may need help returning to the UK, complete this form. British Nationals resident in Brazil should not complete the form.
Travel to your international airport
There may be restrictions on public transit to airports. Check locally before you travel and allow additional time to reach airports.
Domestic flights
Some domestic flights are also being impacted by travel restrictions and cancellations due to reduced demand. You’re advised to book domestic connecting flights on the same ticket as your international flight to the UK, and to allow longer than usual for international connections.
Some passengers have experienced cancellations that have added up to 24 hour delays to their domestic flights. You should also check the status of your flight regularly so that you can rebook an earlier departure if your domestic connecting flight is cancelled.
Road
Some states have put in place restrictions on interstate travel and the situation could change quickly. Check with your tour operator or car hire rental firm before making your journey. Check the Safety and security section of this travel advice for more information on travel by road in Brazil.
Your journey home
The National Travel Health Network and Centre (NaTHNaC) provides advice on how to stay safe as you travel by air.
If you’re returning home before 8 June, follow the guidance for when you return to the UK on steps you should take to protect yourself and others. From 8 June there will be new rules for entering the UK.
