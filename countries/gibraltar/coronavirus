Travel in Gibraltar
A social lockdown came into effect in Gibraltar on Tuesday 24 March 2020 to slow the spread of COVID-19. However the lockdown restrictions are now in the process of being relaxed by the Government of Gibraltar, via a 6-phased process named ‘Unlock the Rock’ which started on 2 May 2020. Full details of the plans to lift lockdown restrictions can be found in this Government of Gibraltar press release.
Public places and services
On 22 May, the regulations affecting the freedom of movement of all citizens came to an end, and people are now permitted to leave their home without restriction. However restrictions on freedom of association (gatherings) imposed by the Government of Gibraltar as part of the social lockdown remain in place. Visiting friends and relatives in their homes or public places is permitted, up to a maximum of twenty people in one gathering, with certain specified exceptions.
From 21 August the Government of Gibraltar announced that bars and restaurants in Gibraltar have reduced opening hours. Last orders are at 12:30am, and the premises must shut by 1am. Additionally, the drinking of alcohol in unlicensed public places after 11pm is now prohibited, and those who do so can be subject to a fixed penalty notice of £100.
From 28 August the Government of Gibraltar announced that it is a legal requirement to wear masks in all enclosed indoor spaces which are open to the public – this includes retail shops, takeaways and hair and beauty salons. Bars, cafes and restaurants are not included in the restrictions. Those failing to wear a mask are subject to a fixed penalty notice of £100. The Government of Gibraltar also recommends that people do not socialise outside of their family or established social bubbles. See guidance from the Government of Gibraltar for more information.
If anyone in Gibraltar has any of the symptoms of COVID-19, they must self-isolate and should not visit any friends or relatives, nor should they permit anyone to visit them until they have been tested and are negative for the virus.
