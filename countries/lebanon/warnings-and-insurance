Warning
FCDO advises against all travel to Lebanon.

Your travel insurance could be invalidated if you travel against advice from the Foreign, Commonwealth & Development Office (FCDO). Consular support is also severely limited where FCDO advises against travel.
 Areas where FCDO advises against travel
FCDO continues to advise against all travel to Lebanon. If you are currently in Lebanon, we encourage you to leave, while commercial options remain available.
For further information on why we advise against travel, see Conflict affecting Lebanon and Regional risks.
Register your presence
If you are a British national in Lebanon, Register Your Presence to tell the UK government that you are there. If you previously registered your details with us (before 12 September), you will need to register again.
Registering your presence includes providing your up-to-date contact information. You should complete a separate form for each member of your family or group who is a British national.
Your registration will allow us to share any updates.
Conflict affecting Lebanon
FCDO advises against all travel to Lebanon due to risks associated with the ongoing conflict between Israel, Lebanese Hizballah and other non-state actors in Lebanon and advises anyone in Lebanon to leave now. Tensions are high and the situation could deteriorate with little warning. Do not rely on FCDO being able to evacuate you in an emergency. The closure or disruption of roads and exit routes at short notice could affect your ability to leave the country. In line with the FCDO’s existing advice against all travel to Syria and to the Northern Border region of Israel, the FCDO advises against leaving Lebanon through land border crossings.
The security situation presents a range of serious risks to British Nationals in Lebanon, including the following.
Military activity across Lebanon
There are ongoing mortar and artillery exchanges and airstrikes across Lebanon, primarily on the boundary with Israel but also in other parts of the country, including Beirut, the Beqaa Valley and locations north of the Litani river. On 30 September, Israel launched a ground incursion in southern Lebanon. The Israeli Defence Force has warned people in Lebanon not to move south of the Awali River. In addition, ‘The Washington Institute’ provides an online map of strikes in Lebanon which may be helpful to understand recently affected areas.
Air-strikes in Beirut
Israel is conducting targeted air strikes against Beirut. The majority of these attacks are in the southern suburbs (Dahiye) area but there have been strikes in central Beirut including on buildings close to the airport road and in the city centre and attacks outside of this area cannot be ruled out. Strikes have resulted in civilian casualties and the destruction of residential buildings. You should not travel to the southern suburbs of Beirut and should shelter in place during strikes.
Access to Beirut airport
There is a risk that access to the airport may be disrupted, whether by traffic congestion, temporary road blocks or closure caused by Israeli airstrikes near by. If you are travelling to the airport, check the local security situation and only make the journey if you judge it safe to do so. Remain alert to local conditions as these could change quickly.  
The security situation is also affecting flight availability. Many flights have been cancelled and many airlines have temporarily suspended flying into Beirut airport. The UK government is working to increase capacity on flights leaving Beirut.
If you are a British National in Lebanon, we encourage you to book the next available flight to leave, even if it is not a direct route. You should check with airlines and travel companies for updates on flight cancellations on a regular basis. Give yourself plenty of time at the airport to allow for crowding in the airport terminal or slower operational delivery due to higher demand on staff. Make sure your travel documents and those of your family are current. If the situation deteriorates, it might not be possible to issue a passport in time for any journey you might plan.
Civil disorder
Celebratory gunfire is common in Lebanon and there is a risk to British Nationals from gunfire being fired in residential areas in reaction to major regional developments. If you hear gunfire, take cover immediately. Protests related to regional events could also take place at short notice and may escalate quickly. Exercise caution, avoid demonstrations, and monitor local media for developments.
Wider regional developments
On 1 October, Iran launched nearly 200 ballistic missiles at Israel. The situation could escalate quickly and pose risks for the wider region. Exercise caution, avoid demonstrations, and monitor local media for developments.
Local support
The Embassy remains open as normal and continues with essential work, including full services to British nationals. Due to the security situation, family members of British Embassy staff have been temporarily withdrawn but staff members remain.
The UK Government is working to increase departure options from Lebanon. This includes putting on additional flights to the UK. British Nationals who have Registered their Presence in country will receive updates about flights directly.
Keep up to date with local and international media including TV and radio stations such as Virgin Radio Lebanon (FM 89.5) and Voice of Lebanon / Sawt Lubnan (FM 100.3 - 100.5) which may be useful sources of information on any developments.
You should have a personal emergency plan that does not rely on the UK government. This may include the ability to leave quickly or to shelter in place if you judge it necessary and safe to do so.
