Crime
The level of crime is generally low, and crime against foreigners is not common, but you should beware of pickpockets on public transport, and in the tourist and pedestrian areas of Sarajevo and other cities. Be vigilant and make sure personal belongings including your passports are secure. Obvious displays of wealth, including large quantities of cash or jewellery and luxury vehicles can make you a target for opportunist thieves.
There has been an increase in thefts from cars, including in popular tourist areas in and around Sarajevo, particularly on Mount Trebevic. Make sure your vehicle is locked and your belongings are out of sight. Take particular care in areas popular with foreign tourists and in crowded public venues.
Report all incidents of crime to the local police station and get a written report. Local police don’t always have English language skills and you may need the services of a translator.
Local travel
English is not always widely spoken. Local rail, bus and tram services are generally reliable if sometimes slow.
Official taxis in Sarajevo and the major towns are well-regulated and metered. Taxi drivers from the Republika Srpska might be unwilling to drive to a destination in the Federation, and vice versa. Don’t use unlicensed taxis.
Landmines and other unexploded ordnance remain from the 1992-95 war. Highly populated areas and major routes are clear of mines and are safe to visit, but you should take special care near to the former lines of conflict. Although roads themselves may be clear on major routes, there are many landmines close to the edge of roads. Don’t stray from roads and paved areas without an experienced guide. Unless you have an experienced guide, you should avoid the open countryside and especially destroyed or abandoned buildings, neglected land, un-tarred roads, woods and orchards, private property and abandoned villages. Abandoned buildings, even in towns and cities may contain unexploded ordnance. For further information, check the Mine Action Centre website.
Road travel
You can drive in Bosnia and Herzegovina using a valid UK driving licence or an International Driving Permit, in accordance with the 1968 Vienna Convention on Road Traffic, during short visits of up to 6 months. If you’re staying longer than 6 months you will need to get a local driving licence. Bosnian authorities will retain your UK or any other foreign driving licence when applying for a Bosnian one. You cannot exchange an International Driving permit for a Bosnian licence.
If you’re driving through Bosnia and Herzegovina to another country, make sure you have the right documentation for your destination. Further advice can be found on the relevant Foreign Travel Advice page.
You need valid insurance to enter Bosnia and Herzegovina in a vehicle. If you don’t have the correct insurance, you’ll need to buy border insurance when you enter the country. The border police should be able to direct you to the insurance company office at the border crossing. Euros are accepted, but credit card payment is not always possible.
You can’t buy border insurance at all border crossings. The border police advise travellers to use the recently upgraded crossings at: Bijaca, Crveni Grm (south), Zubci (south-east), Karakaj and Raca (east), Samac (north-east), Kamensko and Izacici (west).
You can’t buy border insurance at the Neum border crossing. If you’re entering Bosnia and Herzegovina via Neum, you should be able to buy insurance at the Doljani border crossing.
Make sure you have original vehicle registration and ownership papers with you as border guards, customs or the insurance company may want to see them.
Contact the Bosnia and Herzegovina Embassy in London if you have more detailed questions about bringing a vehicle in to the country. The British Embassy won’t be able to help if you don’t have the correct documentation on arrival at the border.
Take care when travelling outside the main towns and cities, especially in winter when road conditions can worsen quickly.
Between November and April you are legally required to use winter equipment on your vehicle. This means:
all tyres must have an MS, M+S or M&S mark and a stylised symbol of a snowflake; the tread should be at least 4 mm deep
snow chains should be carried as their use is compulsory in winter conditions if the relevant sign is displayed
You must drive with dipped headlamps at all times, not just after dark. Take great care when driving at night as many roads are badly lit or have no lighting at all. Avoid long-distance travel at night. Take care when overtaking and when approaching traffic lights as local drivers have a habit of braking suddenly when traffic lights change to amber. If you are involved in an accident, stay at the scene until the police arrive. The police may breathalyse those involved. Traffic police can impose on the spot fines for any traffic offence.
See the AA and RAC guides on driving in Bosnia and Herzegovina.
Air travel
Sarajevo (Butmir) International airport is prone to fog from October to March and particularly during December and January. If you are travelling into or out of Sarajevo during winter, make sure you have enough money if you are forced to extend your stay, as many airlines won’t take responsibility for accommodation due to delays caused by adverse weather.
Adventurous activities
Check that your travel and medical insurance cover you for any adventure activities and sports.
Diving off Mostar bridge is dangerous and has resulted in serious injuries and even fatalities.
Take care when white water rafting in rivers or close to waterfalls. Currents can be extremely strong.
Political situation
The political situation is complicated and political protests are not uncommon. These are normally peaceful but can cause disruption to traffic and limit access to public buildings. Keep up to date with developments through the media, be vigilant and avoid all protests.
There is a small risk of isolated violence linked to particularly contentious issues, for example the return of displaced persons or the arrest of war crimes suspects. This can occur without any warning anywhere in the country. There has been an increase in anti-UK rhetoric from some politicians in the Republika Srpska (one of the entities that makes up the State of Bosnia and Herzegovina). This could translate into wider anti-British sentiment. You should avoid political demonstrations.
