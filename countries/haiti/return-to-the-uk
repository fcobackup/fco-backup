There are currently extremely limited options available to return to the UK from Haiti.
We know this is concerning for British people trying to leave Haiti. The UK government is working closely with airlines, the Haitian authorities and other governments to make sure options are available for you to return to the UK as soon as possible.
The window for commercial flights leaving Haiti is likely to close very shortly. The only flight currently available is an Eastern Airlines flight due to depart for Miami on Thursday 9 April. No further flights are planned.
British Nationals are currently able to travel to the UK via the United States from Haiti on commercial flights, providing they hold a valid ESTA (US). You should consult the ESTA pages to check individual eligibility. Passengers must have an onward ticket to the UK in order to transit. This ticket must be for a flight departing from the same airport as entry and leave no more than 24 hours after arrival. When travelling via the US, passengers must not have been physically present in Europe, China or Iran in the past 14 days. To check available flights please consult directly with Eastern Airline to make a booking. Carriers reserve the right to deny boarding to any individual exhibiting symptoms of coronavirus.
