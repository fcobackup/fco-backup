FCDO advises against all but essential travel to parts of Kosovo.
Terrorism
There is a high threat of terrorist attack globally affecting UK interests and British nationals, including from groups and individuals who view the UK and British nationals as targets. You should remain vigilant at all times.
UK Counter Terrorism Policing has information and advice on staying safe abroad and what to do in the event of a terrorist attack. Find out how to reduce your risk from terrorism while abroad.
Terrorism in Kosovo
Terrorists are likely to try to carry out attacks in Kosovo.
Terrorist attacks could be indiscriminate, including in places visited by foreigners, large public gatherings and cultural events. Terrorists may target religious sites, including churches.
Political situation
The political situation is generally stable, but in recent months there have been a number of protests in the northern municipalities of Zvečan, Zubin Potok and Leposavic, and the northern part of the city of Mitrovica, some of which have been violent.
Find out more about the regions where FCDO advises against travel.
There are also occasional protests in Pristina. These are usually peaceful, but can lead to some disruption, including to traffic and public transport. Keep up to date with local developments and avoid any large crowds or demonstrations.
Crime
Protecting your belongings
Pickpockets operate in airports and on public transport. Criminals target people or vehicles they think may be carrying large amounts of cash. Four-wheel drive and luxury vehicles are common targets. Take precautions to protect yourself from street crime and report incidents of crime to the local police.
Organised crime
Isolated incidents of armed violence and vehicle explosions in major cities are usually linked to organised crime and do not target foreigners, but can take place in areas visited by foreigners.
Old landmines and unexploded bombs
Residual landmines and other unexploded bombs and weapons remain in Kosovo from the 1999 conflict. Roads and tracks have been cleared.
The main areas of risk are:
along the border with Albania
the Dulje Pass area in central Kosovo
the mountainous region between Kosovo, Albania and Montenegro
Keep to the main roads when travelling in these areas. Most of the remaining dangerous areas are in high mountainous regions covered with dense vegetation. If you see something made of metal or anything suspicious, do not touch it, and report it immediately to the police or the nearest Kosovo Force (KFOR) patrol.
Laws and cultural differences
Personal ID
You should carry your passport with you for identification purposes and keep a copy separately in a safe place.
Illegal drugs and prison sentences
Possession or trafficking of drugs usually carries a long prison sentence.
Using cameras in secure areas
Taking photographs of military or police installations, personnel or vehicles may lead to difficulties with the authorities.
LGBT+ travellers
There are no laws against same-sex relations in Kosovo. However, Kosovo is still a conservative society and the LGBT+ scene is more tolerated than accepted.
Read more advice for LGBT+ travellers.
Transport risks
Road travel
If you are planning to drive in Kosovo, see information on driving abroad and read the RAC Kosovo guide.
Licences and permits
You can use a UK photocard driving licence to drive in Kosovo. If you still have a paper driving licence, you may need to update it to a photocard licence or get a 1969 international driving permit (IDP) as well.
Driving regulations
You must carry vehicle registration and ownership documents and a locally valid insurance policy. European Green Card vehicle insurance is not valid. You should buy local third party insurance at the border or from the nearest town at the earliest opportunity. Make sure you have enough cash in euros to pay for insurance.
Driving conditions
The standard of roads varies from fair to poor. Roads are particularly bad in rural areas and after bad weather. There is a risk of landslides and flooding. Avoid travelling at night if possible. The quality of fuel varies.
Border crossings
There are sometimes delays at the border crossings between Kosovo and North Macedonia, Kosovo and Albania, and Kosovo and Serbia. These are common around festive periods and during the summer months. Ensure you have food and water with you in case of delays.
Car hire
Many Serbian car hire firms will not allow you to drive their vehicles in Kosovo, and vice-versa, due to concerns about the security situation. There have been some incidents where Serbian registered cars have been targeted in more isolated areas of Kosovo.
Taxis
The condition of taxis and standard of driving vary. Taxis are readily available in Pristina. Registered taxi firms are the safest option and fares are regulated – these usually need to be ordered via phone, although some are introducing apps. Operators usually speak a reasonable level of English. Taxis that approach you for a fare are often unofficial and can overcharge. International ride-hailing apps are not available. Use established taxi companies instead of a personally owned vehicle converted to a taxi.
Extreme weather and natural disasters
Forest fires
During especially hot and dry periods, there is a danger of forest fires.
Earthquakes
Kosovo lies in a seismically active zone, and earth tremors are common. The last significant earthquake, of magnitude 4.5, happened in 2010 around 90km north of Pristina.
The US Federal Emergency Management Agency has advice about what to do before, during and after and earthquake.
Flooding and landslides
Flooding and poor road conditions can be a problem after wet weather. There is a risk of landslides, particularly in hilly and mountainous regions.
Check local news reports as flooding or landslides may cause road blockages.
