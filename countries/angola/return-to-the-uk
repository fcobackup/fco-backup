Although all scheduled international flights to and from Angola were suspended on 20 March, limited commercial charter flight options to connect to the UK continue to become available on an ad-hoc basis.
If you live in the UK and are currently visiting Angola you’re strongly advised to return now by commercial means. Don’t run the risk of getting stranded. You should not assume that UK special charter flights will become available in Angola because commercial charters are still operating.
If you wish to return to the UK from Angola, you should also contact the British Embassy on BritishEmbassy.LuandaGeral@fco.gov.uk and we will update you directly with details of any possible future flight options.
If you cannot leave Angola at this time, see advice on staying in Angola during coronavirus.
Commercial flights
TAP Air Portugal is operating commercial charter flights on a weekly basis from Luanda to Lisbon. Seats on these flights are available for British nationals. If you wish to travel, email BritishEmbassy.LuandaGeral@fco.gov.uk as soon as possible.
You will be responsible for organising your onward travel to the UK from Lisbon. British Airways and Ryanair are operating regular connecting flights from Lisbon to London
Check travel advice for any country that you will transit on the way back to the UK.
You will need to pay for your return travel to the UK. If departure options are available but you cannot afford the travel costs and have exhausted all other options for getting funds, you may be eligible to apply for an emergency loan from the government. This is a last resort option and you would need to repay the loan when you are back in the UK. For more information, contact Corporate Travel Management (CTM). CTM are a commercial partner of the FCO and are authorised to administer such loans on behalf of the FCO.
Travelling to the airport
If you are intending to travel back to Luanda from the interior by road in order to take a flight out of the country, please contact the Embassy in advance on BritishEmbassy.LuandaGeral@fco.gov.uk.
