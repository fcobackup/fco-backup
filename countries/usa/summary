A storm is affecting western and central states within the United States. Blizzard conditions are expected to engulf parts of Colorado, Wyoming, Montana, Nebraska and South Dakota, and heavy snow is falling in northern Arizona. Additionally, winds of up to 100mph are forecast across New Mexico, Texas, Kansas and Colorado.
These hazardous weather conditions have led to power outages and travel disruption. A substantial number of flights have been cancelled in the most affected areas, particularly Denver, Colorado. More than 100,000 customers are without power in Texas.
If you are in an affected area or due to travel, you should monitor local media and follow the advice of the local authorities. If you are planning to travel to or from an affected area, you should check with your airline or transport provider before starting your journey. You can check forecasts and weather warnings on the US National Weather Service website. See Natural disasters
