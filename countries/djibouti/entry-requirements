Warning
FCDO advises against all travel to parts of Djibouti.

This information is for people travelling on a full ‘British citizen’ passport from the UK. It is based on the UK government’s understanding of Djibouti’s current rules for the most common types of travel. 
The authorities in Djibouti set and enforce entry rules. If you’re not sure how these requirements apply to you, contact the Djibouti Embassy in the UK.
Passport validity requirements
To enter Djibouti, your passport must have an ‘expiry date’ at least 6 months after the date you arrive.
Check with your travel provider that your passport and other travel documents meet requirements. Renew your passport if you need to.
You will be denied entry if you do not have a valid travel document or try to use a passport that has been reported lost or stolen.
Visa requirements
You must have a visa to enter Djibouti.
Applying for a visa
You can buy a tourist visa when you arrive in Djibouti with payment in cash in US dollars. You can also apply for a visa online before travelling or contact the Djibouti Embassy. You must have evidence of your onward journey.
Vaccine requirements
To enter Djibouti, you must have a certificate to prove you’ve had a yellow fever vaccination if you’re coming from a country listed as a transmission risk.
For full details about medical entry requirements and recommended vaccinations, see TravelHealthPro’s Djibouti guide.
Customs rules
There are strict rules about goods you can take into or out of Djibouti. You must declare anything that may be prohibited or subject to tax or duty.
