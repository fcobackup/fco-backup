Malaria is present in all areas of The Gambia throughout the year.
Medical facilities in The Gambia are very limited and the cost of medical evacuation can be very high. Private clinics will only treat fee-paying patients. If you intend to bring prescription medication you should also bring a copy of your prescription and keep items in the original packaging.
Some prescription and over-the-counter medicines like those containing codeine or diazepam are banned under The Gambiaâ€™s drugs laws. If in any doubt about the customs procedures for such items, check with the Gambian Embassy before you travel.
In the 2010 Report on the Global AIDS Epidemic the UNAIDS/WHO Working Group estimated that around 17,000 adults aged 15 or over in Gambia were living with HIV; the prevalence percentage was estimated at around 2% of the adult population compared to the prevalence percentage in adults in the UK of around 0.2%. You should exercise normal precautions to avoid exposure to HIV/AIDS.
For emergency medical numbers check the website of the British High Commission in Banjul. You should contact your insurance/medical assistance company promptly if you are referred to a medical facility for treatment.
