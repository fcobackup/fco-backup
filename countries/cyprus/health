At least 8 weeks before your trip, check the latest country-specific health advice from the National Travel Health Network and Centre (NaTHNaC) on the TravelHealthPro website. Each country-specific page has information on vaccine recommendations, any current health risks or outbreaks, and factsheets with information on staying healthy abroad. Guidance is also available from NHS (Scotland) on the FitForTravel website.
General information on travel vaccinations and a travel health checklist is available on the NHS website. You may then wish to contact your health adviser or pharmacy for advice on other preventive measures and managing any pre-existing medical conditions while you’re abroad.
The legal status and regulation of some medicines prescribed or purchased in the UK can be different in other countries. If you’re travelling with prescription or over-the-counter medicine, read this guidance from NaTHNaC on best practice when travelling with medicines. For further information on the legal status of a specific medicine, you’ll need to contact the embassy, high commission or consulate of the country or territory you’re travelling to.
While travel can be enjoyable, it can sometimes be challenging. There are clear links between mental and physical health, so looking after yourself during travel and when abroad is important. Information on travelling with mental health conditions is available in our guidance page. Further information is also available from the National Travel Health Network and Centre (NaTHNaC).
Coronavirus
There is an ongoing outbreak of coronavirus (COVID-19) in China, but cases have been confirmed in other countries, including Cyprus. You should comply with any additional screening measures put in place by the authorities.
The administration in the north of Cyprus has introduced a temporary ban on British nationals entering the north of Cyprus from 12 March. This ban, aimed at preventing the spread of coronavirus (COVID-19), does not apply to British nationals with residency status in the north of Cyprus. The administration also requires anyone who enters the north of Cyprus to self-isolate for 14 days if they have arrived on the island from a range of countries / territories, including the UK, within the last 14 days.
The Republic of Cyprus government has temporarily closed Ledra Street, Astromeritis, Lefka and Dherynia crossing points as a precautionary measure to prevent the spread of coronavirus (COVID-19). The administration in the north of Cyprus has temporarily closed crossing points at Kato Pyrgos and Strovilia. Crossing points at Ledra Palace and Agios Dometios, and Pergamos in the Eastern Sovereign Base Area, remain open. You may experience longer queues than normal at those crossing points which are open and should allow additional time for your journey.
As part of its coronavirus response, the Cyprus government has banned events of over 75 people. If you are due to attend an event, you should check with the event organiser before travelling.
For information from the Cypriot authorities, see the Cypriot Ministry of Health website
If you develop fever and/or respiratory symptoms such as shortness of breath or cough, the Cyprus Government advise that you stay indoors and immediately contact the Ministry of Health’s public health line: 1420
Further information on coronavirus, including advice on preparing for foreign travel and helping reduce the spread of the virus, is available from Public Health England and on the TravelHealthPro website.
Healthcare
The rules on access to healthcare will stay the same until 31 December 2020.
You should get a free European Health Insurance Card (EHIC) before leaving the UK. After 31 December 2020, your UK-issued EHIC might not be valid.
The EHIC entitles you to state provided medical treatment that may become necessary during your trip. Any treatment provided is on the same terms as Cypriot nationals. If you don’t have your EHIC with you or you’ve lost it, you can call the Department of Health Overseas Healthcare Team (+44 191 218 1999) to get a Provisional Replacement Certificate.
It is important to take out comprehensive travel insurance that includes cover for emergency medical treatment and associated costs. The existing EHIC arrangements are not an alternative to travel insurance, as some health-related costs, including for medical repatriation, ongoing medical treatment and non-urgent treatment, are not covered. The EHIC is also not valid in the north of Cyprus. Read more about what your travel insurance should cover.
If you’re living in Cyprus, you can also find more information on healthcare for residents in our Living In Cyprus guide.
If you need emergency medical assistance during your trip, dial 112 and ask for an ambulance. If you are referred to a medical facility for treatment you should contact your insurance/medical assistance company immediately.
