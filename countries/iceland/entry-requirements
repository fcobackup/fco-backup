The information on this page covers the most common types of travel and reflects the UK government’s understanding of the rules currently in place. Unless otherwise stated, this information is for travellers using a full ‘British Citizen’ passport.
The authorities in the country or territory you’re travelling to are responsible for setting and enforcing the rules for entry. If you’re unclear about any aspect of the entry requirements, or you need further reassurance, you’ll need to contact the embassy, high commission or consulate of the country or territory you’re travelling to.
You should also consider checking with your transport provider or travel company to make sure your passport and other travel documents meet their requirements.
Restrictions in response to coronavirus
Until 15 June almost everyone arriving in Iceland from abroad is required to self-isolate for 14 days upon arrival. You can find further information, including exemptions, from the Icelandic authorities at Covid.is (available in English).
From 15 June all passengers arriving in Iceland can chose to be tested for COVID-19 (free of charge until 30 June, and ISK 15,000 per test thereafter) or self-isolate for 14 days upon arrival. Children born in 2005 or later will be exempt from both testing and self-isolation.
You will also be required to fill out a pre-registration form before departure. Further details and the form will be available at www.covid.is
