All travellers to Ascension Island require an entry permit visa unless exempted by their occupation, such as active members of Her Majesty’s Armed Forces travelling there for work. Failure to enter with a valid visa is an offence under the Entry Control Ordinance and may result in a fine and imprisonment. Individuals may also be refused permission to land and be required to leave on the aircraft or vessel that they arrived on. You should be aware that your application may be affected by a change in the Ascension COVID-19 Response Level, particularly if this reflects an escalation of the seriousness of the COVID-19 threat to the island. During such circumstances permissions for certain types of entry permits may not be granted, and extant permissions may be revoked.
