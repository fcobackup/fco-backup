Cases of coronavirus (COVID-19) have been confirmed in Brunei. The Brunei authorities have introduced a number of measures to limit the spread of the virus.
As part of Brunei’s approach to contain the spread of the virus, mosques and other places of worship have been closed, restaurants and cafes are only open for take-away and public gatherings have been discouraged.
Details of Royal Brunei’s schedule can be found on the Royal Brunei Airlines website.
Entry to Brunei will be denied to non-Bruneians travelling from the United Kingdom, and other countries in Europe, Iran, and Hubei, Zhejiang and Jiangsu provinces of China.
Passengers arriving from all other countries will be required to go into quarantine for 14 days on arrival at a government booked facility (usually a local hotel).
We urge travellers to check the Brunei Ministry of Health for up to date guidance and policy on travel to and from Brunei.
Immigration Control Posts at Brunei’s land borders are operating shortened hours from 6am to 8pm.
There are health and temperature screening measures already in place at borders. You should comply with any additional screening measures put in place by the local authorities.
Brunei has also introduced an exit travel ban, including for permanent residents, and expatriate workers (green identity card holders), and their dependents. Exceptions will be considered by the Prime Minister’s Office on a case by case basis, through email applications to travelapplication@jpm.gov.bn. giving 14 days’ notice of the intention to travel, and setting out reasons why they need to leave the country. Full details are available on the Prime Minister’s Office website.
