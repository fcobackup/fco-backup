Hurricanes
The hurricane season in the Caribbean normally runs from June to November. The Government of Antigua & Barbuda has issued a Tropical Storm Warning for Potential Tropical Cyclone Nine, which is currently forecast to pass near Antigua & Barbuda from Wednesday 29 July 2020. Following the warning, on 29 July, they announced a “national shutdown” due to Potential Tropical Cyclone Nine. This means all businesses will be closed and workers must stay at home. Only essential government and emergency services will be operating as normal. You should monitor local and international weather updates from the Antigua & Barbuda Met Office, the World Meteorological Organisation and the US National Hurricane Centre and follow the advice of the local authorities.
