If you live in Great Britain and are currently visiting Ireland, you’re strongly advised to return now by commercial means. We recommend that UK nationals who wish to leave check the latest travel advice and the most recent updates from their travel operator before travelling. There remain commercial options to return to Great Britain from Ireland; both flights and ferries.
UK special charter flights will only operate for priority countries where commercial flights are not possible. You should not assume that these flights will become available in countries where commercial routes are operating. Please note that this advice does not affect travel from Northern Ireland to Ireland or intra-UK travel. You should follow respectively the Irish and UK public health guidance if you need to undertake essential travel.
