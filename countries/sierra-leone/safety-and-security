Political situation
See our travel advice help and support for details of who to contact in an emergency.
Sierra Leone has taken significant strides since the end of its civil war in 2002. There was a general election on 24 June 2023. However, the political situation can change and protests can turn violent. Avoid any political gatherings or demonstrations and comply with any curfews or restrictions put in place.
Crime
Most visits to Sierra Leone are incident free, but a small number of incidents have been reported of British nationals being robbed, sometimes at knife-point. These incidents were reported in the areas of Congo Cross, Wilkinson Road, Lumley Beach and Aberdeen.
The greatest risk to short-stay travellers is from pick pocketing and mugging in Freetown. If you’re staying for a longer period, make sure your property is secured properly and employ guards.
You should take the following precautions against crime:
avoid crowds and political demonstrations
don’t display or carry expensive items or large sums of money
avoid walking alone after dark
plan your transport arrangements and minimise use of public transport, taxis, poda-podas (minibuses) and Ocadas (motorbikes). Some robberies have been carried out by associates of the drivers and other passengers.
familiarise yourself with your surroundings and remain vigilant.
Reporting crime
The Sierra Leone Police levy a fee for all foreign nationals who need a police report. They are unable to issue crime reference numbers without a police report. You should make your payment to the Sierra Leone Police Revenue Generation Fund Account at the Bank of Sierra Leone and get a receipt. Don’t pay the Sierra Leone Police direct.
If you wish to report a crime but do not need a crime reference number or a written report, there will be no charge.
Local travel 
If you travel outside the Freetown peninsula, try to complete your travel during the hours of daylight, inform your employers of your whereabouts and make sure they have copies of your itinerary.
Travel to Freetown from the airport
Lungi airport is situated on the far side of a wide estuary from Freetown. There are several transfer options, including by road, ferry, water taxi and local boats or pirogues. British High Commission staff operate a policy of informed choice and use all of the transport options available, with the exception of local boats (such as the local canoes and wooden pirogues).
The two main water taxi operators run reliable services between Freetown and Lungi. Services are scheduled to align with flight arrivals and departures, with a journey time of around 25 minutes on the water. Check the times before you travel. They can also be privately chartered if you miss your crossing, though this will be more expensive. Water taxis have navigational aids, night lights and provide life jackets for passengers. They have limited rescue capability.
There’s also a ferry that operates between Lungi Tagrin and Kissy Town (in the eastern end of Freetown). The journey time is around one hour on the water. The service operates on an ad hoc basis. You should pre-plan your onward journey from there, particularly if you’re arriving at night. The service offers a crossing for both foot passengers and vehicles. The ferry lacks basic safety equipment. Foreign foot passengers have reported being pick-pocketed.
Local boats/pirogues operate without lights and any safety equipment. You should avoid using these craft.
During the rainy season (May to October) rough sea conditions may lead to delays or cancellations. If you choose to cross the estuary, it’s good practice to notify a reliable contact of your departure and expected arrival times and agree what action they will take if you don’t arrive at the expected time.
The journey time by road is normally 3 hours. You should prearrange pick-up as there are no car hire facilities at the airport. You can contact the Consular section at the British High Commission Freetown for a list of Freetown-based car hire companies. British High Commission staff don’t use this option for travel after dark, and rarely use it in daytime due to the risk of road traffic accidents.
If you plan to stay at an airport hotel, book early as rooms are extremely limited and in high demand.
Road travel
You can drive on your UK licence for up to one month, or with an International Driving Permit for the length of its validity. If you’re staying longer or living in Sierra Leone, you’ll need to get a Sierra Leone driving licence.
Plan your journeys outside Freetown, travel in convoy if possible and report your progress. Have a plan for what to do and where to go in case of emergencies.
Make sure you use well maintained vehicles. Erratic driving is common and motorbikes are a particular problem. Most roads have little or no lighting and have hazards like vehicles with no lights, wandering pedestrians and animals. Serious traffic accidents are common.
Children will sometimes put a rope across the road and ask for a small donation for mending the road. These incidents are most common at the weekend and on roads to tourist beaches in the Western Area. The rope will be lifted if you indicate that you don’t intend to stop. You can distinguish them from official police checkpoints, which are manned by uniformed officers with marked barriers.
British High Commission staff avoid road travel outside the Freetown peninsula during night hours.
British High Commission staff do not use local taxis, poda-podas (minibuses) or ocadas (motorbikes).
Travellers are advised to exercise caution and be prepared for disruption and potential short notice closure of the Guinea-Sierra Leone border.
Air travel
The FCDO can’t offer advice on the safety of individual airlines. However, the International Air Transport Association publishes a list of registered airlines that have been audited and found to meet a number of operational safety standards and recommended practices. This list is not exhaustive and the absence of an airline from this list does not necessarily mean that it is unsafe.
A list of recent incidents and accidents in Sierra Leone can be found on the website of the Aviation Safety network.
The International Civil Aviation Organisation carried out an audit of the level of implementation of the critical elements of safety oversight in Sierra Leone.
Swimming
Sierra Leone has many attractive beaches, but strong currents exist at some. Seek local advice about conditions. There are no lifeguards. Swimming is at your own risk. Beware of hospital waste, including needles, on Lumley beach.
Services and utilities
No mobile network provides country-wide coverage. Some areas have no mobile reception. There’s no public telephone system and landline connections are poor. It is not possible to call a Sierra Leone mobile phone from a Sierra Leone landline and vice-versa.
Mains water is limited. Power is improving but remains unreliable. Rented accommodation and hotels rely on generators and private water supplies.
