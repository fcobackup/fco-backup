Travel in Uganda
It is mandatory for everyone aged 6 or above to wear a face mask when outside your house. Further guidance is available from the Ministry of Health website.
A curfew remains in place from 9pm to 6am. Passengers travelling on flights departing during curfew hours (9pm to 6am) will be allowed to travel to the airport upon presentation of a valid ticket.
Movement by personal vehicles is now permitted in all districts, including those with an international border, but is still limited to 4 people per car (including the driver) and all must wear masks if there is more than one person in the vehicle.
Travel by public transport (including minibus taxis, buses, coaches, passenger trains) is now allowed. Tuk tuks and boda bodas (motorbike taxis) are allowed to carry passengers, but must stop operating by 6pm.

Hotels and restaurants are open with social distancing measures in place and food delivery services remain operational outside of curfew hours.

Opening hours for casinos and gaming centres are restricted to 6:30am to 7pm. Bars remain closed.

Healthcare in Uganda
There are a number of public and private COVID-19 tests centres in Uganda. For further information on the outbreak in Uganda, please see the Ugandan Government COVID-19 Response website.
If a foreign national tests positive for COVID-19 and wishes to be repatriated for treatment outside of Uganda, they will be expected to cover the costs themselves.
For contact details for English speaking doctors, if you are running low on medication or require emergency medical treatment, you should contact one of the medical practitioners on this list. They will be able to discuss your situation over the phone and advise on the best course of action. Some hospitals and pharmacies are able to deliver medication to you. All major pharmacies in Kampala and surrounding towns are able to read and understand prescriptions issued by UK doctors. UK issued prescriptions are accepted but you should be aware that pharmacies in Uganda do not always stock the same range of medication found in UK pharmacies. British nationals are therefore advised to travel with adequate stocks of their medication for the duration of their stay in Uganda.
Your emotional and mental wellbeing is important. Read guidance on how to look after your mental wellbeing and mental health.
