The Serbian Government has announced a State of Emergency in response to the global pandemic of coronavirus (COVID-19), effective 15 March. It has announced the closure of all airports in Serbia to international passenger flights until further notice. All border crossings for road, rail and river transport will be closed from 8am on Friday 20 March, except for freight traffic. Following these measures, and those taken by neighbouring countries, there are now no commercial means of leaving Serbia to return to the UK by air, road, rail or river.
The Foreign and Commonwealth Office (FCO) therefore advises against all but essential travel to Serbia. British nationals should contact the Embassy if they need assistance. See Health
Countries bordering Serbia have also introduced restrictions. Please check country-specific FCO Travel Advice for details.
A nationwide curfew from 8pm – 5am is in force. People aged over 65 in urban areas, and people over 70 in rural areas, may not leave their homes at any time until further notice. All inter-city (bus and rail) transport has been cancelled. From 2000 on 21 March there will be no public transport, and cafes, shopping malls and restaurants will be closed until further notice. There may be further restrictions to limit the spread of coronavirus. Infringements of these procedures may result in fines and/or a prison sentence. If you are currently in Serbia, check news outlets regularly for up to date information.
