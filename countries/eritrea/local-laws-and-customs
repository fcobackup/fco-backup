Photographing government buildings and military installations is not allowed. If in doubt, ask first. You need a permit to take photographs of the ‘tank graveyard’ in Asmara. You can apply for one at the Ministry of Tourism.
Telephone networks are often unreliable and may only work for limited periods each day outside Asmara and larger towns. There are limited agreements between Eritrean and international mobile telephone providers. You will not be able to receive or send calls or SMS text messages from most overseas mobile phone networks on arrival in Eritrea. A resident’s permit is required to buy a local SIM card and this can take several weeks. There have been unconfirmed reports that phone calls made on the local mobile phone network are recorded.
All electronic items (laptops, mobile phones, cameras etc) should be declared upon arrival. Failure to do so may result in their confiscation by Eritrean customs officials when you depart.
Dress modestly, especially in lowland and predominantly Muslim areas. Shorts and T-shirts are likely to draw attention.
Homosexual behaviour is illegal, although the penalties are unclear. Be discreet. See our information and advice page for the LGBT community before you travel.
