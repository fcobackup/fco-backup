There are occasional political demonstrations in Budapest and elsewhere in the country. Some take place on or close to important national holidays with a political relevance, such as 15 March (anniversary of 1848 Revolution) and 23 October (anniversary of 1956 anti-Soviet Uprising). Peaceful political demonstrations have occasionally ended in violence. You should avoid all political demonstrations, monitor the media coverage of local events and be aware of your surroundings at all times.
Although there’s no recent history of terrorism in Hungary, attacks can’t be ruled out. See Terrorism
