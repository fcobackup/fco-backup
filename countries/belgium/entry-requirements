The information on this page covers the most common types of travel and reflects the UK government’s understanding of the rules currently in place. Unless otherwise stated, this information is for travellers using a full ‘British Citizen’ passport.
The authorities in the country or territory you’re travelling to are responsible for setting and enforcing the rules for entry. If you’re unclear about any aspect of the entry requirements, or you need further reassurance, you’ll need to contact the embassy, high commission or consulate of the country or territory you’re travelling to.
You should also consider checking with your transport provider or travel company to make sure your passport and other travel documents meet their requirements.
Entry rules in response to coronavirus (COVID-19)
Entry to Belgium
Belgium has reopened its borders for travel to and from the United Kingdom, European Union countries, and the four non-EU Schengen countries (Switzerland, Liechtenstein, Iceland and Norway). However travellers entering Belgium from high risk regions in these countries will be required to self-isolate for 14 days. These regions are listed as red on the Belgian Ministry of Foreign Affairs website (in French). There are not currently any red zones listed in the UK.
All other international arrivals remain subject to entry checks to prevent non-essential travel. UK and EU nationals will be able to enter Belgium from outside the EU, the four other Schengen countries or the UK but will be required to self-isolate for 14 days.
Details of entry and exit restrictions are available from the Belgian government.

Your passport should be valid for the proposed duration of your stay; you do not need any additional period of validity on your passport beyond this.
