The authorities in Cyprus set and enforce entry rules. For further information contact their embassy, high commission or consulate. You may also check with your transport provider or travel company to make sure your passport and travel documents meet their requirements.
If you are travelling to Cyprus for work, read the guidance on visas and permits as the rules have changed since 1 January 2021.
Entry rules in response to coronavirus (COVID-19)
Entry to Cyprus
The UK entered Cyprus’ Red category on 8 July.
Passengers coming from Red Category countries must undergo a PCR test within 72 hours prior to departure and provide proof of a negative result. You must then undergo another PCR test upon arrival at Larnaca or Paphos airports, and remain in self-isolation until the result is issued. Test results should be available within three hours through the online platform. The cost of both tests is borne by the passenger.
Results from the PCR test taken before travel can be in the form of an email or SMS, but the result itself and/or appointment letter must include the date and time when the test was taken. You should not use the NHS testing service to get a test in order to facilitate your travel to another country. You should arrange to take a private test.
Children who arrive in the Republic of Cyprus before their 12th birthday, are exempted from the testing requirement.
If you belong to one of the following categories of passengers, you have the option to take a test only upon arrival in the Republic of Cyprus:
Cypriot citizens and family members (alien spouses and their underage children),
Persons legally residing in the Republic,
Persons entitled to enter the Republic under the Vienna Convention.
If you choose this option, you must remain in mandatory self-isolation for 72 hours upon arrival. At the end of the 72-hour period you must undergo another PCR test. If the repeat test is negative, you can end your isolation. The test result must be sent to the following email address: monada@mphs.moh.gov.cy. The cost of both tests is borne by the passenger.
Further information about entry requirements for travellers from countries in Cyprus’ Red category is available on the Cyprus flight pass website.
All permitted travellers must complete a Cyprus Flight Pass before their journey, available on the Cyprus Flight Pass website. Where relevant, you will be responsible for ensuring your PCR test result is uploaded to Cyprus Flight Pass within 24 hours of your departure. If you need to provide your appointment letter you can upload both documents in a single photo. In addition to obtaining the Cyprus Flight Pass, passengers are required to carry with them, in hard copy or electronically, copies of these documents. You will be asked to present your flight pass prior to boarding and on arrival at immigration.
The Cyprus government have a help desk to assist travellers with queries regarding the use of the Cyprus Flight Pass. This service is accessible by telephone +(357) 2484 1234 and through the Cyprus Flight Pass e-platform. You should continue to track developments through the Republic of Cyprus Information Office.
Travellers with proof of two COVID-19 vaccinations are not required to take a PCR test before departure. If you have received two vaccinations you will still need to obtain a Cyprus flight pass. You should check the Cyprus Flight Pass website for information on which vaccinations are acceptable, and the length of time which should have elapsed between your final dose and date of travel. (See Demonstrating your COVID-19 vaccination status)
Travellers to the north of Cyprus who have been in the UK within the previous 14 days are required to undergo a PCR test within 72 hours prior to departure and present a negative result upon entry. If you have completed the vaccination program and/or previously had COVID-19, you will not be required to quarantine after entry. All other travellers are required to quarantine for 7 days at authority-designated accommodation. Both vaccinated and unvaccinated people from UK will need to do a further PCR test upon arrival.
Demonstrating your COVID-19 vaccination status
If you live in England, Cyprus will accept the NHS COVID Pass or your NHS letter to demonstrate your COVID-19 vaccination status. If you live in Scotland or Wales, Cyprus will accept your respective NHS letter to demonstrate your COVID-19 vaccination status. Your NHS appointment card from vaccination centres is not designed to be used as proof of vaccination and should not be used to demonstrate your vaccine status.

The rules for travelling or working in European countries changed on 1 January 2021:
you can travel to Cyprus for up to 90 days in any 180-day period without a visa. This applies if you travel as a tourist, to visit for family or friends, to attend business meetings, cultural or sports events, or for short-term studies or training
visits to other EU or Schengen countries do not count towards the 90-day limit in Cyprus as it is not in the Schengen area. Visits to Cyprus do not count towards your 90-day visa-free limit in the Schengen area
to stay longer, to work or study, for business travel or for other reasons, you will need to meet the Cypriot government’s entry requirements. Check with the Republic of Cyprus High Commission what type of visa and/or work permit you may need
if you stay in Cyprus with a residence permit or long-stay visa, this does not count towards your 90-day visa-free limit
Any time you spent in Cyprus before 1 January 2021 does not count towards the 90-day visa-free limit.
If you’re a resident in Cyprus, you are advised to carry your Republic of Cyprus-issued residency documents when entering/exiting the Republic of Cyprus.
The Republic of Cyprus does not recognise the self-declared ‘Turkish Republic of Northern Cyprus’ in the north of Cyprus, nor residence permits issued by the administration there.
The Republic of Cyprus authorities may count time spent in the north of Cyprus towards the 90 day visa free total. If you overstay, you may potentially face difficulties at the airport on exit or re-entry.
At border control for Cyprus, you may need to use separate lanes from EU, EEA and Swiss citizens when queueing. Your passport may be stamped on entry and exit.
You may also need to:
show a return or onward ticket
show you have enough money for your stay
There are separate requirements for those who are resident in Cyprus. If you are resident in Cyprus, you should carry proof of residence as well as your valid passport when you travel. For further information on these requirements, see our Living in Cyprus guide.
Passport validity
Check your passport is valid for travel before you book your trip, and renew your passport if you do not have enough time left on it.
You must have at least 6 months left on an adult or child passport to travel to most countries in Europe (not including Ireland).
If you renewed your current passport before the previous one expired, extra months may have been added to its expiry date. Any extra months on your passport over 10 years may not count towards the 6 months needed.
If you’re travelling to the north of Cyprus, their administration advises that your passport should be valid for at least 6 months from your date of entry to the north.
UK Emergency Travel Documents
UK Emergency Travel Documents (ETDs) are accepted for entry, airside transit and exit from Cyprus.
