This page reflects the UK government’s understanding of current rules for people travelling on a full ‘British Citizen’ passport, for the most common types of travel.
The authorities in Norway set and enforce entry rules. For further information contact the embassy, high commission or consulate of the country or territory you’re travelling to. You should also consider checking with your transport provider or travel company to make sure your passport and other travel documents meet their requirements.
If you are travelling to Norway for work, read the guidance on visas and permits as the rules have changed since 1 January 2021.
Entry rules in response to coronavirus
Your ability to enter Norway and the rules you must follow will depend on your personal circumstances.
If you are planning a trip to Norway, check the latest official travel rules before you travel. You should also check with your airlines for any additional travel requirements.
Entry requirements from 3 December 2021
All travellers arriving in Norway must get tested on arrival, regardless of vaccination status. You will be advised on what exactly you should do. If there is a test centre at the airport or border crossing point, the test must be taken there. If there is no test centre at the border crossing point, a rapid antigen test at a public test centre or a self-test must be taken within 24 hours of arrival. A positive self-test should be reported to the local municipality immediately. Please see the HelseNorge website for the contact details of all Norway’s municipalities.
All travellers to Norway will also need to complete an online registration form, within 72 hours prior to arrival. Travellers under the age of 16 are exempt. For more guidance on travelling to Norway and entry process see the Ministry of Foreign Affairs website.
Arriving travellers over the age of 12 must wear a face covering in public areas where it is not possible to avoid close contact until they have received a negative test result.
Demonstrating your COVID-19 status
Norway will accept the UK’s proof of COVID-19 recovery and vaccination record that contains a verifiable QR code at the border. Scottish travellers must have the latest version of the Scottish certification, which includes the verifiable QR code. If you are travelling with a printed PDF proof of vaccination status, it must date from 1 November to ensure that the certificate can be scanned successfully. Your NHS appointment card from vaccination centres is not designed to be used as proof of vaccination and should not be used to demonstrate your vaccine status.
For those with QR coded UK NHS Covid Pass
Travellers with a valid QR coded UK NHS COVID Pass or those who can prove they have recovered from COVID-19 during the past six months will not be required to provide evidence of a negative pre-departure test on arrival. You will need to be tested within 24 hours of arrival but will only need to quarantine if you have a positive test. You will need to complete the online registration form within the 72 hours prior to arrival.
For those without a valid QR coded UK NHS COVID Pass
Travellers from the UK without a valid QR coded UK NHS COVID Pass are required to:
complete the online registration form within 72 hours prior to arrival
have proof of a negative COVID-19 test taken less than 24 hours before arrival. This does not apply to travellers under the age of 18
travellers from a dark red country (which currently includes the UK), are required to self-quarantine in a suitable location e.g. hotel or home, for 10 days. If no suitable location is available, you will be required to stay at a quarantine hotel. A negative PCR test taken no earlier than three days after entry will allow you to end quarantine early. There are no quarantine requirements for children under 18
For guidance on what the Norwegian authorities regard as a ‘suitable location’ and how to quarantine, see the FHI website. You may be asked for evidence that your planned place of quarantine meets the requirements.

Regular entry requirements
Visas
The rules for travelling or working in European countries changed on 1 January 2021:
you can travel to countries in the Schengen area for up to 90 days in any 180-day period without a visa. This applies if you travel as a tourist, to visit family or friends, to attend business meetings, cultural or sports events, or for short-term studies or training.
if you are travelling to Norway and other Schengen countries without a visa, make sure your whole visit is within the 90-day limit. Visits to Schengen countries within the previous 180 days before you travel count towards your 90 days.
to stay longer, to work or study, for business travel or for other reasons, you will need to meet the Norwegian government’s entry requirements. Check with the Norwegian Embassy what type of visa and/or work permit, you may need
if you stay in Norway with a residence permit or long-stay visa, this does not count towards your 90-day visa-free limit
Any time you spent in Norway or other Schengen countries before 1 January 2021 does not count towards your 90-day visa-free limit.
At Norwegian border control, you may need to queue in separate lanes from EU, EEA and Swiss citizens.
Check your passport is stamped if you enter or exit the Schengen area through Norway as a visitor. Border guards will use passport stamps to check you’re complying with the 90-day visa-free limit for short stays in the Schengen area. If relevant entry or exit stamps are not in your passport, border guards will presume that you have overstayed your visa-free limit.
You can show evidence of when and where you entered or exited the Schengen area, and ask the border guards to add this date and location in your passport. Examples of acceptable evidence include boarding passes and tickets.
You may also need to:
show a return or onward ticket
show you have enough money for your stay
If you are resident in Norway your passport should not be stamped. You should proactively show your proof of residence as well as your valid passport at Norwegian border control. For further information, see our Living in Norway guide.
Passport validity
If you are planning to travel to an EU country (except Ireland), or Switzerland, Norway, Iceland, Liechtenstein, Andorra, Monaco, San Marino or Vatican City, you must meet the Schengen area rules.
Your passport must meet 2 requirements. It must be:
less than 10 years old on the day you enter (check the ‘date of issue’)
valid for at least 3 months after the day you plan to leave (check the ‘expiry date’)
We are asking the European Commission to clarify the 10-year rule. Their guidance for Schengen border guards may not be updated until the spring of 2022. Until then, for some Schengen countries your passport may need to be less than 10 years old during your whole visit, and the 3 months at the end of your visit may need to be within 10 years of your passport’s issue date.
Check both the issue date and the expiry date in your passport. If you renewed your passport early, extra months may have been added to its expiry date. This could affect the requirement for your passport to be less than 10 years old.
Contact your travel provider or embassy of the country you are visiting if you think that your passport does not meet both these requirements. Renew your passport if you need to.
Svalbard
You’ll need your passport with you to travel to and enter Svalbard. For more information on visiting Svalbard, including coronavirus-related restrictions, see Visit Svalbard’s website.
UK Emergency Travel Documents
UK ETDs are accepted for entry, airside transit and exit from Norway.
Pets
Check with the Norwegian Embassy in London before travelling with pets.
