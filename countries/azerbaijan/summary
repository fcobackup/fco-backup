The Foreign and Commonwealth Office (FCO) advise against all travel to:
Nagorno-Karabakh and the military occupied area surrounding it
within 5km of the Line of Contact

Around 30,000 British nationals visit Azerbaijan every year, mainly on business. Most visits are trouble free.
Following the death of Iranian General Qasem Soleimani in a US strike in Baghdad on 3 January, the incident has led to increased tensions in the region. There is a possibility of an increased threat against Western interests and the security situation could worsen with little warning. You should remain vigilant and keep up to date with the latest developments, including via the media and this travel advice.
Consular support is not available in the Nagorno-Karabakh region. Tensions between Azerbaijan and Armenia over Nagorno-Karabakh continue. Several ceasefire violations along the Line of Contact separating the opposing forces and elsewhere on the inter-state border between Azerbaijan and Armenia took place in 2018, resulting in a number of deaths and casualties. Anyone who has visited Nagorno-Karabakh without the permission of the Azerbaijani authorities will be refused entry to Azerbaijan. See Local travel

If you’re abroad and you need emergency help from the UK government, contact the nearest British embassy, consulate or high commission.
