The military have suspended all scheduled international commercial passenger flights until 31 May 2021. However, we understand that some services will be available. See Flights (below). Land borders are also closed.
If you cannot leave Myanmar at this time, see advice on staying in Myanmar during coronavirus.
Flights
There are limited options for British nationals looking to return to the UK.
We understand that a number of flights are resuming to Kuala Lumpur, Seoul, and Singapore, although these may be subject to change and travellers should contact the relevant airline’s website or office.
These are primarily operated by Myanmar Airways International.
All travellers should check with the embassies of respective transit countries to check transit, entry and Covid-19 testing requirements before making ticket purchases.
Your journey home: before you leave Myanmar
Please be aware of current UK entry requirements. To enter the UK, you are required to:
complete a passenger locator form; and
provide proof of a negative coronavirus test.
You are normally required to show proof of a negative coronavirus test to your airline before being allowed to board.
Coronavirus testing in Myanmar is limited and sites and availability are subject to change at short notice. We currently advise all British nationals to stay home and stay safe. You may be able to arrange a home test or judge that you can travel safely to a testing centre, depending on your location and the situation on the ground.
If not, please consider whether a test in a transit country is possible. If none of these options are possible, please note that the UK entry requirements state that you might not need a test if you are travelling from a country where you cannot access testing facilities. Visit gov.uk for further information or contact the Embassy for advice.
The UK Visa Application Centre (VAC) in Yangon is closed due to the local situation, although plans to reopen as soon as possible. It is currently not possible to make new UK visa and passport applications and there may be a delay in returning documents for applications currently in the system. If you had an appointment booked, please wait to be contacted. Visit the VFS website for the latest information.
If you do not have a valid British Passport, the British Embassy can issue emergency travel documents or emergency passports should you need to leave the country in the near future. Please call the Embassy for further assistance.
Your journey home: re-entering the UK
When you return, you must follow the rules for entering the UK. You:
need to provide your journey and contact details up to 48 hours before you’re due to arrive in the UK
are not allowed to leave the place you’re staying for the first 14 days you’re in the UK except in very limited situations (known as ‘self-isolating’) See also the list of people who are exempt from the border rules.
The National Travel Health Network and Centre (NaTHNaC) also provides advice on how to stay safe as you travel by air.
Help and support
You will need to pay for your return travel to the UK. If departure options are available but you cannot afford the travel costs and have exhausted all other options for getting funds, you may be eligible to apply for an emergency loan from the government. For information on financial support you can access whilst abroad, see our financial assistance guidance.
The Embassy cannot provide further information or advice about departure options over the phone. To get the latest information, sign up for travel advice email alerts.
