Be prepared for your plans to change
No travel is risk-free during COVID. Countries may further restrict travel or bring in new rules at short notice, for example due to a new COVID-19 variant. Check with your travel company or airline for any transport changes which may delay your journey home.
If you test positive for COVID-19, you may need to stay where you are until you test negative. You may also need to seek treatment there.
Plan ahead and make sure you:
can access money
understand what your insurance will cover
can make arrangements to extend your stay and be away for longer than planned
Facemasks
The Lithuanian Government lifted the majority of COVID-19 related restrictions on 1 May.
Medical facemasks remain mandatory to visit patients in medical facilities. These rules do not apply to children under the age of six, or people with a medical exemption. If you cannot wear facemasks on medical grounds, you are advised to wear face shields if possible. Individual medical facilities have the right to apply requirements for other patients, staff, and visitors.
The Lithuanian Government recommends that people should continue to wear facemasks in other indoor public places and on public transport, although it is no longer mandatory.
Public places and services
The Lithuanian Government no longer requires individuals to prove their vaccination status in order to access non-essential services.
Healthcare in Lithuania
Healthcare services are operating as normal, but there may be occasional delays to appointments. Facemasks remain compulsory to visit patients in medical facilities. Individual medical facilities have the right to apply requirements for other patients, staff and visitors.
COVID-19 tests in Lithuania
As a result of the end of COVID-19-related restrictions on 1 May, Lithuania is changing its COVID-19 management strategy. COVID-19 testing and vaccinations will be carried out in ordinary medical facilities; mobile points will be removed; testing will be limited to people with symptoms at the discretion of the GP; and the need for testing before hospitalisation will be decided by individual medical facilities.
Individuals are no longer able to book COVID-19 tests directly themselves. This will be done by health providers at their discretion.
If you are required to have a test for the purposes of travel, you will need to book your test through a private clinic. A list of private clinics offering PCR and antigen tests is available on the Lithuanian Ministry of Health website. The tests booked through these clinics will be charged.
Not all testing centres in Lithuania offer results in English. If you require your results in English, you should request at the point of booking. English language result certificates are likely to incur additional charges.
Testing positive for COVID-19 in Lithuania
Self-isolation is no longer mandatory for individuals who test positive for COVID-19. If you have symptoms you are advised not to go to work, school or public places.
COVID-19 vaccines if you live in Lithuania
Wherever possible British nationals should aim to be vaccinated in the country where they live.
The Lithuanian national vaccination uses Pfizer-BioNTech, AstraZeneca, Moderna and Janssen (Johnson & Johnson) vaccines. British nationals resident in Lithuania are eligible for vaccination. You can book vaccination online or with a GP in Lithuania. Vaccination is recommended in Lithuania for children over 5 years of age, and a booster dose from 12 years of age.
Children aged five years and older are eligible for vaccination in Lithuania. Children aged five to 11 years (inclusive) will be offered a reduced volume dose of Pfizer-BioNTech vaccine. Children aged 12 to 16 years will be offered either standard Pfizer-BioNTech or Moderna vaccines.
Find out more, including about vaccines that are authorised in the UK or approved by the World Health Organisation, on the COVID-19 vaccines if you live abroad page.
Lithuania offers COVID-19 boosters to all residents aged 18 and over, from four months after they completed their first course of COVID-19 vaccine. British nationals resident in Lithuania who wish to register for a booster can book online.
If you receive your COVID-19 vaccination in Lithuania, you can get an EU Digital COVID Certificate from the national authorities. The Certificate proves that you have been vaccinated against COVID-19, received a negative test result, or recovered from COVID-19. It will help facilitate your travel within the EU and, in some countries, you can use it to demonstrate your COVID-19 status to businesses and other organisations. For further information visit the European Commission’s EU Digital COVID Certificate page.
