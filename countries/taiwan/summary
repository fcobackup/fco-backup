In 2017 there were over 60,000 reported visits to Taiwan by British nationals. Most visits are trouble-free.
Taiwan has put in place a number of measures to combat coronavirus (COVID-19), including changes to entry procedures and restrictions on entry to Taiwan. From Thursday 19 March, foreign nationals, except those holding valid resident permits, will not be permitted to enter Taiwan. Taiwanese authorities have also announced that they will not renew or extend the stay of those foreign nationals who have entered using either a visitor visa or a landing visa. See Health
The UK does not recognise Taiwan as a state and has no diplomatic relations with Taiwan, so limited consular services are available to British nationals. See Consular assistance
Crime levels are low, but small-scale petty crime does exist. You should maintain at least the same level of vigilance as you would at home, and take sensible precautions. See Crime
There has been a significant increase in cases of dengue fever. See Health
You should not enter Taiwan with animal products without prior authorisation as those caught smuggling products may face heavy fines. See Customs regulations

You can contact the emergency services by calling 110 (police) or 119 (ambulance and fire).
