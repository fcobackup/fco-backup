Travel to Tunisia is subject to entry restrictions
On 21 December, the Tunisian government suspended until further notice all flights to and from, or that transited through, the UK following the emergence of a new strain of COVID-19. The Tunisian government also suspended the entry into Tunisia of passengers who are coming through the UK or transited through the UK.
British nationals affected by flight cancellations should contact their airlines for further information and for advice on possible alternative flight options via a third country. Please be aware, however, that several third countries have themselves suspended flights to and from the UK and others may follow suit at very short notice.
British nationals who find themselves now stranded in Tunisia and who require consular assistance should call the British Embassy on +216 71 108 700.
If you are entering Tunisia via a different route and have not resided in or transited through the UK, or either South Africa or Australia which are also subject to the same suspension of flights and entry into Tunisia, please refer to the ‘Entry rules in response to coronavirus (COVID-19)’ section.
See Entry requirements for more information before you plan to travel.

On 28 October the Tunisian authorities introduced new COVID-19 measures due to the detection of infection clusters. These measures include a national curfew and travel restrictions. If you’re planning travel to Tunisia, find out what you need to know about coronavirus in the Coronavirus section.
During the COVID-19 pandemic, it is more important than ever to get travel insurance and check it provides sufficient cover. See the FCDO’s guidance on foreign travel insurance.
A state of emergency is in effect in Tunisia, imposed after a suicide attack on a police bus on 24 November 2015. It has been extended a number of times, most recently on 30 May 2020.
Since the terrorist attack in Sousse in June 2015, which targeted tourists, the UK government has been working closely with the Tunisian authorities to investigate the attack and the wider threat from terrorist groups. The Tunisian government has improved protective security in major cities and tourist resorts.
Terrorists are still very likely to try to carry out further attacks in Tunisia, including against UK and Western interests. Security forces remain on a high state of alert in Tunis and other places. You should be vigilant at all times, including around religious sites and festivals. Crowded areas, government installations, transportation networks, businesses with Western interests, and areas where foreign nationals and tourists are known to gather may be at higher risk of attack. You should be particularly vigilant in these areas and follow any specific advice of the local security authorities. In more remote areas of the country, including tourist sites in southern Tunisia, security forces’ response times to an incident may vary. Follow the advice of the Tunisian security authorities and your travel company if you have one. See Terrorism
Demonstrations often occur in Tunisia and the majority are peaceful. However, you should avoid all areas of demonstrations, and exercise caution if in the vicinity of any large gatherings or protests. Localised disruption, such as road blockages, are likely in the vicinity of protests and may occur with little to no warning. See Political situation
You can contact the emergency services by calling 197 (police - when in cities and towns), 193 (national guard - when in rural areas or small villages), 190 (ambulance) or 198 (civil protection - for assistance at incidents, such as car accidents, to provide medical assistance and response to fire).
If you’re abroad and you need emergency help from the UK government, contact the nearest British embassy, consulate or high commission. Consular support may be limited in parts of Tunisia.
