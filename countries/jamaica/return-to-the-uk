There are currently extremely limited commercial options available to return to the UK from Jamaica.
UK special flight
A special flight will depart from Kingston Norman Manley International Airport on Wednesday 3 June to London Heathrow. The flight costs £537 per person.
These flights are for:
British nationals, normally resident in the UK
Dependants travelling with a British national
Vulnerable British nationals will be prioritised.
Vulnerable non-British UK residents with Indefinite Leave to Remain and other foreign nationals may be accommodated if there is sufficient capacity.
Your eligibility will be checked before your tickets are issued.
How to book
Seats on this flight will be allocated to people on our existing waiting list, with priority given to the most vulnerable who have been in contact with the British High Commission in Kingston. We will not be able to register new people on to the list until 29 May.
Financial support for a flight
If you have exhausted all other options available to you for getting funds, you may be eligible to apply for an emergency loan from the government to cover the cost of the ticket.
You would need to repay the loan when you are back in the UK. Our partner CTM is authorised to administer such loans on behalf of the FCO and details will be available when you are asked to pay.
Travel to the airport
You will need to make your own travel arrangements to get to Kingston, Norman Manley International airport. Please do not go to the airport if you do not have a confirmed seat.
Future travel options
The British High Commission is in contact with airlines, the Jamaican authorities and other governments to make sure information on commercial options for returning to the UK is available as soon as possible.
You may be able to make indirect travel arrangements via the USA or Canada if possible but you may have to wait before a flight becomes available. You should refer to those countries’ restrictions before travelling to ensure that you will be allowed to enter the country for onward connection.
Currently no airlines are regularly scheduled to fly to the USA or Canada in May. JetBlue is operating flights at short notice from Kingston and Montego Bay to Fort Lauderdale, Florida from time to time. Miami International Airport is 30 minutes away by bus and flights to the United Kingdom are operating. You will need an ESTA or a valid US visa.
