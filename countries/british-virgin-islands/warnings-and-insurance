As the British Virgin Islands (BVI) is a British Overseas Territory, there is no formal British diplomatic or consular representation and the local authorities deal with all requests for emergency assistance.
The Foreign, Commonwealth & Development Office (FCDO) provides advice about risks of travel to help British nationals in making informed decisions. Find out more about FCDO travel advice.
The Governor has given BVI the all clear following the passage of Tropical Storm Philippe away from BVI. Caution is still required when driving because of falling rocks and other issues that may pose a threat to motorists.
You can monitor updates from the BVI Department of Disaster Management.
Travel insurance
If you choose to travel, research your destinations and get appropriate travel insurance. Insurance should cover your itinerary, planned activities and expenses in an emergency.
