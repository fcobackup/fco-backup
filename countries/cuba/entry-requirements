Coronavirus guidance is being updated.
Read the Prime Minister’s address for the latest information.

The information on this page covers the most common types of travel and reflects the UK government’s understanding of the rules currently in place. Unless otherwise stated, this information is for travellers using a full ‘British Citizen’ passport.
The authorities in the country or territory you’re travelling to are responsible for setting and enforcing the rules for entry. If you’re unclear about any aspect of the entry requirements, or you need further reassurance, you’ll need to contact the embassy, high commission or consulate of the country or territory you’re travelling to.
You should also consider checking with your transport provider or travel company to make sure your passport and other travel documents meet their requirements.
Restrictions in response to coronavirus
All commercial and charter flights are suspended from entering or leaving Cuba until further notice. All foreign sea vessels are to leave Cuban waters. On sea vessels, there may be exceptions made by Cuban authorities on the grounds of health, fuel or technical problems.
Prior to that, from Monday 23 March (midnight), only Cuban nationals and foreign residents of Cuba were allowed to enter Cuba, and they were put in government-managed self-isolation accommodation for 14 days. Returning residents were taken to their province of residence for quarantine.
On 1 April, the Cuban government announced that anyone who arrived in Cuba between 17 and 23 March will be tested for coronavirus.
Keep up to date with information from your tour operator, transport or accommodation provider on the impact on any existing travel plans. If you need further information about entry requirements, contact the Cuban immigration authorities or the nearest Cuban Embassy/Consulate. You should also check with your airline or travel company for the latest information.
If coming to Cuba, you should pack sanitary hand gel, handkerchiefs and other essential items that may prevent transmission, as these items are not always available in Cuba.
Regular entry requirements
Visas
If you’re entering Cuba as a tourist, you’ll need to get a tourist card before you travel.
For more information and advice about visas, contact the Cuban Embassy.
If you’re a dual national, you should contact the Cuban Embassy for advice on entry requirements before you travel.
Passport validity
Your passport should be valid for the proposed duration of your stay. No additional period of validity beyond this is required.
Health screening at entry ports
The Cuban authorities have strengthened their health screening at entry ports. If you show symptoms of a temperature or infectious disease like Zika or coronavirus; or have come in contact with a suspected carrier of the disease, you may be subjected to a medical examination. In some cases you may be referred for medical observation for up to 10 days.
From 23 March 2020 all passengers arriving in Cuba will have to go into 14 days of isolation in government accommodation facilities.
Airport tax
There’s a mandatory airport tax of 25 Cuban convertible pesos (CUCs). This fee should be included in the cost of your airline ticket. If in doubt, check with your airline.
Customs regulations
Some electrical items with heavy power consumption may be confiscated on entry to Cuba. Global Positioning Systems (GPS) are also subject to import requirements and may be confiscated. Confiscated items are normally returned on departure.
Mobile telephones, tablets and laptops can be taken to Cuba, but any inbuilt GPS should be disconnected or disabled. For more information on Cuban customs regulations, including a list of prohibited and regulated items, visit the Cuban Customs Administration website.
From 23 March 2020, people arriving in Cuba (which means only Cuban nationals and returning foreign residents due to coronavirus restrictions) can only bring in one piece of hand luggage and one checked-in bag.
Travelling to Cuba from the USA
Travelling for tourism reasons directly from the USA to Cuba isn’t allowed under US law. The law applies to US nationals and all foreign nationals who are either resident in the USA, or travelling through the USA en route to Cuba. Those travelling on direct flights between the UK and Cuba, or via other countries excluding the USA, are unaffected by this US legislation.
Under certain conditions, travel is permitted from the USA to Cuba, including on the direct flights which operate between the two countries. Everybody travelling on these routes (both US citizens and foreign nationals) will need to comply with US law and travel for one of 12 permitted reasons/categories of travel. Tourism isn’t one of these 12 permitted reasons/categories. For more information see the US Department of the Treasury website and the US State Department’s travel advice for Cuba. For travel-specific questions, see the Code of Federal Regulations 31 C.F.R. 515.560 and the US Treasury’s Office of Foreign Assets Control (OFAC) frequently asked questions.
