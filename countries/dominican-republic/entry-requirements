Entry rules in response to coronavirus
COVID-19 Testing
From 28 June 2021 passengers arriving from the UK, or who have spent time in the UK in the preceding 14 days, will need to present a negative COVID-19 PCR test taken no more than 72 hours before their arrival, or a vaccination card demonstrating a final dose administered no fewer than three weeks before their arrival.
These requirements do not apply to passengers under the age of five years old. These requirements also exist for passengers arriving from, or who have spent time during the previous 14 days in: Australia, Indonesia, Iraq, Iran, Kuwait, Monaco, Ireland, Democratic Republic of Congo, St Vincent and the Grenadines, Senegal, Syria, Switzerland, Thailand, Tunisia India and South Africa.
All passengers will have their temperature tested. The Dominican authorities will administer a rapid diagnostic breath test to a percentage of randomly-selected passengers on arrival. Passengers showing COVID-19 symptoms will also be tested. Passengers may also be subject to a COVID-19 PCR test. If a passenger tests positive for COVID-19, they will be required to isolate in an authorised location. Travellers who have a negative COVID-19 PCR, taken in the 72 hours before arrival, are exempt from these random tests.
You should comply with additional screening and other social distancing measures put in place by the authorities and follow instructions from the airport authorities.
These regulations may be subject to change at short notice and you should check with your travel provider before your journey. Further updates will be published when they are available.
