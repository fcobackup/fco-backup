Crime
Street crime
Street crime like bag snatching and pick-pocketing, on public transport may occur. Many foreigners choose to use taxis in preference to public transport for security and convenience. Muggings and robberies (occasionally armed) also take place. Keep valuables, spare cash and spare credit cards in a safe place. Take care when withdrawing money from ATMs and where possible use machines that are not on the street. Avoid carrying large amounts of cash or wearing expensive jewellery. Consider carrying cash and bank cards in separate pockets and only take with you the money you need at the time.
Take sensible precautions to safeguard your possessions. Keep essential items like mobile phones or wallets out of sight. Leave your passport and other valuables in a safe place.
Try to keep away from isolated or poorly lit areas at night and avoid walking in downtown Asunción, Ciudad del Este and Pedro Juan Caballero alone during night times.
Violent crime
Transnational criminal organisations involved in drug trafficking and arms smuggling operate along Paraguay’s eastern border with Brazil, especially from Pedro Juan Caballero south to Ciudad del Este, including the Tri-Border Area of Paraguay, Brazil and Argentina. Their presence has increased violent crime in these areas. They have also carried out isolated violent criminal attacks in Asunción targeting the Paraguayan security forces and people associated with rival organisations. While tourists have not been the target of such incidents, anyone in the vicinity of an incident could be affected and you should exercise due caution.
A small guerrilla-style group calling itself the EPP (Ejercito del Pueblo Paraguayo) operates in the northern part of the Department of San Pedro and southern part of the Department of Concepción. The group typically targets police, military and large landowners. They steal cattle and in the last decade, they have kidnapped locals for ransom, the most recent one in 2020. Three people remain in captivity. Their attacks can be violent, including the use of explosives and firearms. In August 2016, eight Paraguayan soldiers were killed in a suspected EPP attack in Concepción. Although they do not target UK nationals or tourists, you should take extra precautions if you travel to these areas.
In recent years a small number of high profile kidnappings have occurred. Although foreigners are not routinely targeted, you should remain vigilant.
Reporting crime
If you need to report a crime you must go to the nearest police station. You can also contact the Tourist Police by phone:
Asunción - (595 21) 446-608 or (595 21) 449-020
Ciudad del Este - (595 61) 502-715
Encarnación (595 71) 204-102
Salto del Guairá (595 46) 243-575
Public venues
Take care when visiting public venues. Markets are often located in narrow streets and can be crowded. Safety regulations may be non-existent or poorly-enforced. Food stalls burning fuel and poor electricity standards present a constant fire risk; in 2004, a major fire at a supermarket killed 400 people and in April 2015 a fire in Mercado de San Lorenzo destroyed 150 stalls.
Demonstrations
Groups of demonstrators may sometimes block streets in downtown Asunción near government buildings. You should avoid large gatherings, monitor local media and follow the guidance of local authorities in such circumstances.
Road travel
You can use your UK driving licence or an International Driving Permit while in Paraguay if you are visiting as a tourist. You must have your driver’s licence, passport and entrance stamp with you while driving. If you hire a car, take out adequate insurance. Driving standards are poor and traffic accidents, particularly involving motorcycles, are frequent. Many motorcyclists drive with no crash helmets and some vehicles with no lights at night.
There are regular police checks nationwide, usually to check the vehicle and drivers’ documents (passport, entrance stamp, driving licence) and perform breathalyser tests. These are particularly frequent in Asunción, its neighbouring cities and the San Pedro and Concepción Departments. Take extra care when travelling in and around these areas. Take care when travelling in the departments of Alto Paraná, Concepción, San Pedro, Amambay, Salto del Guairá, Canindeyú and the border with Bolivia where illegal cross-border activities are common.
Paraguay’s network of surfaced main roads is limited and of variable condition. Minor and rural roads remain unsurfaced and often become impassable during the rainy season and major paved roads (including in Asunción) are prone to flooding during heavy rain. Large potholes are a hazard on most roads including in Asunción. Avoid driving on country roads at night, which can be particularly hazardous.
Stop signs, traffic lights and speed limits are often ignored and road signs indicating hazards are lacking in many areas. Road signs are generally poor and can be confusing, even for local drivers.
Many taxis and most of the bus companies do not meet European standards and rarely have functioning seat belts. Road rules and etiquette of driving in Paraguay do not always match those of the UK.
The Terminal de Omnibus Asunción is the main terminal for long distance journeys. The bus station has security but you should keep a close eye on your belongings and be aware of your surroundings.
River travel
Boat trips and excursions are available on the main rivers, but many vessels don’t meet European health and safety standards. Be cautious when swimming in rivers as many have strong currents. Avoid swimming in the River Paraguay around Asunción, which is highly polluted. Seek the latest official advice before swimming in the popular tourist destination of Lake Ypacaraí, close to Asunción.
Air travel
The FCDO can’t offer advice on the safety of individual airlines. However, the International Air Transport Association publishes a list of registered airlines that have been audited and found to meet a number of operational safety standards and recommended practices. This list is not exhaustive and the absence of an airline from this list does not necessarily mean that it is unsafe.
A list of recent incidents and accidents can be found on the website of the Aviation Safety Network.
