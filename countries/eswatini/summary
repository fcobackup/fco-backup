If you plan to pass through another country to return to the UK, check the travel advice for the country you’re transiting.
It is more important than ever to get travel insurance and check it provides sufficient cover. See the FCDO’s guidance on foreign travel insurance.
Protests and demonstrations can occur at any time with little notice. In the past, these have sometimes resulted in violent confrontations with security forces. Road blocks or road closures may occur because of protests. You should avoid protests, demonstrations or marches and stay alert for signs of disturbances, notably in urban or areas between urban and rural regions after dark. Monitor local sources of information and social media to stay up to date. See Political situation
