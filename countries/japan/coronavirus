There is an ongoing outbreak of coronavirus (COVID-19) in Japan, including in-country transmission. It may cause more severe symptoms in older people, and those with pre-existing medical conditions.
All passengers arriving in Japan from the UK, as well as from countries listed below, are required to self-isolate for 14 days on arrival at a designated location (such as a hotel or your own home) and to avoid using public transport. This request will remain in place until at least the end of April. These measures do not apply to passengers who are transiting and do not go through immigration. You should comply with any additional screening measures put in place by the authorities. You should also check the latest entry requirements for your destination.

It also has relevant information and further external links on its website (English). British nationals living in Japan who have symptoms may wish to check the Ministry of Health, Labour and Welfare website for guidance on what to do next.
