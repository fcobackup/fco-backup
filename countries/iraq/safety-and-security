Political and security situation
Iraq remains subject to regional tensions. A number of areas of the Kurdistan Region of Iraq remain subject to sporadic attack by artillery, drones and rockets.
There has been a reduction in attacks against Western interests since June 2022. However a threat to Western interests remains, including to UK citizens. A US national was attacked and killed in November 2022. You should remain vigilant, have robust security arrangements and contingency plans in place, keeping these under review, and keep up to date with the latest developments, including via the media and this travel advice.
Protests regularly take place in and around the International Zone in Baghdad. Protests can escalate into violence. You should avoid any rallies, marches or processions, and follow the instructions of local authorities.
Large protests also occur regularly across Iraq. While many of these demonstrations are peaceful, there have been frequent violent clashes between Iraqi security forces and protesters, resulting in significant casualties including loss of life. You should avoid any rallies, marches and/or processions, and follow the instructions of local authorities.
In the event of widespread disturbances or a deterioration in the security situation, there may be limits to the assistance that the FCDO can provide. Read further information and advice on how to deal with a crisis overseas. Make sure that you are content with your own and your family’s security arrangements and keep yourself up to date with developments, including by regularly monitoring this travel advice. Be prepared to “shelter in place” or hunker down for several days, should the security situation require it. This means having adequate essential supplies, such as food, water and medicine, at the place where you are staying. You should ensure you have correct and up-to-date travel documentation in case a sudden deterioration in the situation on the ground requires travel out of Iraq. Do not rely on the FCDO being able to evacuate you in an emergency.
There may be restrictions on movement, and the Iraqi authorities have discretion to impose curfews as they deem necessary. Curfews and vehicle bans can be enforced at short notice, particularly during protests and civil unrest, but also around religious holidays, pilgrimages and key political dates like elections. Religious gatherings have previously been targeted by terrorists.
British government officials serving in Iraq live and work under strict security rules. Depending on the threat level, they may be prevented from travelling to certain areas of Iraq.
If you’re travelling or moving to Iraq, you should take appropriate security precautions before travelling. Outside of the Kurdistan Region you are strongly advised to employ a private security company, make arrangements for secure accommodation and transport and consider pre-deployment training.
Local travel
Northern and western Iraq
Areas liberated from Daesh are likely to contain remnants of war and improvised explosive devices.
Baghdad
Routes in and out of Baghdad may become blocked and airports closed or inaccessible at little or no notice. You should plan and check your routes in advance of travelling.
There remains a threat to hotels in Baghdad, which could be targeted by terrorist groups. You should remain vigilant and follow the advice of the local authorities.
You should avoid political gatherings and large crowds, and minimise your movement around banks, restaurants and shopping malls. Observe instructions given by the local security authorities.
Kurdistan Region of Iraq
While the Kurdistan Region has a different security environment to the rest of Iraq, there remains a risk of attacks by Daesh.
Turkey conducts regular military action in the north of the Kurdistan Region and on occasion, further south. There is particular risk in mountainous areas, particularly around Qandil, Makhmur, and near the border with Turkey. Crossing points along the Iraq-Turkey border may also be affected.
Iran has claimed responsibility for several recent attacks by ballistic rockets and drones, including in Erbil, Koya and surrounding areas. There have also been a number of attacks in border areas.
Foreign nationals crossing the border from neighbouring countries into the KRI have been arrested for immigration offences. If prosecuted offenders could face a prison sentence of up to 5 years or fines of several thousand US dollars.
Basra
Protests are common in Basra. You should remain alert, monitor media reports and keep up to date with this travel advice.
Land borders
Border crossing points with countries neighbouring Iraq may close with little or no notice.
Check whether border crossings will be open before travelling.
Air travel
Do not leave airports without taking adequate security precautions. You should also take care within all terminal buildings.
Flight schedules may change without notice. Contact your airline or travel company for the latest information before travelling.
The UK Air Safety List (ASL) lists all known airlines in Iraq that do not meet international safety standards and are banned from operating commercial air services to, from, and within the UK. Check the UK Air Safety List when considering which airlines to fly with. The list is maintained by the Department for Transport, based on advice from the UK Civil Aviation Authority.
UK government staff working in Iraq are authorised to use aircraft operated by Iraqi Airways for internal flights on a case by case basis.
Sea travel
Maritime facilities are under a high risk of attack. Maritime and sailing craft should take great care in the northern Persian Gulf. Vessels transiting the Gulf of Oman, Northern Arabian Sea, Gulf of Aden and Bab El Mandeb regions may be at increased risk of attack. You should consider any regional tensions that may affect your route.
Check whether sea borders will be open before your crossing.
Road travel
You need to have a 1968 International Driving Permit to drive in Iraq. 1926 IDPs previously issued by the UK may no longer be accepted. You can get IDPs over the counter from 2,500 UK Post Offices. You will not be able to buy an IDP outside the UK, so get one before you travel.
Road travel within Iraq remains highly dangerous. Driving standards are low compared to those is the UK. Road traffic accidents are frequent and often result in fatalities. False vehicle checkpoints have been used to launch terrorist attacks. There is also a risk of carjacking and robbery.
Consular assistance
UK Consular support is severely limited in Iraq. The Baghdad Embassy and Erbil Consulate-General’s ability to visit locations across Iraq is limited and travel to unsecure areas to deliver consular services may not be possible.
If you need urgent consular assistance, call the FCDO in London on +44 (0)20 7008 5000.
Advice to business
A number of UK companies visit and operate successfully in Iraq. However, movement is restricted and companies nearly always travel with close protection security teams. Specific guidance for companies seeking to do business in Iraq can be found on the Department for Business and Trade (DBT) website. DBT are also able to put you in touch with companies operating in Iraq who offer security services. For more information see Operating in high-risk environments: Advice for business
