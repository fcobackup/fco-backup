Earthquakes
Earthquakes occasionally occur. You should familiarise yourself with steps to take in the event of further seismic shocks.
Forest fires
Forest fires can occur during summer months. Check on the outbreak of fires with local media and follow any instructions from local authorities.
On 3 August, the government of North Macedonia imposed a complete ban on movement in forest areas to protect personal safety and to prevent further spread of fires. The City of Skopje confirms that there is also a ban on movement in wooded areas on Vodno and Skopska Crna Gora. Any persons found moving on forest land without permission will face a fine.
