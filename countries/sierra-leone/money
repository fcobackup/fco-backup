Sierra Leone has a cash-based society and bank or credit cards are only accepted in a few hotels in Freetown. There are a few ATMs in the capital, but they are often out of cash. You should be vigilant when using them because of high levels of fraud. Outside the capital bank and credit cards are not accepted and you should assume that ATMs will not be available.
Opportunities to exchange travellers’ cheques are limited. All foreign exchange transactions must be handled through banks and official exchange offices. A small number of banks in central Freetown may be prepared to accept credit cards to buy local currency.
