If travellers listed or arrested under Sri Lanka’s Prevention of Terrorism Act, could be subject to prolonged detention, in some circumstances without charge/trial. Read the revised list on the Financial Intelligence Unit of Sri Lanka website.
There are severe penalties for all drug offences and crimes related to the abuse of children. In some circumstances you can be held without charge indefinitely. Convicted offenders may face a lengthy jail sentence.
ID laws
You must carry an official form of identification at all times. For foreign nationals, the acceptable form of identification is your passport. If you do not have it with you and you’re stopped by the authorities, you may be detained. If you’re detained, you should ask the authorities to contact the British High Commission.
LGBT+
Same-sex relations are illegal, but the FCDO is not aware of any prosecutions. See our information and advice page for the LGBT community before you travel.
Dress
Nude or topless sunbathing is not allowed.
Although Sri Lankan attitudes to informal styles of dress are generally relaxed, women travelling alone may feel uncomfortable if not dressed modestly. Cover your legs and shoulders, and take off shoes and hats if you are entering a Buddhist temple.
Public offences
Disrespecting Buddhist images and artefacts or making offensive remarks about religion is a serious offence and could lead to arrest. British nationals have been refused entry to Sri Lanka or faced deportation for having visible tattoos of Buddha. Don’t pose for photographs standing in front of a statue of Buddha.
You can be fined if you ignore instructions not to smoke or drink in certain public areas.
Alcohol and meat are not usually available on religious holidays. Drinking in public on these days would be seen by many as culturally insensitive.
Using cameras and binoculars in secure areas
Don’t fly drones, use binoculars or take photographs of military bases, government buildings or vehicles used by VIPs (this includes numerous sites in central Colombo). Details about registering and operating drones in Sri Lanka can be found on the Civil Aviation Authority’s website.
