The information on this page covers the most common types of travel and reflects the UK government’s understanding of the rules currently in place. Unless otherwise stated, this information is for travellers using a full ‘British Citizen’ passport.
The authorities in the country or territory you’re travelling to are responsible for setting and enforcing the rules for entry. If you’re unclear about any aspect of the entry requirements, or you need further reassurance, you’ll need to contact the embassy, high commission or consulate of the country or territory you’re travelling to.
You should also consider checking with your transport provider or travel company to make sure your passport and other travel documents meet their requirements.
Entry rules in response to coronavirus (COVID-19)
Entry to Nigeria
All airports in Nigeria are closed to all international commercial flights.
The Nigerian Immigration Service announced the resumption of passport and migrant registration on 1 July.
The Nigerian authorities have advised that British nationals who exceed their authorised visa stays because of travel restrictions linked to coronavirus, will not be penalised for overstaying when they depart.
Testing / Screening on arrival
Passengers returning to Nigeria must have tested negative for COVID-19 within 2 weeks of their departure to Nigeria, and carry evidence of the test and result. On arrival all passengers will be screened by Port Health Officials and be required to complete a health declaration form and provide full contact details, including their address in Nigeria. Passports will be retained by the Nigerian immigration authorities until the 14 day quarantine period is complete.
Quarantine requirements
All new arrivals are expected to self-isolate at one location in the city of their arrival for 14 days where they will be remotely monitored by the Nigerian authorities. At the end of the 14-day period of self-isolation an exit interview will be conducted by Nigerian authorities. If the authorities are satisfied that there are no indications of COVD-19 they will authorise the release of the retained passport.
Anyone that has developed symptoms of coronavirus during their travel will be required to undergo quarantine at a government-monitored hotel.
Regular entry requirements
Visas
You should get a valid visa before travelling.
Some business travellers might be eligible to apply for a visa on arrival. Applications for a visa on arrival must be made in advance and applicants must obtain a pre-approval letter from the Nigeria Immigration Service (NIS) before travelling. Guidance on applying for a visa on arrival is available on the NIS website.
If you have a valid Nigerian residence permit (CERPAC or Green Card) you don’t need a visa to enter Nigeria.
For further information on entry requirements, contact the Nigeria High Commission in London.
Passport validity
Your passport should be valid for a minimum period of 6 months from the date of entry into Nigeria.
UK Emergency Travel Documents
UK ETDs are accepted for entry, airside transit and exit from Nigeria providing they are endorsed with the appropriate visa.
