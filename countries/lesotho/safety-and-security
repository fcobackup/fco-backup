Crime
Muggers in central Maseru frequently target foreign nationals. Don’t walk alone in isolated areas or after dark and avoid driving in rural areas at night. When driving in urban centres, especially Maseru, keep doors locked, windows shut and valuables out of sight. Park in well-lit areas and do not pick up strangers. Take care at the approaches to main border crossings, particularly at night. There have been cases of armed car-jacking. If you are involved in such an incident, offer no resistance.
Take precautions to safeguard valuables and cash. Leave them in hotel safes, where practicable. Keep copies of important documents, including passports, in a separate place.
There is often an increase in criminal activity, especially property crimes, leading up to the Christmas and Easter holiday periods. Take extra care and be vigilant during this period.
Local travel
There is no effective public transport system. Taxis can be arranged through hotels and you should use pre-booked taxis where possible.
Road travel
A British driving licence or International Driving Permit is valid for use in Lesotho for up to three months. If you wish to drive for a longer period, you will need a local driving licence.
Driving standards in Lesotho are poor and you should drive carefully.  Local mini-bus taxis are often poorly maintained, uninsured, and ignore road safety rules. Animals roaming on the roads are a hazard, especially at night.
Air travel
The FCDO can’t offer advice on the safety of individual airlines. However, the International Air Transport Association publishes a list of registered airlines that have been audited and found to meet a number of operational safety standards and recommended practices. This list is not exhaustive and the absence of an airline from this list does not necessarily mean that it is unsafe.
The International Civil Aviation Organisation has carried out an audit of the level of implementation of the critical elements of safety oversight in Lesotho.
A list of incidents and accidents in Lesotho can be found on the website of the Aviation Safety network.
Political situation
There are occasional planned and spontaneous political demonstrations in Maseru. Whilst the vast majority of demonstrations are peaceful, there is a risk of isolated incidents of unrest or violence. You should remain vigilant and avoid demonstrations, rallies and large public gatherings and stay at home if there is any unusual activity by the security forces.
