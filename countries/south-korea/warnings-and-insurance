Forest fires
Forest fires are ongoing in the south-eastern part of South Korea. Some evacuation orders and road closures have been imposed. You should pay close attention to warnings from local authorities and follow any safety instructions that they issue. Korean-language emergency alerts will automatically be sent to your mobile phone, and English-language translations of emergency alerts can be accessed on the National Disaster and Safety Portal and in the Emergency Ready App.
You can track the location and progress of fires through the Korea Forest Service website in English and Korean. Contact the South Korean authorities by calling 119 if you need emergency assistance.
Elevated Political Tensions
We are aware of heightened political tensions in South Korea. Large demonstrations are likely to continue following President Yoon’s impeachment and arrest. Protests are particularly likely in the areas around Gwanghwamun and the Constitutional Court (Anguk), and could also occur in various parts of Seoul at different times, including in the areas around the Seoul Western District Court (Gongdeok) and the National Assembly (Yeouido). Follow the advice of local authorities and avoid large public gatherings. See the Safety and security page for more information.
