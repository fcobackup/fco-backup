There are now confirmed cases of coronavirus (COVID-19) in Fiji. The situation may change rapidly, including in neighbouring countries. Ensure you follow local guidance at all times. From 3 April, the capital city of Suva will enter lockdown, following new cases in the city. No members of the public will be able to leave or enter the city for 14 days, except to access medical care. Many businesses, except those offering essential services, will remain closed.
The Fijian Government announced that from March 30 there will be a national curfew from 10pm to 5am. From 3 April, the curfew will be extended to include the hours from 8pm to 5am.
The Fijian Government announced that from 26 March, Nadi Airport will be closed to all scheduled flights. We will continue to publish guidance on our social media on what people should do if they believe this leaves them stranded. Check our Facebook page and our Twitter feed.
There are also some measures to limit internal travel. This includes the suspension of all passenger travel to Fiji’s outer islands from 29 March. We recommend British visitors return to the main island of Viti Levu immediately. If you remain in the outer islands there is no guarantee you will be able to leave for some time. Broader travel restrictions could be introduced at little or no notice. More information on the latest restrictions are available from Fiji government.
Further advice on coronavirus, including advice on preparing for foreign travel and helping reduce the spread of the virus, is available from Public Health England and the TravelHealthPro website
