The authorities in the country or territory you’re travelling to are responsible for setting and enforcing the rules for entry. If you’re unclear about any aspect of the entry requirements, or you need further reassurance, you’ll need to contact the embassy, high commission or consulate of the country or territory you’re travelling to.

Entry rules in response to coronavirus (COVID-19)
Entry to Cyprus
The UK is in Cyprus’ Category B/Orange: this means that tourists are permitted to travel to Cyprus so long as they provide a negative COVID-19 result, by way of a polymerase chain reaction PCR test result taken within the 72 hours prior to travel, on arrival. Additionally, as of 21 December, all passengers arriving from the UK will be required to take another PCR test on arrival and remain in authority-assigned quarantine facilities for a minimum of 7 days. After 7 days, with another negative PCR test result, passengers can move to private accommodation and continue their self-isolation for a further three days. Transportation and hotel costs will be paid for by the Republic of Cyprus. Where relevant, under 18s will be able to self-isolate at home for the 14-day period. Full information can be found at the Cyprus Information Office website.
The Republic of Cyprus government state that test results can be in the form of an email or SMS, but the result itself and/or appointment letter must include the date and time when the test was taken. Children under 12 years old are not required to be tested in order to travel to Cyprus. Please see the Republic of Cyprus Information Office website for further information.
You should not use the NHS testing service to get a test in order to facilitate your travel to another country. You should arrange to take a private test. The UK government guide to testing for COVID-19 contains useful links and further information. Searching the internet for the words ‘COVID testing near me’ will bring up many private and local testing facilities (fees can vary).
All travellers to Cyprus must complete a Cyprus Flight Pass before travelling, available on the Cyprus Flight Pass website. You will be responsible for ensuring your PCR test result is uploaded to Cyprus Flight Pass within 24 hours of your departure. If you need to provide your appointment letter you can upload both documents in a single photo. In addition to obtaining the Cyprus Flight Pass, passengers are required to carry with them, in hard copy or electronically, copies of these documents. You will be asked to present your flight pass prior to boarding and on arrival at immigration.
As of 21 December, legal residents of Cyprus and Cypriot ID holders, who are permitted to enter Cyprus on presentation of proof of residence or Cypriot nationality, will be tested on arrival in Cyprus and then transferred to authority-assigned quarantine facilities for a minimum of 7 days, as per the entry requirements stated above.
The Cyprus government has announced the launch of a help desk to assist travellers with queries regarding the use of the Cyprus Flight Pass. This service is accessible by telephone +(357) 2484 1234 and through the Cyprus Flight Pass e-platform. You should continue to track developments through the Republic of Cyprus Information Office.
As of 21 December, arrivals from the UK into the north of Cyprus may be disrupted as a result of restrictions in transit countries. Check with your airline and country-specific FCDO Travel Advice for details.
