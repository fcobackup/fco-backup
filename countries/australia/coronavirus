Be prepared for your plans to change
No travel is risk-free during the COVID-19 pandemic. Countries may further restrict travel or bring in new rules at short notice, for example due to a new COVID-19 variant. Check with your travel company or airline for any transport changes which may delay your journey home.
If you test positive for COVID-19, you may need to stay where you are until you test negative. You may also need to seek treatment there.
Plan ahead and make sure you:
can access money
understand what your insurance will cover
can make arrangements to extend your stay and be away for longer than planned
Travel in Australia
There are currently relatively few flights between States and Territories. Be prepared for last minute changes or cancellations.
Travel between and within some States and Territories within Australia may be restricted. Domestic travel restrictions are decided at the state-level, they vary across the country and may be subject to change at short notice which could disrupt travel plans. You should check individual State and Territory websites for the latest information, including on whether you need to provide your COVID-19 vaccination status, apply for an exemption to cross borders or self-isolate on arrival.
Travelling to your international airport
Regardless of border restrictions, you may travel by air from one Australian State or Territory to another to transit to an international flight as long as you hold a confirmed booking for that flight. Depending on the State or Territory you are transiting, you may need to apply for an exemption to cross borders. You may need to stay within the airport for the duration of your transit, or if transiting overnight, you may be taken to mandatory quarantine for the duration of your transit, or may need to self-isolate in a hotel. There may also be limits on transit times. You should check State and Territory websites for the latest information.
Flights
Commercial flights are available between the UK and Australia. Schedules are more limited than usual due to COVID-19 restrictions, and are subject to change at short notice. You should check individual airline websites and contact your airline or tour operator direct for the latest information on all routes, including restrictions around transits and health measures put in place by airlines and at airports.
Some airlines have mandatory pre-departure PCR COVID-19 testing and vaccination requirements. You should contact your individual airline for further information. You can find information on where you can get tested on Australia’s Health Direct webpages.
All passengers (with the exception of children under certain ages) and air crew must wear masks on flights and in airports.
Public spaces and services
Social distancing restrictions and other local measures are still in place across Australia with a number of variations. These are liable to change at short notice. You should monitor State and Territory websites for the latest information where you are and comply with these measures and other advice from local authorities.
