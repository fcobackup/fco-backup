The currency of the Dominican Republic is the Dominican peso. US dollars and travellersâ€™ cheques are easily exchanged. Only exchange money at banks or official exchange offices (casas de cambio). UK credit cards and debit cards will usually work in ATMs. Take great care when withdrawing cash at an ATM and where possible withdraw money inside a bank branch, shopping centre or supermarket, rather than an ATM on the street.
Credit card cloning and identity theft are a risk in the Dominican Republic. You should avoid letting your payment card out of your sight when paying, or pay in cash instead.
