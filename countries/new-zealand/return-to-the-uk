The New Zealand Government has announced temporary restrictions on travellers in response to coronavirus (COVID-19).
Flights
Most commercial flights from New Zealand to the UK have now been suspended, and flight availability is extremely limited. If you have, or can find, somewhere to stay in New Zealand you may wish to consider staying put for the period of New Zealand’s lockdown.
UK Charter flights
The UK will operate a series of five charter flights from New Zealand to help those travellers most at risk from the effects of COVID-19 to return to the UK.
Flights will depart from Auckland and Christchurch to London, via Hong Kong. The first flight is expected to depart Auckland on 24 April.
Those eligible for the flights include people who are over 70, under 70 with an underlying serious or complex health condition, children under 12, and those who are pregnant. These people will be contacted directly by the British High Commission.
If more seats become available, we will extend booking more widely.
Please continue to check this page and sign up to alerts from the British High Commission Twitter and Facebook accounts for any updates.
To be eligible to take these flights, you must be normally resident in the UK. Eligibility, including your address in the UK, will be checked before tickets are issued.
The cost of the flight is £800 per person.
You will need to pay for your return travel to the UK. If departure options are available but you cannot afford the travel costs and have exhausted all other options for getting funds, you may be eligible to apply for an emergency loan from the government. This is a last resort option and you would need to repay the loan when you are back in the UK. For more information, you should contact Corporate Travel Management (CTM). CTM are a commercial partner of the FCO and are authorised to administer such loans on behalf of the FCO.
Travelling to the airport
On 2 April, the New Zealand government announced that foreign nationals in New Zealand can now use public or private transport to travel to the airport, in order to connect with international flights to their home country. Domestic travel must only be undertaken for the purpose of reaching the airport, and you must have a ticket for an outbound international flight before leaving your location.
There are several criteria that apply. See the NZ government’s COVID-19 website for full details. Check details of public transport in Auckland and Christchurch.
Arrival in the UK
When you arrive back in the UK, follow the guidance for when you return to the UK on steps you should take to protect yourself and others.
Visas
If you are unable to leave New Zealand and your visa is nearing expiry, you should contact the New Zealand authorities as soon as possible. See New Zealand Government and New Zealand Immigration websites for the latest information
