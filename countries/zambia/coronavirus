Cases of coronavirus (COVID-19) have been confirmed in Zambia. The Zambian authorities have introduced a number of measures to limit the spread of the coronavirus including pre-departure screening and mandatory quarantine on arrival for 14 days, in a government facility for those displaying symptoms on arrival, and self-quarantine for all others.
You should comply with any additional screening measures put in place by the authorities.
Issuance of visas for travellers from severe COVID-19 affected countries, including the UK, is being reviewed.
Entry and borders
Zambia’s borders remain open but under tight screening. Many of Zambia’s neighbouring countries have implemented coronavirus related travel restrictions and border closures so you should check travel advice for these countries before travel.
Anyone entering Zambia, including returning residents, will undergo mandatory quarantine for a period of not less than 14 days at a government designated institution or facility at their own cost.
Travellers to Zambia are not allowed to leave Zambia until they have completed the quarantine period
Quarantine is a mandatory requirement from the Zambian Ministry of Health.
All tourist visas to Zambia have been cancelled. Kenneth Kaunda International Airport (KKIA) in Lusaka remains open to international flights, but international flights are suspended from all provincial airports. International train and bus services are suspended.
Local measures
