This page has information on travelling to Turkey. Check what you must do to return to the UK
This page reflects the UK government’s understanding of current rules for people travelling on a full ‘British Citizen’ passport from the UK, for the most common types of travel.
The authorities in Turkey set and enforce entry rules.
COVID-19 entry restrictions
Turkey has entry restrictions for passengers arriving from, or who have visited in the previous 14 days, countries of concern. You should refer to the IATA website for the latest information on these restrictions and select Turkey on the map.
COVID-19 entry requirements may change at short notice, you should check the specifics, with your airline before you travel. Further details are available on Turkish Airlines or Pegasus websites.
All travellers
You will need to complete the online form (Form for Entry to Turkey), a maximum of 72 hours before travelling, to enter Turkey if aged 6 and over. This is not necessary for transit passengers.
All arrivals into Turkey will be subject to a medical evaluation for symptoms of coronavirus, including temperature checks. Arrivals may be subject to random PCR testing on arrival.
You must wear a face mask at all times whilst in an airport, and for the duration of all flights, to and from Turkey.
Your information regarding COVID-19 may be shared with the Ministry of Health and third countries when necessary. Anyone who knowingly provides false information may be prevented from travelling
If you’re fully vaccinated
If you’re fully vaccinated, you can enter Turkey without needing to test or quarantine.
At least 14 days must have passed since your second dose of the vaccine and the vaccine must be approved by the Turkish Ministry of Health or World Health Organization.
Find out if you qualify as fully vaccinated in Turkey on the Turkish Embassy in London website.
Proof of vaccination status
You must present proof that you have been fully vaccinated to enter Turkey.
Turkey will accept the UK’s proof of COVID-19 recovery and vaccination record and proof of COVID-19 vaccination issued in the Crown Dependencies. Your NHS appointment card from vaccination centres is not designed to be used as proof of vaccination and should not be used to demonstrate your vaccine status.
If you’re not fully vaccinated
If you’re not fully vaccinated, you’ll need to show proof of a negative PCR test (taken no more than 72 hours before entry), rapid antigen test (taken no more than 48 hours before entry), or proof of a recent recovery from COVID-19 within the last six months, when entering Turkey. See information on getting a test before entry.
Find out if you qualify as fully vaccinated in Turkey on the Turkish Embassy in London website.
You should not use the NHS testing service to get a test in order to facilitate your travel to another country. You should arrange to take a private test.
If you’ve had COVID-19 in the last six months
If you’re not fully vaccinated but have recovered from COVID-19 in the last six months, you can enter Turkey. You’ll need to show evidence of a positive PCR test (taken more than 14 days and less than six months ago). You will not need to take an additional COVID-19 test.
You can use the NHS COVID Pass to demonstrate proof of COVID-19 recovery when entering Turkey.
Children and young people
Children aged 11 and under can follow the rules for fully vaccinated travellers to enter Turkey.
If you’re transiting through Turkey
International passengers wishing to transit through airports in Turkey on to a domestic Turkish flight will not be required to submit an HES code, unless the passenger is a Turkish citizen or resident of Turkey and the duration between the two flights exceeds 12 hours.
Check your passport and travel documents before you travel
Passport validity
If you are visiting Turkey, your passport should be valid for at least six months from the date you arrive and there should be a full blank page for the entry and exit stamps. You can find more detail about the requirements for entry into Turkey on the website of the Turkish Ministry of Foreign Affairs.
If you are a resident in Turkey, your passport must be valid for six months from the date you arrive.
Check with your travel provider to make sure your passport and other travel documents meet their requirements.
Visas
British Citizens travelling to Turkey for tourist or business purposes are able to travel without a visa for visits of up to 90 days in any 180-day period.
If you plan to remain in Turkey for a period of more than 90 days, you should either apply for a longer stay visa before you travel, or get a residence permit from the local authorities in Turkey before your 90 day stay has elapsed. If you intend to work in Turkey, ensure you have the correct permits. More information is available from the Turkish Ministry of the Interior. If you do not abide by the terms of your visa or permit, you may be fined, deported and banned from re-entering the country.
If you’re entering Turkey via a land border crossing, make sure your passport has a dated entry stamp before you leave the border crossing area.
If you hold a different type of British nationality (eg BN(O), British Overseas Citizen, British Protected Person or British Subject), check visa requirements with the Turkish Consulate General before you travel. These types of passport are classed as ‘UK Special Passports’ in the Turkish e-Visa system. You will need to apply for a visa from the Turkish Consulate General before you travel.
Travelling with children
If you are leaving Turkey with a child who is a dual British-Turkish national, you may be asked to show the Turkish immigration authorities evidence that the Turkish parent has given permission for the child to travel.
UK Emergency Travel Documents
UK Emergency Travel Documents (ETD) are accepted for entry, airside transit and exit from Turkey within the dates printed on the document. ETDs should be valid for a minimum period of 6 months from the date of entry into Turkey.
