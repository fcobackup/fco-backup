This page has information on travelling to Eritrea.
This page reflects the UK government’s understanding of current rules for people travelling on a full ‘British Citizen’ passport from the UK, for the most common types of travel.
The authorities in Eritrea set and enforce entry rules. If you’re unsure how Eritrea’s entry requirements apply to you, contact its UK embassy, high commission or consulate.
Entry to Eritrea
All land borders are closed and are not expected to re-open in the near future. International flights have resumed. See International Travel.
All travellers
Travellers have previously been required to provide hard copy proof of a negative PCR test, taken no more than 72 hours before arrival in Eritrea, to enter or travel through the country. While this is no longer a requirement, some airlines may request this before you travel. You should check pre-flight requirements with your airline before you travel.
See information on getting a test before entry.
Check your passport and travel documents before you travel
Check with your travel provider to make sure your passport and other travel documents meet their requirements.
Passport validity
If you are visiting Eritrea your passport should be valid for a minimum of six months from the date you arrive, and have at least two clear pages adjoining one another in your passport.
If you are a resident in Eritrea your passport must be valid for six months from the date you arrive.
Visas
For information about entry requirements, contact the local immigration authorities or the nearest Eritrean Embassy. You should also check with your airline or travel company for the latest information.
Dual nationals
The Eritrean authorities class dual British/Eritrean nationals entering Eritrea as Eritrean nationals. The Eritrean authorities consider all British nationals holding either Eritrean or PFDJ identity documents (including out of date documents) as Eritrean nationals. The British Embassy is unable to gain consular access to, or obtain information on dual nationals if detained by the authorities or otherwise in need of assistance. Dual nationals entering Eritrea on an Eritrean identity card rather than an Eritrean passport will need an exit visa from the Immigration Office in Asmara to leave the country.
Foreign currency
Foreign visitors must declare all foreign currency over 10,000 US dollars or equivalent on entering the country. There is no limit on the amount that can be brought in. Make sure you have had your completed foreign currency declaration form approved and stamped before you leave the airport.
If you declared currency on arrival, when you leave you will have to show that any foreign currency missing was exchanged at a branch of ’Himbol’, the State foreign currency exchange. If you spend any US dollars at an official hotel you must get a receipt to present along with the currency declaration form when you leave the country.
You are not permitted to take more than 1,000 Nafka (ERN) out of Eritrea.
If you fail to comply with these regulations you may face prosecution leading to a heavy fine, as well as a delay to your departure.
