As a result of the ongoing conflict there have been a number of restrictions placed on financial transactions in Syria. Some of these restrictions are the decision of the Syrian regime, while others are the result of international businesses and banks being unwilling to invest or trade with Syria in the current environment. Since 2011, Syria has been subject to financial sanctions put in place by the European Union (EU) and, therefore, imposed by the UK as a member of the EU. The UKâ€™s own sanctions regime on Syria will come into force from 11pm on 31 December 2020 with substantially the same effect as the EU legislation. For more information, please visit the website of the Office of Financial Sanctions Implementation, HM Treasury and this page on UK sanctions on Syria.
Economic situation
The economic situation makes it challenging to pay for goods and services in Syria. As of mid-2020, the value of the Syrian Pound has fallen rapidly against the US Dollar. Prices have increased accordingly. It is very difficult to access US Dollars locally.
