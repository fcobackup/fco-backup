The information on this page covers the most common types of travel and reflects the UK government’s understanding of the rules currently in place. Unless otherwise stated, this information is for travellers using a full ‘British Citizen’ passport.
The authorities in the country or territory you’re travelling to are responsible for setting and enforcing the rules for entry. If you’re unclear about any aspect of the entry requirements, or you need further reassurance, you’ll need to contact the embassy, high commission or consulate of the country or territory you’re travelling to.
You should also consider checking with your transport provider or travel company to make sure your passport and other travel documents meet their requirements.
Flights to Japan
From 25 December for an initial period of one week, new flight bookings from the UK will not be possible. Current flight reservations should still be valid - you should check with your airline.
Entry rules in response to coronavirus (COVID-19)
Entry to Japan
From 24 December, for travel from the United Kingdom, and from 28 December for travel from elsewhere, new entry to Japan by foreign nationals will not be permitted. This also applies to foreign nationals in possession of visas issued since 1 October under the previous Global Residence Track.
Non-Japanese nationals who do arrive will need to provide written evidence of a negative COVID-19 test result conducted within 72 hours of their flight departure time if they have visited the UK or this list of countries in the last 14 days. You should not use the NHS testing service to get a test in order to facilitate your travel to another country. You should arrange to take a private test. Further details are available on the Ministry of Foreign Affairs website, or via Japan’s Visa Information Hotline on +44 (0)800 041 8412. Alternatively, contact your nearest Japanese Embassy for more information.
Other entry to visit Japan on a short-term basis, such as for tourism or to visit family, continues to be denied in principle for any non-Japanese nationals who have been to the UK or this list of countries in the last 14 days, other than in exceptional circumstances. There is currently no indication of when this might change. You may wish to confirm possible eligibility with your nearest Japanese Embassy for any other exceptions to enter Japan, including for humanitarian reasons.
Re-entry to Japan
British nationals with Status of Residence in Japan and who leave or have left Japan with a valid re-entry permit are allowed to re-enter Japan.
From 24 December for journeys to the UK, and from 28 December for journeys to all other countries, those leaving Japan for Short-Term Business Trips will no longer be eligible for the relaxation of quarantine measures (see below). All travellers will still need to provide written evidence of a negative COVID-19 test result conducted within 72 hours of your flight departure time. You should check the Japanese government’s advice on this re-entry process on the Ministry of Foreign Affairs website and the Ministry of Justice website (in Japanese).
Those who do not have a valid re-entry permit will in principle be denied re-entry even in the above cases.
You may wish to confirm your re-entry eligibility and COVID-19 testing requirements, including the certificate that you need, with the consular section of the Japanese Embassy in London or your nearest Japanese Embassy if you are in a third country. If you’re in Japan, contact the Immigration Services Agency on +81 570 013 904 or +81 357 967 112.
Visas
Japan has suspended its visa waiver system for anyone travelling on a British Citizen or British National (Overseas) passport with no indication of when this suspension will be lifted. Japan has also suspended single and multiple entry visas issued by Japanese Embassies and Consulates Generals in the UK prior to 20 March and in many other countries; the full list can be found on the Japanese Ministry of Foreign Affairs’ website. Anyone arriving in Japan without a valid visa will not be able to enter.
If you are already in Japan and your visa expired before the end of July 2020, Japan’s Immigration Service Agency has introduced a three-month grace period for renewing an expired visa without penalty. This includes short-term tourist visas, subject to proof that you were not able to easily leave Japan for COVID-19 related reasons. The three-month period starts from the date the visa expires – you must visit an immigration centre to renew your visa during this time. You will need to present a valid visa when leaving Japan.
Visas expiring after 1 August must be renewed using the normal process – you should contact the Immigration Services Agency.
Transiting Japan
These measures do not apply to passengers who are transiting through the same airport and do not go through immigration. If you are transiting using different airports you will need a transit permit on arrival.
To get one you will be required to demonstrate that you have not come from a country on the banned list, that you have timely onward travel plans and show that you will not use public transport to move between airports; this includes taxis.
You should comply with any additional screening measures put in place by the authorities. You should also check the latest entry requirements for your destination.
Testing/screening on arrival
All passengers arriving in Japan are required to complete a health questionnaire before disembarkation, including contact details. They are then required to undergo a Covid-19 screening test at the airport. You will be asked to wait for the test results at the airport before moving to your accommodation.
Quarantine requirements
From 24 December for travel to the UK, and from 28 December for travel to all other countries, British nationals with Status of Residence in Japan who leave Japan for short-term business travel will no longer be eligible for relaxation of quarantine measures (see the Ministry of Foreign Affairs announcement in Japanese).
From 26 December, travellers coming from the UK will be requested to spend 3 days in self-isolation at a government-provided facility, with a further screening test on the third day (see the Ministry of Foreign Affairs announcement in Japanese.) If the test is negative they will be allowed to continue 14 days’ self-isolation as set out below.
All passengers arriving in Japan are required to self-isolate for 14 days on arrival at a designated location (such as a hotel or your own home) and to avoid using public transport, including on leaving the airport. They will also be asked to comply with health monitoring procedures and install Japan’s Covid-19 tracing app and maintain location data for 14 days via their smartphone mapping application. These measures will remain in place for the foreseeable future.
New measures may also be brought in at short notice for travel from other countries: you should check the Ministry of Foreign Affairs website in Japanese.
Regular entry requirements
Visas
In normal circumstances, if you have a ‘British Citizen’ or ‘British National (Overseas)’ passport you can enter Japan as a visitor for up to 90 days without a visa. You may need to provide evidence of a return or onward ticket.
If you have a different type of British nationality, or you wish to enter Japan for other purposes (long-term stay, study, settlement, employment); if you have any doubts about whether you’re eligible to enter Japan (eg, if you have a criminal record or have been arrested even if it did not result in a conviction) or about visa matters generally, contact a Japanese Embassy or Consulate. Visas aren’t issued after arrival in Japan.
It’s illegal to work in Japan without the correct visa, however informal or temporary the work. Don’t overstay your permission to remain in the country, otherwise you risk arrest, detention and a heavy fine.
Passport validity
Your passport should be valid for the proposed duration of your stay. No additional period of validity beyond this is required.
UK Emergency Travel Documents
UK Emergency Travel Documents are accepted for entry, airside transit and exit from Japan.
Medication
The use or possession of some common prescription and over-the-counter medicines are banned under Japan’s strictly enforced anti-stimulant drugs law. This includes Vicks inhalers, medicines for allergies and sinus problems, cold and flu medication containing Pseudoephedrine and even some over-the-counter painkillers like those containing codeine. Foreign nationals have been detained and deported for offences - ignorance may not be considered a defence. You should check the status of your medication with the nearest Japanese Embassy or Consulate before you travel.
If you’re travelling with prescription medication that is permitted under Japanese law, you’re normally allowed to bring in up to one month’s supply. You’re advised to bring a copy of your prescription and a letter from your doctor stating the medical condition that the medication has been prescribed to treat. For more guidance on travelling with medication, check information pages from NHS Choices and the National Travel Health Network and Centre (NaTHNaC) in our foreign travel checklist.
If you need prescription medicine for long term use, you may need to provide extra paperwork, such as an import licence. The Japanese Ministry of Health, Labour and Welfare provides information about bringing medication for personal use.
