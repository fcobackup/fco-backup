As the British Virgin Islands (BVI) is a British Overseas Territory, there is no formal British diplomatic or consular representation and the local authorities deal with all requests for emergency assistance.
The Foreign, Commonwealth & Development Office (FCDO) provides advice about risks of travel to help British nationals in making informed decisions. Find out more about FCDO travel advice.

Travel insurance
If you choose to travel, research your destinations and get appropriate travel insurance. Insurance should cover your itinerary, planned activities and expenses in an emergency.
