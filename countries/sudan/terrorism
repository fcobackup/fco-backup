Terrorists are likely to try to carry out attacks in Sudan.
Attacks could be indiscriminate including in places visited by foreigners. You should be vigilant at all times, especially in crowded areas and public places like transport hubs, hotels, restaurants, places of worship and major gatherings. You should follow the advice of local authorities. In November 2020 Al-Qaeda in the Arabian Peninsula released a message calling for attacks in East Africa, including Sudan, against US and Israeli interests.
There is a high threat of terrorist attack globally affecting UK interests and British nationals, including from groups and individuals who view the UK and British nationals as targets. You should remain vigilant at all times.
UK Counter Terrorism Policing has information and advice on staying safe abroad and what to do in the event of a terrorist attack. Find out how to reduce your risk from terrorism while abroad.
Kidnaps
There is a high threat of kidnapping in Darfur. Kidnappings can be for financial or political gain and can be motivated by criminality or terrorism. There have been a number of recent kidnappings, including of British nationals and other westerners. Kidnap groups view those engaged in humanitarian aid work or journalism as legitimate targets.
The long-standing policy of the UK Government is not to make substantive concessions to hostage takers. The UK Government considers that paying ransoms and releasing prisoners increases the risk of further hostage-taking.
