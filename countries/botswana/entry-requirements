The information on this page covers the most common types of travel and reflects the UK government’s understanding of the rules currently in place. Unless otherwise stated, this information is for travellers using a full ‘British Citizen’ passport.
The authorities in the country or territory you’re travelling to are responsible for setting and enforcing the rules for entry. If you’re unclear about any aspect of the entry requirements, or you need further reassurance, you’ll need to contact the embassy, high commission or consulate of the country or territory you’re travelling to.
You should also consider checking with your transport provider or travel company to make sure your passport and other travel documents meet their requirements.
Restrictions in response to coronavirus
Entry and visas
Only citizens and residents will be allowed entry. Returning residents, including from the UK, will be subject to a 14-day mandatory quarantine period in government facilities.
From 16 March, visas will no longer be issued to nationals from countries affected by coronavirus, including the UK, and current visas for those travelling from these countries will be cancelled with immediate effect.
Travel
There are currently no commercial flights in to or out of Botswana. Medical evacuation flights remain possible. The Botswana authorities have also closed land border posts with neighbouring countries.
Flights in to and out of Botswana from South Africa are affected by South Africa’s own coronavirus (COVID-19) response. Follow our travel advice for South Africa for information on South African entry requirements, and consult your nearest South African High Commission.
Regular entry requirements
Visas
British nationals do not normally need a visa to enter Botswana for stays of up to 90 days.
Overstaying can cause delays on departure. If you wish to extend your stay, seek an extension from the Department of Immigration.
Passport validity
Your passport should be valid for a minimum period of 6 months from the date of entry into Botswana.
The Botswana government has stated that dual nationals using two different passports can only enter the country on the same passport they used to exit the previous country.
Yellow fever certificate requirements
Check whether you need a yellow fever certificate by visiting the National Travel Health Network and Centre’s TravelHealthPro website.
Ebola
The Botswana government continues to impose measures to screen travellers arriving from Ebola affected countries. Travellers arriving from Ebola affected countries may be denied entry to Botswana or put into quarantine on arrival. Further information is available from the Botswana Ministry of Health.
UK Emergency Travel Documents
UK Emergency Travel Documents (ETDs) are valid for entry into Botswana. However, unlike with a full validity UK passport, ETD holders must apply for the appropriate Botswana visa or be in possession of a residence permit before travelling to Botswana.
Travel to or from South Africa  
If you are planning to enter South Africa before or after you visit Botswana, you should refer to the travel advice for South Africa.
Travelling with children
The Botswana government has introduced new immigration rules from 1 October 2016. Children (under 18 years of age) who are travelling into or through Botswana must provide a certified copy of their full unabridged birth certificate as well as a valid passport (an abridged (short) birth certificate won’t be accepted).
If the child is travelling with one parent, with another adult or unaccompanied, the parent or parents who aren’t present will need to provide an affidavit giving their consent for the child to travel. For more information please contact the Botswana Embassy.
Travelling with children via South Africa
If you’re transiting through South Africa with children, see our South Africa travel advice page for information and advice about the documents you’ll need to carry.
