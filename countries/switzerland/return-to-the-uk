There remain some commercial options to return to the UK from Switzerland.
If you live in the UK and are currently visiting Switzerland, you’re strongly advised to return now by commercial means. Don’t run the risk of getting stranded.
UK special charter flights will only operate for priority countries where commercial flights are not possible. You should not assume that these flights will become available in countries where commercial routes are operating. Please do not contact the contracted travel management company if no flight is advertised here.
Flights
Flights to London are available from Zurich and Geneva. SWISS is currently the only airline operating commercial flights to the UK. If you are transiting Switzerland from elsewhere in the world, you are strongly advised to have your onward travel booked in advance.
An option for those wishing to return to Northern Ireland is to travel via Dublin. Flights are being operated by Swiss from Zurich via Frankfurt / Germany to Dublin. You should check the Travel Advice for Ireland and Germany. You should check the carrier’s website for the latest flight schedule and availability.
