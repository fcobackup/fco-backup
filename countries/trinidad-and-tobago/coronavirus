The British High Commission is in regular contact with airlines, the Trinidad and Tobago authorities and other governments on commercial options for returning to the UK.
The High Commission understands that there may be limited private charter options for returning from Trinidad and Tobago to Europe in August. A private charter company operates these flights. The British High Commission is unable to assist with any bookings or enquiries related to these flights.

You will need to pay for your return travel to the UK. If departure options are available but you cannot afford the travel costs and have exhausted all other options for getting funds, you may be eligible to apply for an emergency loan from the government. This is a last resort option and you would need to repay the loan when you are back in the UK. For more information, you should contact Corporate Travel Management (CTM).
