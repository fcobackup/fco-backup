Tropical storms
While Omanâ€™s climate is generally dry, heavy rains do fall, usually in the winter. Flash floods can cause injuries and deaths. Cyclones from the Indian Ocean occasionally make landfall in Oman in the summer months, resulting in a disruption of services and utilities. You should follow any instructions given in an official weather warning. Check local weather forecasts and seek advice about travelling conditions particularly if you are considering any off-road travel or adventure tourism, including to Wadi areas (dry riverbeds).
With the exception of Al Wusta and Dhofar governorates, a public holiday has been announced for 3-4 October 2021 because of the risk of adverse conditions from Cyclone Shaheen.
