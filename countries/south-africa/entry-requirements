This page has information on travelling to South Africa. Check what you must do to return to the UK.
This page reflects the UK government’s understanding of current rules for people travelling on a full ‘British Citizen’ passport from the UK, for the most common types of travel.
The authorities in South Africa set and enforce entry rules.
All travellers
You can travel to South Africa for any purpose for up to 90 days without a visa. You should check the expiry date of your visa or entry stamp and make sure you do not overstay.
You may need to complete a health form to enter South Africa.
See Visas and Passport validity sections for more information.
If you’re fully vaccinated
If you are fully vaccinated, you do not need to take a coronavirus test to travel to South Africa. You will need to present your vaccination certificate during travel and on arrival.
South African authorities have confirmed that vaccines recommended and approved for use by the World Health Organisation are accepted. This includes the Moderna, Oxford/AstraZeneca, and Pfizer/BioNTech vaccines used in the UK vaccine programme.
Proof of vaccination status
Any valid vaccination certificate is acceptable. Your personal details on your vaccine certificate should correspond with the information on your passport. You should ensure you can present the digital version, with the QR code, or paper version when you arrive.
South Africa will accept the UK’s proof of COVID-19 vaccination record and proof of COVID-19 vaccination issued in the Crown Dependencies. Your NHS appointment card from vaccination centres is not designed to be used as proof of vaccination and should not be used to demonstrate your vaccine status.
If you’re not fully vaccinated
Upon entry to South Africa, unvaccinated people must produce either:
a valid certificate of a negative COVID-19 PCR test, which was obtained not more than 72 hours before the date of travel, or
a valid certificate of a negative antigen COVID-19 test performed by a medical practitioner, registered health authority or accredited laboratory, obtained not more than 48 hours before the date of departure
If you’ve had COVID-19 in the last 90 days
If you wish to enter using proof of recovery, you will need to follow additional rules set by the South African authorities; set out below.
You must present a valid certificate of a positive PCR COVID-19 test, recognised by the World Health Organisation. The date of the test must be between 10 and 90 days prior to the date of arrival. In addition, produce a signed letter from a health care provider, registered in the country of origin, stating that the person has fully recovered from COVID-19, is not experiencing any new symptoms and is fit to travel.
Children and young people
Children under 12 years old do not need to present a PCR or antigen test or show proof of vaccination on arrival.
If you’re transiting through South Africa
The rules set out above also apply to travellers wishing to transit South Africa.
Exemptions
There are no exemptions to South Africa’s entry requirements.
Check your passport and travel documents before you travel
Check with your travel provider to make sure your passport and other travel documents meet their requirements.
Passport validity
If you are visiting South Africa, your passport should be valid for 6 months from the date you arrive.
Your passport should be valid for at least 30 days beyond your intended date of exit from South Africa, in line with South African immigration regulations. However, some immigration officials still request that a passport should have at least 6 months validity on the date of entry to South Africa. To avoid problems at the airport on arrival, you’re advised to ensure your passport is valid for six months.
Your passport should have at least two blank pages when you arrive in South Africa.
Visas
If you’re visiting South Africa for tourism or business purposes for a period of up to 90 days, you don’t need a visa. You should check the expiry date of your visa or entry stamp and make sure you do not overstay.
For more information on visas, contact the South African High Commission.
Dual citizenship
If you hold South African citizenship, you must enter and exit South Africa on your South African passport. It is an offence for a South African citizen aged 18 or over to enter or leave the country on a foreign passport.
Travelling with children
There are special requirements for travelling to South Africa with children under the age of 18. There are different requirements for unaccompanied children entering South Africa.
Check the advisory from the South African Department of Home Affairs for more details, and consult your nearest South African high commission or embassy if you have any questions about these requirements.
Biometric capturing
South Africa has implemented biometric capturing at all ports of entry. This may result in some delays at land borders. You should allow additional time for border crossings.
Yellow fever certificate requirements
Check whether you need a yellow fever certificate by visiting the National Travel Health Network and Centre’s TravelHealthPro website.
UK Emergency Travel Documents
South African authorities advise that UK Emergency Travel Documents (ETDs) are accepted for entry, transit and exit from South Africa. ETDs should have a minimum of 6 months validity for entry, transit or exit.
