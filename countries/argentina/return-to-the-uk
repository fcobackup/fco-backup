The Argentine government has closed the country’s borders for all those entering except for Argentine citizens and resident foreign nationals, and most international flights have been suspended.
The last direct flight from Argentina to the UK departed on Monday 16 March. Some airlines continue to fly limited routes back to the UK via third countries. Travellers should regularly check availability with these airlines.
British nationals who have already purchased tickets, and who are showing none of the symptoms of coronavirus, will be able to access the airport to catch their flights. You may need to travel to Buenos Aires city, or to another province within Argentina, in order to catch an international flight.
Regulations are subject to change at short notice and you should check with your travel provider before your journey. Further information is also available on the Argentine Ministry of Health website (in Spanish).
Where possible, the British Embassy in Argentina will share relevant information about departure options on Facebook and other social media accounts.
Travel to international airports
Although most domestic flights in Argentina, as well as long distance trains and buses, will not resume operations until 1 April, the airline Aerolíneas Argentinas is running some exceptional flights to transport visitors from tourist destinations to Buenos Aires.
Once you have bought your ticket, you should leave plenty of time to get to the airport. You should make sure you are able to show authorities:
proof of a booked flight (a boarding pass if possible)
your passport
a (printed, if possible) copy of the letter issued by the Ministry of Tourism confirming that foreign nationals are exempt from the quarantine if they are travelling to return to their country of origin.
a (printed, if possible) letter issued from the British Embassy confirming that you should be allowed to travel.
If you encounter any resistance when trying to access the airport, you should contact the British Embassy immediately on +54 11 4808-2200.
