Entry rules in response to coronavirus (COVID-19)
Travel ban on foreign nationals
The authorities have announced a temporary ban on foreign nationals entering, or transiting, Taiwan, with the exception of residents. Currently there is no set date for when these border measures will be lifted. Exceptions may be made for emergency or humanitarian reasons. Contact your local Taipei Representative Office for further information.
Anyone entering Taiwan will be required to follow the quarantine requirements set out below.
Arriving in Taiwan from the UK
Starting from 10 April 2021, all passengers arriving directly from the UK, or those who have been in the UK in the previous 14 days, will no longer be required to complete their mandatory 14 day quarantine at a designated quarantine centre in Taiwan. These travellers instead will be permitted to complete their 14 day quarantine at either a designated quarantine hotel, or follow the one person per residence requirement to complete the mandatory quarantine period at their residential property.
You should refer to the Taiwan Centers for Disease Control (CDC) for further information regarding entry and quarantine requirements in Taiwan. A link to the CDC’s FAQ page can be found on the CDC website.
Quarantine requirements
The local authorities have announced that from 15 January 2021, there will be tightened quarantine measures in Taiwan, and group quarantine facilities will now be available for passengers travelling from low-risk countries. Passengers who are eligible and choose to quarantine at a private residence rather than a quarantine hotel or a group quarantine facility will be required to declare that their residence complies with quarantine requirements. You should refer to the Taiwan Centers for Disease Control (CDC) for further information.
Screening on arrival
All passengers arriving or transiting in Taiwan are required to present a certificate of a negative COVID-19 RT-PCR test in order to be able to board their flight to Taiwan. Any exemption due to exceptional circumstances will require prior approval before departure. This test needs to have taken place within three working days before the date of departure. Test Certificates of a negative COVID-19 RT-PCR must be issued by a recognised medical institution in the country of departure and include the following information:
the passenger’s full name as per their passport,
the date of birth or passport number of the traveller,
specimen collection date and test report date,
the virus name, testing method and the test result.
Test Certificates are required to be produced in either English or Chinese; however, in situations where the passenger provides a certificate in either French or Spanish, if the certificate is in the official language of the place of departure, and ground personnel of the airline are able to assist with the inspection of the content, the certificate may be accepted.
Anyone found to provide false or incorrect test results, or evade or obstruct the quarantine measures, may face a fine of between NT$10,000 to NT$150,000 and further criminal charges.
Refer to the Taiwan Centers for Disease Control for further information regarding Test Exemptions, Test Certificates and COVID-19 test requirements.
You should not use the NHS testing service to get a test in order to facilitate your travel to another country. You should arrange to take a private test.
Alien Resident Certificate (ARC) and Alien Permanent Resident Certificate (APRC) holders
If you already hold a valid Alien Resident Certificate (ARC) or Alien Permanent Resident Certificate (APRC), you do not require a visa to enter Taiwan. For more information, you should visit the website of the Taiwan Centers for Disease Control (CDC). If you are in Taiwan you can also contact the ‘Information For Foreigners In Taiwan’ helpline on 0800-024-111.
If you are unsure if you are permitted to enter Taiwan, or you have further questions about entry restrictions and conditions, you should contact your local Taipei Representative Office (TRO) or airline before you attempt to travel. Entry procedures are being regularly reviewed, so may change at short notice.
Visa extensions
The Taiwanese authorities announced in March that travellers already in Taiwan who arrived under a visa waiver, visitor visa or landing visa before 21 March 2020, and had not overstayed their entry conditions, would be granted an automatic 30-day extension of their stay. This has now been extended by further 30 day periods. The extension will be applied automatically, no application is required. Your total period of stay, including extensions, cannot exceed 510 days (comprised of 180 days on a visitor visa, plus 11 automatic 30 day extensions). For more information, you should contact the National Immigration Agency (NIA).
If you arrived after 21 March 2020, your maximum stay is determined by your visa. If you wish to stay over 180 days, you may apply to do so if you have a legitimate reason for needing to remain in Taiwan or are unable to leave. Restrictions apply and not all British nationals will be eligible. You cannot apply more than 15 days before the 180 day point. For more information, you should contact the National Immigration Agency (NIA). The British Office is unable to issue letters or endorsements to support any application to remain.
Transiting Taiwan
Taiwan announced on 17 May that foreign nationals will not be able to transit Taiwan from 00:01 on 19 May until 18 June. Rules and procedures may change at short notice. For further information, you should contact your airline or provider.
Regular entry requirements
Visas

UK Emergency Travel Documents
UK Emergency Travel Documents are accepted for entry, airside transit and exit from Taiwan. If you’re entering Taiwan using an Emergency Travel Document (ETD), you must apply for a visit visa before travelling (unless you’re travelling from mainland China, in which case you can get a visa on arrival).
Customs regulations
You should not enter Taiwan with animal products without prior authorisation as those caught smuggling products may face heavy fines. Due to recent reports of African Swine Fever Virus (ASF) in pork products, particularly from the People’s Republic of China (PRC), local authorities have increased quarantine checks and inspections
