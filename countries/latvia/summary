The Foreign, Commonwealth & Development Office (FCDO) advises against all but essential travel to:
The whole of Latvia based on the current assessment of COVID-19 risks.
Travel to Latvia is subject to entry restrictions
Asymptomatic travellers arriving in Latvia from a country (or who have been in a country in the previous 14 days) where COVID-19 cases exceed 50 per 100,000 of population over the previous 14 days are required to self-isolate for 10 days after leaving that country
From 1 January 2021, all passengers arriving at Riga International Airport from the United Kingdom are required to take a COVID-19 test upon arrival at the Airport or provide evidence of a negative test and then go straight to their place of residence in Latvia to self-isolate for 10 days.
