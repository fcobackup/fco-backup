Protests
Political protests in Southern Peru, including in Cusco, Arequipa and Puno, and in Lima, continue. They have also spread to other parts of the country. These protests are unpredictable and can escalate quickly and include violence. Clashes between protestors and the security forces have resulted in casualties. In Lima protests have a focus in the historic centre, but have also spread to other areas. In Cusco, Arequipa, Puno and Tacna some protests have targeted airports.
You should take particular care to avoid all areas of large gatherings and protests. If possible, you should remain in a safe place. You should follow the authorities’ advice and monitor local media, including social media channels.
Travellers arriving in Peru should be aware that travel to some parts of the country or the return to Lima may not be possible. Protests have led to road blockades, suspension of train services, disruption in immigration services of land borders and airport closures in different parts of the country.
Plan for disruption and allow extra time to reach your destination. You should ensure you travel with a sufficient supply of food, water, cash in local currency and personal medication.
You should liaise with your local airline, hotel or tour operator for further advice and assistance that they may provide to mitigate disruption, and for information on alternate arrangements that may need to be made for onward travel, including bus and rail journeys.
The Peruvian government has made a form available here to identify any visitors experiencing travel difficulties as a result of the protests. Please note this form is not managed by the British Embassy and we will not be able to contact British nationals registered in this list.
Due to these protests, the following States of Emergency and curfews are in place:
A 30-day State of Emergency came into force on 15 January 2023 in Puno, Cusco and Lima regions, in Callao province, in Andahuaylas province (Apurimac region), in Tambopata and Tahuamanu provinces (Madre de Dios region), and in the Torata district in Mariscal Nieto province (Moquegua region). This allows the military forces to assist the local police and authorities in maintaining law and order.
This State of Emergency also applies to the following roads: the Carretera Panamericana Sur, the Carretera Panamericana Norte, the Carretera Central, the Corredor Vial Sur Apurimac-Cusco-Arequipa and the Corredor Vial Interoceanica Sur.
A 10-day curfew from 8 pm to 4 am came into force on 15 January 2023 in Puno region.
A 30-day State of Emergency came into force on 19 January 2023 in Amazonas, La Libertad and Tacna regions. This allows the military forces to assist the local police and authorities in maintaining law and order.
For more information on states of emergency, please see the El Peruano official newspaper.
Airports
As of 6 January 2023 the airport in Juliaca, Puno region, suspended its operations temporarily due to the protests and should not re-open until at least mid February.
On 19 January the airport in Arequipa suspended its operations temporarily.
All other airports in Peru, including the international airport in Lima, are restricting entry to passengers that hold an ID and a boarding pass.
For information on airport operations, please visit the Lima airport website.
Train services
Train services in the South have been temporarily suspended as a precautionary measure. The route Ollantaytambo-MachuPicchu-Ollantaytambo is subject to frequent change and may open and close with very little notice. It is possible that there could be disruption to travel in the Sacred Valley and any return to Cusco, so we advise visitors to check with travel providers in advance.
Machu Picchu
Machu Picchu tourist site has been closed temporarily. The Inca Trail has also been suspended.
General Protests
In general, local protests are common, can start with very little notice, and can turn violent quickly, potentially causing lengthy disruption to travel and services. Protests can disrupt road, rail, river and air travel and affect tourist areas like Lima, Ica, Cusco, Arequipa, Puerto Maldonado and Iquitos. Protests in Puno can result in the closure of the border crossing with Bolivia, including Lake Titicaca. Protests in Machu Picchu can result in the suspension of train and bus services. Protests in the centre of Lima can disrupt access to the historical centre and to some public offices. Protests in Ica can result in the blockade of Panamericana highway. Protests in the Amazon area can result in the disruption of tour vessels in remote areas where access to food and water can be limited and evacuations are only possible by boat.
You should always remain vigilant, avoid any protests or demonstrations and keep up to date with developments via official local sources. Be wary of unverified, unofficial information. You should ensure you travel with a sufficient supply of food, water, cash in local currency and personal medication, and allow extra time to reach your destination.
Social conflicts
Local groups often announce strike action with little or no notice. These are normally around mining interests and may quickly spill over from one region to another. These demonstrations can become violent and may lead to roadblocks. You should avoid large gatherings and follow the advice of local authorities.
Crime
Street crime, including muggings and thefts, is a significant problem in Lima, Cusco, Arequipa and other major cities. Be vigilant in public places and when withdrawing cash from ATMs. Avoid walking alone in quiet areas or at night.
There have been a number of thefts at gunpoint affecting foreign nationals, including British tourists and residents. These have happened in tourist areas of Miraflores and Barranco, including outside hotels popular with tourists, during the day and at night. In early 2019 there were a small number of robberies in and around luxury lodges near Puerto Maldonado city in the Madre de Dios region, including on tour buses. Some of these have been at gunpoint and involved British tourists. As with travel across the country, you should remain aware of your surroundings and avoid wearing or displaying expensive items. In the event of a robbery, do not attempt to resist attackers or take any action that puts you at greater risk. Report the matter to local police as soon as possible. If the incident takes place in a lodge or hotel, staff will be able to assist.
Passport theft is also common on inter-city buses and at bus stations. Keep your passport with you at all times during your bus journey and take particular care of valuables if you travel on a bus at night. Provincial and inter-city buses are sometimes held up and the passengers robbed.
Petty crime, such as pickpocketing and purse snatching is common, and occurs even in crowded, public areas. Pickpockets and bag snatchers may work in pairs or groups and employ a variety of ruses to divert their victim’s attention.
Avoid wearing expensive watches and jewellery, or showing signs of affluence.
Ensure that your belongings, including your passport and other travel documents, are secure at all times.
Never leave bags unattended.
Tourists have been targeted and robbed by bogus taxi drivers. Do not hail a taxi on the street. Use licensed telephone or app-based taxi services whenever possible, or ask your hotel to book one for you. Be particularly careful when arriving at Jorge Chavez International Airport in Lima, and at bus terminals. Bogus taxi drivers and thieves pretending to be tour operators sometimes approach arriving passengers. At the airport, use one of the official taxi companies located at desks directly outside the arrival hall. Further details are on the Lima Airport Partners website. At bus terminals, use one of the taxis registered with them. Cars travelling from Lima city to the airport have been targeted by thieves when diverted off the main route by GPS navigation applications.
There have been a number of cases of rape, mostly in the Cusco and Arequipa areas. Be alert to the use of ‘date rape’ and other drugs. Buy your own drinks and keep sight of them at all times. If you’re in a bar and don’t feel well, try to seek help from people you know. Unscrupulous tour agents have targeted lone young female travellers in the Cusco area.
If you’re a victim of crime, try to report it to the police as soon as possible so they can start investigations.
The army has been called in to support the police tackle crime in Lima and Callao. You should follow instructions given to you by military, police or other officials.
Local travel
The website of the Peruvian Ministry of Tourism has useful information for tourists and visitors in English, and its local tourist Information and Assistance service - telephone +51 1 574 8000 (24 hours a day) can handle enquiries in English. On the Ministry of Tourism website you will also find information about the government offices that help tourists around the country. The Tourist Protection Network has launched a new 24/7 free line to contact the Tourist Police on 0800 22221. They can handle enquiries in English.
Drugs, organised crime and terrorism are inextricably linked. There is a higher risk to your safety in regions where there is intensive coca cultivation and processing, including the Alto Huallaga, Aguaytia, Apurimac-Ene and Mantaro (VRAEM) river basins. Remnants of the Shining Path terrorist group continue to conduct occasional ambushes and attacks mainly targetting Police, military forces and local authorities. Seek local advice about dangerous areas.
Illegal drug use and drugs trafficking in Peru is subject to severe punishment, with lengthy jail sentences. Prison conditions in Peru are extremely poor and the Embassy cannot intervene in police or judicial matters, nor is it able to secure more favourable conditions for those in detention.
A state of emergency for security reasons related to the above is in force in some districts of Ayacucho, Huancavelica, Junin, Madre de Dios and Cusco regions (Cusco city, Machu Picchu and Manu Park are not affected) and in the Apurimac-Cusco-Arequipa transportation corridor. For further information you should contact Iperu. A state of emergency gives the armed forces responsibility for law and order alongside the police. Some civil rights are suspended. If you do decide to visit any area under a state of emergency you should follow instructions given to you by military, police or other officials.
Unregulated tour services
If you’re planning to undertake adventure activities like canopy/zipline, bungee jumping, paragliding, kayaking, rock climbing, surfing etc, the agency providing the service must have a licence for these activities. For more information, contact the Ministry of Tourism, as they can provide you with updated information on tour and sport services. You should also check with companies for their health and safety precautions.
We are aware of unregulated surfboard rentals at the beaches of Miraflores, that do not operate with the Municipality permission. To our knowledge, there is no life-guard provision.
Border areas
Be especially alert to the local security situation in the border areas with Ecuador, Colombia and Brazil.
There are reports of increased drug trafficking and other organised crime in the area around the Putumayo river, near the border with Colombia, Ecuador and Brazil.
If you’re crossing the Peru-Ecuador border (by land) you should do so at official checkpoints only. Other parts of the border may still have unexploded landmines. You should exercise extra vigilance in these areas.
Inca trail
To protect the Inca trail, where only guided groups are allowed, there is a government fee and restrictions on numbers. During the high season (June–August) you should make reservations with a travel agency well in advance. Always register when entering national parks and be particularly careful in steep or slippery areas which are unfenced or unmarked. Several climbers have died or suffered serious injuries after falling while climbing Huayna Picchu, a peak near Machu Picchu. Only very basic medical assistance is available at Machu Picchu.
The alternative route to Machu Picchu, also known as ‘the Inca Jungle Trail’ can be difficult for vehicles due to poor road conditions and fatal road accidents have been reported.
Lake Titicaca
Travel in groups when walking along the banks of Lake Titicaca. There have been incidents of armed robberies against travellers walking on their own. Take care at all times and contact the local tourist information centre for advice about known safe zones. Local authorities advise against travelling alone at night in the Desaguadero area on the Peru-Bolivia border at the southern end of Lake Titicaca.
Nazca Lines
If you’re planning to overfly the Nazca Lines, check the airline company is licensed and has a good safety record before you book. There have been several fatal accidents in recent years, most recently in February 2022 when an aircraft departing from the Nazca aerodrome crashed causing the death of 5 foreign tourists and 2 local crew members. For more information, please contact Iperu.
Spiritual cleansing
Shamans and other individuals offer ‘spiritual cleansing’ to tourists in the Amazon area, Northern Peru and Cusco. This service is often referred to as Ayahuasca or San Pedro and typically involves the consumption of a brew containing dimethyltryptamine (DMT), an hallucinogenic drug which is prohibited in the UK as a Class A substance. Consumption of this brew is not regulated and its interaction with existing medical conditions isn’t well understood. People have suffered serious illnesses and in some cases death after participating in these ceremonies. There have also been reports of sexual assault during these ceremonies. If you have been sexually assaulted or raped in Peru and you wish to seek assistance or to report the incident, you can refer to this guidance.
Spiritual cleansing retreats are usually some distance from populated areas making it difficult to access medical attention for those who need it. Some retreats have basic medical services, including first aid, but others don’t. Some don’t even have an established plan for how clients can access medical facilities in case of an emergency.
Amazon Cruise ships
In July 2016 a cruise ship carrying foreign nationals was robbed while travelling along the River Amazon. Security arrangements vary between different cruise operators. For more information about safety and security on Amazon cruise ships, contact your cruise ship operator or iPeru (official tourist information and assistance).
Huaraz Region of the Cordillera Blanca Mountains
Several hikers have died and others have had to be rescued after serious accidents in the Huaraz region of the Cordillera Blanca Mountains, where Peru’s highest peaks are located. Most rescues are carried out on foot because helicopters can’t fly to the areas where hikers are experiencing transport difficulties. Contact iperu offices in Huaraz (telephone: +51 (43) 428812) before you set off.
River rafting and boating
Check that the company you use is well established and make sure your insurance covers you for all the activities you want to undertake. The weather can impact on white-water rafting and boating conditions.
Sand buggies 
There have been deaths and injuries involving recreational sand buggies, particularly in the sand dunes around Ica and Lake Huacachina. These buggies are unregulated and the drivers and agencies take no responsibility for the welfare of passengers.
Road travel
You can drive in Peru with a valid UK driving licence for up to 6 months or with an International Driving Permit (IDP) for up to one year.
If you’re driving on an IDP, from 28 March 2019 you should have the 1968 version of the IDP to drive in Peru. 1949 IDPs previously issued by the UK may no longer be accepted after this date. From 1 February 2019, you can only get IDPs over the counter from 2,500 UK Post Offices. You will not be able to buy an IDP outside the UK, so get one before you travel.
Carry your passport with you at all times when driving.
Take particular care if you are driving close to places where protests are taking place. Don’t attempt to pass blockades.
Driving standards in Peru are poor. Stop signs and traffic lights are often ignored. Fatal crashes occur frequently. Drivers don’t always show concern for pedestrians.
Bus crashes are common, especially at night. Only use reputable transport companies, and where possible avoid overnight travel, especially in mountainous and remote regions. Always wear a seat belt.
