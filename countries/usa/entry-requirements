This information is for people travelling on a full ‘British citizen’ passport from the UK. It is based on the UK government’s understanding of the current rules for the most common types of travel. 
The authorities in the US set and enforce entry rules. If you’re not sure how these requirements apply to you, contact the US Embassy or a consulate in the UK.
Passport validity requirements
To enter the US, your passport must be valid for the length of your planned stay.
If you’re travelling through another country on your way to or from the US, check the entry requirements for that country. Many countries will only allow entry if you have at least 6 months validity remaining on your passport. 
Dual nationals  
US law requires US citizens to enter and exit the US using a US passport. Contact the US Embassy or a consulate in the UK for more information.
Visa requirements
To enter or transit through the US, you must have either an Electronic System for Travel Authorisation (ESTA) or a visa.
The US State Department has more information on visas.
Applying for an ESTA
ESTA is an automated system that determines the eligibility of visitors to travel to the US under the Visa Waiver Program (VWP). You can apply for an ESTA via the Official ESTA Application Website or using the ESTA Mobile app on android or on iOS.
All Visa Waiver Program (VWP) travellers intending to enter the US by land, sea and air will be required to obtain an approved ESTA prior to application for admission at land border ports of entry. Individuals who are not eligible to travel under the VWP may apply for a visa at any U.S. Embassy & Consulates.
You may not be able to apply for an ESTA visa waiver if you have:
been arrested (even if the arrest did not result in a criminal conviction)
a criminal record
been refused admission into, or have been deported from, the US
previously overstayed under an ESTA visa waiver
Information on whether you are eligible for an ESTA visa waiver can be found in the help section of the official ESTA Application Website.
You cannot normally apply for an ESTA visa waiver if you were in the following countries on or after March 2011: 
Iran
Iraq
Libya
North Korea
Somalia
Sudan
Syria
Yemen
You cannot apply for an ESTA visa waiver if you travelled to or were in Cuba on or after 12 January 2021. 
If you are not eligible for an ESTA, you must instead apply for a US visa.
Applying for a visa
The US Embassy in London has information on how to apply for a visa.
US visa appointments
Visa appointments at the US Embassy in London are limited. Plan your application as far ahead as possible before travel. If you need to travel urgently, you can request an expedited interview through the US Embassy’s appointment service provider.
The US Embassy has more information on visa appointments.
Children and young people
Anyone aged 17 and under must:
have a valid visa or ESTA on arrival
be able to provide evidence about the purpose, location and length of their visit if asked by immigration officials
have a letter of consent, preferably in English and notarized from one or both parents if travelling alone, with only one parent, or with someone who is not a parent or legal guardian
The US authorities can stop you entering the country if they have safeguarding concerns about a child. If this happens, the US authorities will take the child into their care, and their return from the US could take months. The FCDO cannot speed up the return of British nationals aged 17 and under from the US.
The US government has information about children travelling to the US. If you have questions, contact the US Embassy in the UK.
Vaccine requirements
For details about medical entry requirements and recommended vaccinations, see TravelHealthPro’s US guide.
Customs rules 
There are strict rules about goods you can take into or out of the US. You must declare anything that may be prohibited or subject to tax or duty.
Global Entry
The US Customs and Border Protection Trusted Traveller Program (TTP) Global Entry allows pre-approved, low-risk travellers expedited clearance at some US airports. If you’re a British citizen, you can register to get a UK background check. If you pass the background checks, you’ll be invited to apply for Global Entry for UK Citizens.
