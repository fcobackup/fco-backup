Outbreaks of plague tend to be seasonal and occur mainly during the rainy season, with around 500 cases reported annually. Whilst outbreaks are not uncommon in rural areas, the latest outbreak in 2017, saw seen an increase in reported cases in urban areas, including Antananarivo. The Ministry of Health of Madagascar officially announced the containment of this outbreak on 27 November 2017.
209 deaths were recorded, with none related to international travel. Further outbreaks cannot be ruled out. You can find further information and advice in the ‘Outbreaks’ section of the TravelHealthPro page for Madagascar.
Although there are public and private hospitals in Antananarivo, they can only handle routine operations. Complex surgery requires evacuation either to Mauritius, South Africa or La Reunion. Make sure you have adequate travel health insurance and accessible funds to cover the cost of any medical treatment abroad and repatriation.
You should drink or use only boiled or bottled water and avoid ice in drinks.
High levels of syphilis have been recorded.
