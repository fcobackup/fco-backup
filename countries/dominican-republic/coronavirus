Cases of coronavirus (COVID-19) have been confirmed in the Dominican Republic. The local authorities have introduced measures to limit the spread of the virus.
The FCO strongly encourage non-resident British nationals in Dominican Republic to consider leaving quickly to avoid difficulties they will face if travel out of the country and the region are further restricted and they are unable to get home.

The Dominican government has established a dedicated website and helpline (to access, please call *462) to provide more information on the Dominican Republic’s response to coronavirus. Both of these services operate in Spanish. The helpline is experiencing a high volume of calls and is likely to be under pressure.

All of the Dominican Republic’s air, land and sea borders were closed with effect from 6am on 19 March for 15 days.
The Dominican government suspended all flights between the Dominican Republic and the UK (as well as the whole of Europe, China, South Korea and Iran) with effect from 6am local time on Monday 16 March for one month. This applies to flights both to and from the Dominican Republic.
A quarantine requirement has been imposed for visitors who have been in any of the listed countries during the previous two weeks.

On 17 March the Dominican Government announced a national state of emergency for a period of 25 days and detailed further measures aimed at tackling the spread of COVID-19. These measures will be effective from 6am on 19 March for 15 days.
If you’re in the Dominican Republic, follow the regulations set out by the Dominican government in full. Key measures include:

The curfew applies from 20 March until 3 April between the hours of 8pm and 6am and applies to all persons in the country, except those with specific exemptions (e.g. healthcare workers and certain other professions) or those with a medical emergency travelling to a medical facility. All British nationals in the Dominican Republic should observe this restriction.
