Crime
Addis Ababa and other major urban areas are comparatively safe compared to many African cities. However, the British Embassy has received increased reports of foreign nationals being targeted by groups of youths or scam artists. Petty theft and mugging is on the rise. There has been a smaller number of more serious incidents, including sexual harassment of women and robberies.
Be vigilant if approached by strangers seeking assistance - criminal gangs are known to use distraction techniques including begging, spitting or spilling food/drink on you or feigning illness. Take particular care when visiting crowded public places, especially at night. There has been an increase in violent robberies at parks and walking sites in Addis Ababa. If threatened, hand over your valuables without resistance.
Keep belongings on your person while travelling in taxis, and keep valuables like cameras and passports out of sight. Be aware of the risk of pickpocketing, bag and jewellery snatching including from vehicles stopped at traffic lights in Addis Ababa. Keep car doors locked whilst in your vehicle, and when parking leave your car in a well-lit and guarded area. Consider fitting anti-shatter film to all windows on your vehicle.
Large crowds are common on key national and religious dates. These include Ethiopian Christmas on 7 January, Epiphany/’Timket’ in January, Victory of Adawa on 2 March, Ethiopian Patriots’ Victory Day on 5 May, Downfall of the Derg on 28 May, Ethiopian New Year on 11-12 September and The Finding of the True Cross/’Meskel’ in September. Large crowds also gather on Ethiopian (Orthodox) Easter; Eid Al Fitr; Eid Al Arafa and the Birthday of the Prophet Mohammed. Various parts of the country also have local festivals which can lead to large gatherings, often celebrating Saints days.
There have been a small number of cases of arbitrary detention of British nationals in Ethiopia in recent years. There’s a risk that this could reoccur – particularly where tensions are heightened (for example around major events, or in locations that might be deemed sensitive for security reasons). You should carry copies of your passport and the contact details of the British Embassy Addis Ababa at all times. This may help if you’re questioned or detained. However, you should be aware that the Ethiopian authorities will not necessarily notify embassies when foreign nationals are detained. Even if requested, adequate consular access is not always granted.
Health and safety
Health and safety precautions like life jackets in boats or protective railings at historical sites are rarely in place in Ethiopia.
Road travel
Driving standards and vehicle maintenance are often poor and traffic accidents are a regular occurrence in Ethiopia, especially in Addis Ababa and on the Addis Ababa-Djibouti road. In Addis Ababa, it is advised to use either the metered yellow taxis or app based companies as they offer greater accountability and generally have higher standards of maintenance than the blue and white taxis. The quality of driving and vehicle condition can vary greatly.
Under Ethiopian law, drivers involved in car accidents can face severe punishments, including custodial sentences and fines. You should be very careful when travelling by car. If you’re involved in a traffic accident you should remain in your vehicle and call the local police. You should avoid confrontation and await their arrival to resolve the matter.
In the past some localised demonstrations have led to temporary closures of roads or the targeting of public transport. However, not all reports on social media channels of such disruptions are accurate. If you’re unsure, you should contact local authorities or reputable tour operators in the areas you’re travelling to.
If you encounter a roadblock you should follow the advice of local authorities at the road block if they are present. If you encounter an unattended roadblock, turn around and don’t attempt to pass it.
When travelling outside Addis Ababa, you should avoid driving after dark in rural areas: vehicles often have no lights and livestock may be roaming on the roads. There have been instances where buses from one region have been attacked when passing through another. Medical facilities outside the capital are extremely limited so carry a comprehensive medical pack. You should also consider communications – whilst mobile telephone services are increasingly widespread, connectivity cannot be guaranteed, and there have been multiple examples of mobile internet being closed down with no notice. You may wish to consider travelling in a party and leaving details of your travel itinerary with a reliable person.
Local travel
The Government of Ethiopia and the Tigray People’s Liberation Front signed a peace agreement to cease hostilities in Tigray on 02 November 2022. Implementation of disarmament and reconstruction measures have begun. The situation in Tigray continues to be fragile and the possibility of isolated armed incidents remains.
See Summary and Addis Ababa.
There are frequent incidences of civil unrest in Ethiopia, including protests and strikes. Some of these can cause temporary closure of roads or disruption to local business and transport, and in the past some have escalated into serious violence. Internet and mobile networks may be closed or disrupted during civil unrest. These incidents are often limited in duration and localised. Where they occur, we advise reconsidering any travel plans to the specified area and not to travel until the situation has calmed. This travel advice will flag incidents of concern, where British Embassy staff have received specific advice, but as unrest can occur with little or no notice you are also advised to monitor local news and reconsider travel plans to areas where disturbances are reported. If you’re unsure, contact local authorities or reputable tour operators in the areas you’re travelling to.
Addis Ababa
Travelers, particularly those of Tigrayan or Oromo ethnicity, may face increased scrutiny, although this could affect all people, including at the airport and through direct police operations. There are reports that ethnic Tigrayans have been prevented from boarding flights at Bole International Airport. You should comply with the law, including on carrying ID cards, possession of foreign currency and possession of weapons. You should avoid confrontation and follow the instructions of the authorities.
You should be alert to petty theft around Bole Addis Ababa International Airport, particularly pickpockets and bag snatches. When in or around the airport, keep valuables secure and out of sight. Only use buses or taxis from the airport that have been organised by your hotel or travel company, or choose yellow or app based taxis rather than the blue and white ones.
There has been an increase in the level of reported crime against both expats and Ethiopian nationals in the Bole Medhanealem, Bole Atlas, Meskel Square, Yeka Hills and Entoto areas of Addis Ababa. These have included robberies at knife point and the choking unconscious of victims by their attackers. Don’t travel alone in these areas if possible. You should exercise caution if travelling on foot, and consider using road transportation where possible, both during the daytime and especially after dark. If threatened, hand over your valuables without resistance.
Afar Region
The FCDO advises against all travel to all areas within 100km of the border with Tigray regional state to the north of Anseba town in Afar, and all areas within 30km of the border with Tigray regional state to the south of Anseba town. The FCDO advises against all travel to within 10km of the border with Eritrea in Afar regional state.
There are serious tensions between Tigray and Afar Region, with a build-up of armed forces in the west of Afar Region.

If you encounter an unattended roadblock, turn around and don’t attempt to pass it.
If you’re planning to visit the Danakil desert area, you should be aware of the risk of excessive heat and the difficult terrain in some areas, notably around the volcano of Erta Ale. Facilities are basic in Danakil; there is no running water and medical options are very limited.
Tourism in the area has previously been targeted by armed groups in 2007, 2012 and 2017. You should only travel to this area with a recognised tour company and when booking check that your group will be supported by an armed police or military escort.
Amhara Region
The FCDO advises against all travel to areas within 30km of the border with Tigray regional state and within 20km of the border with Sudan.
There have been reports of incidents along the Addis Ababa – Bahir Dar road, including those of armed men attacking vehicles. These usually take place in the early hours when there is poor visibility. You should exercise additional caution and avoid traveling in the dark or when visibility is poor.
There are serious tensions between Tigray and Amhara regions, with a build-up of armed forces across parts of northern and north western Amhara region, particularly in the Tigray-Amhara border areas. Some flights across northern Ethiopia remain suspended. Domestic and international land borders may be closed. Mobile networks and internet connections may be disrupted. You should monitor local media for further information and comply with local authority instructions.
There have been a number of sporadic, violent clashes between armed groups within Amhara region and in areas bordering Oromia region, including in urban centres. As these are not contained to specific areas in Amhara region, you should exercise caution when traveling throughout Amhara region, and be aware that situations have potential to escalate quickly.
Political disputes in the woredas (districts) of Tsegede, Mirab Armacho and Tach Armacho have in the past turned violent. Violent clashes have previously occurred around Chilga Woreda, Central Gondar Zone, with reports of fatalities, including civilians. While attacks are mostly related to inter-ethnic disputes and foreigners have not been targeted, attacks can occur at any time with significant risk of being caught up in violence. If you’re travelling in the area, monitor local media and follow the advice of local authorities and your tour operator.
There has been an increase in roadblocks across Amhara region. If you encounter a roadblock you should follow the advice of local authorities at the roadblock if they are present. If you encounter an unattended roadblock, turn around and don’t attempt to pass it.
Gambella Region
The FCDO advises against all travel to the Gambella Region.
Incidents of large-scale violence, inter-communal clashes and armed attacks occur regularly in the Gambella region, with heavy fire reported on 14 June. While foreigners have not been targeted, there’s a significant risk of being caught up in violence.

There have been reports of attacks on vehicles travelling on the A1 road, between Adama and Awash, though not targeting international travellers. There have been reports during late October of air strikes against armed groups in the West Shewa area. These could take place in a range of locations without prior notice. Extreme caution should be exercised when travelling in the West Shewa zone, in particular in rural areas.
There continue to be increased tensions and violence between armed groups and the security forces across Oromia region, particularly Shewa, Haraghe and Guji zones. You should avoid military, police and security installations, exercise extreme caution and follow the advice of local authorities.
Since the beginning of November 2022, there has been an marked increase in incidents between armed groups in Oromia region, including the Oromo Liberation Army, the regional government-led Oromo Special Forces and informal Amhara militias. These have primarily been reported in rural areas of Oromia region and areas bordering Amhara region. As these are not contained to specific areas in Oromia region, you should exercise caution when traveling, particularly between urban centres, and be aware that situations have potential to escalate quickly.
There is a threat of kidnapping in western areas of Oromia region, particularly West Wollega, East Wollega and Qellem Wollega Zones. Recent kidnaps have targeted the mining industry. British Nationals working in the area should avoid regular patterns of travel or movement, and aim to only travel during daylight hours.
There has been an increase in roadblocks across the Oromia region recently. If you encounter a roadblock you should follow the advice of local authorities at the roadblock if they are present. If you encounter an unattended roadblock, turn around and don’t attempt to pass it.
