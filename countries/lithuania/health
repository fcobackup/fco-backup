At least 8 weeks before your trip, check the latest country-specific health advice from the National Travel Health Network and Centre (NaTHNaC) on the TravelHealthPro website. Each country-specific page has information on vaccine recommendations, any current health risks or outbreaks, and factsheets with information on staying healthy abroad. Guidance is also available from NHS (Scotland) on the FitForTravel website.
General information on travel vaccinations and a travel health checklist is available on the NHS website. You may then wish to contact your health adviser or pharmacy for advice on other preventive measures and managing any pre-existing medical conditions while you’re abroad.
The legal status and regulation of some medicines prescribed or purchased in the UK can be different in other countries. If you’re travelling with prescription or over-the-counter medicine, read this guidance from NaTHNaC on best practice when travelling with medicines. For further information on the legal status of a specific medicine, you’ll need to contact the embassy, high commission or consulate of the country or territory you’re travelling to.
While travel can be enjoyable, it can sometimes be challenging. There are clear links between mental and physical health, so looking after yourself during travel and when abroad is important. Information on travelling with mental health conditions is available in our guidance page. Further information is also available from the National Travel Health Network and Centre (NaTHNaC).
Coronavirus
The Lithuanian authorities have introduced a number of precautionary measures in response to the coronavirus (COVID-19) pandemic. The Lithuanian authorities have introduced a number of measures to limit the spread of the virus:
• We advise against all but essential travel to Lithuania.
• The Lithuanian authorities are introducing border controls at all Schengen borders from midnight on 15 March effective for ten days. This includes land borders with Poland and Latvia and arrivals by air from Schengen countries. Some routes will be limited – there will only be one open land border with Poland, via the Kalvariu Road.
• We recommend that UK nationals who live in Lithuania should carry their residence document or student enrolment confirmation or work contract.
• Individuals arriving from China, South Korea, Singapore, Japan, Italy, Iran, France, Germany, Spain and Hong Kong must complete an online questionnaire and self-isolate for 14 days.
• From 13 March, all flights from Lithuania to Italy were suspended. From 16 March, all flights from Italy to Lithuania will be suspended.
• You should comply with any additional screening measures put in place by the authorities
• Keep up to date with information from your tour operator, transport or accommodation provider on the impact on any existing travel plans
• If you need further information about entry requirements, contact the local immigration authorities or the nearest Lithuanian embassy/consulate. You should also check with your airline or travel company for the latest information
Further information on coronavirus, including advice on preparing for foreign travel and helping reduce the spread of the virus, is available from Public Health England and on the TravelHealthPro website
Healthcare
The rules on access to healthcare will stay the same until 31 December 2020.
You should get a free European Health Insurance Card (EHIC) before leaving the UK. After 31 December 2020, your UK-issued EHIC might not be valid.
The EHIC entitles you to state provided medical treatment that may become necessary during your trip. Any treatment provided is on the same terms as Lithuanian nationals. If you don’t have your EHIC with you or you’ve lost it, you can call the Department of Health Overseas Healthcare Team (+44 191 218 1999) to get a Provisional Replacement Certificate.
It is important to take out comprehensive travel insurance that includes cover for emergency medical treatment and associated costs. The existing EHIC arrangements are not an alternative to travel insurance, as some health-related costs, including for medical repatriation, ongoing medical treatment and non-urgent treatment, are not covered. Read more about what your travel insurance should cover.
If you’re living in Lithuania, you can also find more information on healthcare for residents in our Living In Lithuania guide.
If you need emergency medical assistance during your trip, dial 112 and ask for an ambulance. If you are referred to a medical facility for treatment you should contact your insurance/medical assistance company immediately.
