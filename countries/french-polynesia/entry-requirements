The information on this page covers the most common types of travel and reflects the UK government’s understanding of the rules currently in place. Unless otherwise stated, this information is for travellers using a full ‘British Citizen’ passport.
The authorities in the country or territory you’re travelling to are responsible for setting and enforcing the rules for entry. If you’re unclear about any aspect of the entry requirements, or you need further reassurance, you’ll need to contact the embassy, high commission or consulate of the country or territory you’re travelling to.
You should also consider checking with your transport provider or travel company to make sure your passport and other travel documents meet their requirements.
Entry rules in response to coronavirus (COVID-19)
Current measures include a requirement for all travellers to undertake a test for COVID-19 within 72 hours before departure and to show proof of a negative result when embarking. Further details are available on the website of the French High Commission.
Travellers will also need to register on the French Polynesian Electronic Travel Information System (ETIS) and provide the receipt at check-in. Minors travelling with their parents can be included on their ETIS form.
If travelling from France, travellers will also need to produce an international travel certificate to be completed in order to travel to French Polynesia. Further information is available here.
Airlines may refuse boarding to anyone who does not produce both proof of a negative result and the self-certified document. If travelling via France, you should also check our Travel Advice for France.
Further details are available on the website of the French High Commission.
These entry requirements are subject to change. For further information on the entry restrictions in place for French Overseas Territories, please see the French government’s website before travelling.
Regular entry requirements
Visas
French Polynesia is an Overseas Collective (collectivité d’outre-mer) of France.
If you hold a British Citizen passport, you don’t need a visa to enter French Polynesia for stays of up to three months. Other British passport holders, and those who plan to stay longer than three months, should check the current entry requirements on the website of the French Ministry of Foreign Affairs and, if necessary, confirm with the nearest French Diplomatic mission.
Passport validity
UK residents in French Polynesia
If you live in French Polynesia, you should carry your residence document, as well as your valid passport when you travel. If you have applied but not yet received your document, carry your certificate of application. You will have received this as an email. If you have not yet applied for a residence document, you should carry evidence that you are resident in French Polynesia. This could include a tenancy agreement or a utility bill in your name, dating from 2020. For more information, including on how to apply for a residence document, see the French government’s website.
