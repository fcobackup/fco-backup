These regulations have imposed restrictions on movement across international borders and within the country.
Wearing of masks is compulsory in all public spaces including public transport, on the roadside and in markets.
Gatherings of more than 20 people are banned.
You should continue to comply with any additional measures put in place by the local authorities.

The government of Mozambique is only allowing Mozambican citizens or foreign residents to enter the country until further notice. Those permitted to enter who have come from countries with active transmission, including the UK, are required to self-isolate on arrival for 14 days.
Many airlines are suspending flights and many airports are closing, preventing flights from leaving. No cruise ships carrying passengers will be able to dock.
The government has suspended the issuing of entry visas. Overseas nationals remaining in Mozambique have had their visas extended by Presidential decree until 30 June without the need to re-apply.
You should comply with any additional screening measures put in place by the authorities.
Many of Mozambique’s neighbouring countries, including South Africa, have closed their borders or put in place other travel restrictions. Check FCO Travel Advice for South Africa or other affected countries before planning onward travel from Mozambique.
