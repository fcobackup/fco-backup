There are currently very limited commercial options available to return to the UK from Pakistan. The Government has suspended normal scheduled international flights to and from Pakistan until at least 21 April.
We know this is concerning for British people trying to leave Pakistan. The UK government is working closely with airlines, the Pakistan authorities and other governments to make sure options are available for you to return to the UK as soon as possible.
UK special charter flights
From 21 April, the UK will operate a series of special charter flights from Islamabad and Lahore for British nationals who normally live in the UK and their direct dependants to return to the UK. This includes British nationals holding a National Identity Card for Overseas Pakistanis. Priority will be given to vulnerable British nationals, including the elderly and those with health conditions.
This round of chartered flights will include three direct flights from Islamabad to Heathrow, four direct flights from Islamabad to Manchester, two direct flights from Lahore to Heathrow, and one direct flight from Lahore to Manchester.
British nationals on short-term visits to Pakistan should take the earliest available opportunity to return to the UK by visiting the booking portal and completing the online form.
We are assessing demand from British nationals for flights from Karachi. If you are a British national who normally lives in the UK and are looking to return from Karachi to UK, please let us know by filling in the form here.

Travel to the airport
You will need to arrange your own travel to the airport.
Due to government restrictions there are limited public transport options, and the authorities have discouraged all non-essential use of public transport. British nationals travelling to Islamabad or Lahore Airport are advised to carry hard copies of their flight confirmation and have their passports easily to hand.
We have secured assurances from provincial and federal authorities that, if you have a confirmed flight ticket and valid travel document, you will be able to travel to the airport. If you are not allowed to travel across a checkpoint, please call us on 051 201 2000. If you have been placed into a quarantine centre, or you are in an area that has been quarantined by the authorities, you may have to wait until the quarantine is lifted before being able to travel to the airport. Follow the advice of the relevant local authorities.
Some provinces have limited the number of people that can be in a vehicle. In addition, people who do not have a flight ticket, except the driver, may not be allowed to accompany travellers to the airport.
You are strongly advised not to travel to the airport if you are displaying any COVID-19 symptoms, including a high-temperature. You will not be able to travel if you are currently exhibiting coronavirus symptoms. You will be thermal scanned by the Pakistani authorities when you enter the airport. If you are displaying a high temperature or other COVID-19 symptoms, you will not be permitted to fly. The Pakistan Government are likely to take you to a quarantine facility, where you will be tested after 48 hours. Those testing positive will likely be moved to a hospital isolation facility, while those testing negative will be released with instructions to self-isolate for a period of time determined by relevant authorities.
Travellers will be expected to wear a face mask in the airport and will need to bring their own face mask with them for this purpose.
Those travelling on the specially arranged charter flights should attend at the airport at least 4 hours before the flight is due to depart. It will be a requirement for travellers to wear a face mask at the airport and they will need to bring their own masks with them for this purpose – they will not be provided by the airline or the airport authorities.
