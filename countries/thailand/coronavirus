Travel in Thailand
Domestic travel options within Thailand are available but remain subject to disease control measures. These may include restrictions on movement between provinces. If you are taking an internal flight in Thailand, you may be asked to download an app or complete additional travel documentation.
You will be required to wear a face mask and follow other disease control measures when using public transport, including planes, trains, buses and taxis.
Until further notice you must also wear a mask in all indoor and outdoor public spaces in Thailand. If you do not wear a mask you may have to pay a fine.
COVID-related restrictions in Thailand
An emergency decree is currently in place. This includes instructions that you must not:
enter high risk areas
hoard essential goods
attend public gatherings
propagate false information
The Thai government also advises that you should avoid unnecessary travel and crowded places, and scan the ‘Thai Chana’ QR code where available.
A number of disease control measures at national and local levels are also in place. These include a colour rating for each of Thailand’s 76 provinces based on the number of COVID-19 cases. Restrictions in each province and for movement between provinces depend on the colour rating and any additional local rules, and they may change at any time. In some provinces these measures may include restrictions on dining in restaurants, gathering in large groups and leaving the province. You are advised to strictly follow preventative and disease control measures to minimise risks. You should check with local authorities and the Thai government’s PR website and Facebook page on the control measures where you are.
In areas designated as dark-red zones there is increasing pressure on medical services and British Nationals may find it difficult to access COVID-19 testing and medical care.
Accommodation
Hotel and private rental accommodation is available throughout Thailand. However, some hotels remain closed so we advise you to contact hotels directly when booking.
The majority of hotels will ask to take your temperature on arrival and ask you to provide information on your recent travel history and any symptoms you may have related to COVID-19. You may also need to follow other disease control measures.
Some services and facilities in hotels may not be available e.g. leisure facilities.
Health

If you think you have COVID-19 symptoms, you should call the Thai COVID-19 Hotline on 1422.
If you need a COVID-19 test, Thailand’s Ministry of Public Health has compiled a list of private and government-managed testing facilities. You should contact the Ministry for further information.
If you test positive for COVID-19, Thai public health regulations require that you quarantine at either a hospital, hospitel (a repurposed hotel with medical capabilities) or field hospital, depending on the severity of your symptoms. This includes anyone who is asymptomatic.
There may also be specific measures in place that impact on maternity services in some hospitals, including quarantine for newborn babies and C-sections as the preferred form of delivery. In most cases, these are recommendations only but in some hospitals they are mandatory. You should ensure you understand your health care provider’s policies so you can make the choices that work best for you. The WHO has useful guidance on COVID and maternity / post-natal care.
Your emotional and mental wellbeing is important. Read guidance on how to look after your mental wellbeing and mental health.

COVID-19 vaccines if you live in Thailand
Wherever possible British nationals should aim to be vaccinated in the country where they live. As further information is available about the national vaccination programme, this page will be updated. Sign up to get email notifications.
A nationwide rollout of vaccines for all residents of Thailand, including foreigners, has now begun. The Ministry of Public Health has confirmed that you can register for a vaccine at any hospital that holds your health records. Registration online and at hospitals that do not hold your records may also be possible. Short and longer-term visitors may not be eligible under this scheme.
You should contact your local health provider and provincial authority for more information. You can also register with the Embassy to receive updates about the vaccination programme by sending a message to Bangkok.DocumentaryServices@fcdo.gov.uk.
The Medicines and Healthcare Products Regulatory Agency (MHRA) is the UK authority responsible for assessing the safety, quality and efficacy of vaccines. It has authorised the Pfizer/BioNTech, Oxford/AstraZeneca and Moderna vaccines for temporary supply and use in the UK. Find out more about MHRA approval for these vaccines.
You can find out more about COVID-19 vaccines on the World Health Organization COVID-19 vaccines page. This list of Stringent Regulatory Authorities recognised by the World Health Organisation may also be a useful source of additional information.
