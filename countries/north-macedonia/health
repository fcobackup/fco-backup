At least 8 weeks before your trip, check the latest country-specific health advice from the National Travel Health Network and Centre (NaTHNaC) on the TravelHealthPro website. Each country-specific page has information on vaccine recommendations, any current health risks or outbreaks, and factsheets with information on staying healthy abroad. Guidance is also available from NHS (Scotland) on the FitForTravel website.
General information on travel vaccinations and a travel health checklist is available on the NHS website. You may then wish to contact your health adviser or pharmacy for advice on other preventive measures and managing any pre-existing medical conditions while you’re abroad.
The legal status and regulation of some medicines prescribed or purchased in the UK can be different in other countries. If you’re travelling with prescription or over-the-counter medicine, read this guidance from NaTHNaC on best practice when travelling with medicines. For further information on the legal status of a specific medicine, you’ll need to contact the embassy, high commission or consulate of the country or territory you’re travelling to.
While travel can be enjoyable, it can sometimes be challenging. There are clear links between mental and physical health, so looking after yourself during travel and when abroad is important. Information on travelling with mental health conditions is available in our guidance page. Further information is also available from the National Travel Health Network and Centre (NaTHNaC).
Coronavirus
The Macedonian authorities have introduced measures in response to the coronavirus (COVID-19) pandemic. You should comply with any additional screening measures put in place by the authorities.
On 18 March, the President of North Macedonia declared a State of emergency for the whole territory of North Macedonia for a period of 30 days. There are currently no additional restrictions to movement within the country.
All border crossings in North Macedonia are now closed for foreign citizens except for freight vehicles, diplomatic corps, foreigners with long-term stay permit and their family members, and others with special permission from the Ministry of Interior (MoI).
Skopje International Airport is closed for air traffic until further notice except for state, military, medical and emergency flights. St. Paul the Apostle Airport in Ohrid is also closed.
Travellers returning to North Macedonia from COVID-19 affected areas, regardless of their residence status, are subject to mandatory 14-day self-isolation and should follow the standard procedure if symptoms occur.
On 13 March 2020, the Government of North Macedonia introduced restrictions on entry and exit to the municipalities of Debar and Centar Zhupa.
Restaurants, cafés, bars and shopping malls are closed to the public, but grocery stores are permitted to open. Please follow any measures put in place by the authorities.
The Ministry of Health also advises if you are a British National in North Macedonia and develop any symptoms of COVID-19, please consider them urgent and call +389 78 387 194 or +389 2 15 123.
Keep up to date with information from your tour operator, transport or accommodation provider on the impact on any existing travel plans.
Further information on coronavirus, including advice on preparing for foreign travel and helping reduce the spread of the virus, is available from Public Health England and on the TravelHealthPro website.
Medical treatment
There is a reciprocal healthcare agreement for British nationals, which entitles you to free emergency treatment in North Macedonia. You will need to present your British passport as proof of entitlement. If you’re resident in the UK but are not a British national, you will need to present a certificate of insurance from HM Revenue & Customs. The health system in all parts of North Macedonia is suffering from widespread shortage of medicines and other essentials and you may need to pay some of the initial costs (usually between 50 and 100 Euros). If the treatment is not deemed an emergency, you will have to pay the full cost yourself. Make sure you have adequate travel and medical insurance.
Health risks
Mosquito-borne diseases including West Nile virus are present in North Macedonia.
High levels of air pollution in cities, especially in winter, can affect public health. Children, the elderly and those with pre-existing medical conditions may be especially affected. You can find further information and advice on air quality on the World Health Organization (WHO) website. Keep up to date with local information and seek medical advice on appropriate precautions.
