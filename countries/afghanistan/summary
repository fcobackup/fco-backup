The Foreign, Commonwealth & Development Office (FCDO) advise against all travel to Afghanistan. You should not travel to Afghanistan
Commercial flights are not currently operating. We are contacting British nationals, who have registered their details with us, with information about flights departing Kabul for the UK. If you can leave Afghanistan safely by other means, you should do so immediately.
If you need assistance, you should call +44 (0)1908 516666 and select the option “Consular services for British nationals”.
We have suspended all non-essential operations at the British Embassy in Kabul in response to the deterioration in the security situation. The Embassy has relocated. The FCDO is only providing consular assistance remotely and is extremely limited.
Travel by road throughout the country is extremely dangerous. There have been allegations of people being mistreated on their way to Kabul International Airport.
If you are a vulnerable non-British national in Afghanistan and need assistance, view our Afghanistan support page. This sets out the prioritised groups that we are seeking to assist, provides contact information and explains what details you will be asked to provide. You should call +44 (0)2475 389980. The number is available 24/7.
