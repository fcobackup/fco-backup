Before you travel, check the ‘Entry requirements’ section for Democratic Republic of the Congo’s current entry restrictions and requirements. These may change with little warning. Monitor this advice for the latest updates and stay in contact with your travel provider.
If you plan to pass through another country to return to the UK, check the travel advice for the country you’re transiting.
It is more important than ever to get travel insurance and check it provides sufficient cover. See the FCDO’s guidance on foreign travel insurance.
DRC held Presidential, Parliamentary, provincial and some local elections on 20 December 2023. There is an increased likelihood of protests and demonstrations nationwide but particularly in Kinshasa and other major population centres. See Protests and demonstrations.
In the period following the elections until the President’s inauguration scheduled for 20 January 2024, there is a higher risk of civil unrest and disruption to services including internet connectivity. These risks apply even in areas of the country in which elections are not able to take place. If there are widespread disturbances or the security situation deteriorates, there may be limits to the assistance that the British Embassy Kinshasa can provide. Be prepared to shelter in place for several days, if the security situation requires it. This means having enough essential supplies, such as food, water and medicine, at the place where you are staying. Do not rely on the FCDO being able to evacuate you in an emergency.
The security situation in eastern DRC remains unstable. There are continued reports of several towns in eastern DRC being attacked by or falling under temporary control of armed groups, including some territories and villages within a 30km range north of Goma. Armed groups are present and intercommunal violence can affect the political, security and humanitarian situation. You should be prepared to leave at short notice via available routes. Travellers should regularly check government advice for updates. See Safety and security.
There were calls for protests against the UN peacekeeping mission known as the United Nations Organization Stabilization Mission in the Democratic Republic of the Congo (MONUSCO) in Goma on 13 September. Similar calls cannot be ruled out. Remain vigilant and stay away from demonstrations, protests or disturbances. See Protests and demonstrations.
After heavy rains on 3 May 2023, flooding and landslides have affected several territories in South Kivu Province, eastern DRC. At least 400 people are known to have died. There is potential for further floods and landslides during the rainy season. See Natural disasters and Safety and security
In eastern DRC there are continued reports of attacks and kidnappings. See Safety and security
Inter-communal violence between ethnic groups over land in Kwamouth territory of Mai-Ndombe province has been ongoing since August 2022. See Inter-communal violence
On 22 May 2021, Mount Nyiragongo volcano, close to the city of Goma, and near the border with Rwanda erupted. Further volcanic activity is possible in future. See Natural disasters
Consular support is severely limited in parts of DRC. The lack of infrastructure throughout the country and insecurity in eastern DRC often prevent the British Embassy in Kinshasa from being able to extend normal levels of consular assistance to British nationals anywhere in the DRC other than Kinshasa. You should not assume that the FCDO will be able to provide assistance to leave the country in the event of serious unrest or crisis.
Street crime and robbery is common. You should avoid using any taxis in DRC. If you must take a taxi, use a privately booked one. Don’t hail taxis in the street. Beware of gangs promising you cut price gold and diamonds. See Crime
Terrorists are very likely to try to carry out attacks in the DRC. Attacks could be indiscriminate. You should be vigilant, especially in places visited by foreigners. See Terrorism
If you’re abroad and you need emergency help from the UK government, contact the nearest British embassy, consulate or high commission.
