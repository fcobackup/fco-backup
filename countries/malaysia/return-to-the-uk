There remain commercial options to leave Malaysia.
If you live in the UK and are currently travelling in Malaysia, you are strongly advised to return home now. Don’t run the risk of getting stranded.
UK special charter flights will only operate for priority countries where commercial flights are not possible. You should not assume that these flights will become available in countries where commercial routes are operating. Please do not contact the contracted travel management company if no flight is advertised here.
There are no immigration restrictions preventing foreign nationals leaving Malaysia.
Flights
Qatar Airways is operating 3 scheduled flights from Kuala Lumpur to the UK via Doha each week. Malaysia Airlines is also operating a limited number of direct flights to London in June. If you do not have any onward travel booked, you should urgently do so by contacting the following:
Qatar Airways on +974 4023 0000 or +974 4023 0090
Malaysia Airlines on +60 3 7843 3000
Other airlines may resume flights as quarantine and other restrictions are lifted, however all future schedules are liable to change at short notice. If you live in the UK, you are strongly advised to take the earliest possible flight.
Some airlines require passengers to bring their own face mask to be worn in the airport and throughout the flight. Check with your airline. If you do not have a face mask, you may not be allowed to fly.
You will need to pay for your return travel to the UK. If departure options are available but you cannot afford the travel costs and have exhausted all other options for getting funds, you may be eligible to apply for an emergency loan from the government. This is a last resort option and you would need to repay the loan when you are back in the UK. For more information, you should contact Corporate Travel Management (CTM). CTM are a commercial partner of the FCO and are authorised to administer such loans on behalf of the FCO.
Travelling to your international airport
Domestic flights
Limited internal flights to Kuala Lumpur International Airport (KLIA) continue to operate for essential travel. If you are unable to secure a flight to KLIA, you can fly to Sultan Abdul Aziz Shah Airport (also known as Subang Airport) and travel by taxi to KLIA (60km).
If you’re looking to travel by air domestically within Malaysia (including from Sabah or Sarawak) in order to use KLIA to transit onwards to the UK, you’re advised to check with your airline and choose a route which enables travel from Malaysia to the UK on one ticket. This allows direct transit to the international flight at KLIA. Check that your luggage can be checked through to your final destination from the starting point of your journey. You will only be allowed to board a flight to KLIA within Malaysia if it is linked to an onward international flight.
Travel overland
If you are currently in the Kuala Lumpur area, you can get to the airport by taxi. The KLIA express train from Sentral station is operating a limited service. A bus service does operate from Sentral, but infrequently.
Your journey home: re-entering the UK
When you return, you must follow the rules for entering the UK. You:
need to provide your journey and contact details up to 48 hours before you’re due to arrive in the UK
are not allowed to leave the place you’re staying for the first 14 days you’re in the UK except in very limited situations (known as ‘self-isolating’)
See also the list of people who are exempt from the border rules.
The National Travel Health Network and Centre (NaTHNaC) also provides advice on how to stay safe as you travel by air.
Transit via Malaysia
If you are currently in another country in the region and travelling through Kuala Lumpur International Airport (KLIA) as part of a route back to the UK, you will be permitted to transit through KLIA.
You will not be able to enter Malaysia to stay in a hotel or travel to any other airport (including KLIA2, the low-cost airline airport) unless you meet the strict immigration criteria.
If you cannot leave Malaysia at this time
See advice on staying in Malaysia during coronavirus.
Residents
If you currently live in Malaysia and are considering travelling to the UK, you should carefully consider your personal circumstances and the fast-moving situation. Remaining is likely to be the best option for many residents. You will not currently be permitted to re-enter Malaysia while the Recovery Movement Control Order remains in place, unless you meet the strict immigration criteria. For information on the criteria, see Staying during coronavirus
