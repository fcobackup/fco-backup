Warning
FCDO advises against all travel to Belarus.

This information is for people travelling on a full ‘British citizen’ passport from the UK who choose to travel against FCDO advice. It is based on the UK government’s understanding of the current rules for the most common types of travel.
The authorities in Belarus set and enforce entry rules. If you’re not sure how Belarus’s entry requirements apply to you, contact the Embassy of Belarus in the UK.
 COVID-19 rules
There are no COVID-19 testing or vaccination requirements for travellers entering Belarus.  
Passport validity requirements
To visit Belarus, your passport must be valid for at least 3 months from the date you arrive.
Check with your travel provider to make sure your passport and other travel documents meet their requirements. Renew your passport if you need to.
Children of Belarusian passport holders
Children aged 15 and under who do not have a Belarusian passport but have a parent who does, must have a travel certificate issued by a Belarusian embassy or consulate to enter Belarus. Parents of children entering on this document should contact the State Border Committee, Ministry of Interior and Ministry of Foreign Affairs to make sure their children also have the relevant documentation to exit Belarus.
Visa requirements    
The Belarusian authorities have announced that from 19 July 2024 until 31 December 2024 all British nationals (except those entering on a diplomatic or official passport) can enter Belarus for up to 30 days without a visa, limited to a total of 90 days per calendar year.
If you want to stay longer than 30 days during a visit, or for a total period exceeding 90 days per calendar year, you must have a visa. You can find more information from the Embassy of Belarus in the UK.
If you’re travelling directly from or to Russia, the visa-free arrangement does not apply and you must have a visa. You can find more information from the Embassy of Belarus in the UK.
Visas for travelling through Belarus
You do not need a visa to transit Belarus by air, but the maximum period you can remain airside (in the airport without going through border control) is 24 hours.
Travelling by air between Belarus and Russia
FCDO is not aware of any difficulties for British nationals travelling by air between Belarus and Russia. However, make sure you get an exit stamp in your passport when you leave Belarus. If you have no stamp, you will not be allowed back in on your next visit.
Land borders
The land borders with Ukraine and Russia are currently closed to British nationals. Other land borders have restrictions. See Safety and security.
Vaccine requirements
For details about medical entry requirements and recommended vaccinations, see TravelHealthPro’s Belarus guide.
Insurance requirements
When you apply for your visa or when you arrive in Belarus, you will need to show both:
documentary evidence of medical insurance to the value of 10,000 euros
funds equivalent to 25 euros per day
This can be in the form of cash, credit card or travellers cheques in any currency. Contact the Embassy of Belarus for full details.
Journalists
If you plan to work as a journalist in Belarus, you must get accreditation from the Ministry of Foreign Affairs of Belarus before you travel.
Registering with the authorities
Accommodation providers must register any foreign guests staying for more than 10 days in Belarus. Registration will normally be arranged by your hotel. If you’re staying with someone, check that they’re doing this. You can register with the authorities online (this page may not be accessible from all countries) or with the local police office (OVIR) in the district where you’re staying. There are fines for not registering in time. See the Ministry of Foreign Affairs website for more details.
Customs rules
If you are carrying cash or travellers cheques worth more than 10,000 US dollars, you must complete a currency declaration form and get it stamped by a customs officer.
You are not allowed to take more currency out of Belarus than you declared when you arrived. Keep your entry declaration form for the duration of your visit. When you leave Belarus, you must complete a new form and show the entry form. If you do not, you could be delayed and fined.
Importing goods for charitable purposes
If you want to import goods or services for charitable purposes, consult the Embassy of Belarus in the UK for advice about local procedures and tariffs. If you think your goods will be exempt from Belarusian taxation, get written confirmation from the embassy.
