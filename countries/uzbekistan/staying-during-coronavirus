This page gives you guidance on how to stay safely in Uzbekistan as a visitor, if you are unable to return to the UK.
Everyone should comply with the measures put in place in Uzbekistan to limit the spread of coronavirus (COVID-19).
Up-to-date statistics on coronavirus cases in Uzbekistan are available from a dedicated Uzbekistan Government website - coronavirus.uz (in Uzbek and Russian only).
Moving around in Uzbekistan
Under measures introduced by the Uzbek authorities, anyone subject to quarantine or self-isolation who breaches such controls is liable to a minimum fine of 11 Million UZS (approximately £900) or up to 10 years imprisonment.
From 23 March, you must wear a face mask while outside – you may be fined (up to approximately £100) if you do not comply with this regulation.
While infection rates have risen in major cities such as Tashkent and Samarkand, the Uzbek authorities have eased some restrictive measures. The country has now been divided into red, yellow and green zones, with different restrictions in each. However, lockdown measures have been extended until 1 August in all regions, independently of their colour code.
Restrictions and rules continue to apply, including maintaining physical distance, wearing masks, the prohibition of gatherings of more than three people and working from home for a number of institutions. In Yellow and Green zones entertainment venues remain closed with the exception of restaurants, cafes and gyms. Restrictions on use of public transport including taxis have been lifted in Green and Yellow zones although the metro remains closed. There are also restrictions on travel between regions which remains severely limited. Movement between Tashkent city and the Tashkent region is currently permitted.
These measures may be subject to change. Entry requirements may vary and further restrictions could be applied at short notice by the Uzbek authorities. See Entry requirements.

Finance
There is a range of financial support from the government that you can access while you are unable to return due to coronavirus restrictions.
If you’re in Uzbekistan, and have exhausted all other options to cover essential living costs while you wait to return home, you could apply for an emergency loan for your living costs from the UK government. You can only apply if you normally live in the UK and you cannot return home. This last-resort option is for those most in need, and you would need to repay the loan when you are back in the UK. Apply for an emergency loan.
