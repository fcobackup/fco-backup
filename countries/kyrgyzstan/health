Coronavirus (COVID-19)
Check the latest information on risk from COVID-19 for Kyrgyzstan on the TravelHealthPro website
See the healthcare information in the Coronavirus section for information on what to do if you think you have coronavirus while in Kyrgyzstan.
At least 8 weeks before your trip, check the latest country-specific health advice from the National Travel Health Network and Centre (NaTHNaC) on the TravelHealthPro website. Each country-specific page has information on vaccine recommendations, any current health risks or outbreaks, and factsheets with information on staying healthy abroad. Guidance is also available from NHS (Scotland) on the FitForTravel website.
General information on travel vaccinations and a travel health checklist is available on the NHS website. You may then wish to contact your health adviser or pharmacy for advice on other preventive measures and managing any pre-existing medical conditions while you’re abroad.
The legal status and regulation of some medicines prescribed or bought in the UK can be different in other countries. Most UK prescriptions are accepted in Kyrgyzstan but you should check in advance with individual pharmacies. If you’re travelling with prescription or over-the-counter medicine, read this guidance from NaTHNaC on best practice when travelling with medicines. For further information on the legal status of a specific medicine, you’ll need to contact the embassy, high commission or consulate of the country or territory you’re travelling to. Be aware that there is no ability to purchase Insulin in Kyrgyzstan as Insulin is given free of charge to Kyrgyz citizens. You will be able to get an appointment to see a doctor about diabetes, but it takes some time.
While travel can be enjoyable, it can sometimes be challenging. There are clear links between mental and physical health, so looking after yourself during travel and when abroad is important. Information on travelling with mental health conditions is available in our guidance page. Further information is also available from the National Travel Health Network and Centre (NaTHNaC).
Other health risks
There have been several cases of anthrax in Kyrgyzstan, mainly in the south of the country, due to insufficient measures to vaccinate animals.
Some travellers in mountainous areas have experienced problems with altitude sickness. Sunstroke and severe sunburn can also cause problems, especially in the mountains, where cooler temperatures can hide the intensity of the sun.
Local medical care
The reciprocal healthcare agreement between the UK and Kyrgyzstan terminated on 1 January 2016.
Medical facilities in Kyrgyzstan are not as developed as those in the UK. Make sure you have adequate travel health insurance and accessible funds to cover the cost of any medical treatment abroad and repatriation.
If you need emergency medical assistance during your trip, dial 103 and ask for an ambulance. You should contact your insurance/medical assistance company promptly if you’re referred to a medical facility for treatment.
Pharmacies and chemists are very widely available in Kyrgyzstan. They are often marked by a green cross. You may need to pay for medicine in cash. Basic medications (aspirin etc.) are available without a prescription. For prescription medication you will need to present a valid prescription either from a local doctor or your doctor in the UK. You should check with your pharmacy in Kyrgyzstan if they will accept a prescription from the UK. You may need to get your UK prescription translated into Russian or Kyrgyz.
Some prescription medicines used in the UK are not widely available in Kyrgyzstan. Your local Kyrgyz doctor or pharmacy is best placed to advise on availability of specific medications. Medications are often supplied under different brand names in Kyrgyzstan so it is important to ask for the generic name of the relevant drug. If your prescription medication is not available in Kyrgyzstan it may be possible to get supplies couriered from Russia and Turkey though this could take some time.
Foreign nationals may be able to buy into the Compulsory Medical Insurance Fund (CMIF) of Kyrgyzstan. Your nearest Family Medicine Centre or the territorial office of the CMIF can provide further information on this. All applicants will need to present a valid passport or ID card, complete an application and make a payment through a Quick Pay terminal. The CMIF policy entitles you to a basic package of medical services including certain types of blood tests and urine analysis, discount on medicines on an outpatient basis, and co-payment on some types of inpatient care. For additional information you can contact the CMIF hotline on 113.
