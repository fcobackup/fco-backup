Entry and borders
Borders have been closed with border controls introduced by the Polish government now extended until 3 May. International rail services and flights have been further suspended until 26 April. These measures may be extended.
It is not possible for non-Polish nationals to enter Poland unless they are:
Spouses and children or individuals under the permanent care of Polish nationals; or
Holders of a Pole’s Card; or
Individuals with the right to permanent or temporary stay in Poland or people with a work permit; or
Foreign nationals driving a means of transport used for transporting goods.
Anyone entitled to enter Poland will be required to self-isolate on arrival for 14 days (except commercial drivers entering Poland for a limited time for the sole purpose of transporting goods). They are required to download a special “Home Quarantine” app on their smartphone that allows the local authorities to provide information and stay in regular touch during their self-isolation and monitor adherence to the strict quarantine rules. They are also required to provide information on arrival about their place of stay or address and a telephone number with which they can be contacted regularly during their self-isolation.
Local measures
Most hotels and short term accommodation establishments closed to new guests from 2 April, with limited exceptions including for business travellers, quarantine cases and students in university accommodation. Where hotels remain open, guests who checked in on or before 31 March can continue their stay. Please consult your accommodation provider for more detailed information.
People are only allowed to leave home to go to work, shop for food or medicine, take exercise or to support the elderly and disabled. From 16 April, it is obligatory to cover nose and mouth when outside (with a mask or scarf).
Gatherings of more than two people are prohibited. When outside, people should keep a 2 metre distance from each other, apart from a parent with a child under 13 or a disabled person with a carer. Minors under the age of 13 are only allowed to leave home if accompanied by an adult. A limited number of people at any one time are allowed to attend religious services.
Beaches, zoos, parks and playgrounds are closed, as are cinemas, operas, theatres, museums and other cultural venues. From 20 April, National Forests and parks re-opened, though the nose and mouth covering and social distancing rules above apply to visitors.
Most shops have been closed but grocery shops, pharmacies and banks remain open. The number of customers at any one time has been restricted. Restaurants, pubs, clubs and casinos are closed but home delivery services are permitted.
Public transport use is limited to 50% of available seating to maintain appropriate distance between passengers.
There are fines of between £1000 - £6000 (5000 – 30000 PLN) for anyone found breaking these rules.
All schools and universities are closed until 26 April.
The above measures may be extended further, in scope and time, at short notice.
UK nationals living in Poland should note that the Office for Foreigners has put limitations on in-person appointments.
