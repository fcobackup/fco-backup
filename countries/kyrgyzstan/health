Before you travel check that:
your destination can provide the healthcare you may need
you have appropriate travel insurance for local treatment or unexpected medical evacuation
This is particularly important if you have a health condition or are pregnant.
Emergency medical number
Call 103 and ask for an ambulance.
Contact your insurance company promptly if you’re referred to a medical facility for treatment.
Vaccinations and health risks
At least 8 weeks before your trip check:

Medication
The legal status and regulation of some medicines prescribed or bought in the UK can be different in other countries.
Read best practice when travelling with medicines on TravelHealthPro.
The NHS has information on whether you can take your medicine abroad.
Basic medicines (such as aspirin) are available without a prescription. Most UK prescriptions are accepted in Kyrgyzstan, but you should phone a Kyrgyz pharmacy in advance to check. You may need to get your UK prescription translated into Russian or Kyrgyz. You can get a translation in Kyrgyzstan – find an interpreter or translator.
Some prescription medications are not widely available. Check on availability with a Kyrgyz doctor or pharmacy. Medications often come under different brand names, so ask for the drug’s generic name. If your medication is not available, you may be able to get it couriered from Russia or Turkey, though this could take time.
You may need to pay cash for medication.
Healthcare facilities in Kyrgyzstan
Medical facilities in Kyrgyzstan are not as developed as those in the UK. Make sure you have adequate travel health insurance and accessible funds to cover the cost of any medical treatment abroad and repatriation.
FCDO has a list of English-speaking doctors in Kyrgyzstan. 
COVID-19 healthcare in Kyrgyzstan
If you suspect you have COVID-19 symptoms, call Kyrgyzstan’s medical hotline (118, 112 or 103), or private medical services.
Private laboratories offer COVID-19 PCR and antibody tests for people who are not showing symptoms.
