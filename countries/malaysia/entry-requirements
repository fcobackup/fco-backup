Coronavirus guidance is being updated.
Read the Prime Minister’s address for the latest information.

The information on this page covers the most common types of travel and reflects the UK government’s understanding of the rules currently in place. Unless otherwise stated, this information is for travellers using a full ‘British Citizen’ passport.
The authorities in the country or territory you’re travelling to are responsible for setting and enforcing the rules for entry. If you’re unclear about any aspect of the entry requirements, or you need further reassurance, you’ll need to contact the embassy, high commission or consulate of the country or territory you’re travelling to.
You should also consider checking with your transport provider or travel company to make sure your passport and other travel documents meet their requirements.
Restrictions in response to coronavirus
Entry and borders
If you must travel to Malaysia for essential purposes, check the latest information with your airline and keep up to date with developments, including this travel advice. For information on the Movement Control Order you can contact the hotline of the National Operations Management Centre on +60388882010.
The government of Malaysia has introduced a Movement Control Order that restricts the entry of foreign nationals until 12 May 2020. Under the terms of that Order, no foreign nationals can enter Malaysia except those with diplomatic passports, those who have Permanent Residence or those who are an “expatriate in an essential service”.
If you or your dependents have other visas, including working visas or “Malaysia My Second Home” visas, these do not qualify for an exemption and you will not be permitted to enter.
The government has published further clarifications setting out some exceptions on immigration, including for foreign national spouses of Malaysian citizens. However, this information has not necessarily been reflected in all guidance and we are aware of reports that airlines are refusing to accept passengers who do not meet the headline requirements in the main Order.
Quarantine requirements
Anyone (including British nationals) entering the country under the immigration rules mentioned above will be obliged to enter quarantine for 14 days in centres designated by the government. You will be charged a minimum of RM150 (£30) each day you are in quarantine. If you have an onward domestic flight in peninsular Malaysia, you will undergo quarantine in Kuala Lumpur. Any onward flight to a regional airport will need to be booked at a later date.
If you are transiting via Kuala Lumpur International Airport (KLIA) to East Malaysia (Sabah or Sarawak), you must stay airside and connect to your onward flight. You will be placed in quarantine for 14 days on arrival in Sabah/Sarawak, and charged for each day you are there. Sabah and Sarawak have additional immigration rules in place. You will only be permitted to enter if you have permanent residence or an employment pass in the relevant state.
Transiting Malaysia
You can transit via Kuala Lumpur International Airport (KLIA) as long as you remain airside.
Transit that requires passage through immigration (to collect bags, or to move between the two Kuala Lumpur terminals - KLIA and KLIA2) is not possible, unless you meet the general immigration requirements above.
Regular entry requirements
Visas
British nationals don’t need a visa to visit Malaysia. You will normally be given permission to stay for 3 months on arrival. Visas for longer stays or for non-tourist purposes must be obtained from the nearest Malaysian diplomatic mission before you travel.
The Malaysian authorities are running a vigorous campaign against illegal immigration. Don’t overstay your visa, or violate the terms of entry. Even if you overstay for just a few days, you can be fined, detained, deported to the UK and blacklisted. Flight costs will be the responsibility of the individual.
If you’re travelling between Peninsular Malaysia and East Malaysia (sometimes known as Malaysian Borneo and comprising the states of Sabah and Sarawak) you will need to carry your passport. You must get an entry stamp in East Malaysia at your initial port of entry.
Regional travel
Recent changes to visa requirements for Thailand may affect travellers wishing to make regular crossings at land borders between Malaysia and Thailand. See Thailand Travel Advice for further information.
Passport validity
Your passport should be valid for a minimum period of 6 months from the date of entry into Malaysia.
Yellow fever certificate requirements
Check whether you need a yellow fever certificate by visiting the National Travel Health Network and Centre’s TravelHealthPro website.
UK Emergency Travel Documents
UK Emergency Travel Documents (ETDs) are accepted for exit from Malaysia. You’re likely to need to get a special exit pass from Malaysian Immigration before leaving and there will be a cost for this. If you plan to use an ETD to enter or transit through Malaysia, check entry requirements with the nearest Malaysian Embassy or High Commission before you travel.
Dual nationals
Malaysia doesn’t recognise dual nationality. Technically you can be refused entry if you are found to be holding two passports of different nationality.
Exchange control rules
You can import or export up to 10,000 Malaysian Ringgit without prior approval. There are no limits on the amount of foreign currency you can import or export, but you must declare any amount in excess of US$ 10,000. Penalties include a fine of up to RM 1 million and up to 3 years’ imprisonment. Further information can be found on the Royal Malaysian Customs Department website.
