You should carry a copy of your passport at all times and keep the original in a safe place.
Homosexuality is legal in Georgia, but not widely accepted in society. On 17 May 2013, a rally to mark the International Day Against Homophobia was interrupted by a large crowd of protestors in Tbilisi. Supporters of the Georgian Orthodox Church both physically and verbally attacked those present, and a number of people were injured. See our information and advice page for the LGBT community before you travel.
Don’t photograph sensitive sites like military bases and power installations. Be aware of cultural sensitivities when photographing churches and other religious sites. Some visitors have been prevented from photographing the Presidential Palace in Tbilisi. Always seek permission if in doubt.
Tbilisi is a cosmopolitan city, but more conservative attitudes exist in rural areas. You should dress and behave modestly in these areas and avoid open displays of affection
The government of Georgia does not recognise the unilateral declarations of independence by either South Ossetia or Abkhazia and, in accordance with international law, continues to claim the right to exercise sovereignty in the two territories. The UK government, along with those of all EU member states and the United States, recognise Georgia’s right to do so.
The government of Georgia has implemented legislation which requires those trading with Abkhazia and South Ossetia to hold a licence issued by the Georgian government. This includes buying and selling property and most financial transactions. Those who trade without licences may be open to penalties under Georgian civil and criminal law.
The ownership of many properties is disputed across both regions with many thousands of claims to ownership of properties from people displaced following recent conflicts. Purchase of these properties could have serious financial and legal implications, including legal proceedings in the courts of Georgia, as well as attempts to enforce judgements from these courts elsewhere in the EU. A future settlement to these territorial disputes could have consequences for property purchased in South Ossetia and Abkhazia, including possible restitution of the property to its original owners.
If you’re visiting Georgia for the purpose of commissioning surrogacy arrangements you should consider the potential risks and challenges involved in pursuing international surrogacy and seek specialist legal advice on Georgian and UK laws prior to making any arrangements. Surrogacy is complex and lengthy process. The British Embassy doesn’t have authority to be involved in surrogacy arrangements. The FCO and Home Office have produced guidance to help inform you on the issues you may face when embarking on a surrogacy arrangement. Commissioning a surrogacy won’t automatically mean that the child holds British citizenship.
Make sure you’re fully aware of the facts and are well prepared before starting the process. Research prospective surrogacy clinics and hospitals thoroughly to ensure you’re dealing with a safe and reputable organisation. The British Embassy can’t recommend specific hospitals or clinics.
If you wish to bring children born via surrogacy from Georgia to the UK you must apply for a full validity British passport, for which a Georgian birth certificate will be needed. You should check the Public Service Hall website and research the requirements which must be met to have a Georgian birth certificate issued and to leave the country with your child. The maximum period of visa-free stay allowed by the Georgian authorities is one year. Extensions of stay are unlikely to be granted.
For further detailed information about visa issues in Georgia, see the Ministry of Foreign Affairs of Georgia website.
