FCDO advises against all travel to parts of Turkey.

You should also read FCDO’s overall travel advice and regional risks advice.
Terrorism
There is a high threat of terrorist attack globally affecting UK interests and British nationals, including from groups and individuals who view the UK and British nationals as targets. You should remain vigilant at all times.
UK Counter Terrorism Policing has information and advice on staying safe abroad and what to do in the event of a terrorist attack. Find out how to reduce your risk from terrorism while abroad.
Terrorism in Turkey
Terrorists are very likely to try to carry out attacks in Turkey.
Most terrorist attacks have happened in Southeast Turkey, Ankara and Istanbul. Citizens from western countries may be targets or caught up in attacks, particularly in major cities.
Terrorists may target places visited by foreigners, such as:
public buildings
places of worship
major events
large public gatherings
Terrorist groups sometimes call for attacks around religious occasions and public holidays.
Previous attacks have included:
armed assaults
suicide bombings
car bombings
rocket attacks
arson
improvised explosive devices left in bins, crowded areas, shops and on public transport
There is also a heightened risk of terrorist attack against the aviation industry in Turkey.
You should:
follow the advice of the local security authorities
monitor media reports
cooperate fully with security officials at airports
It is illegal to be a member or supporter of a terrorist organisation in Turkey. Organisations such as the YPG and the Gülen Movement are illegal in Turkey.
Terrorist and insurgent groups include Daesh (formerly referred to as ISIL), PKK, and THKP/C-Acilciler (Turkish People’s Liberation Party/Front) and the DHKP/C (Revolutionary People’s Liberation Front). There’s a domestic terrorist presence in the southeast of the country including in Van, Bitlis, Bingol, Elazig, Mus, Batman, Erzincan, Diyarbakir and Agri provinces.
DHKP/C attacks have mainly targeted the Turkish authorities and US diplomatic missions.
Extremist groups based in Syria including Daesh and Al-Qaeda linked groups have the capacity to carry out attacks in neighbouring countries, including Turkey. Daesh has previously targeted border crossings and nearby locations on the Syrian side of the border.
Take particular care during dates of significance to terrorist groups, including:
15 August
30 March to 20 April
19 December
Terrorist groups operating in Syria, including Daesh and Al-Qaeda linked groups, routinely use kidnapping as a tactic. They’re present in the Syrian border areas. Be particularly vigilant in these locations. Daesh and other terrorist groups may target humanitarian aid workers and journalists. If you’re kidnapped, the reason for your presence is unlikely to serve as protection or secure your safe release.
The long-standing policy of the British Government is not to make substantive concessions to hostage takers. The British Government considers that paying ransoms and releasing prisoners builds the capability of terrorist groups and finances their activities. This can, in turn, increase the risk of further hostage-taking. The Terrorism Act (2000) makes payments to terrorists illegal.
Political situation
Occasional demonstrations can occur in cities and may become violent. Police have used tear gas and water cannon to disperse protests.
Events in Israel and the Occupied Palestinian Territories have led to heightened tensions in the region and demonstrations are expected in locations across Turkey. Large demonstrations have been reported outside diplomatic missions connected to the conflict in central Ankara, including the Israeli residence on Ataturk Bulvari, Cankaya.
Avoid all demonstrations and leave the area if one develops. Local transport routes may be disrupted.
Crime
Street robbery and pickpocketing
Street robbery and pick-pocketing are common in the major tourist areas of Istanbul. Be aware of your personal belongings and make sure they are always secure.
Drink and food spiking
Buy your own drinks and always keep sight of them so they are not spiked. Be wary of strangers approaching you offering food and drink (which may be drugged), to change money, or to take you to a restaurant or nightclub.
Counterfeit alcohol
In a small number of cases, counterfeit alcohol has caused deaths of tourists. If you have any concerns, seek advice from your tour operator or the Turkish authorities.
Sexual assault
In 2022, 51 cases of sexual assault, including rape, were reported to British consular staff in Turkey. Most sexual assault cases reported to British consular staff in Turkey have happened during summer holidays in coastal tourist areas. Many were committed at night by someone the victim met during the day, including hotel workers. There have also been sexual attacks on minors visiting toilet facilities alone. Be extra vigilant in these situations.
Vehicle safety
Accepting lifts from strangers can be dangerous. Find a registered taxi and note the registration number before entering.
Laws and cultural differences
Personal ID
It is illegal not to carry some form of photographic ID in Turkey. Always carry your passport or residence permit. In some busy areas, especially Istanbul, the authorities may stop people for ID checks. There are also several police checkpoints on main roads across Turkey. Cooperate with officials conducting checks.
Dress visiting mosques
Dress modestly if you’re visiting a mosque or a religious shrine to avoid causing offence.
Personal injury claims
There are reports of tourists being encouraged to submit a claim for personal injury if they have experienced gastric illness in Turkey. Find out what you can do if you have suffered a personal injury on the Citizens Advice website. Only make a claim if you have genuinely suffered from injury or illness. If you make a false or fraudulent claim, you may face legal proceedings in the UK or Turkey.
Smoking bans
Smoking is illegal on public transport and in all indoor workplaces and public places. Smoking is restricted in some outdoor areas where cultural, artistic, sports or entertainment activities are held.
Illegal drugs and prison sentences
Turkey has strict laws against the use, possession and trafficking of illegal drugs. You may receive a fine or prison sentence of 4 to 24 years.
Stray dogs
Most towns and cities have stray dogs. Packs congregate in parks and wastelands and can be aggressive. Take care and do not approach stray dogs. If you’re bitten, get medical advice immediately. Rabies and other animal borne diseases are present in Turkey.
Sale of antiquities
The possession, sale and export of antiquities is illegal. You could be fined and receive a prison sentence of 5 to 12 years. Some historical items found at local markets and in antique shops can be sold within Turkey but are illegal to export. Confirm the legal requirements before purchasing or exporting such items.
Using cameras
Do not take photographs near military or official installations. Ask for permission before photographing people.
LGBT+ travellers
Homosexuality is legal in Turkey. However, many parts of Turkey are socially conservative and showing affection in public could result in unwelcome attention. Read more advice for LGBT+ travellers.
Comments about the nation and flag
It is illegal to insult the Turkish nation or the national flag, or to deface currency. This can include comments about the Turkish state. These laws also apply to comments made online. You could get a prison sentence of between 6 months and 3 years
Outdoor activities and adventure tourism
Extreme sports
If you do an extreme sport, check that adequate safety precautions are in place. British nationals have been injured and killed doing extreme sports. Only use reputable operators. Make sure you are given full instructions and training before your activity. Make sure your travel insurance covers you for all activities you want to do.
Transport risks
Road travel
If you are planning to drive in Turkey, see information on driving abroad. You must carry a green card in Turkey.
Take care when travelling by road, particularly at night. Approach checkpoints slowly and follow the instructions of security personnel. Roads between major cities are generally in excellent condition, but can be poor in remote, rural areas. Accidents are common and mainly due to poor or reckless driving.
It is illegal not to wear a helmet on motorcycles and mopeds. You may get a large fine if you do not wear a helmet.
Do not drink and drive. The police fine drunk drivers and your licence could be confiscated for 6 months.
Licences and documents
You need either a 1968 international driving permit (IDP) or a valid UK driving licence (notarised in Turkish) to drive in Turkey. The 1949 IDP is not accepted anymore. You cannot buy an IDP outside the UK, so get one before you travel. You can buy an IDP in person from some UK post offices – find your nearest post office branch that offers this service.
If you stay in Turkey for more than 6 months, you must convert your UK driving licence into a Turkish licence. Provisional driving licences aren’t recognised. If you intend to bring a vehicle registered in another country into Turkey, familiarise yourself with the relevant Turkish customs regulations.
Extreme weather and natural disasters
Forest fires
Forest fires happen frequently in Turkey during summer. Take care when visiting or driving through woodland areas.
You could get a fine or prison sentence for lighting a fire of any kind in forbidden areas. This includes barbeques and discarding cigarette butts in the woods.
If there is a forest fire in your area, local authorities may tell you to leave your accommodation. Follow the directions of local authorities.
If you see a forest fire, call emergency services on 112.
Flooding
Severe rainstorms can cause flooding and landslides across Turkey. Roads may become impassable and bridges damaged, making it difficult to travel and reducing essential services.
If you’re in an affected area:
monitor local media
follow instructions of local authorities, including evacuation orders
Earthquakes
Many parts of Turkey regularly experience earthquakes and tremors. These can be a high magnitude, cause damage to infrastructure, and pose a risk to life.
A 7.8 magnitude earthquake hit Gaziantep and neighbouring provinces in the south-east of Turkey in February 2023. Strong earthquakes may continue to affect the region and it remains heavily damaged.
Follow any advice given by the local authorities.  See the US Federal Emergency Management Agency guidance about what to do before, during and after an earthquake .
