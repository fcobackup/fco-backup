Healthcare in Dominica  
FCDO has a list of medical providers in Dominica.   
There is also guidance on healthcare if you’re living in Dominica.  
The Dominica China Friendship Hospital, the government hospital in Roseau, can cope with many types of treatment, but serious cases may require emergency evacuation. 
Before choosing to be treated at a private facility, you should check the payment policy. Private clinics may ask for payment up front, so insurance documents may not be sufficient.  
Private medical treatment in Dominica can be expensive. Make sure you have adequate travel health insurance and accessible funds to cover the cost of any medical treatment abroad and repatriation. 
Travel and mental health 
Read FCDO guidance on travel and mental health. There is also mental health guidance on TravelHealthPro.
