The information on this page covers the most common types of travel and reflects the UK government’s understanding of the rules currently in place. Unless otherwise stated, this information is for travellers using a full ‘British Citizen’ passport.
The authorities in the country or territory you’re travelling to are responsible for setting and enforcing the rules for entry. If you’re unclear about any aspect of the entry requirements, or you need further reassurance, you’ll need to contact the embassy, high commission or consulate of the country or territory you’re travelling to.
You should also consider checking with your transport provider or travel company to make sure your passport and other travel documents meet their requirements.
Entry rules in response to coronavirus (COVID-19)
Entry to Moldova
On entering Moldova, you must complete a form that declares information about your state of health (relevant to the COVID pandemic) and confirm that you will self-isolate for 14 days unless you are exempt.
You will be exempt from self-isolation if you present a printed negative result from a PCR test conducted less than 72 hours before your time of embarkation (if travelling by mass transport) or your arrival time at the border (if travelling by private means). Current rules do not specify whether electronic documents are acceptable, but you are recommended to bring your test result in paper form. The test result can be in English, Romanian, Russian, German, Italian or French.
You will also be exempt from self-isolation if you can present proof of having received a vaccination against COVID-19, including those offered by the NHS. The rules do not specify that two doses must have been received.
Demonstrating your COVID-19 vaccination status
The document proving you have been vaccinated can be in English, Romanian, Russian, German, Italian or French.
Moldova will accept the UK’s solutions to demonstrate your COVID vaccination status. Your NHS appointment card from vaccination centres is not designed to be used as proof of vaccination and should not be used to demonstrate your vaccine status.
A number of further exemptions exist, as set out below under Quarantine requirements.
You should contact your travel operator and air carrier for more information before travelling to Moldova.
You should check for updates on border crossings with Ukraine and Romania on the Moldovan Border Police website.
Quarantine requirements
In addition to the exemptions mentioned above, the following categories are also exempt from self-isolation:
children under 5 years old;
drivers of cargo vehicles and passengers transport;
persons traveling for medical treatment, or humanitarian reasons;
students coming for studies, exams, or academic contests upon presenting confirmation papers;
workers with a visa, residence permit, or work contract;
persons returning from a work-related visit abroad upon providing a confirmation that they were delegated to travel;
members of official visiting delegations;
cross-border workers;
crews and service personnel of aircraft, ships, and trains;
passengers in transit;
sportsmen and accompanying staff traveling to international sports events;
persons summoned by Moldovan law enforcement institutions;
diplomatic passport holders and their family members;
Persons in self-isolation may stop self-isolating if they take a PCR test after day 10 and the result is negative.
You are allowed to enter Transnistrian region, without a negative PCR test. This rule is in place at least until 1 July.
Data collection
Upon arrival to Moldova, you must fill out an epidemiological form. This form is to be submitted to immigration officials.
Regular entry requirements
Visas
Visas are no longer required to enter Moldova if your stay is under 90 days. For all other types of travel, contact the Embassy of the Republic of Moldova in London. See below for information on entry into Moldova.
The Moldovan authorities strictly enforce penalties (including deportation) against foreign visitors who overstay the terms of their visas. As a visitor you are allowed to spend no more than 90 days in any six months period in Moldova. At any official point of entry, your arrival date will be registered automatically. Please see below for details of entry through Transnistria.
Residence and/or work permits are required for stays over 90 days. Immigration, residence, and work permits usually need to be extended annually, but can be issued for up to five years. Alternatively, you must regularise your stay by applying for a residence or work visa.
Passport validity
Your passport should be valid for at least six months and have at least one unused page.
Entry into Moldova via Transnistria
If you’re entering into Transnistria overland from Ukraine (for example by bus or rail) be aware that the Transnistrian border guard will not place entry stamps into passports, but you will receive a registration document. Keep this document until your departure and present it at the border. The service is free of charge.
If you cross the border by road, there are 6 check points with immigration controls, where you can receive a registration document.
If you cross the border by rail, there are no ‘immigration controls’ and your passport won’t be stamped. In this case, within 3 days, you should go to the Bureau for Migration and Asylum in Chisinau (124 Stefan cel Mare Boulevard) to register your stay.
Alternatively, you could go to the local offices of the Bureau for Migration and Asylum located in: Hîrbovăț in Anenii Noi; Hajumus in Căușeni; Pîrîta in Dubăsari, Criuleni in Criuleni, Rezina in Rezina and Sărătăuac în Florești.
To register your stay you must present the following documents:
your passport
proof of travel (for example a Green Card if you drive a vehicle into Moldova; air/ bus/train ticket)
Failure to register may result in fines and difficulties when leaving Moldova.
Entry into Moldova via Ukraine
If you enter Moldova overland from Ukraine do so at one of the internationally recognised border crossing points between Moldova (excluding the Transnistria segment) and Ukraine in the north and south of the country.
Entry into Transnistria
There are no ‘immigration controls’ in place on the internal boundary between Transnistria and Moldova proper and entry stamps won’t be placed into passports. But on entering Transnistria you will be required to fill in 2 copies of a migration card, one of which should be retained and produced on exit. You may also be questioned on the aim of your visit, duration and where you will stay.
UK Emergency Travel Documents
UK ETDs are accepted for entry, airside transit and exit from Moldova.
