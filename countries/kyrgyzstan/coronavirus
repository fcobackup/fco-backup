International travel
There are regular flights to and from Kyrgyzstan, operated by a range of airlines. Tickets are available online and at local travel agents. However, there may be reduced flights on some routes. Check with your airline or travel agent on status of flights to Kyrgyzstan before travelling.
Check with your airline for any Coronavirus restrictions, and for information about Coronavirus restrictions at the airports you’re transiting through. A number of countries that British passengers frequently transit en route between the UK and Kyrgyzstan have additional restrictions on passengers travelling to or from the UK. Please note that if you are transiting through a red list country you will still be required to follow the rules for entering the UK from a red list country. You can find more information on transiting a red or amber list country on gov.uk. You should check the relevant travel advice pages before travelling.

Entry and borders
Proof of vaccination against COVID-19 or a negative PCR test from no more than 72 hours before your arrival is now needed for entry into Kyrgyzstan. If your journey is delayed and your test becomes out of date you will need to have a PCR test on arrival.
British nationals are allowed to enter Kyrgyzstan.
Demonstrating your vaccination status from the UK is not currently formalised for entry into Kyrgyzstan, so you should follow alternative advice for entry into Kyrgyzstan by getting a negative PCR test. Your NHS appointment card from vaccination centres is not designed to be used as proof of vaccination and should not be used to demonstrate your vaccine status.
If you’re planning to cross into Kyrgyzstan through one of the land borders you should check ahead that the border crossing you’re planning to use will allow British citizens to cross and for any additional Coronavirus restrictions, and delays they may cause.
If you fly into Kyrgyzstan you will be asked to complete a questionnaire for entering the Kyrgyz Republic whilst on board your flight and hand this in on arrival. You will have your temperature taken when entering Kyrgyzstan. You should comply with any additional screening measures and other restrictions put in place by the authorities.
See Entry requirements to find out what you will need to do when you arrive in Kyrgyzstan.

COVID-19 vaccines if you live in Kyrgyzstan
The Medicines and Healthcare Products Regulatory Agency (MHRA) is the UK authority responsible for assessing the safety, quality and efficacy of vaccines. It has authorised the Pfizer/BioNTech, Oxford/AstraZeneca and Moderna vaccines for temporary supply and use in the UK. Find out more about MHRA approval for these vaccines.
British nationals living overseas should seek medical advice from their local healthcare provider in the country where they reside. Information about vaccines used in other national programmes, including regulatory status, should be available from the local authorities.

Returning to the UK
When you return, you must follow the rules for entering the UK.
You are responsible for organising your own COVID-19 test, in line with UK government testing requirements. You should check that the test result can be provided in the correct format and language.
Visas
The Kyrgyz government is operating a “green corridor” system, which means that foreign citizens will not face penalties when leaving Kyrgyzstan even if they have overstayed the visa free period or if registration has expired.
If you need to extend your period of stay on the basis of obtaining a visa (work permit, family ties, or other grounds) the visa centre is willing to consider the possibility of obtaining visas without leaving the Kyrgyz republic.
See Entry requirements for more information on visas.
