Most commercial flights have stopped. The remaining commercial option to leave Uruguay is with Amaszonas who are running ad-hoc flights to Sao Paulo once or twice a week until 30 May. Currently flights are scheduled for 7, 9, 14, 16, 23 and 30 May. We do not know if these flights will continue after this date.
Connections to Europe (but not London) from Sao Paulo are still possible. Transit passengers cannot spend more than 24 hours in Sao Paulo. There are limited options for final transit from Europe to the UK. To book, please contact Amaszonas directly on 096 436 032.
You will need to pay for your return travel to the UK. If departure options are available but you cannot afford the travel costs and have exhausted all other options for getting funds, you may be eligible to apply for an emergency loan from the government. This is a last resort option and you would need to repay the loan when you are back in the UK. For more information, you should contact Corporate Travel Management (CTM). CTM are a commercial partner of the FCO and are authorised to administer such loans on behalf of the FCO.
