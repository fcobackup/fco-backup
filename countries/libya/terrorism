There is a high threat of terrorist attack globally affecting UK interests and British Nationals, including from groups and individuals who view the UK and British Nationals as targets. You should remain vigilant at all times.
Terrorists are very likely to try to carry out attacks in Libya. British and nationals of other Western countries are considered high value targets. Government buildings and security checkpoints have also been targeted in recent years, resulting in loss of lives.
Extremist groups including Daesh in Libya (formerly referred to as ISIL) are responsible for the majority of attacks, which have targeted foreign and diplomatic personnel and premises, international hotels, commercial and oil installations, and government and other official security institutions.
Although government-aligned forces, supported by US airstrikes, declared the end of operations against Daesh in Sirte in January 2016, Daesh remain a serious threat to security in Libya.
On 7 and 14 June 2021 Daesh claimed responsibility for two separate bomb attacks on Libyan security forces in Fezzan province in southern Libya. These attacks killed at least four people.
Attacks could be indiscriminate, including in places visited by foreigners. While there is a greater concentration of terrorist groups in the Fezzan Province, it is highly likely smaller numbers of terrorists can move relatively freely to facilitate activity outside of the Fezzan Province to other towns and regions.
Due to increased security pressure against terrorist groups it is likely both Daesh and Al Qaida in the Islamic Maghreb (AQIM), are prioritising facilitation activity (such as weapons and people smuggling), to support terrorist operations in West Africa and are focused on maintaining their operating environment in the Fezzan Province. It is likely the threat from armed group violence has also helped to mitigate the terrorist threat in the north of Libya by further reducing the freedom of movement of terrorist groups.
Travel in border regions presents an elevated risk.  Extremist groups operating in the region, including AQIM and Daesh, conduct operations in the border areas of northern Mali, Niger and Algeria. They have a proven capability of travelling long distances to carry out attacks, including in neighbouring countries and Libya.

Kidnap
Terrorist groups including Daesh, Al Qaeda and their affiliates routinely use kidnapping as a tactic and are capable of conducting kidnapping across borders. Terrorist groups within Libya have both intent and capability to carry out further kidnappings. Itâ€™s a realistic possibility that they will target foreign nationals. Criminal gangs also carry out kidnappings, and there is a realistic possibility that they would sell hostages on to terrorist groups. Foreign nationals have been kidnapped in Libya in the past, including four foreign nationals in south-east Libya in July 2018.
It is likely that any Kidnap for Ransom (KfR) attempt by a terrorist group in Libya would occur in the south of the country, whereas a KfR by militias would occur in a northern coastal city.
There is a realistic possibility that a terrorist group, most likely Daesh-Libya or Al Qaeda in the Islamic Maghreb, will kidnap a Western national in Libya. In recent months, the importance of oil and natural gas production in Libya has increased, and any Western nationals working for oil and natural gas companies in Libya are highly likely viewed as high value targets. See our Sahel page for information on the regional threat.
Those engaged in tourism, humanitarian aid work, journalism or business sectors are viewed as legitimate targets. If you are kidnapped, the reason for your presence is unlikely to serve as a protection or secure your safe release. The long-standing policy of the British government is not to make substantive concessions to hostage takers. The British government considers that paying ransoms and releasing prisoners increases the risk of further hostage taking. The Terrorism Act (2000) also makes payments to terrorists illegal.
