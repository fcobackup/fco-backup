The information on this page covers the most common types of travel and reflects the UK government’s understanding of the rules currently in place. Unless otherwise stated, this information is for travellers using a full ‘British Citizen’ passport.
The authorities in the country or territory you’re travelling to are responsible for setting and enforcing the rules for entry. If you’re unclear about any aspect of the entry requirements, or you need further reassurance, you’ll need to contact the embassy, high commission or consulate of the country or territory you’re travelling to.
You should also consider checking with your transport provider or travel company to make sure your passport and other travel documents meet their requirements.
Under Montenegrin law you must carry a valid form of ID with you at all times, for example a driving licence, passport or equivalent, otherwise you may be fined. Keep a photocopy of your passport in a safe place.
Visas
British passport holders do not require a visa to enter Montenegro for short-term stays of up to 90 days. The Montenegrin law considers “stays of 90 days” as 90 days in total in a 180-day period, counted from the first entry date.
If you are in the UK and you would like to consult if and what type of Montenegrin visa(http://www.mvp.gov.me/en/sections/consular-affairs/visa-information/What-is-a-Visa/) you require prior to your arrival, please contact the [Montenegrin Embassy in London]http://www.mvp.gov.me/rubrike/misije/Ambasade-i-konzulati-CG-u-svijetu/Ujedinjeno-Kraljevstvo-Velike-Britanije-Sjeverne-I).
British passport holders who are in Montenegro already and wish to extend their stay, need to apply for a visa or a temporary residence permit to the Montenegrin Ministry of Interior Affairs(http://www.mup.gov.me/ministarstvo) no later than one week before the 90-day period expires.
Passport validity
Your passport should be undamaged and in accordance with local law should be issued in the last 10 years and valid for at least 3 months after the planned date of departure from Montenegro.
Border crossings
There may be additional delays on roads approaching the border crossings between Montenegro and Croatia as Croatia implements an EU decision on enhanced border controls which involves additional checks.
Only enter Montenegro through recognised border crossings.
If you are planning a mountaineering tour which involves crossing borders other than at an official border crossing point contact the National Tourist Organisation for advice.
On entering Montenegro, make sure the border police put an entry stamp in your passport. This helps avoid problems related to verifying the length of your stay in the country.
Registration
It is a legal requirement that you register with the local police or tourist organisation in the town/city where you’re staying within 24 hours of your arrival in Montenegro, unless you’re staying in a hotel or other commercial accommodation where you’ll be registered automatically on checking in. If you don’t register you may be fined, detained or face a court appearance.
Further information can be found on our living in Montenegro page.
Customs requirements
Although there is no limit to the amount of money you can bring into Montenegro, you should declare sums of money in excess of €10,000 (including travellers’ cheques or equivalent in other currencies). To take more than €10,000 out of the country you will need to provide proof that you brought the money in. Customs Officers at all border points issue declaration forms. On departure, you will need to return a certified copy of this declaration to customs. For sums of money in excess of €15,000 you should also have obtained a document which states the origin of the funds. If you fail to comply with these rules, your money may be confiscated. To avoid customs charges, declare items of value like expensive jewellery, photographic and computer equipment.
UK Emergency Travel Documents
UK Emergency Travel Documents are accepted for entry, airside transit and exit from Montenegro.
