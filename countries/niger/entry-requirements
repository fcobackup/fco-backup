This page reflects the UK government’s understanding of current rules for people travelling on a full ‘British Citizen’ passport from the UK, for the most common types of travel.
The authorities in Niger set and enforce entry rules.
All travellers
Entry to Niger is only permitted for Nigerien nationals, persons with valid residency and foreign nationals with valid visas.
For further information contact the embassy, high commission or consulate which covers the country or territory you’re travelling to. You should also consider checking with your transport provider or travel company to make sure your passport and other travel documents meet their requirements.
All travellers eligible for entry will need to present a negative COVID-19 PCR test certificate taken within 72 hours before arrival to the airport authorities. All travellers entering Niger are also required to register their PCR test and obtain a mandatory QR code. Before travelling, you should register and upload your PCR test results online.
You can find a full list of approved COVID-19 testing laboratories on the Trusted Travel website. Details of how this policy is being implemented are not fully clear at this stage. You may be subject to temperature checks upon arrival.
Quarantine requirements
If you are staying in Niger for less than 7 days, you will need to take a COVID-19 test on arrival and self-isolate until you have received the results of the test. If your test is negative, you can end the self-isolation. If you are staying in Niger for more than 7 days, you will have to self-isolate at your final destination (home, hotel) for seven days. On the seventh day of self-isolation you will need to take a second COVID-19 test; if the result is negative you can end self-isolation and if the result is positive you will have to follow government isolation procedures.
