This page reflects the UK government’s understanding of current rules for people travelling on a full ‘British Citizen’ passport, for the most common types of travel.
The authorities in Switzerland set and enforce entry rules. For further information contact the embassy, high commission or consulate of the country or territory you’re travelling to. You should also consider checking with your transport provider or travel company to make sure your passport and other travel documents meet their requirements.
You will require a valid passport or other travel document to enter Switzerland.
If you are travelling to Switzerland for work, read the guidance on visas and permits as the rules have changed since 1 January 2021.
Entry rules in response to coronavirus (COVID-19)
Eligibility to enter Switzerland
You are eligible to enter Switzerland for any travel purpose if you are fully vaccinated and can show adequate proof (detailed below). All arrivals from the UK must report their arrival to the relevant cantonal office within two days and must complete a further test (antigen or PCR) after 4 to 7 days in Switzerland, and must send the result of the second test to the relevant cantonal office. Find the relevant cantonal office
All arrivals from the UK must report their arrival to the relevant cantonal office within two days and must complete a further test (antigen or PCR) after 4 to 7 days in Switzerland, and must send the result of the second test to the relevant cantonal office. Find the relevant cantonal office.
More detail is available on the Swiss Federal Office of Health’s website.
Travellers who are not fully vaccinated are only eligible to enter Switzerland from the UK if they are:
Swiss or Liechtenstein nationals;
EU or EFTA nationals;
holders of the following documents:
a residence permit, i.e. a Swiss residence permit (L / B / C / Ci permits);
a cross-border permit (G permit);
an FDFA legitimation card;
a D visa issued by Switzerland;
confirmation of notification for the cross-border provision of services up to 90 days;
holders of a ‘laissez passer’ issued by the Swiss Embassy in situations of special necessity
Travellers who are not fully vaccinated and do not meet one of the exemptions outlined above are not eligible to enter Switzerland.
Anyone who is eligible to enter Switzerland who has not been fully vaccinated against COVID-19 or can demonstrate they have recovered from the virus (see ‘Demonstrating your COVID-19 status’, below) must provide a negative COVID test result (either PCR or antigen). They will have to take a second test between four and seven days after arrival, and send the result to the relevant cantonal health authority.
Unvaccinated children and adolescents arriving from the UK under the age of 18 are allowed to enter Switzerland if they are accompanied by fully vaccinated adults.
All travellers must complete a passenger locator form.
You can see what rules apply to you when entering Switzerland using the online Travelcheck service.
Testing requirements
In addition to the above entry requirements, all travellers flying to Switzerland must possess either proof of vaccination, proof of recovery in the last 6 months or a negative COVID-19 test prior to departure. Negative PCR tests (not older than 72 hours) are accepted. Children under the age of 16 are exempt from testing. A negative COVID-19 test will not grant your entry to Switzerland if you are not eligible to enter (i.e. fully vaccinated or exempt.)
Quarantine
All arrivals from the UK must report their arrival to the relevant cantonal office within two days and must complete a further test (antigen or PCR) after 4 to 7 days in Switzerland, and must send the result of the second test to the relevant cantonal office. Find the relevant cantonal office. More detail is available on the Swiss Federal Office of Health’s website.
Demonstrating your COVID-19 status
Switzerland will accept the UK’s proof of COVID-19 recovery and vaccination record. However a screenshot or a photo is not sufficient. Further information is available from the State Secretariat for Migration. If you are travelling with a printed PDF proof of vaccination status, it must date from 1 November to ensure that the certificate can be scanned successfully. Your NHS appointment card from vaccination centres is not designed to be used as proof of vaccination and should not be used to demonstrate your vaccine status.
You will be regarded as vaccinated if you have been vaccinated with a vaccine that either:
is authorised in Switzerland and has been administered in full in accordance with Federal Office of Public Health recommendations; or
has been authorised by the European Medicines Agency for the European Union and has been administered in full in accordance with the requirements or recommendations of the country in which the vaccination was administered; or
has been authorised under the WHO Emergency Use Listing and has been administered in full in accordance with the requirements or recommendations of the country in which the vaccination was administered.
This includes the AstraZeneca, Pfizer, Moderna and Janssen vaccines that are available in the UK.
Your vaccination is valid for 12 months directly after the date of your last vaccination.
For the Janssen vaccination the validity starts 22 days after the date of vaccination.
Further information is available on the Federal Office of Public Health and State Secretariat for Migration websites. The Federal Office of Public Health also have a helpline for people travelling to Switzerland (+41 58 464 44 88) which is available every day from 6am to 11pm CET.
Transit
There is no quarantine requirement for unvaccinated travellers arriving in Switzerland from the UK who wish to travel onward to another country, as long as travel through Switzerland is less than 24 hours and does not involve a stopover. More detail is available in the ordinance (in German). There is no quarantine requirement for those in transit airside at the airport.
If you are transiting Switzerland, you are strongly advised to have your onward travel booked in advance and to have confirmed you meet the entry requirements of your destination country (you may be asked to provide proof of your onward travel and accommodation). If you are transiting by air, you must complete an online form and provide contact details. You should also check the travel advice for any country that you will transit on the way back to the UK. Further information about travelling through Switzerland is available from the State Secretariat for Migration.
Helpline
Further advice for people travelling to Switzerland is available from an information line run by the Federal Office of Public Health on +41 58 464 44 88 (4am – 9pm GMT). Assistance is available in English, German, French and Italian.
Regular entry requirements
Visas
The rules for travelling or working in European countries changed on 1 January 2021:
you can travel to countries in the Schengen area for up to 90 days in any 180-day period without a visa. This applies if you travel as a tourist, to visit family or friends, to attend business meetings, cultural or sports events, or for short-term studies or training.
if you are travelling to Switzerland and other Schengen countries without a visa, make sure your whole visit is within the 90-day limit. Visits to Schengen countries within the previous 180 days before you travel count towards your 90 days.
to stay longer, to work or study, for business travel or for other reasons, you will need to meet the Swiss government’s entry requirements. Check the Swiss Embassy what type of visa and/or work permit, if any, you may need
if you stay in Switzerland with a residence permit or long-stay visa, this does not count towards your 90-day visa-free limit
Any time you spent in Switzerland or other Schengen countries before 1 January 2021 does not count towards your 90-day visa-free limit.
At Swiss border control, you may need to queue in separate lanes from EU, EEA and Swiss citizens.
Check your passport is stamped if you enter or exit the Schengen area through Switzerland as a visitor. Border guards will use passport stamps to check you’re complying with the 90-day visa-free limit for short stays in the Schengen area. If relevant entry or exit stamps are not in your passport, border guards will presume that you have overstayed your visa-free limit.
You can show evidence of when and where you entered or exited the Schengen area, and ask the border guards to add this date and location in your passport. Examples of acceptable evidence include boarding passes and tickets.
You may also need to:
show a return or onward ticket
show you have enough money for your stay
If you are resident in Switzerland your passport should not be stamped. You should proactively show your proof of residence as well as your valid passport at Swiss border control. For further information, see our Living in Switzerland guide.
Passport validity
Check your passport is valid for travel before you book your trip, and renew your passport if you do not have enough time left on it.
Make sure your passport is:
valid for at least 3 months after the day you plan to leave Switzerland, or any other Schengen country
less than 10 years old
The 3 months you need when leaving a country must be within 10 years of the passport issue date.
If you renewed your current passport before the previous one expired, extra months may have been added to its expiry date. Any extra months on your passport over 10 years may not count towards the minimum 3 months needed.
Customs regulations

UK Emergency Travel Documents
UK Emergency Travel Documents (ETDs) are accepted for entry, airside transit and exit from Switzerland.
