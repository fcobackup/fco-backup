The Maltese authorities have introduced a number of measures in response to the coronavirus (COVID-19) pandemic, including a mandatory 14 day self-quarantine period for all arrivals into Malta.
On 13 March Malta introduced a mandatory 14 day self-quarantine period for all arrivals into Malta. This will affect tourists and returning residents. Asymptomatic visitors can choose to either enter mandatory self-quarantine or to return to their country of origin as soon as possible. If you choose to leave Malta you must travel directly from your accommodation to the airport where you will be thermally screened. Most flights continue to operate but this could change at short notice. See Health
