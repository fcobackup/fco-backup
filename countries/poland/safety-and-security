Terrorism
There is a high threat of terrorist attack globally affecting UK interests and British nationals, including from groups and individuals who view the UK and British nationals as targets. You should remain vigilant at all times.
UK Counter Terrorism Policing has information and advice on staying safe abroad and what to do in the event of a terrorist attack. Find out more about the global threat from terrorism.
Terrorism in Poland
Terrorist attacks in Poland cannot be ruled out.
Travel from Ukraine
FCDO advises against travel to Ukraine due to the Russian invasion. There have been Russian military strikes in Ukraine within 20km of the Polish border. In 2022, there was an explosion in Przewodów near the Ukrainian border killing 2 Polish nationals. Do not attempt to cross into Ukraine from Poland. Remain vigilant and follow the advice of the authorities if you are near the Ukrainian border.
If you have arrived in Poland from Ukraine and are in need of assistance, call +48 22 311 0000 or +44 1908 516666 and select the option for ‘consular services for British nationals’. You can also send an enquiry using the web contact form.
The main border crossing points to enter Poland from Ukraine can be found on the Ukrainian government website. Prepare for potential long delays at border crossings.
Belarus border
There is limited access along parts of the Poland’s border with Belarus. The Kuzniсa-Bruzgi road border crossing is currently closed. In February, traffic was suspended at the Bobrowniki border crossing until further notice. More border checkpoints may close or implement restrictions at short notice and other disruption is possible.
Access to within 200 metres of the border with Belarus is still limited. You should abide by this limitation at all times and follow the instructions of Polish authorities if you are in this area.
Political situation and demonstrations
Public demonstrations are common. Marches and gatherings are mostly peaceful and well-policed, but take extra care in crowded places. Demonstrations can attract violence. Monitor local media and follow the instructions of local authorities.
Crime
Racially motivated attacks
Most visitors do not experience any difficulties. Serious crime against foreigners is rare, but crimes do occur and in some cases attacks have been racially motivated.
Protecting your belongings
Be alert to street crime and petty theft. Foreigners can be seen as easy targets. Keep valuables and cash out of sight, especially:
in crowded areas
in tourist spots
at main rail stations and on all train services and overnight sleeper trains
Unofficial taxi drivers
Unofficial taxi drivers often overcharge. Passengers have been attacked, including sexual assaults, in unofficial taxis and cars booked using ride share apps. See further advice from the Polish police (in Polish).
Do not use unofficial taxis. Official taxis will:
have the name and telephone number of the taxi company on the door and top of the taxi
show a rate card on the window of the vehicle
Taxis with a crest but no company name are not official.
Take precautions, particularly at night or if you are alone.
Drink and food spiking
Victims of spiked drinks have been robbed in bars and clubs. Be careful about taking drinks from strangers or leaving your drink or food unattended.
Overcharging in bars
Check your bill carefully when buying drinks in bars and nightclubs. Visitors have been overcharged large amounts when paying for drinks by debit or credit card.
Sexual assault
There is advice for victims of rape or sexual assault in Poland.
Laws and cultural differences
Dual nationals
Dual Polish-British nationals will be treated as a Polish national if arrested or detained by the Polish authorities.
Alcohol laws
It is illegal to drink alcohol in public places. If caught, you might be fined.
If you are drunk in a public place, you could be taken to a clinic to be medically assessed. You will have to say there until you are sober, including overnight. You will have to pay for the cost of your stay.
LGBT+ travellers
Small towns and rural areas can be less tolerant towards LGBT+ travellers. There are gay and LGBT+-friendly restaurants, clubs and bars in many towns and cities including Warsaw, Krakow, Wroclaw, Poznan, Gdansk and Sopot.
Same-sex relationships are legal and same sex partners can live together, but same-sex marriages and civil partnerships are not recognised under Polish law.
Read more advice for LGBT+ travellers.
Jaywalking
You could be fined if you are caught jaywalking.
Transport risks
Wear reflective clothing
Walkers and cyclists must wear a reflective item at night in non built-up areas. You may be held responsible if you are involved in an accident and not wearing a reflective item. You could be fined 100 Polish zloty (around £20) if you don’t have a reflective item.
Public transport
Validate a public transport ticket at the start of a journey. You will be fined if you travel on an invalid or unvalidated ticket.
Road travel
If you are planning to drive in Poland, see information on driving abroad and read the RAC guide.
Poland is a major east-west transit route for heavy vehicles. The road network is being constantly upgraded, and roadworks are frequent, particularly in summer. Even some main roads between major towns and cities can be narrow and poorly surfaced, making driving after dark particularly challenging.
Car hire
Most car rental companies will not allow you to take your hire car across the Poland/Ukraine border.
Licences and permits
You can drive in Poland with your UK photocard driving licence without the need for an international driving permit (IDP).
If you’re living in Poland, check the Living in Poland guide for information on the rules for residents.
When driving, always have your:
driving licence
ID
car registration papers
car ownership papers
insurance papers
You will need to show these documents if you are stopped by the police or if you cross non-Schengen borders. This includes rental vehicles. If you do not have these papers the police may take your vehicle and charge you for this. If you drive a vehicle in Poland it must meet local technical requirements.
Driving a British car abroad
You may need a UK sticker to drive your car outside the UK. From 2021 UK stickers have replaced GB stickers. Check guidance on displaying number plates for more information on what to do if you are driving outside the UK.
Tolls
You may need to pay a road toll on some parts of motorways, expressways and national roads. More information is available on the toll operator website.
