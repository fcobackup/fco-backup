Be prepared for your plans to change
No travel is risk-free during COVID-19. Countries may further restrict travel or bring in new rules at short notice, for example due to a new COVID-19 variant. Check with your travel company or airline for any transport changes which may delay your journey home.
If you are travelling to South Korea, plan ahead and make sure you:
can access enough money to cover unexpected COVID-19-related costs
understand what your insurance will cover
can make arrangements to extend your stay and be away for longer than planned
Testing positive for COVID-19
If you think you might have COVID-19 while in South Korea, you should self-isolate immediately and contact the Korea Disease Control and Prevention Agency on 1339 for guidance (support is available in English). Antigen tests are available for purchase at pharmacies and PCR tests can be done for a fee at most hospitals.
If you test positive for COVID-19, you will be recommended to isolate for a five-day period. Authorities will recommend staying indoors for the whole period, aside from necessary visits to a hospital or pharmacy. Hospitalized patients who test positive will be recommended to isolate for at least seven days and up to 20 days, depending on a doctor’s decision. You may face additional costs from your travel provider if you have to rearrange your travel.
