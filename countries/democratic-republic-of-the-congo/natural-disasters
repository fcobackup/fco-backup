Volcanoes
At approximately 6:50pm local time on Saturday 22 May, Mount Nyiragongo volcano, close to the city of Goma, and near the border with Rwanda, began erupting. Lava flow has now slowed, but aftershocks of varying magnitude and frequency could continue for some time. Current assessments indicate there is no immediate risk to people in the city of Goma, but we recommend you take appropriate safety precautions against these tremors and remain vigilant. British nationals who are concerned should contact the British Embassy in Kinshasa online or by telephone on +243 81 556 6200. We continue to monitor the situation closely.
Mount Nyiragongo volcano is still active. The eruption in 2002 resulted in significant destruction in Goma. Local authorities, the UN and local NGOs continue to monitor the volcanoâ€™s activity.
Earthquakes
Earthquakes occasionally occur. On 7 August 2015 an earthquake of magnitude 5.6 hit eastern DRC, resulting in a small number of reported deaths and injuries in the town of Bukavu.
