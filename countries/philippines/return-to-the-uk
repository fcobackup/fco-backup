Commercial flights
There remains widespread disruption to international travel routes, and domestic flights Commercial options to return to the UK have been running throughout the lockdown period, but there remains widespread disruption to international travel routes, and domestic flights are severely limited.
The following airlines are operating international flights from Manila Ninoy Aquino International Airport, with connections to the UK. Flights are subject to change and you should contact the airline directly to confirm details:
Cathay Pacific via Hong Kong
Emirates via Dubai
Etihad via Abu Dhabi
Gulf Air via Bahrain
Korean Air via Seoul Incheon
Philippines Airlines direct to London Heathrow
Qatar Airways via Doha
You will need to pay for your return travel to the UK. If departure options are available but you cannot afford the travel costs and have exhausted all other options for getting funds, you may be eligible to apply for an emergency loan from the government. This is a last resort option and you would need to repay the loan when you are back in the UK. For more information, you should contact Corporate Travel Management (CTM). CTM are a commercial partner of the FCO and are authorised to administer such loans on behalf of the FCO.
Travel to departure airports for commercial flights
Resolution No.15 of the Philippines Inter-Agency Task Force grants that all stranded foreign nationals can travel to and from national government facilities such as airports, ferries, bus terminals etc.
If you plan to take a commercial flight but are experiencing difficulty travelling to the airport due to community quarantine restrictions, the British Embassy can provide a letter to facilitate your passage through checkpoints. You can submit your request to our Consular team via the web contact form. You can also seek assistance from your local Department of Tourism office, which may be able to offer advice on transport options or hotels.
Your journey home: re-entering the UK
When you return, you must follow the rules for entering the UK. You:
need to provide your journey and contact details up to 48 hours before you’re due to arrive in the UK
are not allowed to leave the place you’re staying for the first 14 days you’re in the UK except in very limited situations (known as ‘self-isolating’)
See also the list of people who are exempt from the border rules.
The National Travel Health Network and Centre (NaTHNaC) also provides advice on how to stay safe as you travel by air.
Future options
The British Embassy Manila is in contact with airlines, the Philippine authorities and other governments to make sure commercial options for returning to the UK remain open for as long as possible.
