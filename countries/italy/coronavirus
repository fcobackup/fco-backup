Travel in Italy
There are currently no “orange” or “red” regions but moving to and from “orange” and “red” regions will only be permitted for residents holding a “green certificate” confirming that they have been fully vaccinated against, or have recovered from, Covid-19. The “green certificate” will be valid for 6 months.
It is also possible to obtain a “green certificate” valid for 48 hours after testing negative to antigen or molecular swab tests.
Anyone falsifying a certificate is liable to face a fine of up to €3000 or a prison sentence.
All travellers entering Italy must comply with the regulations of the region they are visiting. Public transport links may be less frequent and seating limited to comply with social distancing measures. Masks must be worn on board public services. Taxi and car hire options are widely available.
More information on all these requirements is available from the Ministry of Health or the Agency for National Tourism.
Consult the European Union’s Re-Open EU page for rules on travelling within the EU.
Public spaces and services
Many of the restrictive coronavirus measures have now been eased. The following restrictions remain:
The mandatory use of masks in all outdoor spaces where social distancing is not possible, and whilst indoors. Children, under the age of 6, do not need to wear a mask. You should pay close attention to signage when travelling and carry a mask with you at all times
Social distancing of one metre must be observed and gatherings should be avoided
Cinemas, theatres and concert venues are open with limited capacity and pre-assigned seating
Museums and exhibits should be pre-booked at least one day in advance
Indoor parties are forbidden and dance clubs remain closed
Limited attendance to outdoor competitive group sports
Information on regional classifications, or on regional COVID zones is available on the Ministry of Health website (in English).
Regional and local authorities in Italy are empowered to adjust these measures where required, which may occur at short notice. You are strongly advised to consult the websites for the regions in which you are travelling for the latest information. You should also pay close attention to local signage.
You can find more information on measures on the Ministry of Health website (in English) and Frequently Asked Questions on the Ministry of Foreign Affairs website (in English).
Healthcare in Italy
If you need medical advice or believe you have symptoms of coronavirus you should contact your local GP, your local ASL (Azienda Sanitaria Locale) or one of the regional numbers listed on the Italian Ministry of Health website (in English) before visiting a health centre.
Tests for travel can be obtained from a private clinic as well as rapid testing in some pharmacies and, in some regions, drive-in testing is available. You are strongly advised to consult the website for the region from which you are travelling as test facilities vary across regions.
In some Italian regions, you may be required to take a coronavirus test if you spend 48 hours or two consecutive nights in a hospital for any reason. If you test positive, you will be required to quarantine, which may last from 10 days to 3 weeks.
In the case of an emergency you should call Italy’s 112 emergency number. English speaking operators are available.

COVID-19 vaccines if you live in Italy
Wherever possible British nationals should aim to be vaccinated in the country where they live. As further information is available about the national vaccination programme, this page will be updated. Sign up to get email notifications.
A phased vaccination programme was launched in Italy on 27 December. The Italian Medicines Agency (AIFA) has issued comprehensive information, on the vaccine and the documentation required to book an appointment.
Many regional authorities have launched on-line booking platforms and opened call centres for bookings. A tessera sanitaria number is required to book your appointment.
An interactive map (in Italian) details a list of vaccine administration points by region.
The Medicines and Healthcare Products Regulatory Agency (MHRA) is the UK authority responsible for assessing the safety, quality and efficacy of vaccines. It has authorised the Pfizer/BioNTech, Oxford/AstraZeneca and Moderna vaccines for temporary supply and use in the UK. Find out more about MHRA approval for these vaccines.
British nationals living overseas should seek medical advice from their local healthcare provider in the country where they reside. Information about vaccines used in other national programmes, including regulatory status, should be available from the local authorities. This list of Stringent Regulatory Authorities recognised by the World Health Organisation may also be a useful source of additional information. Find out more about COVID-19 vaccines on the World Health Organisation COVID-19 vaccines page.
