Forest fires
Chile is frequently affected by severe forest fires. These can be highly destructive and spread rapidly, causing National Park and road closures; this could affect your travel itinerary with short notice.
You should monitor local media for updates and follow the advice of local authorities. Avoid the areas they advise are at risk and follow evacuation procedures if instructed to by authorities.
For up to date information regarding locations and severity of forest fires, you can check the following websites: ONEMI - Oficina Nacional de Emergencias (Chilean National Emergencies Office) alerts, CONAF and FIRMS (Fire Information for Resource Management System).
Earthquakes
Serious earthquakes are always a possibility in Chile. You should familiarise yourself with safety procedures in the event of an earthquake or tsunami, and take note of instructions in hotel rooms. Building regulations require new structures to take account of seismic risks. Safety measures are widely known and put into practice by national organisations and the local authorities.
Volcanoes
A chain of volcanoes erupted in the Puyehue and Los Lagos region (500 miles south of Santiago) in June 2011 and are still active. There is a continuing risk of eruptions in Chaiten in southern Chile, Llaima in the Conguillo National Park and Lascar in northern Chile.  The Copahue Volcano on the Argentina/Chile border also erupts periodically, causing local residents to be evacuated. If youâ€™re travelling to these areas, monitor local media reports and follow the advice of the local authorities.
