Entry and borders
See Entry requirements to find out what you will need to do when you arrive in Cuba.
Visa extensions and departure
During the period of Cuban government coronavirus measures, visa extension requirements have been suspended while immigration offices have had limited services. If you are still in Cuba and your visa has expired or will expire while flights are suspended, you should keep in touch with the local immigration office; there is one in each municipality. All types of visas that have expired during Coronavirus measures will remain valid for 30 days after the suspension on commercial flights is lifted.
If you have dual British and Cuban nationality, you are subject to Cuban measures and should check your immigration status to clarify if you can leave Cuba while current travel restrictions are in place (and when flights resume). If you need permission to leave, you should get this from the immigration office in Havana; permission cannot be given at the airport.
Travel in Cuba
On 11 June, the Cuban Government set out three recovery phases that will gradually lift the measures in place. Havana was in phase one from 3 July. However, this ended on 10 August when stricter measures were re-introduced to control transmission in Havana, and further measures are being applied from 1 to 30 September (and may be extended). Anyone who does not follow the measures can be fined or prosecuted.
There is a difference in travel and transport services within Provinces, according to the different phases of the virus management or recovery plan. All inter-provincial transport is suspended between 13 and 30 September.
Face masks must be worn at all times when travelling on buses and in taxis.
The Cayos
If you’re arriving on an international holiday charter flight to the Cayos, you will be transported to your resort by bus and must wear a mask during the transfer.
Check with your tour operator and seek local advice if you have questions about excursions to other parts of Cuba.
Havana
From 1 to 30 September (subject to decision to extend this further), people are only allowed out between 0500h and 1900h. All public and private transport services are suspended, and there are restrictions on private transport allowed.
There are no transport services and no journeys are allowed between Havana and other Provinces; police check points are in place.
There are taxis running to and from Havana airport. There will not be any train services until Havana is in phase 2.
Car rental is not allowed.
Other provinces
The Municipality of Ciego de Avila (in the Province of Ciego de Avila) is currently closed to traffic in and out, to observe a state of quarantine.
There are limited transport services in Mayabeque and Artemisa Provinces (in phase two) and less in Bauta Municipality in Artemisa Province and Ciego de Avlia Province (phase one), with limited passenger numbers allowed.
Car rental is not allowed in Havana, Mayabeque or Artemisa.
For all other Provinces in phase three (i.e. not Havana, Artemisa, Ciego de Avila or Mayabeque), transport services within the Provinces have restarted. Only passengers with tickets are allowed to enter bus stations.
Inter-provincial transport is suspended between 13 and 30 September.
Accommodation
International tourists arriving on international charter flights are allowed into the hotels in the five Cayos. See Entry requirements for more information on these flights.
Hotels and guest houses are starting to reopen for Cubans and foreign residents of Cuba (known as ‘national tourism’) but to a limited occupancy (between 30 and 50%). Guests going to hotels must have a PCR test 48 hours in advance. Guests may have to wear face masks in some hotel facilities. Medical teams may visit to check on health of guests, including taking their temperature.
Campsites are also starting to reopen to a limited capacity.
Hotels must limit the numbers of people using facilities at any one time, especially swimming pools and elevators.
Public spaces and services
Wearing a face mask in public is compulsory as is social distancing of a minimum of one metre.
Between 1 and 30 (subject to decision to extend this further) September, shops in Havana will be open only between 0900h and 1600 between Monday and Saturday, and between 0900h and 1300h on Sunday. You are only allowed to go to shops within the Municipality where you are staying.
Shops in all Provinces can open but must limit the number of customers within the shop. This means there are queues to enter shops.
Cafés, bars and restaurants in Havana are only open for take away service, and those services may be further reduced between 1 and 30 September in line with other measures. In other provinces, they may re-open but must limit the opening hours, the number of customers and separate tables by 1.5 metres. No dancing is allowed during phase one or phase two of the recovery plan.
The re-opening measures below apply to all of Cuba except for Havana and Ciego de Avila Municipality, where stricter measures have been re-introduced and such venues are closed again:
Public parks will be open.
Social clubs, gyms, museums, etc can re-open to a limited capacity and visitors must observe social distancing.
Swimming pools can open to a limited capacity and to restricted visit times, to allow cleaning for the next opening times.
Beaches are open but limited numbers of people are allowed during phase one and phase two. There will be personnel at the beaches to manage access.
Churches are also able to re-open for services.
In Havana, between 1 and 30 September, no outdoor exercise is allowed and anyone who organises a party will be prosecuted.
Provinces in Phase three of the recovery plan (currently all except Havana, Artemisa, Ciego de Avila and Mayabeque), can start to re-open theatres and cinemas and hold some sporting events.
