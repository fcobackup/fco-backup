Travel in the Netherlands
The latest information on Dutch domestic coronavirus measures can be found on the Dutch government website (in English).
Non-medical face masks must be worn on public transport if you are aged 13 and over. If you do not wear a face mask on public transport you can be fined €95. In stations, on platforms and at bus and tram stops face masks are not required, but you must stay 1.5 metres away from others. Buses, trains, trams and metros can now operate at full capacity. However, you should avoid using public transport during peak hours.
For other shared forms of transport, such as taxis, passenger vans and coaches, reservations should be made in advance and you must wear a non-medical face mask.
If you’re travelling in a car or other private vehicle, you are advised to wear non-medical face masks if there are two or more people in the vehicle who belong to different households.
On other forms of transport, you must stay 1.5 metres apart.
Schiphol, Eindhoven and Rotterdam Airports
All passengers and staff aged 13+ are urged to wear face masks in all areas of these airports. The terminals are only open for passengers and staff. You must not be accompanied into the airport, unless absolutely necessary for a traveller with reduced mobility.
Ferries
The wearing of face masks is mandatory on board ferries and in ferry terminals. Check with your operator for details before travelling.
DFDS
All travellers must wear face coverings at check-in, whilst boarding, and during disembarkation. This applies for both foot- and car passengers, as well as freight drivers. DFDS also highly encourages travellers to wear face coverings whilst moving around the ship. Face coverings do not need to be worn when travellers are in their cabins, seated in a socially distanced manner or whilst social distancing on outside decks.
P&O
All travellers must wear a face mask during their journey.
Public Spaces and Services
New national measures came into effect on 29 September to address a rise in the number of coronavirus infections. These measures will be in effect untill at least 20 October.
Rules indoors
You can host no more than 3 guests in your home, garden or on your balcony. This is in addition to members of your own household and does not include children under the age of 13.
In other buildings, no more than 4 people can form a group. This does not include children under the age of 13.
The number of people in a room (e.g. a restaurant or cinema) is limited to 30 people.
Establishments serving food and drink can accept no new customers after 9pm and must be closed by 10pm.
Sports clubhouses will be closed.
Restaurants, cafés and bars must ask guests to provide their names and contact details for contact tracing by the municipal health service (GGD) in the event someone is infected.
Indoor spaces with a continuous flow of visitors, such as historic buildings, libraries and museums – but not retail businesses and markets – must operate using reservations on the basis of time slots.
People working in contact-based industries must ask their customers to provide their names and contact details.
Rules outdoors
Numbers for outdoor activities where there is no continuous flow of people are limited to 40. This includes children under 13 but excludes staff.
Travel should be kept to a minimum
More information on these measures can be found on the Dutch government website (in English). In addition, the wearing of a non-medical face mask in public indoor spaces (e.g. supermarkets) is strongly advised in the regions of Amsterdam, Rotterdam-Rijnmond, Haaglanden (The Hague) and Brabant-Zuidoost.
You should check the latest local information before travelling, as individual regions might have imposed extra measures.
You must stay 1.5 metres away from other people. This applies to everyone over the age of 18: in the street, in shops and other buildings. It does not apply to family members or other people that you live with and it does not apply if you are providing assistance to someone, for example pushing a wheelchair. If you notice that it is becoming difficult to keep a distance of 1.5 metres, you should leave. Avoid busy places in general, as if a gathering poses a safety or public health risk, enforcement officers can take action.
