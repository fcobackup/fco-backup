Earthquakes
Small tremors are recorded several times a month throughout the year without consequences. To learn more about what to do before, during and after an earthquake, visit the website of the US Federal Emergency Management Agency.
On 29 December 2020, a 6.4 magnitude earthquake hit the region of Petrinja near Sisak, in central Croatia, causing extensive damage to buildings and infrastructure and loss of life. There have been frequent aftershocks. Therefore common sense should be used when travelling to Petrinja, Sisak and neighbouring areas. An extensive repair and recovery operation is underway. Roads and pavements remain hazardous, including in the capital Zagreb, due to the risk of further falling debris.
Forest fires
Forest fires are very common during Croatia’s hot and dry summers. Take care when visiting or driving through woodland and forest areas. Make sure cigarette ends are properly extinguished, don’t light barbecues and don’t leave any rubbish, particularly empty bottles, behind.
Floods
Flash floods can occur with very little warning and can lead to dangerous water flows and disruption to transport and other networks. You should keep a close eye on weather forecasts and follow the advice of local authorities.
Monitor media reports and follow the advice of the local authorities if a forest fire, earthquake, floods or other natural disaster occurs in your area.
