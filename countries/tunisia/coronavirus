Local measures
A countrywide curfew came into effect on 18 March from 6pm to 6am. All schools and nurseries are closed, as are all cafés and restaurants. All sporting fixtures, conferences, public prayers and events have been cancelled. An “obligatory confinement period” came into effect from 22 March. During this period, between 6am and 6pm, people are only expected to leave their house for essential business such as grocery shopping or medical care. The Tunisian government has also prohibited travel between cities and regions and has announced the closure of factories.
