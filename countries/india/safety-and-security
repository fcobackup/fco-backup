Warning
FCDO advises against all travel to parts of India.

This guide also has safety advice for regions of India.
Terrorism
There is a high threat of terrorist attack globally affecting UK interests and British nationals, including from groups and individuals who view the UK and British nationals as targets. Stay aware of your surroundings at all times.   
UK Counter Terrorism Policing has information and advice on staying safe abroad and what to do in the event of a terrorist attack. Find out how to reduce your risk from terrorism while abroad.
Terrorism in India
Terrorists are very likely to try to carry out attacks in India.
There is a heightened risk of terrorism in some Indian regions. Read our advice on regional risks in India for more information.   
Terrorist and insurgent groups operating in India include:
Lashkar-e-Tayyiba (LET) and Jaish-e-Mohammed (JEM) in Kashmir
Naxalite (radical communist insurgent) groups active in some of the India’s eastern, southern and central states
Khalistani extremists operating mainly in Punjab
Daesh, Al Qa’ida in the Indian Subcontinent (AQIS) and other groups may also be planning attacks
Terrorist attacks have targeted Indian government interests and civilians, including tourists and foreign nationals. Security has been strengthened, including at major hotels and transport hubs. However, terrorist attacks could be indiscriminate, including in places visited by foreign nationals, such as:
restaurants, hotels, bars and markets
stations and airports
places of worship and tourist attractions
festivals, sports venues and beaches
Take particular care during periods of national or religious significance, such as:
Republic Day (26 January)
Independence Day (15 August)
Diwali (usually in October or November)
Eid (date changes each year)
Stay aware of your surroundings and keep up to date with local media reports. It is advisable to always carry identity documents and follow the advice of local authorities.
Political situation
Strikes (sometimes referred to as ‘bandh’ or ‘hartal’), political rallies and demonstrations happen frequently and can become violent. The risks are higher during elections and after the death of party or government leaders. Protests may also happen at short notice, especially around days of national importance. Local authorities may impose curfews and other restrictions. Transport and public services including mobile networks and internet may be disrupted.
You should:
avoid protests or large gatherings, including at religious sites
follow the advice of the local authorities and your travel company
monitor local media and follow any curfew restrictions
Crime
If you’re the victim of crime in India, call:
police helpline: 100
national emergency number: 112
women helpline: 1091
Protecting your belongings
Keep a copy of your passport, visa and flight ticket separately from originals when travelling. Leave copies at home where others can access them, and store copies electronically. If your passport is lost or stolen, tell the police immediately and get a police report. You will need the police report for your exit visa application.  
Take care of your possessions on buses, trains and in crowds. Criminals may ride past on motorbikes and snatch valuables.
Be cautious in tourist areas, where scammers, pickpockets and ticket touts target foreign nationals.
Scams
Cybercrime, internet scamming, card skimming and confidence scams are common. These scams come in many forms and can cause great financial loss.
Criminals often use the details of British high commissions and embassies. Be cautious and check the authenticity of details before responding.
Drink and food spiking
Be wary of accepting drinks or food from strangers or leaving drinks unattended. There have been reports of spiked drinks and food, with British nationals being robbed or assaulted.
Sexual assault
There is a risk of sexual assault, including attacks on female foreign national visitors in tourist areas and cities.
Female travellers often experience verbal and physical harassment by individuals or groups of men. Serious sexual attacks involving both Indian and foreign nationals have been reported. British women have been victims of sexual assault, including rape, in multiple states in India. Avoid isolated areas, including beaches, when alone at any time of day.
See advice for women travelling abroad.
Laws and cultural differences
Dress code
Respect local dress and customs, particularly when visiting religious sites and rural areas. 
Alcohol laws and bans
Laws on alcohol, including buying, drinking and the legal drinking age, vary by state. Get advice from your travel agent, hotel or the authorities about the laws in areas you are visiting.
It is illegal to drink alcohol in public places, such as parks.
In some states, foreign nationals and non-resident Indians can buy 30-day alcohol permits.
There is often a ban on the sale of alcohol during major religious festivals, national holidays and elections.
The consumption, production or transportation of alcohol is illegal in:
Bihar
Gujarat
Mizoram
Nagaland
the region of Lakshadweep
If you drink or possess alcohol in these states, you could be arrested and held without bail. You could face a prison sentence of 5 to 10 years.
Smoking and e-cigarette bans
It is illegal to smoke in most public places. Only smoke in designated smoking areas.
E-cigarettes and related products are banned. You cannot buy e-cigarettes in India or bring them into the country.
Illegal drugs and prison sentences
Do not get involved with any illegal drugs. Drugs are not categorised as they would be in the UK, into Class A, B and C and possession of any illegal drug could lead to sentencing. You could face a minimum sentence of 6 months for possession of small amounts deemed for personal consumption only, up to a 10-year sentence for other amounts. The judicial process is slow, and you could be detained for several years while your case is processed.
Using cameras and binoculars in secure areas
Activities involving cameras and binoculars, like photography, birdwatching or plane spotting, may be misunderstood. Be particularly careful near military sites, government buildings, airports and railway stations.
Satellite phones and other devices  
It is illegal to possess and operate satellite phones and GPS devices in India without a licence, even if you are only transiting through India. This may also cover other satellite-enabled devices, including handheld or cycling GPSs. You can be fined or arrested for possession of these devices without permission and the item can be confiscated.
A number of British nationals have been arrested or detained for bringing satellite phones and other satellite-enabled navigational devices into the country without prior permission. Contact the Indian Department of Telecommunication to request a licence. Further information is also available at the Bureau of Civil Aviation Security.
Swimming safety
There are strong currents off many coasts and people drown every year. Most beaches do not have warning signs, flags or lifesaving equipment. Take local advice and follow warnings and instructions issued by lifeguards. Emergency service standards may differ from those in the UK.  
See water safety on holiday from the Royal Life Saving Society.
Trekking in India
Trekkers should:
travel in groups
use reputable local guides and stay on established routes
check if you need any special permits
Leave details of where you’re going and when you expect to return with your accommodation. You are extremely unlikely to have a phone signal in the mountains, so make sure your accommodation provider registers your whereabouts using the online C-form.
It is illegal to possess or operate satellite phones without prior permission of the Indian authorities.
Hazards when trekking exist throughout the year, especially above 3,000 metres, including:
altitude sickness
sudden weather changes, including thunderstorms
avalanches and snow drifts
landslides, flooding and rock falls
Make sure your insurance policy covers you for altitudes over 2,400m and mountain rescue and helicopter costs.
There are no commercial mountain rescue services operating above 3,000m. In some border areas only the Indian Air Force can carry out air rescues. However, they are under no obligation to perform them and only carry out rescues during working hours.
LGBT+ travellers
Same-sex sexual relationships are legal in India. However same-sex marriage is illegal. Indian society is conservative. This includes attitudes to LGBT+ people, which can be less accepting than in the UK. There is a risk of harassment and discrimination, especially outside of big cities. Showing affection in public may attract unwanted and negative attention.
See more advice for LGBT+ travellers.
Child custody and family law
Indian family law is very different from UK law. Special caution is needed when child custody becomes an issue. In case of dispute, consult a lawyer in India to find out more about the relevant laws.
Commercial surrogacy is illegal for foreign nationals in India. Overseas Citizens of India (OCI) can seek legal guidance on surrogacy if at least one partner is an Indian passport holder.
Wildlife, animal products and souvenirs
It is illegal to buy, sell, kill or capture any protected wild animal or trade its parts without a licence. India has a strong legal framework to regulate and restrict wildlife trade and is also a signatory to the Convention on International Trade in Endangered Species of Wild Fauna and Flora (CITES). If you’re caught purchasing or trafficking these illegally, you will be prosecuted and receive a prison sentence or fine.
Sexual offences against children
There are severe penalties for any form of sexual offence against a child. There is a minimum jail term of 20 years, which may go up to life in prison or a death sentence, for anyone convicted of raping a child aged 12 or under.
Transport risks
Driving in India
If you are planning to drive in India, see information on driving abroad.
You’ll need to have both the 1949 version of the international driving permit (IDP) and your UK driving licence with you in the car. You cannot buy an IDP outside the UK, so get one before you travel.
Rules on how long you can drive on a UK licence vary from state to state.
Road safety
India has a high death rate from road accidents. Comply with the police if they are at the scene. If the police are not present, it could be unsafe to remain at the scene. If safe to do so, go to the nearest police station.
Driving can be dangerous in urban and rural areas due to wandering livestock. Accidents involving cows can draw crowds and potentially lead to violence. Anyone in the vehicle involved may be attacked or targeted for extortion. It is common to use your horn or flash your headlights frequently to announce your presence on the road.
Avoid travelling at night and in fog as accidents are common due to low visibility and there is a higher risk of crime at night. Always travel in a well-maintained vehicle.
If you travel by motorbike, wear a helmet and proper footwear.
Buses are often driven fast and recklessly. Accidents are common.
Be careful when crossing streets, even in marked pedestrian areas and especially at night, as vehicles sometimes drive on the wrong side of the road.
Taxis and rickshaws
Avoid travelling alone and hailing taxis on the street, especially at night. App-based taxis like Uber and Ola are widely available, including in all airport terminal buildings. Pre-paid taxi services are also available and many hotels offer transfers. If a hotel driver is collecting you at the airport by, make sure they properly identify themselves before you set off.
If you book a taxi online, there’s usually a way to share journey details with your contacts who can then follow your location.
Seatbelts are not common in 3-wheel taxis (autos) or in the back seats of taxis. Try to use taxis that have seatbelts.
Air travel
When travelling through an airport, allow enough time to complete check-in and security procedures, as your baggage may need to go through screening equipment and checks. Allow time for transiting between flights if you need to change from international terminals to domestic terminals, even if using the airport shuttle service.
If you arrive on a charter flight booked through a tour operator, you can only fly into and out of the country with the same charter operator. Chartered flight passengers are not allowed to fly into or out of the country using a scheduled airline. 
Rail travel
Train travel in India is generally safe, however accidents happen and have previously resulted in death and serious injury. There are police or guards on trains and stations if you need help.
When travelling by train:
do not accept food or drinks from strangers
take care of your passport and valuables as thefts are common
avoid people at railway stations offering tickets and tours as you may be scammed
Sea travel
Tourist boats and other small craft rarely carry life-saving equipment.
Although piracy has not so far affected India’s territorial waters, it poses a significant threat in parts of the Indian Ocean. Mariners should follow shipping industry guidelines on precautions to take.
Ships and crew must have the necessary authorisation and paperwork before entering Indian territorial waters and follow Indian laws and regulations. If carrying weapons on board ships in Indian territorial waters, you must follow Indian laws and regulations.
Extreme weather and natural disasters
India can experience extreme weather events that threaten life and disrupt infrastructure, including buildings, roads and communications.
Find out what you can do to prepare for and respond to extreme weather and natural hazards.
You should:
plan your travel so that you are aware of seasonal weather events, such as monsoon rains
follow the advice of local authorities and your travel company
check the Indian Meteorological Department for weather updates
Monsoons
The monsoon season in India usually runs from June to October. Monsoon rains can cause:
flooding and landslides, sometimes leading to significant loss of life
towns and villages to be cut off
serious disruption to road and train travel
disruption in big cities due to flooding
disruption to services including telephone lines, internet services and electricity
Cyclones and tropical storms
Tropical cyclones are a risk in India, particularly in:
the east coast of India, from September to December
the Bay of Bengal, from April to June and September to December
south India, from June to November
Tropical cyclones can cause:
high winds, which can damage or destroy buildings, bring down trees and power and telephone lines
storm surges, which can cause a temporary rise in sea level of several metres which can flood coastal areas and damage buildings on the shoreline
heavy rainfall, which can cause flooding and mudslides
Earthquakes
Several parts of India lie on highly active fault zones, including areas of the north and north-east. The most active are along the length of the Himalayas. Tremors are common in these regions and can cause landslides. Limited emergency response vehicles, equipment and medical facilities could increase an earthquake’s impact.
The US Federal Emergency Management Agency website has advice about what to do before, during and after an earthquake.
