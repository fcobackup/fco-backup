Return to the UK
The UK is operating a special flight from Norman Manley International Airport, Kingston, Jamaica on 7 May to London Heathrow Airport.
This flight will cost £367 per person.
To be eligible to take this flight, you must be a British national normally resident in the UK, returning from employment or have a medical or other compelling reason to travel. Also eligible are Jamaican and other nationals who are dependents of (and t travelling with) a British national with appropriate visas.
While we will be prioritising British nationals, we will also be making tickets available to those nationals who have Indefinite Leave to Remain and who have not been outside the UK for more than one year. The most vulnerable will be prioritised.
Your eligibility will be checked before your tickets are issued. If you wish to travel, register to book tickets on the CTM website https://etm.eventsair.com/fco-jamaica/fco-jamaicacharter1418/Site/Register as soon as possible.
If you have difficulty booking online, you can text CTM on +44 7537 416 124 with your name and you will receive a call back.
To book flights you will need:
full passport and contact details for each traveller you are registering
your UK home address and postcode
your means of payment, such as credit or debit card details
Pets are not to be taken on the flight. Baggage will be limited to 2 x 20kg hold luggage and 10kg hand luggage.
Your place on a flight is not confirmed until you receive an email confirmation telling you so.
Tickets will not be on sale at the airport. Do not travel to the airport without a confirmed ticket.
If you cannot afford the travel costs and have exhausted all other options for getting funds, a British citizen may be eligible to apply for an emergency loan from the government. This is a last resort option and you would need to repay the loan when you are back in the UK. For more information, you should contact Corporate Travel Management (CTM) via SMS on +44 7537 416 124 to receive a call back. CTM are a commercial partner of the FCO and are authorised to administer such loans on behalf of the FCO.
Any bookings you may already have with another airline cannot be transferred for this special charter fight.
Travel to the airport
When travelling to the airport carry printed copies of your flight confirmation and have your passport easily to hand. You should be at the airport by no later than 13.00hrs. You will not be able to check in after 15.00. The curfew implemented by the Government of Jamaica prohibiting travel between 18.00 - 06.00hrs is still in place.
You will need to make your own travel arrangements to the airport and onward journey home when you reach London.
Future travel options
There are currently extremely limited commercial options available to return to the UK from Jamaica.
The flight on 7 May will be the only UK Government organised special flight from Jamaica. If you do not board the flight on 7 May you are encouraged to make indirect travel arrangements via the USA or Canada if possible but you may have to wait before a flight becomes available. You should refer to those countries’ restrictions before travelling to ensure that you will be allowed to enter the country for onward connection.
Currently no airlines are scheduled to fly to the USA or Canada in May.
