Flooding
High waters known as “acqua alta” are a common occurrence in Venice during the winter months and can cause flooding in parts of the city. You should monitor local media and weather reports and follow the advice of local authorities in affected areas. More information is available on the website of the Civil Protection Department.
Forest fires
Forest fires are a risk during the extended summer months. Forest fires are highly dangerous and unpredictable; check with local authorities if you’re considering travelling to affected areas. Take care when visiting or driving through woodland areas and report fires to the emergency services. You can also visit the website of the Civil Protection Department.
Earthquakes
Many parts of Italy lie on a major seismic fault line. Minor tremors and earthquakes are a regular occurrence. To learn more about what to do before, during, and after an earthquake visit the Protezione Civile website.
Due to Mount Etna’s recent volcanic eruption, a series of earthquakes and earth tremors are affecting the Catania area and the eastern part of the island of Sicily. This seismic activity is expected to continue until the volcanic activity subsides. Local authorities are monitoring the situation and providing updates via their website (in Italian). If you intend to travel to affected areas, you should follow their advice. You should also check the Catania Airport website for flight updates before travel. For more details, see the National Centre for Earthquakes website (in Italian).
Since 14 August 2018, there have also been a number of localised earthquakes in the Molise region of Italy, near the town of Montecilfone. Several strong earthquakes were felt in central Italy in 2016, 2017 and 2018.
