The FCDO advises against all but essential travel to:
the whole of Poland based on the current assessment of COVID-19 risks.
If you are returning to the UK from Poland, you will need to self-isolate on your return (unless you are exempt). Check the latest guidance for England, Northern Ireland, Scotland and Wales.
Travel is subject to entry restrictions
UK nationals, their spouses and children are included in the Polish Border Guards list of those who are exempt from entry restrictions related to COVID-19.
There are separate entry requirements for those who are resident in Poland. If you are resident in Poland, you should carry proof of residence as well as your valid passport when you travel.
Flights between the UK and Poland are permitted.
You are required to self-isolate on arrival in Poland if you enter by public transport, or have coronavirus symptoms, or have come into contact with someone who has, unless you have a negative COVID test result issued within 48 hours before crossing the Polish border.
See Entry requirements for more information before you plan to travel.
Preparing for your return journey to the UK
If you’re returning to the UK from overseas, you will need to:
provide your journey and contact details before you travel
