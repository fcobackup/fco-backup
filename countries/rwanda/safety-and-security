Local travel
The eastern part of the Democratic Republic of Congo (DRC) which neighbours Rwanda remains unstable, and conflict can flare up with little notice. There have been incidents of violent clashes on the DRC-Rwanda border in recent years, and armed incursions into the southwest of Rwanda.
If you plan to visit areas close to the DRC or Burundi borders, such as popular tourist destinations including Volcanoes and Nyungwe National Parks, you should be alert to the risks and exercise caution. All travellers should keep up to date with developments on the current situation, including via your tour operator, the local media and this travel advice.
On Saturday 22 May, Mount Nyiragongo volcano in Democratic Republic of Congo (DRC), close to the city of Goma, and near the border with Rwanda, began erupting. Lava flow has now slowed, but aftershocks of varying magnitude and frequency could continue for some time, including in Rwanda. Current assessments indicate there is no immediate risk to people on either side of the border but we recommend you take appropriate safety precautions against these tremors and remain vigilant. We continue to monitor the situation closely. You should follow the instructions of local authorities.
The land border crossings between Rwanda and the DRC at Gisenyi/Goma and Cyangugu/Bukavu are usually open between 6am and 6pm, but currently remain closed due to COVID-19 with limited exceptions. Both borders are liable to close at short notice and you should not rely on them as a point of exit from DRC.
If you’re crossing regularly between Rwanda and the DRC you may encounter immigration difficulties if you have not regularised your residency status.
The situation in Burundi remains volatile. Tensions along the Rwanda/Burundi border remain heightened, with allegations from both sides of cross-border raids targeting local inhabitants.
In July 2016, Burundi banned public transport vehicles from crossing the border with Rwanda.
Gorilla trekking
Gorilla trekking has resumed in the Volcanoes National Park.
If you plan to travel close to the border with the DRC you should remain aware of the risks, exercise caution, and keep up to date with developments on the current situation, including via your tour operator, the local media and this travel advice.
Grenade attacks
Grenade attacks have occurred sporadically over the last five years. Genocide memorial sites, markets, bus stops, and taxis have been targets in Kigali and Ruhengeri (Musanze). The most recent grenade attack was on 7 May 2020 in Kimironko in Kigali, which killed one person in a hair salon. While such attacks have reduced in frequency, further indiscriminate attacks cannot be ruled out, including in places frequented by foreigners. You should remain vigilant.
Crime
Levels of crime remain relatively low in Rwanda, but there are cases of burglary, theft, bag snatching and mugging in Kigali.
You should take sensible precautions. Take care when walking at night. Pre-arrange transport. Lock car doors when driving, don’t leave valuables in cars when parked and don’t leave cars unsupervised in the town centre. Don’t carry large amounts of money or other valuables.
Some off-limits military zones in Kigali may not be well-lit or signposted. You should take extra care when walking around less populated zones, particularly at night time.
Road travel
You can drive using a UK driving licence or an International Driving Permit for up to one year, after which you should apply for a Rwandan licence. To apply for a local driving licence, you need to write a letter of application to the Commissioner Traffic and Road Safety attaching your existing licence and a copy of your visa or Foreign Resident ID card, and pay a fee.
Roads from Kigali to all major towns are good. There can be landslides during the annual rains in late spring and autumn. Avoid road travel after dark as roads are unlit and driving standards are poor.
Shared taxis (mini-vans) and motorbike taxis are the most common form of public transport within towns and around the country. However, they are also the most vulnerable to accidents.
Public transport may be affected by COVID-19 prevention measures. See Coronavirus
Air travel
Before using internal or regional flights that are not with major international carriers, you should check the airline’s accreditation and see whether the airline operates in line with the International Civil Aviation Organisation’s (ICAO) safety standards.
Health and safety
Levels of health and safety in Rwanda are lower than in the UK. There have been incidences of buildings and construction sites collapsing, causing deaths and serious injuries. Fire safety standards are also variable, with incidences of fire in residential and public places a continuing risk.
There have been a number of building fires apparently caused by poor wiring and substandard electrical cables. Take extra care when using electronic equipment.
