There are severe penalties for drug trafficking (15 to 20 years in prison and a very large fine) and drug use (from three to nine months in a rehabilitation centre). Honduran prisons are overcrowded and violent.
Homosexuality is not illegal, although currently there are no provisions in Honduran legislation guaranteeing freedom from discrimination on the grounds of sexual orientation. There is no recognition of same-sex marriage in Honduras. Local people are largely tolerant of individualsâ€™ personal lifestyles and small displays of affection between same-sex couples are accepted. There is a more conservative attitude outside Tegucigalpa City and public displays of affection by same-sex couples are not recommended. See our information and advice page for the LGBT community before you travel.
