From 27 March, Turkish Airlines will only operate flights to five locations: Hong Kong, Moscow, Addis Ababa, New York and Washington. There are currently no direct repatriation flights scheduled from Turkey to the UK.
You will not be allowed to leave the airside area when transiting Turkey. If transiting Turkey with hold luggage you should ensure that both sections of your flights are with airlines which are part of the same airline alliance group and booked on one ticket. You cannot enter Turkey to collect hold luggage from one flight to be re-checked in on another. Those without hold luggage (just hand luggage) should still be able to transit on two separate tickets, as you do not have to leave the airside area.
You should check with your airline before travelling.
All passengers holding Turkish residence permits entering Turkey who have been in a banned country in the preceding 14 days will be tested on arrival for coronavirus. A positive test will lead to the passenger going straight to a government-run quarantine facility. A negative test will lead to mobility restrictions â€“ either self-isolation or full quarantine for 14 days. Land crossings with Greece, Bulgaria, Georgia, Iran and Iraq have also been closed.
You should carry additional supplies of necessary medication in carry-on luggage.
Keep up to date with information from your tour operator, transport or accommodation provider on the impact on any existing travel plans. Delays at airports are possible.
