Be prepared for your plans to change
No travel is risk-free during COVID-19. Countries may further restrict travel or bring in new rules at short notice, for example due to a new COVID-19 variant. Check with your travel company or airline for any transport changes which may delay your journey home.
If you test positive for COVID-19, you may need to stay where you are until you test negative. You may also need to seek treatment there.
Plan ahead and make sure you:
can access money
understand what your insurance will cover
can make arrangements to extend your stay and be away for longer than planned
Travel in Romania
Travel to/from airport or other port of arrival
Due to movement restrictions in place, when travelling to the airport make sure you carry:
your passport
your flight ticket
Road transit across or through Romania is possible although we recommend against all travel to Ukraine.
Carry your passport at all times.
Accommodation
Hotels, guesthouses, camping units have been allowed to open, but only when observing a specific set health-safety of rules.
Public spaces and services
With the ending of the State of Alert there are no longer restrictions related to mask wearing, shop and restaurant opening, public events, concerts and conferences. It is no longer a legal requirement to wear a medical-grade mask in all indoor and outdoor public spaces. It is no longer necessary to show proof of your vaccination or recovery status to access restaurants and events.
The Minister of Health recommends that people continue to wear a mask in crowded outdoor spaces, public transport and indoor spaces, and to avoid overcrowded places. Further recommendations include taking a test if symptomatic and self-isolating if positive. Recommendations are not legally enforceable.
