The Foreign, Commonwealth & Development Office (FCDO) advises against all travel to:
Within 25km of Eritrea’s land borders, with the exceptions of: the town of Tessenei; the border crossings at Debay Sima – Burre, plus the main paved roads leading to those crossings.
The FCDO advises against all but essential travel to:
the remainder of Eritrea based on the current assessment of COVID-19 risks
Travel to Eritrea is subject to entry restrictions
There are no legal entry points into Eritrea for normal travellers. The international airport in Asmara closed on 26 March as a precaution against COVID-19. It is not known when it will re-open and entry will be allowed.
All land borders are closed and are not expected to re-open in the near future
See Entry requirements for more information before you plan to travel.
Preparing for your return journey to the UK
If you’re returning to the UK from overseas, you will need to:
provide your journey and contact details before you travel
check if you need to self-isolate on your return
Check our advice on foreign travel during the coronavirus (COVID-19) pandemic and sign up for email alerts for this travel advice.
If you’re planning travel to Eritrea, find out what you need to know about coronavirus there in the Coronavirus section.
During the COVID-19 pandemic, it is more important than ever to get travel insurance and check it provides sufficient cover. See the FCDO’s guidance on foreign travel insurance.
Explosions were reported in Asmara on 14 November at around 20:00 local time. These are believed to be related to the ongoing military conflict in Tigray, Ethiopia. You should exercise extreme caution; stay away from government and military sites and airports wherever possible; and comply with the instructions of the authorities.
All border crossings between Ethiopia and Eritrea are currently closed. See Local travel
The Eritrean authorities have introduced a number of measures to limit the spread of the virus, including closure of Asmara International Airport. See Entry requirements
All foreign nationals, including diplomats, must apply in advance for a travel permit to leave the Asmara region. See Travel permits and Consular assistance.
The Eritrean authorities consider all British nationals holding either Eritrean or PFDJ identity documents (including out of date documents) as Eritrean nationals.
Consular support is severely limited in parts of Eritrea. Constraints on travel within Eritrea means the British Embassy in Asmara is unable to offer consular assistance to British nationals outside the greater Asmara area easily. The British Embassy is unable to offer consular assistance to dual nationals in Eritrea. See Dual nationals.
Although there’s no recent history of terrorism in Eritrea, attacks can’t be ruled out. See Terrorism.
As a result of the closure of the borders, the cost of some basic foodstuffs has risen dramatically and imported goods are becoming increasingly hard to find.
If you’re abroad and you need emergency help from the UK government, contact the nearest British embassy, consulate or high commission.
