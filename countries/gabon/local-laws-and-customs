The Gabon Penal Code criminalises consensual same-sex sexual relations. Under the law, same-sex sexual relations is punishable with up to six months in prison and a fine of up to 5 million CFA francs. Same-sex couples and households headed by same-sex couples are not eligible for the same legal protections available to opposite-sex couples. There’s no legal protection against discrimination based on sexual orientation. Gabon remains a conservative society and discrimination can be a problem for those open about their sexual identity. Same-sex marriage isn’t recognised in Gabon. See our information and advice page for the LGBT community before you travel.
Taking photographs of military sites and government buildings is forbidden.
