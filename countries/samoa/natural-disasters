Samoa is located in a seismic zone called the “Ring of Fire” and is subject to earthquakes.
An earthquake of magnitude 8.3 struck Samoa on 29 September 2009, which triggered a devastating tsunami.
The tropical cyclone season normally runs from November to the end of April. Flooding can occur.  Monitor local and international weather updates from World Meteorological Organisation (WMO), the Samoa Meteorology Division website or the Fiji Meteorological Service website. See our tropical cyclones page for advice about what to do if you’re caught up in a tropical cyclone.
