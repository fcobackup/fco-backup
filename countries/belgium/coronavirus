Returning to the UK
Travelling from and returning to the UK
Check what you must do to travel abroad and return to England, Scotland, Wales or Northern Ireland.
If you plan to pass through another country to return to the UK, check the travel advice for the country you’re transiting. If you will pass through a red list country, book your hotel quarantine package before travelling to the UK.
You are responsible for organising your own COVID-19 test, in line with UK government testing requirements. You should contact local authorities for information on testing facilities.
Be prepared for your plans to change
No travel is risk-free during COVID. Countries may further restrict travel or bring in new rules at short notice, for example due to a new COVID-19 variant. Check with your travel company or airline for any transport changes which may delay your journey home.
If you test positive for COVID-19, you may need to stay where you are until you test negative. Belgian authorities are likely to conduct calls to check you are quarantining. You may also need to seek treatment there.
Plan ahead and make sure you:
can access money
understand what your insurance will cover
make arrangements to quarantine at your hotel or the place you were staying (rules for what you can and cannot do during quarantine are found on the Belgian government’s website under ‘What should I do?’)
can make arrangements to extend your stay and be away for longer than planned
Public spaces and services
The Belgian Government has significantly eased COVID-19 restrictions. However, wearing a face mask remains mandatory on public transport and in healthcare facilities for those above 12 years old.

COVID-19 vaccines if you live in Belgium
We will update this page when the Government of Belgium announces new information on the national vaccination programme. You can sign up to get email notifications when this page is updated.
The Belgium national vaccine programme started in January 2021 and is using the Pfizer-BioNTech, Moderna, AstraZeneca and Janssen (Johnson and Johnson) vaccines. The Government of Belgium has stated that British nationals resident in Belgium are eligible for vaccination if they choose to join the programme. Further information on vaccinations can be found on the Belgian government COVID-19 vaccination website.
Find out more, including about vaccines that are authorised in the UK or approved by the World Health Organisation, on the COVID-19 vaccines if you live abroad.
If you’re a British national living in Belgium, you should seek medical advice from your local healthcare provider. Information about COVID-19 vaccines used in the national programme where you live, including regulatory status, should be available from local authorities.
If you receive your COVID-19 vaccination in Belgium, you can get an EU Digital COVID Certificate from the national authorities. The Certificate proves that you have been vaccinated against COVID-19, received a negative test result, or recovered from COVID-19. It will help facilitate your travel within the EU and, in some countries, you can use it to demonstrate your COVID-19 status to businesses and other organisations. For further information visit the European Commission’s EU Digital COVID Certificate page.
