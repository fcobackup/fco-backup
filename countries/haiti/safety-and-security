Crime
The security situation in Haiti remains highly unpredictable and, given the ongoing political crisis, could worsen further.
If you choose to travel to or stay in Haiti against FCDO advice, you should monitor local media and make sure you have robust contingency plans in place. Be vigilant at all times, keep others informed including family and friends of your travel plans and consider your necessary routes in advance.
The general security situation is unpredictable, and crime levels are high. There is usually an increase in criminality in the period leading up to the holiday season in December, the Carnival (in February or March) and the beginning of the school year (late August/early September). Theft, including armed robbery, purse snatching and pickpocketing, is common in Haiti. Criminal activity is especially prevalent in downtown Port-au-Prince, where armed gangs operate, and in Petion-Ville. The areas of Bel Air, Carrefour, Cité Soleil and Martissant have particularly high levels of criminality and gang activity. There is also a high level of criminal activity near the Haiti–Dominican Republic border.
Armed robbery is common. Victims are often attacked in broad daylight by armed thieves on motorcycles. Some attacks have resulted in fatalities. Single women drivers stuck in traffic jams have been targeted by armed assailants.
There have been kidnappings involving foreign nationals, including missionaries, aid workers and children. Most victims have been released upon the payment of a ransom. In some exceptional cases, however, victims have disappeared or have been killed. You should be vigilant across the country, remaining alert to small groups of loiterers, especially near your place of residence. Keep doors and windows secure at all times and be wary of inviting anyone into your residence who you do not know or were not expecting.
The long-standing policy of the British government is not to make substantive concessions to hostage takers. The British government considers that paying ransoms for the release of hostages increases the risk of further hostage taking.
Avoid using banks or withdrawing money at public cash points where you may be observed and become the target of criminals. If necessary, make withdrawals from cash machines in supermarkets or hotels with security guards. Always be aware of your surroundings and who might be watching you. Gangs, often on motorbikes, target people making cash withdrawals or leaving banks, particularly those travelling on foot.
Security guards are recommended at residential properties.
Local travel
The FCDO advise against all travel to Haiti due to the volatile security situation. UK government officials use an armoured vehicle and close protection when visiting Port-au-Prince.
The border between Haiti and the Dominican Republic is closed, this is liable to change at short notice, you should monitor local media for updates.
Road travel
Road travel is highly dangerous.
The security situation in Haiti remains volatile and armed gangs may set up road blocks sporadically to extort or kidnap motorists.
We advise against all travel to and around Haiti.
Air travel
A list of recent incidents and accidents can be found on the website of the Aviation Safety network.
The FCDO can’t offer advice on the safety of individual airlines. However, the International Air Transport Association publishes a list of registered airlines that have been audited and found to meet a number of operational safety standards and recommended practices. This list is not exhaustive and the absence of an airline from this list does not necessarily mean that it is unsafe.
Political situation
The political situation in Haiti is extremely fluid and unpredictable and demonstrations can become violent very quickly. You should avoid political rallies, demonstrations and crowds.
There have continued to be sporadic, unpredictable and sometimes violent demonstrations, protests and roadblocks in Port au Prince and throughout Haiti since July 2018. The movement of goods and people into and within the country is often disrupted due to blocked roads and security incidents. As a consequence, there are sometimes fuel and food shortages.
Communications
Mobile telephones are widely used and mobile data is available from some service providers (Digicel, Natcom). Signal reception varies greatly but is generally acceptable around Port-au-Prince and other cities. You can buy local SIM cards and prepaid cards in large towns.
