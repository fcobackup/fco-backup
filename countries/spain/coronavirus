Cases of coronavirus (COVID-19) have been confirmed in Spain. The Spanish authorities have introduced a number of measures to limit the spread of the virus.
If you’re currently in Spain, follow the advice of local authorities. Anybody planning to travel to Spain should consult their airline or tour operator and note that the FCO advises British nationals against all but essential international travel.

Spain declared a State of Emergency (“Estado de Alarma”) on 14 March, which introduces a series of measures including significant restrictions on movement throughout the country in response to the coronavirus outbreak.
Following further border restrictions, only British nationals who can prove they are resident in Spain or fall under other limited categories will be allowed to enter Spain. British travellers will continue to be allowed to leave Spain.
British travellers who are currently in Spain and who wish to return to the UK are advised to make travel plans to do so as soon as possible. For those returning to the UK by road via France, please ensure you check the travel advice for France
Accommodation
The Spanish government has ordered that hotels and short-stay accommodation (such as short-stay campsites or caravan parks) must close by midnight 26 March. These measures do not apply to long-term accommodation, such as long-stay campsites, as long as clients can cater for themselves, in their own spaces (i.e. that clients do not rely on communal facilities).
The Spanish government has published a list of accommodation in each region that will remain open during the State of Emergency. The list may be modified so we advise you to check with the hotels directly. Whilst this is mainly intended for key workers, the accommodation will also be available for tourists who have been unable to return home.
If you’re currently on holiday in Spain, check with your tour operator or accommodation provider for further information. If you’re travelling and wish to return to the UK, see Return to the UK
Air, land and sea borders
From Monday 23 March, for an initial period of 30 days (although it could be extended), only Spanish citizens or those who can prove they are resident in Spain, will be allowed to enter Spain through airports, ports or land borders. In order to enter Spain you may be required to show proof you are resident here such as a residency certificate or other form of ID with your Spanish home address on it.
British travellers will continue to be allowed to leave Spain. British travellers who are not resident in Spain, should not attempt to travel to enter Spain.
The following categories of people are also exempt from border restrictions:
Frontier workers
Health workers
Those who are transiting Spain to their country of residence in EU/Schengen area
Those with a Schengen visa who are transiting Spain to their country of residence in EU/Schengen area
Those who can prove that they need to enter Spain for essential reasons
These measures follow the restrictions on land borders which were introduced on Tuesday 17 March.
The land borders remain open for those leaving Spain. British nationals can still drive through France to return to the UK, but they will need to complete an ‘attestation’ (declaration) specifying the reason for being outside. If you’re planning to use this route, check the latest FCO travel advice for France ahead of your journey. In addition to the required ‘attestation’ you may also find this letter explaining the reason for your journey useful in both France and Spain, see Return to UK.
At present, airports remain open, but airlines are operating heavily reduced services. There are no passenger ferries currently operating between Spain and the UK. You should make alternative arrangements to return to the UK. For information on how to return to the UK from Spain, see Return to UK
Public places and transport
Public gatherings are banned, most shops other than those selling food or other essential items such as pharmacies will be closed, many businesses and all schools and universities are closed, and all citizens have been instructed to remain at home except when going about a limited set of activities, in particular:
to buy food or other essential items
to return home to their primary residence
to go to hospital or other health centres
to go to work if you are employed in one of the essential services designated by the government see full list here
to carry out caring or similar duties or in case of real need.
Transport services will be operating at reduced levels.
Travel to airports by road or rail to leave Spain is still permitted, but travellers may be asked to provide evidence that they are departing Spain (i.e. plane ticket).
