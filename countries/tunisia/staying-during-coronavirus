This page gives you guidance on how to stay safely in Tunisia as a visitor, if you are unable to return to the UK.
Everyone should comply with the measures put in place in Tunisia to limit the spread of coronavirus (COVID-19).
Moving around during Tunisia
A countrywide curfew is in effect from 11pm to 5am. All schools and nurseries are closed, as are all cafés and restaurants. All sporting fixtures, conferences, public prayers and events have been cancelled.
An “obligatory confinement period” is in effect between 5am and 11pm. During this time people are only expected to leave their house for essential business such as grocery shopping or medical care. The Tunisian government has also prohibited travel between cities and regions. All visitors arriving in Tunisia must self-quarantine for a period of 14 days.
At the end of April, the Tunisian authorities announced a phased change to the confinement measures. From 4 May, the majority of shops and businesses will be allowed to reopen with the exception of cafes, bars, restaurants which are operating a takeaway/delivery service only. Schools and nurseries remain closed.
The authorities have announced that the following groups of people must continue to abide by full confinement rules:
those aged 65 years or over
children under the age of 15
pregnant women
people with underlying health conditions
As part of these measures, the Tunisian authorities have announced that the wearing of a face mask in public places and the workplace is now mandatory. Failure to respect this rule could lead to a fine.
During this phase, people must continue to travel only for good reason such as grocery shopping or medical care. There are also limitations on the number of passengers permitted on public transport.
