Northern Kosovo
FCDO advises against all but essential travel to the municipalities of Zubin Potok, Leposavic, Zvecan, and northern part of the city of Mitrovica due to violent incidents and heightened tensions in these areas.
Since December 2022 there have been violent clashes and incidents involving grenades and vehicle explosions. Be cautious and avoid public gatherings, particularly around the Austerlitz Bridge area which separates Mitrovica north and south.
Protests have the potential to turn violent. You should:
avoid public gatherings, political rallies and protests
check local media
consult hotel receptions for advice
sign up to get email notifications when this advice is updated
Avoid travelling between Kosovo and Serbia via Gate 1 (Leposavic) or Gate 31 (Zubin Potok). You should find alternative routes for travel between Kosovo and Serbia.
