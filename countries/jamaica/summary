As part of security enhancement measures, the Government of Jamaica is taking in areas of concern and has issued States of Emergency in the following areas:
The Parish of St James, including Montego Bay, which has been extended until 31 January 2019
St Catherine North State (focused on Spanish Town, Linstead and Bog Walk), which has been extended until 2 January 2019
Specified boundaries in parts of Kingston Central, Kingston Western and St Andrew South Police Divisions, as of 7 January 2019
The Jamaican government has also extended Zones of Special Operations (ZOSOs) in certain neighbourhoods in Kingston (Denham town and other areas in West Kingston).
These measures allow the military to support the police in joint security operations in response to recent violence and shooting incidents.
Security operations are ongoing and further activity could occur with little or no notice. You should exercise caution if you’re in the area, particularly if travelling at night, and follow the advice of the local authorities, including any restrictions. These may also result in road closures or travel delays, and the operating hours of some businesses may be subject to change.
The hurricane season in Jamaica normally runs from June to November. You should monitor local and international weather updates from the US National Hurricane Centre and follow the advice of local authorities. See Natural Disasters
Public order incidents and demonstrations can occur across Jamaica, and may cause significant disruption to traffic and public transportation. You should avoid all demonstrations; they have the potential to turn violent and are often used by criminals as cover for robbery and theft. See Safety and security
