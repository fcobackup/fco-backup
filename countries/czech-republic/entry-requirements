The information on this page covers the most common types of travel and reflects the UK government’s understanding of the rules currently in place. Unless otherwise stated, this information is for travellers using a full ‘British Citizen’ passport.
The authorities in the country or territory you’re travelling to are responsible for setting and enforcing the rules for entry. If you’re unclear about any aspect of the entry requirements, or you need further reassurance, you’ll need to contact the embassy, high commission or consulate of the country or territory you’re travelling to.
You should also consider checking with your transport provider or travel company to make sure your passport and other travel documents meet their requirements.
Passport validity
Your passport should be valid for the proposed duration of your stay; you don’t need any additional period of validity on your passport beyond this.
However, if the UK leaves the European Union with no deal, the passport validity rules for travel to most countries in Europe will change from 29 March 2019. Before booking travel, you should check that your passport will meet these new rules and find out whether you need to renew it.
UK Emergency Travel Documents
UK Emergency Travel Documents are accepted for entry, airside transit and exit from the Czech Republic.
Visas
British citizens don’t need a visa to enter the Czech Republic. If you have another type of British nationality (eg British Overseas Citizen) you may need a visa. Contact the Embassy of the Czech Republic in London for further information.  
If you intend to stay longer than 30 days or settle permanently in the Czech Republic you need to register with Czech Foreign Police.
You can find further information about residency from the Czech Ministry of the Interior.
