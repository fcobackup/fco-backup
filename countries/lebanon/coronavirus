From Thursday 7 January 2021, all travellers to Lebanon will be required to take a PCR test at Beirut International Airport upon arrival (which is provided at the airline’s expense) and then to quarantine for one week. The first 72 hours of quarantine must be spent at a Government of Lebanon approved hotel. Check with the Lebanese embassy in London or your airline for further details. When you receive your airport test result, if it is negative, you may move to your accommodation. You must continue to quarantine at your accommodation before taking another PCR test (that you must arrange yourself) a week after your arrival. If both tests are negative, you may leave quarantine.

Travel in Lebanon
A nation-wide lockdown will come into place on Thursday 7 January 2021 to prevent the spread of COVID-19. From 7 January until 1 February, movement will be prohibited between 6pm and 5am. Hospitality businesses will be closed and public and private gatherings banned. Supermarkets and food shops will remain open during the day (5am-5pm) and pharmacies and essential health services can continue operating. Restaurants will be delivery only (5am-5pm). Public institutions and schools will also close, though there are exemptions, including for banks (who will be permitted open 20% of branches operating at 20% capacity) and some ministries and security institutions. Movement of personal vehicles on roadways will be restricted to vehicles with registrations ending in odd numbers on Mondays, Wednesdays and Fridays and even numbers on Tuesday, Thursdays and Saturdays. Driving on Sundays is not permitted. Taxi services will remain open within curfew hours, though it is advised to book ahead.
Beirut International airport will remain open, as well as sea and land borders. All passengers are required to have their tickets with them when transferring to and from the airport. Some exemptions to COVID-19 restrictions are applied to aid workers. For further clarification, aid workers should contact the United Nations for advice.
When traveling around Lebanon, including to and from the airport, private cars should have no more than four people in them (including the driver). Wearing masks for all passengers is obligatory.
Fabric masks covering the mouth and nose must be worn when outside the home and in vehicles (unless travelling alone, or exercising). Those over the age of 65 years old are advised to stay home and not go out unless absolutely necessary.
Lebanese authorities may issue fines, impose road blocks, or imprison those violating these measures for up to three years. You should comply with all measures introduced by the Lebanese authorities and obey the instructions of the security forces. These measures may be changed at short notice.
Keep up to date with information from your tour operator, transport or accommodation provider on the impact on any existing travel plans.
