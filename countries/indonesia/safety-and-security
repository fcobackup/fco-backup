Crime
Numbers of reported cases of rape and sexual assault are high in Bali and Lombok. You should exercise the same caution you would in the UK when travelling at night and avoid areas that are poorly lit. If you wish to travel by taxi, use only registered companies (such as Bluebird, Silverbird or Express) and ensure the driver’s identity is shown. If you are booking via a mobile app, always ensure that the driver is the same as the person on the app and share your journey with a friend via the in app option. Be aware of drivers claiming to be registered with online ride hailing apps trying to pick up passengers off the street.
Be aware of the risk of street crime and pick-pocketing, particularly in busy tourist areas in Bali, where there have been reports of bag-snatching. Take sensible measures to protect yourself and your belongings. Avoid having bags obviously on show and carry only essential items. Take particular care of your passport and bank cards and avoid travelling around alone.
Credit card fraud is common. Do not lose sight of your card during transactions. Criminals sometimes place a fake telephone number on ATMs advising customers to report problems. Customers dialling the number are asked for their PIN and their card is then retained within the machine.
Beware of thieves on public transport. If you’re travelling by car keep doors locked at all times. Car hire and taxi firms are widely advertised at hotels and shopping malls in central Jakarta and at Soekarno-Hatta International Airport. Take care to distinguish Bluebird and Silverbird taxi vehicles from ‘lookalike’ competitors. Beware of taxi touts at airports who will try to charge extortionate rates.
Only use licensed money changers for converting your money. Licensed money changers can be identified by the presence of a sign titled ‘Authorized Money Changer’ and the formal name of the business, accompanied by logos and certificates issued by the Bank of Indonesia. On the logos and branding, there should be a QR Code that when opened shows the information of the business and proof of licenses.
Alcohol and drugs
Drinks served in bars can be stronger than those in the UK and the measures of spirits are larger. In some cases, over drinking and taking drugs has resulted in accidents, injuries, robbery, assaults and lost travel documents and some British nationals have suffered psychiatric problems caused by alcohol, drugs and a lack of sleep. You should drink responsibly and be aware of your limits.
Possession of drugs in Indonesia is illegal and will attract a lengthy sentence if you are caught with even small amounts. Indonesia retains the death penalty for drug dealing and smuggling.
Drink spiking
There have been reports of sexual assaults and drink spiking in Bali, Lombok and the Gili Islands. Make sure drinks are prepared in your sight and be careful about accepting drinks from strangers at clubs and parties, or leaving drinks unattended. Tourists have also been robbed after taking visitors to their hotel rooms, and in some cases have found that their drinks were spiked.
Methanol poisoning
There have been a number of deaths and also recent cases of serious illness amongst locals and foreigners in Indonesia caused by drinking alcoholic drinks contaminated with methanol. These cases have occurred in bars, shops and hotels in popular tourist areas like Bali, Lombok, the Gili Islands and Sumatra. Criminal gangs have been reported to manufacture counterfeit replicas of well-known brands of alcohol containing high amounts of methanol. Take extreme care when buying spirit-based drinks, as bottles may appear to be genuine when they’re not.
There have also been cases of methanol poisoning from drinking adulterated arak/arrack, a local rice or palm liquor.
If you or someone you’re travelling with show signs of alcohol induced methanol poisoning or drink-spiking, seek immediate medical attention.
Local travel
For longer journeys, notify friends of your travel plans, contact them on arrival and where possible travel in convoy/with others. Always carry a reliable means of communication with you and ensure that your travel insurance covers you for any activities you may be undertaking.
Papua and West Papua
Political tensions in Papua province have given rise to occasional violence and armed attacks between Free Papua Movement (OPM) and associated groups, and the Indonesian authorities, particularly in the Central Highlands area around Puncak Jaya (including Wamena), but also including in Jayapura, Abepura, and Sentani on the north coast, and Timika town on the south coast.
On 30 March 2020, a New Zealand national was shot dead and a number of Indonesian nationals were wounded at the Freeport mining facility in Papua province. Clashes in previous years have at times resulted in civilian deaths. If you’re travelling in the region, you should exercise extreme caution. Papuan separatists have kidnapped foreigners in the past. There is a heavy security presence in some areas, especially along the border with Papua New Guinea.
Political tensions have also given rise to occasional mass demonstrations in cities in Papua and violent protests have most recently taken place in several locations including Manokwari, West Papua Province, and in Jayapura (February and July 2022) and Wamena Papua Province, Timika and Fakfak regency(August and September 2019). There are reports of difficulties with internet connections during periods of intra-community tension and communications may be limited. You should monitor local media, avoid all protests, demonstrations and political rallies in these and other areas as they could become violent with little notice.
Should you need medical attention, there are limited hospital facilities in Papua and West Papua provinces and the likely destination for a medical emergency is Darwin, Australia. Monitor the situation and be alert to changing circumstances.
Central Sulawesi Province
The political situation in Central Sulawesi Province is unsettled. Take particular care in Palu, Poso and Tentena and be alert to the potential for politically-motivated violence.
There is ongoing conflict between the Indonesian security forces and terrorists, including attacks upon police and civilians in May 2021. This conflict is predominantly concentrated in the Sigi, Parigi Moutong and Poso regions.
Maluku Province
Maluku Province has experienced unrest and violence between different religious and tribal groups. Take particular care in Ambon, including Haruku Island (Pulau Haruku).
Aceh
Aceh has emerged from a long period of internal conflict. Although violence against foreigners is rare, a British national was abducted in June 2013 and there were three separate incidents in November 2009 targeting foreigners. There have been reports of Sharia (religious) police harassing foreigners.
Be alert to the risk of politically-motivated violence and take particular care in remote areas. Keep up to date with local developments and avoid large crowds, especially political rallies.
Sharia law is in force in Aceh. See Local laws and customs
Political situation
The overall political situation in Indonesia is stable, but internal developments, such as elections, presidential inaugurations and external developments, including in the Middle East, can trigger public protests or unrest. You should avoid all protests, demonstrations and political rallies as they could turn violent with little notice.
Nationwide student protests took place in 2019, again in 2020, and have the potential to reoccur at any time. You should avoid large gatherings in public areas, including demonstrations, student and political rallies.
Road travel
You cannot drive in Indonesia using a UK driving licence. You can drive using an International Driving Permit issued in Indonesia. International Driving Permits issued in the UK may need to be endorsed by the Indonesian licensing office in Jakarta.
Before driving, riding or hiring any type of vehicle, ensure that you have the appropriate licence to do so, and check with your travel insurance company to confirm that you’re covered.
Traffic discipline is very poor and we have seen a large increase in moped and motorbike accidents, including serious injury and fatalities in Bali. Foreigners involved in even minor traffic violations or accidents may be vulnerable to exploitation. Consider employing a private driver or hiring a car with a driver. Some multinational companies do not allow their expatriate staff to drive in Indonesia. Make sure you wear a helmet if you’re riding a motorbike or moped.
If you’re involved in an accident or breakdown, make sure someone remains with your vehicle. If you have any concerns for your security, move to another location safely. You should make yourself available for questioning by the police if requested to do so.
Air travel
The FCDO cannot offer advice on the safety of individual airlines, but the International Air Transport Association publishes a list of registered airlines that have been audited and found to meet a number of operational safety standards and recommended practices. This list is not exhaustive and the absence of an airline from this list doesn’t necessarily mean that it is unsafe.
On 29 October 2018, a Lion Air domestic flight from Jakarta to Pangkal Pinang crashed into the Kawarang Sea shortly after take-off. There were no survivors and an investigation is underway to determine the cause of the crash.
On 9 January 2021, Sriwijaya Air flight 182 crashed into the Java Sea off the Thousand Islands killing all 62 people on board.
A list of recent incidents and accidents can be found on the website of the Aviation Safety network.
Sea travel
Travelling by boat or ferry can be dangerous as the sea conditions can change rapidly, vessels can be crowded, overloaded, poorly maintained and safety standards vary between providers. According to National Search and Rescue Agency, there were 811 boat accidents in 2021 that resulted in 441 deaths and 401 people lost at sea. Make sure you’re satisfied with safety standards before travelling, including availability of safety equipment and life-jackets. Life-jackets suitable for children aren’t always available and you should consider bringing your own. Avoid travelling after dark unless you’re satisfied the vessel is suitably equipped.
There have been attacks against ships in and around the waters of Indonesia. Mariners should be vigilant, reduce opportunities for theft, establish secure areas on board and report all incidents to the coastal and flag state authorities.
