The Foreign, Commonwealth & Development Office (FCDO) continues to advise against all non-essential travel to Spain, including the Balearic Islands, based on the current assessment of COVID-19 risks in the country. The Canary Islands are exempt from the FCDO’s advice against all non-essential international travel.
The requirement to self-isolate on return to the UK from the Canary Islands was lifted on 25 October. You must still self-isolate if returning to the UK from any other part of Spain. Some exemptions apply. Check the latest guidance for England, Northern Ireland, Scotland and Wales.
Travel is subject to entry restrictions
On arrival, travellers entering Spain from the UK will not be required to self-isolate. However, you will be subject to the following three requirements:
It is mandatory for all passengers travelling to Spain to fill out and sign an online form 48 hours prior to travel, providing the Spanish Ministry of Health with contact information and details of any known history of exposure to COVID-19. You can do this on the Spain Travel Health website or downloadable app. On completion, you will be issued a personal and non-transferable QR code which you must show (electronically or hardcopy) at airport health controls on arrival
Temperature check
Undergo a visual health assessment
From 14 November, travellers to the Canary Islands will need to provide a negative COVID-19 test when checking-in to regulated tourist accommodation. Do not use the NHS testing service for a test to travel to the Canary Islands. You should arrange to take a private test.
See Entry requirements for more information before you plan to travel.
