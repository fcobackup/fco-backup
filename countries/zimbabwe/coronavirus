You can spread the virus even if you donâ€™t have symptoms.

Cases of coronavirus (COVID-19) have been confirmed in Zimbabwe. The Zimbabwean authorities have introduced a number of measures to limit the spread of the virus, including announcing the closure of all borders to non-residents and a countrywide lockdown as of 30 March, for 21 days.
Travel restrictions
Commercial airlines have suspended all flights in to and out of Zimbabwe. You should consult your airline and travel insurance company immediately to understand what impact this will have for your travel plans. You should ensure you have accommodation for this entire period as some hotels may close at short notice. If you take regular medication, you should ensure you have a sufficient supply.

Local Measures
President Mnangagwa announced on 30 March that everybody in Zimbabwe must stay at home, except to buy essential food or medicine. Only certain categories of key workers are exempt. You should comply with this requirement, wherever you are staying in Zimbabwe.
The Government has said that anyone displaying a symptom associated with coronavirus will be placed in a Government of Zimbabwe facility for testing. Anyone who tests positive will be treated in a Government of Zimbabwe treatment centre. A British national has reported being quarantined for 21 days on arrival at Harare airport despite testing negative for coronavirus (COVID-19).
