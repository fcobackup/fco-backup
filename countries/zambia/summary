The FCDO advises against all but essential travel to:
the whole of Zambia based on the current assessment of COVID-19 risks.
From 4am on Saturday 9 January, visitors arriving into the UK who have been in or transited through Zambia in the previous 10 days will not be permitted entry. British and Irish nationals, and third country nationals with residence rights in the UK arriving in England from Zambia will be required to quarantine in a hotel. Different rules apply for arrivals into England, Northern Ireland, Scotland and Wales.
The FCDO is not advising those already travelling in Zambia to leave at this time. Travellers should follow the advice of the local authorities on how best to protect themselves and others, including any measures that they bring in to control the virus. You should contact your tour operator or airline if you have any questions about your return journey.
Travel to Zambia is subject to entry restrictions
All visitors and returning residents must have proof that they have tested negative for COVID-19 in the 7 days before their arrival in Zambia. There is no requirement for visitors to self-isolate on arrival. Returning residents should self-isolate for 14 days following their return to Zambia.
Temperature checking is routine on arrival. If your body temperature is 38 degrees Celsius or higher, you will be tested for COVID-19. If you also show additional symptoms, you will be taken to government facilities for treatment and quarantine.
All travellers wishing to leave Zambia to travel to a country that requires a negative COVID-19 test will be required to produce a medical certificate stating that they have tested negative for COVID-19 in the previous 14 days. This requirement does not apply to travellers to a destination that does not require a negative test but travellers are advised to check with their airline on their requirements prior to travel.
See Entry requirements for more information before you plan to travel.
