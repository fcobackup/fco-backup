Entry and borders
Since 16 March, it is not possible for many British nationals to enter the USA if they have been in the UK, Ireland, Schengen zone, Iran or China within the previous 14 days.
US citizens and permanent residents of the USA, certain specified close family members and certain other limited categories of visas holders (such as UN staff and diplomats) are exempt and will still be able to enter the USA, subject to normal entry requirements.
Those allowed entry to the USA must be prepared to self-isolate for up to 14 days after arrival.
Airports
The new restrictions limit the number of airports to which flights from international destinations can operate to the USA. The 13 airports are:
JFK (New York)
EWR (Newark)
IAD (Washington DC)
BOS (Boston)
ORD (Chicago)
DTW (Detroit)
MIA (Miami)
ATL (Atlanta)
DFW (Dallas)
LAX (Los Angeles)
SEA (Seattle)
SFO (San Francisco)
HML (Honolulu)
While there may be NO direct flights from DTW (Detroit), (ATL) Atlanta, SEA (Seattle), SFO (San Francisco), or HML (Honolulu) to the UK at this time, there are flights with connections to the UK.
Transiting the USA
You will be unable to transit the USA on an ESTA visa waiver if you have been in the UK, Ireland, Schengen zone, Iran or China within the previous 14 days. For further information on the validity of ESTAs, check the advice from US Customs and Border Protection.
Departing the USA
British travellers currently in the USA will be allowed to leave. For information on how to return to the UK from the USA, see Return to the UK
Travel to American Samoa
To prevent the spread of coronavirus (COVID-19), American Samoa currently requires all non-US passport holders to spend at least 14 days in Hawaii, Samoa (Apia) or Tonga before entering. Other restrictions for those travelling from countries affected by the outbreak could also be in force.
If you’re due to travel, check the websites of the American Samoa Government and the US Center for Disease Control and Prevention for any updates, and with your airline before leaving. You should check with your airline or travel agent for any additional information about existing travel bookings.
Visas
ESTA extensions
If you entered the USA on an ESTA and are concerned that your period of admission is about to expire and you cannot depart the USA due to the ongoing coronavirus crisis, you can apply for Satisfactory Departure from the US Customs and Border Protection.
This discretionary authority permits US Citizenship and Immigration Services and US Customs and Border Protection to extend an ESTA admission for a period not to exceed 30 days in order to allow you to depart the United States without penalty.
You can find more information on the Customs and Border Protection’s Frequently Asked Questions page.
Green cards
As of 22 April, the USA is no longer issuing ‘green card’ visas to those seeking lawful permanent residence. This order will last for a period of sixty days, contains a number of exemptions, and is subject to further review and extension.
For details and further information, you should refer to advice from the US Embassy in the UK.
