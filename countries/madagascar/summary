The Foreign and Commonwealth Office (FCO) advise against all travel to Batterie Beach, north of Toliara (Tuléar), where there have been violent attacks including fatalities.
Tropical Storm Eliakim is forecast to bring hazardous sea and weather conditions to the north-east coast of Madagascar, in particular the Masaola peninsula, from around Friday 16 March 2018. If you’re in the area, you should monitor local and international weather reports and follow the advice and instructions of the local authorities. Rainfall is expected to be extremely heavy and the risk of flooding is elevated. Road and air travel is often badly affected by tropical storms and cyclones. Travel to and from the popular tourist destination, Isle Sainte Marie, is likely to be severely affected, and potentially impossible. If you’re in the area, keep in touch with your tour operator and make sure you have sufficient supplies of food, water and medication to last for several days.
Previous cyclones, including most recently Tropical Storm Ava, have left some remote areas inaccessible by road and water supply systems have been damaged and contaminated in some areas. Principle routes have re-opened, but check the METEO Madagascar website for the latest details.
The cyclone season in Madagascar normally runs from November to April. Coastal areas are particularly affected. You should monitor the progress of approaching storms. See Natural disasters
There has been continued political instability in Madagascar since the 2009 coup d’état. Despite the political transition back to democracy in early 2014, the situation remains fragile and may have an impact on security, especially in the capital, the larger regional cities, and the Betroka region in the south. There were riots in December 2014 in Morondava and Port Berge (Boriziny). You should avoid all crowds and political demonstrations. See Political situation
Take great care and follow local advice in the south-east of the country. In the southern triangle between Ihosy, Toliara/Tuléar and Fort-Dauphin the security situation remains tense and the roads are in very poor condition. Avoid overnight stays in the countryside.
You should avoid travelling at night on Route Nationale 13 (RN 13) between Ambovombe and Ihosy and on the RN 10 between Betioky and Andranovory (the western route to Toliara/Tuléar). There have been several attacks on vehicles. If you’re planning on travelling to Fort Dauphin via the RN 13, then you should strongly consider travelling by air instead. If this isn’t possible, take great care on the RN 13 during the daytime, be vigilant at all times and follow the instructions of local authorities. See Crime and Local travel.
In October 2013 on the island of Nosy Be, 2 foreigners and 1 Malagasy were lynched and burned by the local population. Remain vigilant during visits to beaches.
Crime and politically motivated violence is widespread in Madagascar. Be vigilant in the capital Antananarivo particularly on the Avenue de L’Independence, Ambohijatovo, Analakely, Behoririka, Isoraka Ampasamandinika, 67ha and around the military barracks at Betongolo.
Be especially vigilant at night and don’t touch any suspect packages.
Be vigilant and maintain a low profile while moving around the country, in particular if you’re travelling alone. If you’re travelling independently, monitor the local media closely for the duration of your visit. See Local travel
In 2013 there were just over 8,000 British visitors to Madagascar and most visits were trouble free. If possible, travel with established organisations or travel companies who know the terrain and have the capacity to warn of potential hazards.
Although there’s no recent history of terrorism in Madagascar, attacks can’t be ruled out. See Terrorism
Piracy remains a significant threat in the Gulf of Aden and Indian Ocean, and has occurred more than 1,000 nautical miles from the Somali coast. See River and sea travel
