Visas
Check the validity of your Indian visa. If it has expired, or is due to expire, you will need to apply for a visa extension via the FRRO website. We are aware that there are currently issues with the FRRO website – we are working with the relevant authority to rectify. Try at off-peak times if you are experiencing problems. All regular and e-visas which have expired since 1 February, or are due to expire during the suspension of international air travel, will be extended at no cost if you apply online. This extension will be granted for a period of up to 30 days from the date that international air travel resumes.
Certain categories of OCI cardholders stranded abroad are now exempt from visa & travel suspension. For more information, see Ministry of Home Affairs guidance.
Visit the FRRO website if you have any visa-related queries.
Accommodation
If your hotel asks you to leave, ask them to provide alternative accommodation, or talk to the police who can assist. If you have nowhere to go and you need urgent help, contact the nearest British consulate:
New Delhi: +91 (11) 2419 2100
Chennai: + 91 (44) 42192151

Health
If you need medicine, check with your nearest pharmacy or ask your accommodation provider to help. Carry all medical papers or prescriptions and be prepared to answer questions if stopped by the police. If your usual medication is not available, consult a local doctor for an Indian alternative or go to the nearest hospital. In a genuine medical emergency, call an ambulance.

Coronavirus
It is a mandatory requirement in a number of states for foreign nationals to complete a health declaration. You may be liable for prosecution if you are symptomatic or a confirmed case and deliberately attempt to hide symptoms and/or travel history.
The Indian Government has expanded testing, including through private laboratories, though testing is still available only on the prescription of a registered medical practitioner. A Government supported central help line number +91-11-23978046 can be used to re-direct you to a medical practitioner. If you have symptoms of COVID-19 (coughing and fever and/or shortness of breath) and would like to get tested and get more information, contact a registered medical practitioner. See additional guidance on testing.
Finance
There is a range of financial support from the government that you can access while you are unable to return due to coronavirus restrictions.
If you’re in India, and have exhausted all other options to cover essential living costs while you wait to return home, you could apply for an emergency loan for your living costs from the UK government. You can only apply if you normally live in the UK and you cannot return home. This last-resort option is for those most in need, and you would need to repay the loan when you are back in the UK. Apply for an emergency loan.
