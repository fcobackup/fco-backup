Entry and borders
From 3 April, entry to Japan will be denied for any non-Japanese nationals who have been to the UK or this list of countries in the last 14 days, other than in exceptional circumstances. These measures also apply to people who live in Japan but are temporarily out of the country.
Exceptions are restricted to those who left Japan on or before 2 April with re-entry permission and who are:
holders of permanent residency permits (eijusha)
holders of long-term residence permits (teijusha)
spouses or children of permanent residents (eijusha no haigusha-to)
direct relatives of Japanese nationals.
Those who leave Japan on or after 3 April will in principle be denied entry even in the above cases.
You should confirm eligibility to enter Japan before you travel. Consult with the consular section of the Japanese Embassy in London or your nearest Japanese Embassy if you are in a third country. If you’re in Japan, contact the Immigration Services Agency on +81 570 013 904 or +81 357 967 112.
All passengers who arrive in Japan may be required to undergo a coronavirus screening test (PCR) and are required to self-isolate for 14 days on arrival at a designated location (such as a hotel or your own home) and to avoid using public transport. This request will remain in place until at least the end of May.
Transit
These measures do not apply to passengers who are transiting through the same airport and do not go through immigration. If you are transiting using different airports you will need a transit permit on arrival. To get one you will be required to demonstrate that you have not come from a country on the banned list, that you have timely onward travel plans and show that you will not use public transport to move between airports; this includes taxis. You should comply with any additional screening measures put in place by the authorities. You should also check the latest entry requirements for your destination.
Local measures
A nationwide State of Emergency is in place until 31 May. You should follow the instructions of your local authority.
Emergency measures will vary by locality, but are likely to include requests or directives for residents to stay at home, work from home, and avoid areas where infection is more likely. You should avoid unnecessary journeys from affected prefectures to other regions. In addition, non-essential businesses may be closed, and emergency medical measures may be taken at short notice. Supermarkets, convenience stores, pharmacies and banks are likely to remain open.
Subject to local guidelines, necessary journeys to purchase food, take exercise, seek medical care or for unavoidable work trips are still possible. Public transport should still operate. You should be prepared to explain to the authorities the reason for your journey and you must have your passport or residence card with you at all times. Those wishing to leave Japan should be able to travel to airports.
Local authorities may also put in place special measures for natural disaster response, including additional evacuation locations and medical procedures. See Natural disasters for more information on general disaster preparedness in Japan.
The situation is changing rapidly. You should continue to follow the advice of local authorities.
Visas
Japan has suspended its visa waiver system for anyone travelling on a British Citizen or British National (Overseas) passport until at least the end of May 2020. Japan has also suspended single and multiple entry visas issued by Japanese Embassies and Consulate Generals in the UK prior to 20 March and in many other countries, full list is here. Anyone arriving in Japan without a valid visa will not be able to enter.
These measures do not impact on the ‘Status of Residence’ of British nationals already living in Japan.
If you are already in Japan and your visa has expired or due to expire before the end of June 2020, Japan’s Immigration Service Agency has introduced a three-month grace period for renewing an expired visa without penalty. This includes short-term tourist visas, subject to proof that you were not able to easily leave Japan. The three-month period starts from the date the visa expires – you must visit an immigration centre to renew your visa during this time. You will need to present a valid visa when leaving Japan. You may wish to contact Japan’s Immigration Services Agency on +81 570 013 904 or +81 357 967 112 and check what evidence you will need to provide when applying for your extension.
