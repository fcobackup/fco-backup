Goods and services are paid for in Seychelles rupees (SCR). It isn’t common to purchase goods or pay for services in any other currency, although some guesthouses and hotels may accept euros or US dollars. You should check before travelling.
Exchanging money can be done at travel agents, banks and bureau de changes. ATMs are common in Seychelles, most are found in Victoria but it can be difficult to find them in more remote areas. Most shops and restaurants accept credit and debit card payments. You should check with your hotel or guesthouse if you will be able to pay using your card.
