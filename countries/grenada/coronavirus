Be prepared for your plans to change
No travel is risk-free during COVID. Countries may further restrict travel or bring in new rules at short notice, for example due to a new COVID-19 variant. Check with your travel company or airline for any transport changes which may delay your journey home.
If you test positive for COVID-19, you must self-isolate at your hotel, home or other approved facility. You will be monitored until granted clearance by local health officials. If you receive a positive test, you will be contacted by the health authorities and provided with all the information on your status and the requirements for self-isolation.
You are not allowed to leave your home or hotel while in self-isolation. If you are unable to stay in your hotel due to financial or other reasons you will be placed in a state approved and monitored facility. All transfers are conducted by health officials using strict infection prevention measures. All positive cases are treated similarly. Minors will be required to self-isolate even if travelling without parents. The guardian will self-isolate with the minor if required.
Plan ahead and make sure you:
can access money
understand what your insurance will cover
can make arrangements to extend your stay and be away for longer than planned
