You will need to pay for your return travel to the UK. If departure options are available but you cannot afford the travel costs and have exhausted all other options for getting funds, you may be eligible to apply for an emergency loan from the government. This is a last resort option and you would need to repay the loan when you are back in the UK. For more information, you should contact Corporate Travel Management (CTM). CTM are a commercial partner of the FCO and are authorised to administer such loans on behalf of the FCO.
Travelling to the airport
You can travel from your accommodation to the airport if you have a valid plane ticket and are not showing any symptoms of coronavirus.
Regular domestic flights within Argentina, as well as all scheduled long distance trains and buses, are suspended until midnight on 26 April. There may be other options for travelling overland, such as taking a taxi or hiring a car, but you are only permitted to travel to Buenos Aires if you have a valid ticket for an international flight which departs within 24 hours of your arrival. Please also note that vehicles are unable to stop overnight so there must be a minimum of two drivers for long journeys.
If you need to spend a night in Buenos Aires, you will need to find accommodation to meet the requirements of the nationwide quarantine, which prohibits you from leaving your accommodation without justification. See Coronavirus
If you are planning to travel overland to Buenos Aires, you will need:
