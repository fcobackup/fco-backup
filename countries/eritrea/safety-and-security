Crime
Though Asmara is a relatively safe city, there have been increased incidences of criminality over the last 2 years. You should take sensible precautions with your personal safety. Don’t walk around late at night alone. Keep valuables, particularly cameras and passports, out of sight. Keep a photocopy of the personal details page of your passport in a safe place, or with friends or family in the UK.
A large proportion of the population has access to arms under the government of Eritrea’s civilian militia programme. We have no evidence that these weapons increase the threat of violent crime.
Local security measures
On 14 September 2022, the Eritrean Government announced a national call up of its local militia, in response to the conflict in Tigray.  Extra security measures may be in place around Asmara and the rest of Eritrea.  You should be extra vigilant at this time.
Local travel
There are extensive mine fields in Eritrea, especially in border areas. Driving on main roads away from border areas is generally safe.
The FCDO advise against all travel within 25km of Eritrea’s border with Ethiopia. All border crossings between Ethiopia and Eritrea are currently closed - travellers should check local advice before proceeding to the border. In the border area use main paved roads and avoid driving on non-metalled roads and walking or hiking in the countryside. In September 2011, a landmine exploded on the road between Senafe and Afoma, to the east of Senafe, killing 5 people.
The FCDO advise against all travel within 25 km of Eritrea’s border with Djibouti. All border crossings between Djibouti and Eritrea are currently closed. In 2008 there was fighting between Djibouti and Eritrea after an incursion of Eritrean forces into the disputed Djibouti border region. Though relations have improved, the situation remains unresolved.
The FCDO advise against all travel to within 25km of Eritrea’s border with Sudan. All border crossings between Sudan and Eritrea are currently closed. There are ongoing reports of banditry in and around the border area.
Avoid travelling after dark in rural areas. Road signage and barriers are scarce, road surfaces are uneven – causing erratic driving. Tight blind bends and steep drops are common. In many parts of the country, roads are difficult or impassable during the rainy season.
Due to the proximity of the Hanish islands in the Red Sea to the ongoing conflict in Yemen, it is highly unlikely that permission would be granted to visit the southwestern Hanish islands that belong to Eritrea.
Travel Permits
All foreign nationals must apply in advance for a travel permit to leave Asmara and the surrounding province of zoba Maekel. There are checkpoints outside of Asmara where your travel permit will be checked. Those working outside Asmara also need a travel permit to leave their area of residence or work. Applications in Asmara are handled by the relevant Ministry. For business travellers, applications are dealt with by the Ministry of Trade and Industry. Applications outside Asmara are handled by the local Zoba (Region) Administration Offices. Permission may take several days to be granted and is sometimes refused or delayed.
Tourists wishing to travel outside Asmara should apply for a travel permit at the Ministry of Tourism located on Harnet Avenue in Asmara. Processing usually takes around 24 hours. When applying for permission to travel outside of Asmara, you should supply details of the car you’ll be travelling in. There have been reports of tourists not being permitted to use public transport to travel outside of Asmara and having to rent a car or use a private taxi.
Restrictions on travel by foreign nationals apply equally to foreign diplomats. Staff from the British Embassy are therefore unable to easily provide consular assistance to British nationals outside of Asmara.
Sea travel
Mariners must seek permissions and entry visas before attempting to land in Eritrea. This includes all islands in the Red Sea that belong to Eritrea. There have been cases of mariners being detained in the last 3 years for ignoring this.
Due to the proximity of the Hanish islands in the Red Sea to the ongoing conflict in Yemen, it is highly unlikely permission would be granted to visit the southwestern Hanish islands that belong to Eritrea. Those landing without a permit have previously been detained.
Recent piracy attacks off the coast of Somalia and in the Gulf of Aden, highlight that the threat of piracy related activity and armed robbery in the Gulf of Aden and Indian Ocean remains significant.
Reports of attacks on local fishing dhows in the area around the Gulf of Aden and Horn of Africa continue.
The combined threat assessment of the international Naval Counter Piracy Forces remains that all sailing yachts under their own passage should remain out of the designated High Risk Area or face the risk of being hijacked and held hostage for ransom. For more information and advice, see our Piracy and armed robbery at sea page.
Consular Assistance
Consular support is severely limited in parts of Eritrea. Constraints on travel within Eritrea means the British Embassy in Asmara is unable to offer consular assistance easily to British nationals outside the greater Asmara area.
There are obstacles to the provision of consular assistance even in Asmara. The Eritrean authorities may not inform the relevant Embassy if a foreign national is in need of help and there have been recent instances where the Eritrean authorities have refused consular access to detained foreign nationals.
The Eritrean authorities consider all British nationals holding either Eritrean or PFDJ identity documents (including out of date documents) as Eritrean nationals. The British Embassy is unable to gain consular access to, or obtain information on dual nationals if detained by the authorities or otherwise in need of assistance.
If you are in Eritrea and you need urgent help (for example, you’ve been attacked, arrested or someone has died), call the British Embassy on +291 1 125 123.
If you’re in the UK and worried about a British national in Eritrea, call 020 7008 5000.
