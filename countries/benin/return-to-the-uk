There remain commercial options to return to the UK from Benin. Air France and Ethiopian Airlines continue to operate a reduced service of international flights into and out of Benin. If you live in the UK and are currently visiting Benin, you are strongly advised to return now by commercial means. Don’t run the risk of getting stranded.
UK special charter flights will only operate for priority countries where commercial flights are not possible. You should not assume that these flights will become available in countries where commercial routes are operating. Please do not contact the contracted travel management company if no flight is advertised here.
