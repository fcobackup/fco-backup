Terrorism in San Marino 
Terrorist attacks in San Marino cannot be ruled out.
Crime 
Protecting your belongings 
Street crime is very rare, but you should take precautions to keep your passport and money safe.
Alcohol and drink spiking
Drinks served in bars abroad are often stronger than those in the UK. Be careful about accepting drinks from strangers or leaving your drinks unattended. 
Laws and cultural differences 
Illegal drugs and prison sentences 
There is a zero-tolerance policy towards the possession and use of illegal drugs. If you are convicted, you will face a prison sentence or a heavy fine. 
Transport risks 
Road travel 
If you are planning to drive in San Marino, see information on driving abroad and check the rules of the road in the RAC’s San Marino guide. The guide lists driving regulations and other legal requirements you need to be aware of.
You’ll need to have both the 1968 version of the international driving permit (IDP) and your UK driving licence with you in the car. You cannot buy an IDP outside the UK, so get one before you travel.
Hire car companies often have stricter requirements for their customers, such as a year of driving experience and a higher minimum age.
