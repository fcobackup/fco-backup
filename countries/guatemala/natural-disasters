Rainy season
The rainy season in Guatemala normally runs from June to November, coinciding with the hurricane season in the Caribbean. Heavy rains cause frequent flooding, landslides and collapsed roads and bridges throughout the country. Monitor local media and consult your tour operator and PROATUR as travel routes are likely to face disruption. You should plan any travel carefully. You should monitor local and international weather updates from the World Meteorological Organisation and the US National Hurricane Centre. Follow the advice of the local authorities, including any evacuation orders. For more general information see our Tropical Cyclones page.

You are advised to follow official advice from local authorities. Further information can be found on www.conred.gob.gt (English and Spanish) and www.insivumeh.gov.gt (Spanish).
On 10th October 2022, local authorities declared a “State of Public Calamity” for 30 days in the whole country due to all the damage caused by heavy rainfall arising from Tropical Storm Julia. This declaration allows the authorities to take measures to avoid further damage and to protect and guarantee the lives and security of the population.
Recent heavy rainfall across the country has led to landslides, flash flooding and damage to the infrastructure. You should monitor local and international weather updates from the US National Hurricane Centre. Follow the advice of local authorities, including any evacuation orders.

The possibility of eruptions always exists.
Take care if you are near any active volcano. Monitor local media and seek advice from your tour operator in case of possible travel disruption. For further information visit the website of the Guatemalan disaster agency CONRED (in Spanish).

Earthquakes
Guatemala is subject to frequent minor earth tremors and occasional earthquakes.
On 8 September 2017 there was an earthquake of magnitude 8.2 on the Richter scale off the coast of Chiapas, Mexico which caused severe damage in western Guatemala.
Make sure you know what action to take if an earthquake strikes. Follow the advice of the local authorities. Read the hotel earthquake instructions. During an earthquake, you should drop to the ground and take cover under sturdy furniture, in a doorway or next to an inside wall, away from windows or objects which may fall. Cover your head with a pillow or your arms and wait for the earthquake to stop, before moving to a safe area outside.
The US Federal Emergency Management Agency has advice about what to do before, during and after an earthquake or tsunami.
