The Kyrgyzstan authorities have introduced a number of precautionary measures, including banning all foreign nationals from entering the country. Foreign nationals already in Kyrgyzstan are allowed to leave, but flights are now limited to one Moscow – Bishkek flight, one Moscow-Osh flight and one Novosibirsk – Bishkek flight per week. It is uncertain when this might change. If you wish to leave Kyrgyzstan you should make arrangements to do so immediately.
Terrorist attacks in Kyrgyzstan can’t be ruled out. You should be vigilant in public places and follow security advice from the local authorities. See Terrorism.
