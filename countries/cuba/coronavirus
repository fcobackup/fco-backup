Visa extensions and departure
During the period of Cuban government coronavirus measures, visa extension requirements have been suspended while immigration offices have had limited services. If you are still in Cuba and your visa has expired or will expire while flights are suspended, you should keep in touch with the local immigration office; there is one in each municipality. All types of visas that have expired during Coronavirus measures will remain valid for 30 days after the suspension on commercial flights is lifted if you have not been able to renew yours with Immigration.
If you have dual British and Cuban nationality, you are subject to Cuban measures and should check your immigration status to clarify if you can leave Cuba while travel restrictions are in place (and when flights resume). If you need permission to leave, you should get this from the immigration office in Havana; permission cannot be given at the airport.

The suspension of inter-provincial transport was lifted on 19 October 2020, except to/from Havana, Ciego de Avila, Sancti Spiritus and Pinar del Rio. Any change in the situation in a province or municipality may mean inter-provincial or municipal transport links also change. There is currently no transport service within Pinar del Rio Province.
