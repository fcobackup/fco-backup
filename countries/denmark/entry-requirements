This page reflects the UK government’s understanding of current rules for people travelling on a full ‘British Citizen’ passport, for the most common types of travel.
The authorities in Denmark set and enforce entry rules. For further information contact their embassy, high commission or consulate. You may also check with your transport provider or travel company to make sure your passport and travel documents meet their requirements.
If you are travelling to Denmark for work, read the guidance on visas and permits as the rules have changed since 1 January 2021.
Entry rules in response to coronavirus (COVID-19)
Entry to Denmark is assessed by risk level of the particular country you are travelling from. This is categorised by green, yellow, orange and red ratings. Danish authorities will review the risk level weekly. The UK is currently rated orange.
However, England, Northern Ireland and Scotland are rated as red areas and this impacts on the pre-boarding test requirement to Denmark as well as the testing and self-isolation requirements that apply after entry into Denmark.
If you are planning a trip to Denmark check the latest travel rules before you travel.
Entry to Denmark – not fully vaccinated
If you are resident in the UK, you will be able to enter Denmark if you have a worthy purpose. You can see the list of worthy purposes on the Danish coronavirus website.
You will need to provide evidence of your worthy purpose.
Entry to Denmark - fully vaccinated
Fully vaccinated UK residents can enter Denmark for all purposes, but you must follow the testing and self-isolation requirements outlined below. Two weeks must have passed since your second dose and the vaccine must be one approved by the European Medicines Agency.
This also applies to Danish citizens, UK Nationals, or other persons resident in Denmark
Testing and self-isolation requirements – if travelling from a red area airport/port.
You must have:
A worthy purpose or be fully vaccinated
A PCR test 72 hours prior to entry
A test on arrival
To self-isolate on arrival for 10 days (with the option to test to release after four days)

You can check with the Danish authorities on their helpline (+45 7020 6044) for advice on the conditions of entry for foreign nationals. You can also keep up to date at the Danish coronavirus website.
Demonstrating your COVID-19 vaccination status
Denmark will accept the UK’s solutions to demonstrate your COVID vaccination status. Your NHS appointment card from vaccination centres is not designed to be used as proof of vaccination and should not be used to demonstrate your vaccine status.
Face masks at Danish airports
It is now compulsory to wear face masks on flights with several airlines. You should check with your airline before travel. Passengers are responsible for providing their own face masks. It is compulsory to wear a mask throughout terminals in Danish airports. You should wear a medical mask from the moment you enter the terminals, on board the plane, and until you leave again upon arrival. It is recommended by the Danish health authorities to change the mask every 3 to 4 hours.
Travel to the Faroe Islands
All UK resident travellers to the Faroe Islands must have a worthy purpose to enter in line with the Danish government’s stricter requirements. You must have a negative COVID-19 test at least 72 hours before departure. You must also self-isolate for 10 days after arrival in the Faroe Islands. You must isolate even if the test taken at arrival is negative. The isolation may end after a negative PCR test taken no earlier than on the fourth day after entry.
If you are fully vaccinated see guidance on the official Faroese website.
Details of test centres and opening hours are available online.
You should check the latest guidance on entry requirements for travel to the Faroe Islands before departure.
If you need further guidance or information on COVID-19 in the Faroe Islands you can visit the Faroe Islands’ dedicated website or call the Faroese Corona Hotline on +298 30 40 40 (open Monday to Thursday from 10 am to 3 pm).
Travel to Greenland
You can enter Greenland from Denmark. There may be limited flight capacity for a period of time.
All travellers must have a negative PCR test at least 72 hours prior to departure.
If you are not vaccinated you must go directly into quarantine at the end-destination and be retested on the fifth day of quarantine.
If you are fully vaccinated, you can be tested the day after entry into Greenland (if the test centre is open). If the test is negative, you are released from quarantine.
Accompanying children between the ages of 2 and 11 are covered by the same vaccination offer as their travelling companion. This means that incoming vaccinated parents and their traveling child can be tested the day after entry, even if their child has not been vaccinated.
Be aware that restrictions on entry to Greenland can be reinstated at any time depending on the national and global spread of COVID-19.
For further information regarding travel from Denmark to Greenland, you can contact Greenland’s Corona Secretariat at corona@nanoq.gl. You can keep up to date at Visit Greenland’s travel advice.
Regular entry requirements
The Danish authorities increased border controls at the land border with Germany in January 2016. Border controls were also introduced in November 2019 for travellers from Rønne, Helsingør, Frederikshavn, Grenaa and those using the Øresund Bridge, including all train traffic from Sweden. These checks are temporary but will be in place for an unspecified period of time.
If you’re travelling using the land border, or by rail, road, or ferry you should make sure you have your passport with you. Allow additional time, be vigilant and follow the instructions of local authorities. Check with local media, your carrier, ferry operator or Danish State Railways (DSB) for more information.
When crossing from Denmark to Sweden various forms of ID are accepted, but must include a photograph, the holder’s full name, social security number or date of birth, holders signature, a stated validity and information on the issuing authority. Children under 18 accompanied by an adult with the appropriate ID are not required to carry ID themselves.
Visas
Greenland and the Faroe Islands aren’t members of the European Union. You don’t need a visa to enter for tourism, but you should get a work and residence permit before entry if you intend to live and work there.
The rules for travelling or working in European countries changed on 1 January 2021:
you can travel to countries in the Schengen area for up to 90 days in any 180-day period without a visa. This applies if you travel as a tourist, to visit family or friends, to attend business meetings, cultural or sports events, or for short-term studies or training
if you are travelling to Denmark and other Schengen countries without a visa, make sure your whole visit is within the 90-day limit. Visits to Schengen countries within the previous 180 days before you travel count towards your 90 days
to stay longer, to work or study, for business travel or for other reasons, you will need to meet the Danish government’s entry requirements. Check with the Danish Embassy what type of visa, if any, you will need
if you stay in Denmark with a residence permit or long-stay visa, this does not count towards your 90-day visa-free limit
Any time you spent in Denmark or other Schengen countries before 1 January 2021 does not count towards your 90-day visa-free limit.
At Danish border control, you may need to use separate lanes from EU, EEA and Swiss citizens when queueing. Your passport may be stamped on entry and exit. You may also need to:
show a return or onward ticket
show you have enough money for your stay
There are separate requirements for those who are resident in Denmark. If you are resident in Denmark, you should carry proof of residence as well as your valid passport when you travel. For further information on these requirements, see our Living in Denmark guide.
Passport validity
Check your passport is valid for travel before you book your trip, and renew your passport if you do not have enough time left on it.
You must have at least 6 months left on an adult or child passport to travel to most countries in Europe (not including Ireland).
If you renewed your current passport before the previous one expired, extra months may have been added to its expiry date. Any extra months on your passport over 10 years may not count towards the 6 months needed.
UK Emergency Travel Documents
UK Emergency Travel Documents (ETDs) are accepted for entry, airside transit and exit from Denmark. Your ETD must be valid for the proposed duration of your stay.
