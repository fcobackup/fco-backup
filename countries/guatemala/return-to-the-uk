On 12 April, Guatemalan authorities extended the prohibition of landings and departures of international and local flights, both commercial and private, until further notice, with the exception of rescue-humanitarian, official, military and ambulance flights, that have been authorised by the Presidency of the Republic through the Ministry of Foreign Affairs.

Financial support for a flight
If you have exhausted all other options available to you for getting funds, you may be eligible to apply for an emergency loan from the government to cover the cost of the ticket.
You would need to repay the loan when you are back in the UK.
Our partner CTM is also authorised to administer such loans on behalf of the FCO and details will be available when you are asked to pay.
Travel to the airport
There are currently strict travel restrictions between departments in Guatemala. The Embassy will therefore organise buses to help British Nationals outside of Guatemala City to travel safely to the airport. Once your ticket has been confirmed, the Embassy will be in touch with further information. Passengers travelling during curfew hours will be provided with (salvoconductos) permissions of safe passage.
