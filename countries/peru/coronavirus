Cases of coronavirus (COVID-19) have been confirmed in Peru. The Peruvian authorities have introduced measures to limit the spread of the virus.
On 15 March, Peru announced a national State of Emergency, which has now been extended until 10 May.
Since 31 March, there is a nationwide curfew between the hours of 18:00 to 04:00. In Tumbes, Piura, Lambayeque, La Libertad and Loreto the curfew will start two hours early, lasting from 16:00 to 04:00. The Government of Peru has announced that all individuals should use facemasks when going outside.
On Sundays, no one is allowed out.
These restrictions may not apply to those who have obtained a travel permit (salvo-conducto) from the Peruvian authorities in order to travel to flights or on pre-arranged transport. If you require a salvo-conducto, you must contact the British Embassy first and we will request one on your behalf. You should note that the Peruvian authorities are not issuing salvo-conductos for those without pre-arranged international flights. If you need to travel within Peru (from one region to another), let us know so that we can make a request to the Peruvian authorities. Depending on the destination of the flight, you may also have to spend some time (possibly two weeks) on quarantine immediately after arrival. The exact location of the quarantine will be decided by the regional government upon arrival.
Borders and travel restrictions
All borders are closed indefinitely.
If you are in Peru, you are advised to secure accommodation for this period. IPERU, the Peruvian Tourism Information Agency, is offering details of suitable accommodation. There are reports of hotels and hostels closing throughout the country due to threats of quarantine. IPERU has details of remaining accommodation options.

Local measures
Freedom of movement is restricted for the same period. The main exceptions are to purchase food or medication, or to visit banks. British nationals in Peru should follow the advice of the Peruvian authorities and abide by the measures in place. There will be police and armed forces patrols to impose the restrictions.
The Peruvian authorities have confirmed that drinking in public areas is prohibited during the State of Emergency.
Private and public school classes in Peru have been suspended. Virtual sessions started on 6 April.
Visas
During this period the Peruvian authorities have also confirmed that fees will be waived for overstays on visas owing to the State of Emergency.
