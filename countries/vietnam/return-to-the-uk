There are still commercial options to return to the UK from Vietnam.
If you live in the UK and are currently visiting Vietnam, you’re strongly advised to return now by commercial means. While some international flights remain, these cannot be fully guaranteed. Don’t run the risk of getting stranded.
UK special charter flights will only operate for priority countries where commercial flights are not possible. You should not assume that these flights will become available in Vietnam because commercial routes are operating.
International flights
The remaining regular flight options to the UK are from Hanoi and Ho Chi Minh City via Incheon, South Korea on Korean Air and Asiana Airlines. You may also take VietJet to Incheon, provided you have a confirmed connecting flight and only have carry on luggage, due to transit regulations. Please note that flight frequency may change with little notice and there are restrictions on transiting, particularly if you’re using more than one airline. Please check with the airlines and/or travel agents for up to date information on flight times and travel requirements, particularly transit times, visa and transit visa requirements.
You should follow the British Embassy on Twitter and Facebook for further information and instructions.
You will need to pay for your return travel to the UK. If departure options are available but you cannot afford the travel costs and have exhausted all other options for getting funds, you may be eligible to apply for an emergency loan from the government. This is a last resort option and you would need to repay the loan when you are back in the UK. For more information, you should contact Corporate Travel Management (CTM). CTM are a commercial partner of the FCO and are authorised to administer such loans on behalf of the FCO.
UK Emergency Travel Documents
If you need to travel from Vietnam, we may be able to issue an Emergency Travel Document (ETD). Please contact us for information about how to apply at:
British Embassy Hanoi: www.gov.uk/contact-consulate-hanoi
British Consulate General HCMC: www.gov.uk/contact-consulate-ho-chi-minh
UK Emergency Travel Documents are accepted for entry, airside transit and exit from Vietnam. Please contact the nearest Vietnamese Embassy to obtain an appropriate visa before travel. If your ETD has been issued in Vietnam, to replace a lost/stolen passport, you will need an exit visa from the Vietnam Immigration Department before you can travel out of Vietnam. This process normally takes 5 working days. Contact the Immigration Department directly for further information.
Travelling to the airport
Taxis or private hire cars are available to take you to international airports in Vietnam.
Accessing departure airports
Internal flight routes have resumed though many routes have a lower frequency than pre-COVID-19 levels.
