The security situation throughout Afghanistan remains uncertain, and could change rapidly. If you choose to travel to or stay in Afghanistan against FCDO advice, you should monitor media reporting and make sure you have robust contingency plans in place. Be vigilant at all times, keep others informed of your travel plans and vary your routes and routines.
Political situation
Afghanistan is undergoing a major transition in terms of politics, economy and security, with the departure of NATO troops.
The risk for violence around political events and rallies remains. You should avoid all political demonstrations and public gatherings. Keep up to date with developments in the security situation, including through monitoring local media.
Road travel
If you travel to or stay in Afghanistan against this advice, you should be aware that road travel is highly dangerous. Insurgents have set up false vehicle checkpoints from which violent attacks have been launched, and there continue to be fatal roadside bombings and attacks on military and civilian vehicles. In addition to the threat from terrorism and kidnapping, there is also a continuing criminal threat from carjacking and robbery. Avoid travelling between cities at night.
Public transport is dangerous. Taxis and long distance buses are often poorly maintained, uninsured and driven by unqualified drivers. Privately hired transport is often driven by uninsured, unqualified drivers. You should carry out long distance journeys by air where possible.
If you choose to travel by road you should only travel in secure transport with close protection, using reputable local drivers and guides. Make sure doors are locked and windows closed. You should consider strongly the use of armoured vehicles. Most road surfaces are in a very poor condition. The overall standard of driving is poor and most local drivers are uninsured. Accidents may lead to confrontation and threatening behaviour.
Afghan regulations allow people to drive in Afghanistan with a valid driving licence for up to one year. After that you will need to get a local licence.
Non-Governmental Organisations (NGOs)
There have been a number of serious attacks on both western and Afghan NGOs and vehicles belonging to them, in which people have been killed or injured. NGO workers have been kidnapped near their places of work. Most attacks continue to occur in the east and south of Afghanistan with a recent increase in activity in the central areas. The International NGO Safety Organisation (INSO) issues regular security updates for NGOs.
Air travel
All airlines from Afghanistan have been refused permission to operate services to the EU because Afghanistan is unable to ensure that its airlines meet international safety standards. FCDO staff are advised to use carriers which aren’t subject to the EU operating ban.
A list of recent incidents and accidents can be found on the website of the Aviation Safety network. The FCDO cannot offer advice on the safety of individual airlines. However, the International Air Transport Association publishes a list of registered airlines that have been audited and found to meet a number of operational safety standards and recommended practices. This list is not exhaustive and the absence of an airline from this list doesn’t necessarily mean that it’s unsafe.
Transiting UAE
Flying to Dubai and then transferring is the most common route into Afghanistan. If you’re planning to travel this route, you should also check travel advice for the United Arab Emirates.
It is illegal to transit the United Arab Emirates carrying unlicensed personal protection equipment. This includes, but is not limited to, body armour (including ballistic vests), weapon holsters and handcuffs. Other specialist technical equipment such as satellite phones, listening and recording devices, powerful cameras and binoculars, while freely available in the UK, may also need licences. Persons found carrying any such items without a licence may be subject to conviction resulting in imprisonment and substantial monetary fines in accordance with Emirati law.
Crime
Crime is a serious concern, particularly in rural areas. British nationals of Afghan origin have been targeted by criminals, including kidnappers, as they are often perceived as being wealthier than locals. Foreigners have been the victims of violent attacks, including armed robbery and rape. Do not display any obvious signs of wealth, or carry large sums of money. Do not travel alone, especially on foot. Take particular care after dark.
Harassment of foreign women is not unusual including uninvited physical contact and unwanted attention.
Advice to business
Specific guidance for companies seeking to do business in Afghanistan can be found on the Department for International Trade (DIT) website. DIT are also able to put you in touch with companies operating in Afghanistan who offer security services. For more information see Operating in High Risk Environments: advice for business.
Local travel
If you travel to or stay in Afghanistan against FCDO advice and are travelling around Afghanistan, including Kabul, you should seek professional security advice and continually reassess your personal security. The British Embassy in Kabul operates under strict security protocols and always uses armoured vehicles; staff receive regular security briefings to enable them to carry out their work in as safe an environment as possible.

Only travel with reputable local guides and to fully protected workplaces. Take the greatest possible care and vary your routines. Do not publicise your travel, including on social media. If possible, maintain radio or telephone communications to report your movements. Avoid any protests, demonstrations or large gatherings.
There are large amounts of unexploded bombs and land mines (both anti-tank and anti-personnel) throughout the country.
