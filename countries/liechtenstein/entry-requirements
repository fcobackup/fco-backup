The information on this page covers the most common types of travel and reflects the UK government’s understanding of the rules currently in place. Unless otherwise stated, this information is for travellers using a full ‘British Citizen’ passport.
The authorities in the country or territory you’re travelling to are responsible for setting and enforcing the rules for entry. If you’re unclear about any aspect of the entry requirements, or you need further reassurance, you’ll need to contact the embassy, high commission or consulate of the country or territory you’re travelling to.
You should also consider checking with your transport provider or travel company to make sure your passport and other travel documents meet their requirements.
Immigration and customs
Switzerland handles immigration and customs matters for Liechtenstein. Entry requirements are the same as for Switzerland. There is no customs border between Switzerland and Liechtenstein.
Visas
British nationals do not need a visa to enter Liechtenstein for a maximum stay of 90 days. For all other types of travel, you should refer to the Swiss Embassy in London.
In the event of changes to entry requirements after the UK leaves the EU on 29 March 2019, this page will be updated as soon as information is available.
Passport validity
Your passport should be valid for the proposed duration of your stay. No additional period of validity beyond this is required.
However, if the UK leaves the European Union with no deal, the passport validity rules for travel to most countries in Europe will change from 29 March 2019. Some passports with up to 15 months validity remaining may not be valid for travel. Before booking travel, you should check that your passport will meet these new rules and find out whether you need to renew it.
UK Emergency Travel Documents (ETDs)
UK ETDs are accepted for entry, airside transit and exit from Liechtenstein.
