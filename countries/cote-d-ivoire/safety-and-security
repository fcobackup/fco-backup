Political situation
Following peaceful presidential elections in 2015 the risk of a return to the levels of conflict experienced between December 2010 and May 2011 is low.
Political protests took place in Abidjan on 23 December 2019. Further protests may take place, with the potential for violence, including around the party headquarters of GPS in Cocody Riviera. You should avoid areas of demonstrations and large gatherings and follow instructions from the local authorities.
There were incidents of violence and intimidation during local elections in October 2018 and re-runs in December 2018. Political tensions remain heightened following these elections, particularly in the central Plateau district of Abidjan. You should exercise caution and avoid large political rallies and gatherings. In the event of unrest, monitor local media and follow instructions given by local police and security personnel.
You should be vigilant near military barracks, military installations, large crowds and demonstrations. There were several incidents of violence and protest related to the military during 2017 and 2018. Security forces in Bouake clashed on 8 to 9 January 2018, resulting in the destruction of military buildings. Military protests also occurred in several cities in Côte d’Ivoire in January, February and May 2017. The government reached an agreement with the soldiers resulting in an end to their protests. In the event of unrest, monitor local media and follow instructions given by local police and security personnel.
Security
If you’re staying longer in Côte d’Ivoire you should regularly review personal security arrangements and seek professional security advice. You should keep a stock of food and water.
Crime
There’s a risk of crime in Abidjan, including violent crime, car-jackings, armed break-ins to private residences, hold-ups in the street, and theft from cars. These incidents aren’t common, but they do occur.
In vehicles, keep doors locked, windows shut and valuables out of sight. If possible, avoid using public transport, shared taxis, or walking around after dark.
On bridges to and from the Le Plateau areas of Abidjan, pedestrians have been attacked and robbed even during the day. Avoid displaying your wallet; for instance, have money to hand to tip supermarket trolley attendants.
Attacks by armed robbers have occurred on the main road between Yamoussoukro and Korogho.
Attacks have been reported in the west of the country, during daylight hours as well as night.
Local travel
Northern border with Mali and Burkina Faso (including Comoé national park area)
The FCO advise against all but essential travel to within 40km of the border with Mali and Burkina Faso, due to the security situation in these neighbouring countries. See Terrorism
Border with Liberia
The FCO advise against all but essential travel to within 20km of the border with Liberia owing to the risk of serious violence by local militias. Fatal clashes between militias and the security forces have taken place in this area in the past. Seek professional local advice before embarking on any travel to these areas. Take care if you intend to travel to any rural areas.
Road travel
Driving standards and road conditions in Côte d’Ivoire are poor, although they are improving in Abidjan where the road infrastructure is being upgraded. Avoid driving outside towns and cities at night as roads and vehicles can be poorly lit, and unlit broken-down vehicles can block the road. You should be alert to the risk of stray livestock that could cause a safety hazard. Grass or leaves strewn on the carriageway often means an accident or other hazard in the road ahead. During the rainy season roads, especially those that are minor and unpaved, may become impassable.
Take care when using public transport; driving standards and vehicle maintenance are poor. Unskilled drivers, poorly maintained vehicles and overloaded vehicles and inadequate lighting make driving conditions hazardous. Taxis are available in main cities, but are likely to be in bad mechanical condition. There’s an online taxi booking service operated in Abidjan by Africab, whose service is becoming increasingly popular. Wear a seat belt at all times.
Roadblocks and checkpoints
You might still occasionally encounter checkpoints in and around Abidjan. You might also find official and unofficial roadblocks and checkpoints on the major routes outside of Abidjan. Take care and co-operate with those operating them.
Air travel
The European Commission has published a list of air carriers that are subject to an operating ban or restrictions within the European Union. You should check the list to see whether this will affect your travel.
You should monitor changes to travel restrictions and make sure that you have adequate and flexible travel arrangements in place for your onward journey from Côte d’Ivoire.
Swimming
Ocean currents are very strong along the coast. There’s no lifeboat service and many drownings occur each year.
