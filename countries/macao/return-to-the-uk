There remain commercial options to return to the UK from Macao.
If you live in the UK and are currently visiting Macao, you’re strongly advised to return now by commercial means. Don’t run the risk of getting stranded.
UK special charter flights will only operate for priority countries where commercial flights are not possible. You should not assume that these flights will become available in countries where commercial routes are operating. Please do not contact the contracted travel management company if no flight is advertised here.
Flights
There are limited indirect flights available from Macao International Airport. You should check that the country in which you plan to transit allows you to do so. Airlines are likely to further reduce or suspend flights at short notice. Please check with your airline or tour operator for the latest updates.
You will need to pay for your return travel to the UK. If departure options are available but you cannot afford the travel costs and have exhausted all other options for getting funds, you may be eligible to apply for an emergency loan from the government. This is a last resort option and you would need to repay the loan when you are back in the UK. For more information, you should contact Corporate Travel Management (CTM). CTM are a commercial partner of the FCO and are authorised to administer such loans on behalf of the FCO.
Travel via Hong Kong
It is no longer possible to return from Macao to the UK via Hong Kong due to travel restrictions between Hong Kong and Macao, and restrictions on entry into Hong Kong.
All ferry crossings and commercial bus routes between Hong Kong and Macao have ceased until further notice. While the Hong Kong-Zhuhai-Macao bridge will remain open for some private vehicles between 0600 - 2200, only a limited number of vehicles with specific licenses are permitted to use the crossing.
All persons arriving from or having stayed in Macao will be subject to mandatory 14 day quarantine upon arrival in Hong Kong, and non-Hong Kong residents travelling to Hong Kong from Macao will be denied entry to Hong Kong if they have been to any overseas country/territory in the past 14 days. For further information, see Hong Kong travel advice.
