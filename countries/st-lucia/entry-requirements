The authorities in St Lucia set and enforce entry rules. For further information contact the embassy, high commission or consulate of the country or territory you’re travelling to. You should also consider checking with your transport provider or travel company to make sure your passport and other travel documents meet their requirements.
Entry rules in response to coronavirus (COVID-19)
From 5 March 2022 there are new rules for unvaccinated travellers (both resident and non-resident) arriving in St Lucia, that may restrict accommodation and movement for the first 14 days.
Cruise ship passengers should read entry protocols for anyone arriving on a cruise ship.
Testing and Quarantine requirements on arrival
Fully vaccinated travellers and in-transit passengers aged 5 and over must have a negative rapid Covid-19 antigen test or a Rapid COVID-19 PCR test taken one day prior to entering Saint Lucia. Travellers may also provide a negative RT- PCR COVID-19 test taken up to five days prior to arrival
All unvaccinated travellers must present a negative RT- PCR COVID-19 test, taken up to five days prior to entering Saint Lucia
All travellers must register their information and upload test results online prior to travel. On completion, they will receive an automatic ‘ready to go’ email. The previous two-step approval process is no longer required for boarding
Rapid antigen tests must be administered by a healthcare provider. Self-administered tests and saliva tests are not accepted. UK NHS tests are not valid for travel
St Lucia accepts the following tests: nasopharyngeal sample, oropharyngeal sample, nasal sample, oropharyngeal, anterior nares sample and mid turbinate samples. The following tests are not accepted: LAMP tests, self-administered tests or home kits, saliva samples
Failure to upload all the necessary information will result in delays in processing at the port of entry
Passengers arriving without tests or with the wrong type of test will be tested on arrival at their own cost and will be required to remain in quarantine until the result of the test is known.
Quarantine requirements
The St Lucia Tourism Authority website has the protocols for unvaccinated residents and unvaccinated non-residents that apply for the first 14 days. Unvaccinated residents must go into state quarantine and send a confirmed booking in advance, or get exemption for home quarantine in advance of travel. Unvaccinated non-residents must stay in COVID-certified accommodation. The website has details of certified activities for this period.
Any symptomatic passengers will be isolated and tested and required to remain in quarantine/isolation at your hotel or Government operated quarantine facility until the test result is obtained. If the test is positive all visitors and nationals will be transferred to a treatment facility until they receive two negative test results and are clinically stable.
Lifting of Quarantine for Fully Vaccinated Persons
Persons who have been fully vaccinated will not be required to go into quarantine on arrival. Persons must have received their second dose 14 days prior to arrival on island. All other protocols must be adhered to such as mask wearing and social distancing. Complete list of protocols are on https://www.stlucia.org/en_UK/.
If you are travelling with children aged 5-17 years and you would like them to also be exempt from quarantine they will need to be retested on arrival at your cost, and they must remain in quarantine until the results of the test are known. Once the test is negative they will not be required to quarantine.
Demonstrating your COVID-19 status
St Lucia will accept the UK’s proof of COVID-19 recovery and vaccination record. Your NHS appointment card from vaccination centres is not designed to be used as proof of vaccination and should not be used to demonstrate your vaccine status.
