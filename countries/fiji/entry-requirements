The information on this page covers the most common types of travel and reflects the UK government’s understanding of the rules currently in place. Unless otherwise stated, this information is for travellers using a full ‘British Citizen’ passport.
The authorities in the country or territory you’re travelling to are responsible for setting and enforcing the rules for entry. If you’re unclear about any aspect of the entry requirements, or you need further reassurance, you’ll need to contact the embassy, high commission or consulate of the country or territory you’re travelling to.
You should also consider checking with your transport provider or travel company to make sure your passport and other travel documents meet their requirements.
Visas
Visas are not required for visits of up to 4 months. You must have an onward or return ticket and a valid visa for the next country you are travelling to. If you are visiting Fiji on business you will be granted a stay for 14 days on arrival.
If you plan to stay for longer than 4 months, you will need to apply for a visa from the Fiji High Commission in London.
Yachts can only enter Fiji through Suva, Lautoka, Savusavu and Levuka For other ports, such as Nadi/Denarau, prior arrangement with the Fijian Authorities is required.
Passport validity
Your passport should be valid for a minimum period of 6 months from the date of entry into Fiji.
UK Emergency Travel Documents
UK Emergency Travel Documents are valid for entry, airside transit and exit from Fiji.
Yellow fever certificate requirements
Check whether you need a yellow fever certificate by visiting the National Travel Health Network and Centre’s TravelHealthPro website.
Importing meat or dairy products
Fiji customs enforce strict quarantine regulations and x-ray all in-bound luggage at Nadi airport. Most perishable foodstuffs will be confiscated on arrival, unless arriving from a country with quarantine agreements with Fiji.
Importing or exporting currency
You must declare currency amounts in excess of FJ$10,000.
Travelling with children
Some countries require documentary evidence of parental responsibility before allowing lone parents to enter the country or, in some cases, before permitting the children to leave the country.
In the case of Fiji, no such documentation is required for visitors. But it is required for those applying for work and/or residency permits. For further information contact the Fiji High Commission in London.
