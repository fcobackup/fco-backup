Warning
FCDO advises against all travel to Syria.

The Foreign, Commonwealth & Development Office (FCDO) cannot provide tailored advice for individual trips. Read this travel advice and carry out your own research before deciding whether to travel.
Emergency services in Syria
Due to the conflict, there are no effective emergency services in Syria.
Help abroad in an emergency
Consular support is not available from the British government from within Syria, as all British Embassy services in Damascus are suspended and all diplomatic and consular staff have been withdrawn. The FCDO may become aware of support provided by other organisations which can be shared with British nationals.
The FCDO may become aware of plans by other organisations which can be shared with British nationals we know want to leave. Any travel would be undertaken at your own risk.
If you are a British national in Syria and need help, call the FCDO in London on +44 (0)20 7008 5000.

Contact your travel provider and insurer 
Contact your travel provider and your insurer if you are involved in a serious incident or emergency abroad. They will tell you if they can help and what you need to do. 
Refunds and changes to travel 
For refunds or changes to travel, contact your travel provider. You may also be able to make a claim through insurance. However, insurers usually require you to talk to your travel provider first.
