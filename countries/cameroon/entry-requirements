This page reflects the UK government’s understanding of current rules for people travelling on a full ‘British Citizen’ passport, for the most common types of travel.
The authorities in Cameroon set and enforce entry rules. If you’re unsure how Cameroon’s entry requirements apply to you, contact its UK embassy, high commission or consulate.
You should also consider checking with your transport provider or travel company to make sure your passport and other travel documents meet their requirements.
Travellers may be asked to show proof that they fulfil the COVID-19 entry requirements of their destination country. Be prepared to produce the necessary documentation.
Visas
You will need a visa to enter Cameroon.
Visa applications should be made online, through the visa portal. There have been technical problems with this online visa system since its implementation in May 2023, which has prevented many from obtaining visas.
There is currently no visa-on-arrival service at either Yaoundé or Douala International Airport. If you travel to Cameroon by road or sea you must obtain a physical visa before arrival. E-visas will not be issued at land or sea borders.
If you have a query about your immigration status while in Cameroon, contact the General Delegation for National Security in Yaoundé (telephone: +237 22221 2884).
Dual nationality
Cameroon does not recognise dual nationality in adults. If you have acquired British citizenship but previously held Cameroon citizenship, or as an adult still hold a Cameroon passport, you should not attempt to enter Cameroon on your Cameroonian passport because this is against the law.
Passport validity
Your passport should be valid for a minimum period of six months from the date of entry into Cameroon.
Yellow fever certificate requirements
You must present a yellow fever certificate upon arrival in Cameroon, and travellers leaving Cameroon are frequently asked for their Yellow Fever certificate as they pass through security. Check the requirements by visiting the National Travel Health Network and Centre’s TravelHealthPro website.
