Papua New Guinea sits along a volatile seismic strip called the “Ring of Fire” in the Pacific. Volcanic eruptions, earthquakes and tsunamis are possible. Seismic and volcanic activity is more likely to occur near Rabaul in East New Britain Province, Kimbe in West New Britain Province, and on Manam Island in Madang Province.
Earthquakes
There is a constant danger from earthquakes, which can be followed by tsunami warnings.
To learn more about what to do before, during and after an earthquake, see the website of the US Federal Emergency Management Agency.
Volcanoes
Kadovar Island volcano started to erupt on 5 January 2018. The island has been evacuated. You should monitor local reports for the latest information on the volcano and follow the instructions of local authorities. Information on the volcanic ash plume is available on the website of the Volcanic Ash Advisory Centre in Darwin.
Manam Island Volcano erupted in 2010 and although there has been no evidence of any lava flow, people have been advised not to climb on or around the volcano.
Tropical Cyclones
The tropical cyclone season normally runs from November to May. Monitor local and international weather updates from the World Meteorological Organisation (WMO) and the Australian Bureau of Meteorology.
See our tropical cyclones page for advice about what to do if you are caught up in a storm.
Floods 
Flooding and landslides can occur, especially in rural areas. Coastal areas experience monthly King Tides, which may cause localised flooding. Local communities are fairly well adapted to cope.
