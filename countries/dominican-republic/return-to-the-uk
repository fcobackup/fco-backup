The Dominican Republic’s borders are closed and international flights have been suspended. Although limited commercial options are still departing via the US, British Nationals have not been able to book onto these flights.
UK special flights
From 3 June, the UK is planning to  operate special flights from  Barbados to the UK.  Local ‘sweeper ’ flights will connect British travellers in  Antigua and Barbuda,  the British Virgin Islands,  Dominica, the Dominican Republic, Grenada,  Montserrat, St Kitts and Nevis, St Lucia, Saint Vincent and the Grenadines,  and Trinidad and Tobago  to Barbados.
The flight cost is £600 per person, regardless of where your journey begins.
These flights are for:
British travellers, normally resident in the UK
dependants  travelling with a British traveller
Vulnerable British travellers  will be prioritised.  For these flights, you may be vulnerable if, for example, you are located in more remote or at risk areas, over the age of 70, have serious underlying medical conditions, or are travelling with children.  Remaining seats  will be allocated on a first come, first served basis to British travellers and their direct dependants.
Vulnerable non-British UK residents with Indefinite Leave to Remain, and other foreign nationals, may be accommodated  if there is sufficient capacity.
Your eligibility will be checked before your tickets are issued.
How to book
CTM is working on behalf of the Foreign and Commonwealth Office (FCO) to manage special flight bookings.
If you have already expressed your interest in returning home on a government-chartered flight and are eligible to do so, the Foreign and Commonwealth Office will contact you by email by Tuesday 26 May with instructions on how to book a ticket.  Booking will be staggered by country. You should not attempt to book until you receive the link to the portal from the British High Commission.
Passengers will not be able to choose which flight they will travel  on. You will be allocated a place based on your location and personal circumstances.  You  will be told  your flight date and time once your booking is confirmed.
If you are eligible to travel  and have not already expressed your interest,  you should  contact the  British High  Commission as soon as possible, by emailing  ukinbarbados@fco.gov.uk.
Tickets will not be on sale at the airport. Do not travel to the airport without a confirmed ticket.
You may find it helpful to read our  guide to eligibility and the booking process for special charter flights.
Financial support for a flight
If you have exhausted all other options available to you for getting funds, you may be eligible to apply for an emergency loan from the government to cover the cost of the ticket.
You would need to repay the loan when you are back in the UK.
Our partner  CTM is also authorised to administer such loans on behalf of the  FCO and details will be available when you  are asked to pay.
Travel to the airport
You should observe the curfew (7pm to 5am Monday to Saturday, 5pm to 5am on Sundays) when planning your travel to the airport. You should comply with all COVID-19 social distancing restrictions and any instructions from police or the Dominican authorities. If these measures will affect your journey or you will need to travel during curfew in order to reach the airport in time, contact the Embassy urgently on Returnfrom.DominicanRepublic@fco.gov.uk.
