Elections 
Guyana will hold national and regional elections on 1 September 2025. Political rallies are common. These rallies can draw large crowds and cause significant transport disruption. Any event with large crowds, including large celebratory gatherings, has the potential to turn violent and can also be used by criminals as cover for robbery and theft.
