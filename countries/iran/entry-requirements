Warning
FCDO advises against all travel to Iran.

This information is for people travelling on a full ‘British citizen’ passport from the UK who choose to travel against FCDO advice. It is based on the UK government’s understanding of Iran’s current rules for the most common types of travel. 
The authorities in Iran set and enforce entry rules. If you’re not sure how these requirements apply to you, contact the Iranian Embassy in the UK. 
You are at risk of arrest, detention and a death sentence if you travel to Iran. 
British nationals are at increased risk of questioning and detention by the Iranian authorities. See Safety and security. 
Passport validity requirements 
If you choose to enter Iran against FCDO advice, your passport must have an ‘expiry date’ at least 6 months after the date you arrive. It’s not possible to apply for a British passport from Iran.  
Check with your travel provider that your passport and other travel documents meet requirements. Renew your passport if you need to.   
You will be denied entry if you do not have a valid travel document or try to use a passport that has been reported lost or stolen.  
Dual nationality  
Iran does not recognise dual nationality. If you are a dual national, the Iranian authorities will consider you to be an Iranian national. They are highly unlikely to accept any requests made by the UK government on your behalf.  
All Iranian nationals must enter and leave Iran using an Iranian passport. If you want to travel to the UK from Iran, you may also need to prove to the Iranian authorities that you have the right to enter the UK. You must be able to produce your British passport or a valid UK visa in your Iranian passport on request. You may face increased scrutiny, questioning or detention because of your connection to the UK.  
Recent media reports suggest Iran is willing to detain people who have been visiting relatives inside Iran. Having travelled to and from Iran previously without issue does not guarantee your safety. See Safety and security for more information about the risks British nationals face in Iran. 
Being considered an Iranian national  
Even if you do not consider yourself Iranian, the Iranian authorities may see you as an Iranian national. For example, if your father is Iranian, or if you’re married to an Iranian man.   
Previous travel to Israel  
If your passport has stamps from Israel or other countries’ border crossing points with Israel, you may be refused entry to Iran. 
Overseas British passport applications 
You cannot apply for a British passport from Iran.  
You can apply in a neighbouring country. Choose from the list of countries and follow the application process for that country. 
For help with your passport application, contact HM Passport Office.  
Visa requirements  
You must have a visa to visit Iran unless you hold an Iranian passport. 
Check the expiry date of your visa before travelling. If you overstay your visa, you may have to stay in Iran until this is resolved and you may be detained.   
If you’re travelling through an Iranian airport, check visa requirements with your airline and the Iranian Embassy in the UK.  
Applying for a visa  
If you choose to travel to Iran against FCDO advice, apply for a visa well in advance of your travel. The application process for an Iranian visa can be long and unpredictable. 
If you want to travel to Iran with a British passport, the Iranian Embassy has told FCDO you must either apply as part of an organised tour or have a sponsor in Iran to get a visa. Check with the Iranian Embassy in the UK for more information.  
Your passport must be valid for at least 6 months from the date you submit your visa application. 
Women and girls aged 10 or over should wear a headscarf in their visa application photos.   
Some British nationals have had problems getting visas from private online visa agencies.  
Vaccine requirements 
To enter Iran, you must have certificates to prove you’ve had:  
a yellow fever vaccination if you’re coming from a country listed as a transmission risk 
a polio vaccine if you’re coming from a polio-affected country  
For full details about medical entry requirements and recommended vaccinations, see TravelHealthPro’s Iran guide.   
Customs rules  
There are strict rules about goods that you can take into or out of Iran. You must declare anything that may be prohibited or subject to tax or duty.  
Pork products  
Importing pork products is illegal. 
Children travelling without a male parent  
In Iran, a female parent travelling with her children must have the father’s permission, usually verbal, to take them out of Iran. Iranian immigration authorities will usually assume you have permission unless the father has petitioned the court, or the court has ruled to prevent the children travelling. For more information, contact the Iranian Embassy in the UK.  
Kish Island  
To enter Kish Island, you must arrange your visit through an Iranian travel agency. The agency must:  
inform the Iranian Ministry of Foreign Affairs about your visit at least 2 weeks before you travel  
have received confirmation that a visa will be issued on arrival 
The nearest Iranian embassy or consulate can give you advice and a list of registered travel agents.  
You must also have a hotel reservation before you travel. Your guide must:  
pass a copy of the hotel reservation confirmation to the immigration office at Kish Airport at least 48 hours before you arrive  
meet you at the airport when you arrive  
Travellers have occasionally been denied entry to Kish without explanation. If you’re denied entry, follow the advice of your airline or travel agent.
