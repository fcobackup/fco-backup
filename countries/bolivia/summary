As of 9 May 2018, the city of Sucre remains blockaded; it is not possible to enter or leave the city. We expect the blockade will be lifted temporarily later on 9 May to allow people to leave. It remains unclear if flights will operate from the airport. The city authorities may put in place arrangements to facilitate safe passage for those wishing to depart. If you’re in Sucre, you’re advised to remain in touch with the local authorities and keep up to date with this travel advice. It seems likely that the blockade will be reimposed from 10 May, once again preventing entry to and exit from the city.
There is a dispute between local communities on the Island of the Sun (Isla del Sol) on Lake Titicaca, and foreign tourists have been affected. You should remain vigilant, and before travelling to the Island you should seek local advice.

Social conflict is common in Bolivia and blockades may occur along the main roads. Public transport can be disrupted at very short notice and strikes may result in widespread road blockades, including on roads to and from airports. You should never try to cross a blockade. See Road travel and Road blockades. You should avoid large crowds and demonstrations.
