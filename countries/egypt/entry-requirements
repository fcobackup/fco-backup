Warning
FCDO advises against all travel to parts of Egypt.

This information is for people travelling on a full ‘British citizen’ passport from the UK. It is based on the UK government’s understanding of Egypt’s current rules for the most common types of travel.
The authorities in Egypt set and enforce entry rules. If you’re not sure how these requirements apply to you, contact the Egyptian Consulate General in the UK.
Passport validity requirements
To enter Egypt, your passport must have an ‘expiry date’ at least 6 months after the date you arrive and have at least one blank page.   
Check with your travel provider that your passport and other travel documents meet requirements. Renew your passport if you need to.
You will be denied entry if you do not have a valid travel document.
Visa requirements
British passport holders travelling to Egypt normally need a visa.
If you are staying for less than 15 days at resorts in Sharm el Sheikh, Dahab, Nuweiba or Taba, you do not need a visa. You will get a free entry permission stamp on arrival. If you plan to travel outside the resorts or stay more than 15 days, you must get a visa. You can get a visa at Sharm el Sheikh airport or online.     
Applying for a visa
You can apply for a visa:
online – getting an e-visa in advance can help to prevent delays, tourist e-visas are valid for up to 3 months
in person or by post – apply through the Egyptian Consulate General in the UK
on arrival in Egypt – approved airports have kiosks before you reach the immigration counters where you can buy a visa for 25 US dollars (cash only – Egyptian officials prefer dollars, but you may be able to pay in British pounds or euros). Visas on arrival are valid for up to 30 days.
British passport holders from British Overseas Territories and Crown Dependencies cannot apply online. 
Visa extensions
You can apply for a visa extension at the Egyptian Passport and Immigration Offices. If you try to leave Egypt on an expired visa, you may face difficulties, including a fine if your visa has expired by more than 14 days. Contact the Egyptian Consulate General in the UK for more information.
Visa agents in airports
You do not need to buy a visa from an agent. Agents often charge more than the required 25 US dollars. If an agent harasses you, report the incident to the tourist police in the airport terminal.
Gender expression
You may be denied entry if your gender expression or physical appearance does not match the sex marker in your passport or your passport photograph. See general advice for LGBT+ travellers
Entering Egypt from Israel
If you cross the border from Israel into Egypt at Taba, you will have to pay a ‘Sinai Tax’ of 720 Egyptian pounds per person (not applicable to children 24 months). This is payable at the Taba Border Crossing in Egyptian pounds, cash only. There is a bank and ATMs dispensing Egyptian pounds at the border. The ‘Sinai Tax’ exempts you from requiring an entry visa for Egypt for up to 15 days, as long as you stay within the Sinai Peninsula. If your stay in Sinai will exceed 15 days, or you are planning to leave the Sinai Peninsula, including to fly on from mainland airports, for example Cairo or Hurghada, you will need an entry visa. This costs 25 US dollars and can be purchased at the Taba Border Crossing on entry, or from the immigration office in Sharm el Sheikh.
Entering Egypt from Sudan 
The situation at the Egypt-Sudan border remains unclear. There are 2 main land border crossings – Qustul and Argeen. There is almost no infrastructure at these crossings, and it is no longer possible to obtain a visa on arrival at these locations. The Egyptian consulate is based in Wadi Halfa, 30km from the border – applications for Egyptian visas can be made here, but visa approvals can take upwards of 6 months. 
The UK Government is no longer evacuating people from Sudan. The British Embassy in Cairo does not have staff at the border and our ability to provide assistance is very limited. Travel in and from Sudan is at your own risk. See Sudan travel advice. 
If you are a British national and have crossed into Egypt from Sudan without valid documents, contact the British Embassy in Cairo for support.
Vaccine requirements
To enter Egypt, you must have a certificate to prove you’ve had a yellow fever vaccination if you’re coming from a country listed as a transmission risk.
For full details about medical entry requirements and recommended vaccinations, see TravelHealthPro’s Egypt guide.
HIV test for work permits
You will need to show HIV test results to apply for a work permit.
Customs rules
There are strict rules about goods you can take into or out of Egypt. You must declare anything that may be prohibited or subject to tax or duty. Contact the Egyptian Consulate General in the UK for more information about customs rules.
Taking money into or out of Egypt
You can bring up to 5,000 Egyptian pounds into or out of Egypt.
You must declare foreign currency worth more than 10,000 US dollars on arrival – there is no limit to the amount of foreign currency you can bring.
Electronic and communication devices
You should declare high value electronic devices and recording equipment when you arrive. Officials are likely to confiscate satellite phones or radio communications equipment unless you have prior clearance from the Ministry of Telecommunications.
