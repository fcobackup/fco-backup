Heavy rainfall
Heavy rainfall in Ecuador’s highlands (Sierra) and Amazon regions has triggered flooding, landslides and significant damage to the national road network, especially in the provinces of Azuay, Napo, Sucumbíos, Zamora Chinchipe, Loja, and Chimborazo.
In several areas, landslides have disrupted vehicle access, making travel to the Amazon region difficult. The provinces of Napo and Zamora Chinchipe are among the most affected by the heavy rains, and on 4 July the government declared a road emergency there for 60 and 45 days respectively. Check the ECU911 updates on road conditions and closures (in Spanish only).
Regional state of emergency declared (internal disturbance and armed violence)
A 60-day state of emergency (SOE) was renewed on 6 August due to internal disturbance and armed violence. You should always follow the instructions of police and local authorities. The SOE currently applies to the following provinces:
Guayas
El Oro
Manabí
Los Ríos
