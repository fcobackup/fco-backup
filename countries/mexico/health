Warning
FCDO advises against all but essential travel to parts of Mexico.

Before you travel check that:
your destination can provide the healthcare you may need
you have appropriate travel insurance for local treatment or unexpected medical evacuation
This is particularly important if you have a health condition or are pregnant.
Emergency medical number
Dial 911 and ask for an ambulance.
In Mexico City, you can use emergency buttons on CCTV cameras across the city to immediately connect to the emergency services.
Outside of state capitals and larger urban areas, medical and emergency services may be limited. This includes immediate response, ambulances, basic medical equipment and expertise.
Contact your insurance or medical assistance company quickly if you’re referred to a medical facility for treatment.
Vaccine recommendations and health risks 
At least 8 weeks before your trip:

Only drink boiled or bottled water and avoid ice in drinks.
Cyclospora

Medication
The legal status and regulation of some medicines prescribed or bought in the UK can be different in other countries.
Many pharmacies in large cities in Mexico provide 24-hour service, including home deliveries of medication. You must get prescriptions issued outside of Mexico translated into Spanish. Local pharmacies may still decide to reject a foreign prescription. Many pharmacies have a GP who can assess a patient and prescribe medication.
