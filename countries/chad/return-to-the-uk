Special Air France Flight
Air France will operate a special fight from N’Djamena to Paris on Saturday 30 May. The timings are not yet confirmed. Reservations for this flight need to be made exclusively with the Air France Office in N’Djamena and not through the French Embassy. We recommend that you look at the at the Travel Advice page for France (https://www.gov.uk/foreign-travel-advice/france) for advice on transit and onward travel to the UK, including the French requirements for documentation.
If you cannot afford the travel costs and have exhausted all other options for getting funds, you may be eligible to apply for an emergency loan from the government. This is a last resort option and you would need to repay the loan when you are back in the UK. For more information, you should contact Corporate Travel Management (CTM). CTM are a commercial partner of the FCO and are authorised to administer such loans on behalf of the FCO.
