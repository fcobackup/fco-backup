The information on this page covers the most common types of travel and reflects the UK government’s understanding of the rules currently in place. Unless otherwise stated, this information is for travellers using a full ‘British Citizen’ passport.
The authorities in the country or territory you’re travelling to are responsible for setting and enforcing the rules for entry. If you’re unclear about any aspect of the entry requirements, or you need further reassurance, you’ll need to contact the embassy, high commission or consulate of the country or territory you’re travelling to.
You should also consider checking with your transport provider or travel company to make sure your passport and other travel documents meet their requirements.
Passport validity
Your passport should be valid for the proposed duration of your stay; you don’t need any additional period of validity on your passport beyond this.
Visas
British citizens don’t need a visa to enter Bulgaria. If you have a different type of British nationality, check entry requirements with the Bulgarian Embassy in London before you travel.
If you want to stay in Bulgaria for longer than 3 months, you will need to register with the police and apply for a residence permit. You can find more information on how to register at the Ministry of Interior website
If you are a dual British-Bulgarian national you should enter and exit Bulgaria on your Bulgarian passport and carry your Bulgarian travel document and British passport with you.
UK Emergency Travel Documents
UK Emergency Travel Documents are accepted for entry, airside transit and exit from Bulgaria.
