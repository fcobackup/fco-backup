Nationwide political protests across Ecuador began on 13 June 2022. The situation turned violent in some areas and involved the declaration of state of emergencies in various provinces. Following a mediation dialogue process and an interim agreement signed on 30 June, the end of the nationwide demonstrations and national strike has been announced. The agreement includes ending road blockades to allow safe transit throughout the country, including the transport of essential supplies including food, cooking gas and medical supplies.
British nationals are advised to continue to avoid any public gatherings and to monitor local media, including social media channels. You are advised to check the state of roads on the Ecuadorean government website (in Spanish). Foreign tourists in country affected by the demonstrations and road disturbances, can contact the Ecuadorean Ministry of Tourism (MinTur) for direct help and guidance, through an online assistance requirement system. For more information, you can also follow MinTur social media channels. You should also follow any relevant advice from local tour operators.
