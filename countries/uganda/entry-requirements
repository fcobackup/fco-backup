Coronavirus guidance is being updated.
Read the Prime Minister’s address for the latest information.

The information on this page covers the most common types of travel and reflects the UK government’s understanding of the rules currently in place. Unless otherwise stated, this information is for travellers using a full ‘British Citizen’ passport.
The authorities in the country or territory you’re travelling to are responsible for setting and enforcing the rules for entry. If you’re unclear about any aspect of the entry requirements, or you need further reassurance, you’ll need to contact the embassy, high commission or consulate of the country or territory you’re travelling to.
You should also consider checking with your transport provider or travel company to make sure your passport and other travel documents meet their requirements.
Coronavirus
The Ugandan authorities have introduced new measures in relation to coronavirus. See Coronavirus section for further information.
The Ugandan Immigration offices are closed until further notice. We are seeking urgent guidance on what this means for British Nationals whose visas or residency permits are due to expire. You should continue to check this travel advice and the British Embassy Facebook and Twitter pages.
Visas 
You’ll need a visa to enter Uganda. You can apply for a visa at the Ugandan High Commission in London or apply online for an ‘e-visa’. You can find full details of how to apply on the website of the Ugandan High Commission in London. You should give yourself sufficient time to apply for a visa and make sure when applying that the start date and validity covers the period you wish to travel.
You can also apply for an East African Tourist Visa. This is valid for 90 days and allows multiple entry into Kenya, Rwanda and Uganda. You can apply for this visa on the ‘e-visa’ website.
Ugandan immigration officers decide how long travellers are permitted to stay in Uganda when they enter the country. This is usually between 2 weeks and 3 months, and the immigration officer will normally enter a handwritten note of this period next to the entry stamp in your passport. You can usually be fined and/or imprisoned for overstaying your visa. However Immigration offices in Uganda are closed until further notice. The Ministry of Internal Affairs have advised that fines accrued for overstaying visa/permits from the 18 March to 17 May 2020 are waived. They have also advised that foreign nationals who are in Uganda with expired visas/permits will not be arrested.
For more information about entry requirements, visit the Ugandan Directorate of Citizenship and Immigration Control website.
