On 22 June 2020, the Saudi authorities announced that due to the Covid-19 pandemic, pilgrims from outside the Kingdom would not be permitted to enter Saudi Arabia to perform Hajj in 2020. Hajj rites were performed by a very limited number of pilgrims who already reside in the Kingdom. A temporary suspension on Umrah remains in place.
The approximate dates for the 2021 Hajj are 17-22 July. British citizens wishing to perform Umrah or Hajj should follow announcements on FCO official social media channels @ukinsaudiarabia and guidance from local authorities.
