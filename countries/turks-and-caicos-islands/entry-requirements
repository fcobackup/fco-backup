Visas
If you need further information about entry requirements, contact the local immigration authorities. You should also check with your airline or travel company for the latest information.
Visas are not required if you have a valid UK Passport. The Turks and Caicos Islands Immigration department will normally give you permission to stay for up to 90 days. You will need a permit to work on any of the islands.
For more information on visa requirements, visit the website of the Turks and Caicos Islands Ministry of Border Control and Employment.
Passport Validity
You must hold a valid passport to enter Turks and Caicos. Your passport should be valid for a minimum period of 6 months from the date of entry into Turks and Caicos.
Customs regulations
There are restrictions on the import and export of agricultural, food and marine products. Before arrival, all flight passengers will be asked to complete a form providing details of products they are bringing into the country. This form should be handed to a customs official on arrival.
There are no restrictions for travellers on the import of cameras, film or sports equipment. To bring in firearms of any type (including spear guns and Hawaiian slings), you will need written approval from the Commissioner of Police.
Travelling with medicines or any controlled drugs must be accompanied by a doctor’s prescription. Keep all medication in original packaging to avoid confusion and questioning at ports of entry.
