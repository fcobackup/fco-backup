There are severe penalties for drug trafficking and drug use in El Salvador. Prisons are overcrowded and violent.
In El Salvador, local people are largely tolerant of individuals’ personal lifestyles and small displays of affection between same sex couples. However, there’s a much more conservative attitude outside San Salvador so public displays of affection by same-sex couples aren’t recommended. There are no legal provisions for same-sex marriage or adoption. While the Family Code establishes that marriage should happen between a man and a woman, the Constitution does not make this specific point.
