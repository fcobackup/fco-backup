Thailand-Malaysia border  
FCDO advises against all but essential travel to parts of the south, near the Thailand-Malaysia border:
Pattani Province
Yala Province
Narathiwat Province
southern Songkhla Province – south of the A43 road between Hat Yai and Sakom, and south of the train line which runs between Hat Yai and Padang Besar
FCDO also advises against all but essential travel on the Hat Yai to Padang Besar train line that runs through these provinces.
This is due to regular terrorist attacks. See Terrorism.
Thailand-Cambodia border
Take extra care in border areas and follow the instructions of local authorities. The line of the international border near the Preah Vihear temple is disputed by Cambodia and Thailand. There are unexploded landmines in the border area. Stay on marked paths especially around Ta Krabey.
Stay alert to the local situation when travelling anywhere near to the border with Cambodia, and at land crossings between the 2 countries.
Thailand-Laos border
Not all land border crossings into Laos are open to foreign nationals. Even if the border crossing is open, you may need to get a visa for Laos in advance. Check the entry requirements in the Laos travel advice. Follow the instructions of local authorities and be vigilant in the border areas.
Thailand-Myanmar border
The security situation in Myanmar is unpredictable and liable to change without notice. See Myanmar travel advice.
