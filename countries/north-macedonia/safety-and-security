Crime
Personal attacks against foreigners are extremely rare. Organised criminal groups are active, particularly in northern areas the border with Kosovo. Shooting incidents, including in Skopje do sometimes occur, but are not targeted at foreigners. Gunfire can also be heard as part of a celebration. You should be vigilant at all times.
There have been several cases of pick pocketing by gangs of children and bag snatches in the main shopping and entertainment areas late at night. Foreign nationals appear to have been specifically targeted. Make sure your personal possessions are secure.
In the event of civil disorder, stay indoors as much as possible, especially after dark, and avoid crowds and demonstrations.
Keep your passport in a secure place and carry a copy of your passport data page for identification. If your passport is lost or stolen report it immediately to the local police and the British Embassy Skopje on +389 (2) 3299 299 or consular.skopje@fcdo.gov.uk.
Political situation
Opposition parties are holding large demonstrations daily in central Skopje and have announced that these protests will continue to take place every evening outside Parliament and Government buildings. Demonstrations could also occur outside other public buildings. Recent demonstrations have turned violent, when Molotov cocktails, firecrackers and other hard objects were thrown. There have been reports that some protesters were armed with firearms and shots fired. Further large-scale protests are likely, and may turn violent. Demonstrations also may take place outside the capital. You should check local media for the latest information, be vigilant, and avoid any large crowds and gatherings.
Local travel
Travel near the border with Kosovo should be restricted to primary roads and daylight hours only.
Lorries transiting North Macedonia borders may be subject to long delays before being allowed to cross. Make sure you have the proper customs documentation before arrival at the border.
Between November and February, Skopje and surrounding areas can experience thick fog. This can sometimes cause delays or diverted flights if visibility at Skopje airport is affected. Updates of arrivals and departures, as well as delays and cancellations due to weather conditions can be found on the Skopje airport website.
