The information on this page covers the most common types of travel and reflects the UK government’s understanding of the rules currently in place. Unless otherwise stated, this information is for travellers using a full ‘British Citizen’ passport.
The authorities in the country or territory you’re travelling to are responsible for setting and enforcing the rules for entry. If you’re unclear about any aspect of the entry requirements, or you need further reassurance, you’ll need to contact the embassy, high commission or consulate of the country or territory you’re travelling to.
You should also consider checking with your transport provider or travel company to make sure your passport and other travel documents meet their requirements.
If you are travelling to Bulgaria for work, read the guidance on visas and permits as the rules have changed since 1 January 2021.
Entry rules in response to coronavirus (COVID-19)
Entry to Bulgaria
From 1 July, Bulgaria introduced a new system of classification for travellers arriving in the country based on green, orange and red zones. The UK is currently categorised as an ‘orange zone’ country which means that if you are travelling from the UK to Bulgaria you are required to present one of the following three documents:
A vaccination certificate indicating an approved vaccine schedule has been completed at least 14 days before arrival. The document must contain the name of the person in Latin alphabet, date of birth, date of the last administered dose, serial number of the dose, and the total number of doses administered, trade name of vaccine, batch number of dose(s), manufacturer name, name of country and organisation who has issued the certificate.
A document showing a positive result from a PCR or rapid antigen test for people who have recovered from COVID-19. This must be dated at least 11, but no more than 180 days before arrival. The document must contain the name of the person in Latin alphabet, date of birth, date of the first positive result, details of the medical institution that performed the test (name, address or other contact details), the authority that issued the document, the country in which the test has been performed, type of test (PCR or RAT), and ‘Positive’ written in Latin.
The types of vaccine and antigen tests that are accepted by Bulgarian authorities are listed in the annexes (in Bulgarian) at the end of the published ordinance.
A negative PCR test performed within 72 hours before entry into Bulgaria or a rapid antigen test performed up to 48 hours before entry. The document must contain the names of the person in Latin alphabet, date of birth, type of test (PCR or RAT) and ‘Negative’ written in Latin alphabet, details of the medical institution that performed the test (name, address or other contact details), date and time of the test sample, trade name and manufacturer of the test (mandatory for rapid antigen tests), the country in which the test has been performed and the authority that issued the document.
Additionally, upon arrival to Bulgaria, at least 5% of all arrivals from orange zone countries will be tested with a rapid antigen test at random. If you test positive for COVID-19, you will be required to self-isolate for 14 days. Additionally, there is a mandatory 10-day self-isolation requirement for anyone who has been in close contact with someone who has tested positive for COVID-19. The isolation period starts from the date of the last contact with the infected person.
The Bulgarian authorities have stated that only the letter version of the NHS COVID Pass is acceptable as evidence of vaccination. The digital app, or a print-out of the app version, does not meet their requirements.
Only Bulgarian nationals and permanent and long-term residents are allowed to enter from red list countries, but they will be required to complete a mandatory 10-day quarantine. Red countries are listed in the latest ordinance.
Children under 12, are exempt from the requirement to present Covid-19 documents upon their arrival in Bulgaria.
Bulgarian government advice is that Bulgarian citizens and foreign nationals with valid residence permits, as well as their immediate family members, can opt for a quarantine of 10 days in lieu of presenting one of the documents listed above upon arrival in Bulgaria.
Immediate family members are restricted to the following categories: wife, husband, or a person you live with in a relationship akin to marriage; and dependent children under the age of 18 years of age. You will be expected to show documentation to prove relationship status (e.g. birth or marriage certificate) if you are not in possession of a Bulgarian residence permit.
The option of a 10-day quarantine on arrival, in lieu of a PCR test for people legally resident in Bulgaria, can be shortened if they present a negative PCR or antigen test performed within 24 hours of arriving in Bulgaria. The quarantine requirement will be revoked within 24 hours of submitting the document demonstrating the negative PCR test result.
A list of places offering PCR testing in Bulgaria is available from the Bulgarian government (in Bulgarian). You should submit the document showing a negative result of the PCR test to the respective Regional Health Inspectorate. For Sofia Health Inspectorate, submit your document to the following email address: director@srzi.bg. Due to an increased amount of inquiries, the health authorities may not have enough capacity to respond to each email individually so you should call them directly to find out if your quarantine has been lifted. Contact numbers are listed here.
The measures are in force at all air, road, rail and sea border crossings into Bulgaria.
Further information on the full range of exemptions is available on the following Bulgarian Government web site (in Bulgarian). If you fall into one of the exempted categories, you should contact your travel operator in advance of travel for further information on how to demonstrate your exemption from the travel ban.
Many land borders crossings in the region are restricted or closed for passenger traffic. Furthermore, neighbouring countries are implementing additional health requirements for entry to or departure from Bulgaria including declarations and COVID-19 tests. You should check the relevant FCDO Travel Advice.
If you need to travel, plan ahead and before you travel check border information published by the Ministry of Interior (English and Bulgarian) before you travel.
Quarantine requirements
Arrivals to Bulgaria, with the exception of those arriving from red-list countries, are not required to quarantine if they have provided a vaccine certificate, a document showing a positive result from a PCR or rapid antigen or a negative PCR or rapid antigen test.
Check the list of UK private providers of Coronavirus testing and make arrangements for your test in good time. It may not be possible to secure a test at short notice. Children under 12 years of age are exempt from the requirement to present Covid-19 documents upon arrival in Bulgaria.
Bulgarian citizens, residents, and their immediate family members may opt to undertake a mandatory 10-day quarantine period upon arrival to Bulgaria in lieu of presenting one of the documents listed above. This quarantine will be overseen by the Regional Health Authority for the region where you reside. You will be required to provide an address where you will stay for the full 10-day period and should expect checks to be made to ensure that you are complying with the terms of the quarantine in full. Fines or a prison sentence can be imposed on those found to have broken the quarantine requirement.
The option of a 10-day quarantine on arrival, in lieu of a PCR test for people legally resident in Bulgaria, can be shortened if they present a negative PCR test performed within 24 hours of arriving in Bulgaria. The quarantine requirement will be revoked within 24 hours of submitting the document demonstrating the negative PCR test result.

A very small number of travellers are exempted from both the quarantine requirement, and the need to provide evidence of a negative PCR test. These include people transiting through Bulgaria and hauliers and transport crew members of vessels or aircraft who do not remain in Bulgaria following their work-related duties. Check the latest information on the Ministry of Interior website (English and Bulgarian).

Passport validity
Check your passport is valid for travel before you book your trip, and renew your passport if you do not have enough time left on it.
You must have at least 6 months left on an adult or child passport to travel to most countries in Europe (not including Ireland).
If you renewed your current passport before the previous one expired, extra months may have been added to its expiry date. Any extra months on your passport over 10 years may not count towards the 6 months needed.
