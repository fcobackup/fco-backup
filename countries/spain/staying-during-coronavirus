This page gives you guidance on how to stay safely in Spain as a visitor, if you are unable to return to the UK.
Everyone should comply with the measures put in place in Spain to limit the spread of coronavirus (COVID-19).
If you’re currently in Spain, follow the advice of local authorities. Anybody planning to travel to Spain should consult their airline or tour operator and note that the FCO advises British nationals against all but essential international travel.

Spain declared a State of Emergency (“Estado de Alarma”) on 14 March, which introduces a series of measures including significant restrictions on movement throughout the country in response to the coronavirus outbreak.
Moving around in Spain
From 15 May, all new international arrivals entering Spain, including Spanish nationals and residents, will be required to self-isolate in their residence or hotel for a period of 14 days.
Movement will be limited to essential trips to supermarkets or pharmacies and those affected will be required to wear a facemask at all times in public. They should be contactable by authorities and should report any coronavirus symptoms to regional authorities. Cross-border workers, cabin crew, lorry drivers and healthcare workers are exempt from this measure. The Spanish authorities have confirmed that travellers transiting through Spain are also exempt as long as they travel home directly and do not spend the night in any establishment in Spain. All passengers should carry their passports, proof of onward travel (i.e. ferry or Eurotunnel tickets) and country of residency. You may also find this letter useful should you be required to explain your reason for travel.
De-escalation measures
On April 28, the Spanish government announced a 4-stage de-escalation plan to gradually ease the current confinement and mobility measures over an estimated period of at least 8 weeks.
While no specific dates have been attributed to each phase, it is estimated that each one will last for an initial period of 2 weeks from May 4. Moving from one phase to another will be contingent on the control of the COVID-19 outbreak in Spain and different provinces and regions of Spain may progress at different speeds.
You can consult the specific measures included in each phase of the national plan here and should refer to local authorities for guidance on the specific measures where you are. Social distancing measures and other safety precautions should be considered at all times. Spanish authorities “highly recommend” the use of face masks for all activities outside the home where social distancing cannot be guaranteed. Face masks on all public transport is obligatory.
Public places and transport
Public gatherings are banned, most shops other than those selling food or other essential items such as pharmacies will be closed, many businesses and all schools and universities are closed, and all citizens have been instructed to remain at home except when going about a limited set of activities, in particular:
to buy food or other essential items
to return home to their primary residence
to go to hospital or other health centres
to go to work if you are employed in one of the essential services designated by the government see full list here
to carry out caring or similar duties or in case of real need.
As from May 4, Phase 0 of the de-escalation plan will allow for individuals to do exercise outdoors and for members of the same household to take a walk together outside.
Urban and inter-regional transport services (i.e. coaches and trains) are operating at reduced levels. Travel to airports by road or rail to leave Spain is still permitted, but travellers may be asked to provide evidence that they are departing Spain (i.e. plane ticket).

Accommodation
The Spanish government has ordered that hotels and short-stay accommodation (such as short-stay campsites or caravan parks) must close by midnight 26 March. These measures do not apply to long-term accommodation, such as long-stay campsites, as long as clients can cater for themselves, in their own spaces (i.e. that clients do not rely on communal facilities).
The Spanish government has published a list of accommodation in each region that will remain open during the State of Emergency. The list may be modified so we advise you to check with the hotels directly. Whilst this is mainly intended for key workers, the accommodation will also be available for tourists who have been unable to return home. Hotels and other tourist accommodation are expected to re-open (with access restrictions to communal areas) when Phase 1 of the plan is activated.
If you’re currently on holiday in Spain, check with your tour operator or accommodation provider for further information. If you’re travelling and wish to return to the UK, see Return to the UK.
If you cannot travel back to the UK due to ill health or reduced mobility, you may wish to consider looking for longer-term accommodation in Spain until the State of Emergency is lifted. If you need medical treatment, the UK EHIC is still valid for the rest of 2020.
