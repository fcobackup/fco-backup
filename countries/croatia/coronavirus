International travel
Croatia has put measures in place to limit the spread of COVID-19. You should follow the advice of the local authorities in the most appropriate way to protect yourself and others, including any measures brought in to control the virus. These measures may change at short notice either at national or at local level. You should check local guidance for further information and details about restrictions in Croatia.
Entry and borders
See Entry requirements to find out what you will need to do when you arrive in Croatia. If entering Croatia for the purpose of overland transit you should familiarise yourself with the local travel requirements and ensure you depart the country within 12 hours. Failure to comply with this requirement may result in a fine.
Returning to the UK
When you return, you must follow the rules for entering the UK.
You are responsible for organising your own COVID-19 test, in line with UK government testing requirements. Information on testing facilities throughout Croatia can be found on the government website. You should check that the test result can be provided in the correct format and language.
Be prepared for your plans to change
No travel is risk-free during COVID. Countries may further restrict travel or bring in new rules at short notice, for example due to a new COVID-19 variant. Check with your travel company or airline for any transport changes which may delay your journey home.
If you test positive for COVID-19, you may need to stay where you are until you test negative. You may also need to seek treatment there.
Plan ahead and make sure you:
can access money
understand what your insurance will cover
can make arrangements to extend your stay and be away for longer than planned
