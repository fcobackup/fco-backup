The Foreign, Commonwealth & Development Office (FCDO) advises against all travel to:
the northern provinces of Chad (Borkou, Ennedi, Tibesti)
eastern Kanem province, including the town of Nokou
the Lake Chad region
within 30 km of all Chad’s other border areas
The FCDO advises against all but essential travel to the rest of Chad, including the capital, N’Djamena.
Before you travel, check the ‘Entry requirements’ section for Chad’s current entry restrictions and requirements. Due to COVID-19, these may change with little warning. Monitor this advice for the latest updates and stay in contact with your travel provider.
If you plan to pass through another country on your journey, check the travel advice for the country you’re transiting.
There continues to be potential for instability in Chad, particularly in its border regions and in the run-up to and during major political events, such as during Chad’s ongoing political transition and ahead of elections, due to take place before the end of 2024. See Safety and security
British Nationals in Chad requiring consular assistance should phone +237 650 46 06 52 (between 8h00 and 1600) or +44 20 7136 6857. Consular officers are available 24/7 on this number to assist with your enquiries. The British Embassy in N’Djamena does not provide consular services. Consular services are provided remotely from the British High Commission in Cameroon.
Keep your passport, and those of immediate family members, up to date, along with any visas that you may require; a replacement emergency travel document may take time to issue, which could make travelling more complicated.
It is more important than ever to get travel insurance and check it provides appropriate cover. See the FCDO’s guidance on foreign travel insurance.
Terrorists are very likely to try to carry out attacks in Chad. Attacks could be indiscriminate, including in places visited by foreigners. There is a threat of retaliatory attacks due to Chad’s involvement in the regional fight to counter Boko Haram. There is a heightened threat of kidnap in Chad. See Terrorism
The number of reports of car-jackings on roads outside N’Djamena has increased, including during daylight hours. See Local travel
Heavy rains during the rainy season (July-October) can result in major flooding in many areas, particularly in the south and east. You should ensure you have adequate supplies of food and clean water. See Road Travel.
