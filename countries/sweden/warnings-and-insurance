Eurovision Song Contest
The Eurovision song contest will take place in Malmö from 4 May to 11 May. There will be a greater number of people in Malmö during this time. Travel around the city may be affected by travel control systems, or protests. See safety and security information if you plan to be in Malmö, or attending the event.
Travel insurance
If you choose to travel, research your destinations and get appropriate travel insurance. Insurance should cover your itinerary, planned activities and expenses in an emergency.
