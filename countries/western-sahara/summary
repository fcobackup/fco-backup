There is no British diplomatic presence in Western Sahara and consular support is severely limited. If you need consular assistance you should contact the British Embassy in Rabat, Morocco. If you’re abroad and you need emergency help from the UK government, contact the nearest British embassy, consulate or high commission.
If your return journey to the UK transits another country, you should check whether it is subject to a travel ban or any other additional requirements. If so, contact your travel provider.
