Public spaces and services
The Polish government has strict sanitary rules and restrictions in place nationwide until at least 17 January 2021.
Masks are compulsory in open public spaces across Poland, apart from parks, forests and National Parks. Children under 4 are not required to wear masks. If there are medical reasons why you cannot wear a mask, you must carry a doctor’s note with you explaining this. When outside, you should keep a 1.5 metre distance from others, unless you are a parent with a child under 13 or the carer of a disabled person.
You must also wear a mask at all times in enclosed spaces, on public transport, in taxis or in an open space where you are unable to maintain a 1.5 metre distance. You do not need to wear a mask in a private car. Police and sanitary inspectors are entitled to issue you with an on-the-spot fine (approximately PLN500/£100) if you are found not to be wearing a mask when you should. Further prosecution could result in a fine of up to PLN 30,000 (£6,000) for failing to follow sanitary rules.
Seniors, aged 70 and over have been requested to stay at home, leaving only for work or necessities.
Public gatherings are limited to 5 people, excluding households bigger than 5 members and workplaces. Private gatherings may include no more than 5 people, excluding household members. There are restrictions on the number of people attending religious services and funerals. There is a nationwide ban on weddings and wakes.
Public transport is operating with 50% capacity seating to maintain appropriate distance between passengers. You can still use taxis. Masks must be worn at all times.
Cultural institutions, such as museums, theatres, cinemas and cultural centres will be closed until at least 17 January 2021.
National Forests, parks and beaches are open but could be closed at short notice.
Customer numbers are limited in shops. This might mean you have to queue for entry. In all areas of Poland a mask must be worn inside shops and hand sanitiser must be used where provided. ‘Seniors only’ hours are in place between 10am to 12 noon on weekdays for those aged 60 and over. These apply to shops, pharmacies and post offices.
Shopping malls and retail parks are closed, except for some shops providing essential services or goods (hairdressers, grocery shops, telecommunications, books, pharmacies, drug stores, pet stores, opticians and furniture stores). Petrol stations, car washes and car/motorbike repair centres remain open. Banks, insurance providers and post offices also remain open.
Restaurants, cafes and pubs are closed, and can only provide a takeaway/delivery service. Sporting events are not permitted with audiences, but may take place without an audience. All cultural events continue to be suspended until further notice. Libraries may open with strict sanitary procedures in place.
Swimming pools, gyms, sanatoriums, ski slopes and aqua parks remain closed. Tanning salons, massage salons and tattoo parlours remain open, with strict hygiene rules in place including limits on numbers of people, but these could be closed at short notice.
Administrative offices may open with limited numbers inside at any one time. You might find some offices are only open by appointment and you are recommended to check websites or contact the office before travelling.
For updates changes in restrictions see the Polish Ministry for Health’s Twitter pages (in Polish – look for the colour coded map).
The above national measures may be extended further, in scope and time, at short notice.
