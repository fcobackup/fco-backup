Cases of coronavirus (COVID-19) have been confirmed in Brunei. The Brunei authorities have introduced a number of measures to limit the spread of the virus.
As part of Brunei’s approach to contain the spread of the virus, mosques and other places of worship have been closed, restaurants and cafes are only open for take-away and public gatherings have been discouraged.
Details of Royal Brunei’s schedule can be found on the Royal Brunei Airlines website.
Entry to Brunei is severely restricted. It is not yet clear which exceptional circumstances, if any, foreign nationals may be permitted to enter Brunei. In the event the Government of Brunei permits you entry, you will be required to go into quarantine on arrival at a government booked facility (usually a local hotel). On the 16 April, The Minister of Health announced that all foreigners will have to pay $1,000 BND for a Covid-19 test upon arrival and would need to cover the cost of their stay in a quarantine facility (14 days from the date of arrival). We understand that quarantine charges can vary depending on the quarantine facility you are placed in. You should ensure that you have the means to cover the cost of your Covid-19 test and the full 14-day quarantine period. We are seeking clarification on whether further follow-up Covid-19 testing will be chargeable and further clarity on daily-rates for quarantine facilities.
We urge travellers to check the Brunei Ministry of Health for up to date guidance and policy on travel to and from Brunei.
Immigration Control Posts at Brunei’s land borders are operating shortened hours from 6am to 8pm.
There are health and temperature screening measures already in place at borders. You should comply with any additional screening measures put in place by the local authorities.
Brunei has also introduced an exit travel ban, including for permanent residents, and expatriate workers (green identity card holders), and their dependents. Exceptions will be considered by the Prime Minister’s Office on a case by case basis, through email applications to travelapplication@jpm.gov.bn. giving 14 days’ notice of the intention to travel, and setting out reasons why they need to leave the country. Full details are available on the Prime Minister’s Office website.
