Entry
The Israeli authorities have announced that with effect from 18 March, foreign nationals will not be permitted to enter unless they are citizens or residents of Israel. Limited exceptions do apply. Check Israeli Population and Immigration Authority pages for full details. Further restrictions may be introduced at short notice.
Land crossings
Restrictions also apply at land crossings between Israel and Jordan, and between the Occupied Palestinian Territories and Jordan. Visitors should follow guidelines from Israel’s Ministry of Health and the Palestinian Authority, which are regularly updated, and be alert to local changes.
The Allenby/King Hussein Bridge Crossing between the Occupied Palestinian Territories and Jordan is closed with the exception of: Jordanian citizens returning to Jordan; Palestinian residents (West Bank, Gaza and East Jerusalem ID holders) returning to the Occupied Palestinian Territories; and Israeli citizens returning from Jordan to Israel. Travellers passing through this crossing in either direction may be required to enter quarantine facilities.
The Jordan River / Sheikh Hussein and Yitzhak Rabin/ Wadi Arraba crossings between Jordan and Israel are open to Israeli citizens. Foreign passport holders will not be allowed to enter Israel and the Occupied Palestinian Territories via these crossings.
The Palestinian Authority (PA) has issued restrictions for visitors and residents in the Occupied Palestinian Territories, including in the Bethlehem area. Foreign nationals are not currently able to cross checkpoints to enter Bethlehem. You should reconfirm your arrangements with your tour operator or hotel before travelling.
You may face delays or restrictions at Israeli controlled checkpoints around the West Bank, including when attempting to leave the West Bank. Foreign nationals are not currently able to cross checkpoints to enter Bethlehem. Foreign nationals who are currently in Bethlehem must leave six hours before their scheduled flight and travel direct to Tel Aviv Ben Gurion Airport. Similar restrictions may be applied to foreign nationals seeking to leave from other parts of the West Bank. If you are part of an organised tour group, you will travel on an Israeli bus which will be escorted by Israeli police direct to the airport. If you are travelling alone, you can take an Israeli taxi to the airport six hours before your flight. No prior coordination with the Israeli authorities is necessary. You will need to show your passport and flight ticket to authorities at the Israeli controlled checkpoint.
Visitors should follow the guidance which is regularly updated on Israel’s Ministry of Health website and be alert to local changes.
Flights
Some airlines have suspended or reduced flight operations to Tel Aviv Ben Gurion Airport. Further travel restrictions and flight suspensions may be introduced at short notice. Visitors in Israel or the Occupied Palestinian Territories are advised to re-confirm their travel arrangements with their airline, including double-checking which departure terminal they are leaving from as this may change, and to consider returning home earlier than planned if required.
Local measures
On 5 March 2020 the Palestinian Authority (PA) announced a state of emergency lasting 30 days, including closure of educational institutions, reducing movement between cities, cancellation of public gatherings and conferences, and cancellation of tourism reservations and hotel bookings.
