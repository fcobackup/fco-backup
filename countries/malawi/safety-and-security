Terrorism in Malawi
Terrorist attacks in Malawi cannot be ruled out.
Political situation
There can be demonstrations related to political and economic issues. Avoid large crowds and demonstrations. Monitor local media for updates. Keep local and international travel plans under review.
Crime
Criminal kidnaps
There are occasional reports of kidnappings for ransom in Malawi. These kidnaps have generally been for financial gain or motivated by criminality. In some instances, the kidnapped individuals have been British Nationals, so kidnappers may also target foreigners. Business/wealthy individuals are likely to be at increased risk of this activity.
Protecting yourself and your belongings
There is a risk of mugging and bag-snatching. Take sensible precautions to protect yourself such as:
not walking in quiet areas, especially after dark
leaving valuables and cash in a hotel safe if possible
keeping copies of important documents in a separate place
Most thefts from tourists take place around main bus stations in urban areas. Report any thefts to the police as soon as possible.
Be cautious if over-friendly people approach you offering to act as guides, selling goods, or claiming to know you and asking for a lift.
Drink and food spiking
People have been robbed after eating drugged food. Do not accept food or drink from strangers.
Burglary and violent assault
There is a risk of  burglaries and violent assault, including by armed gangs. A group of UK tourists were violently assaulted and robbed in 2025 in their hotel in Mulanje. There has been an increase in break-ins in Lilongwe, Blantyre and Limbe, including violent assaults on residents. Review your security systems and watch out for anything unusual.
Climbing Mulanje Mountain

Always carry your licence when driving, you may need to show it at police checkpoints.
There are frequent fuel shortages in Malawi and there can often be long queues. Do not assume fuel will be available on your route. Plan ahead to make sure you can reach your destination.

Drivers caught drink-driving or speeding can also have their licences and vehicles immediately confiscated. Convicted drivers face fines and possible imprisonment.
