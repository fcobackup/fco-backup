The Papua New Guinean authorities have imposed a State of Emergency to limit the spread of the virus. A reduced domestic flight schedule has resumed. Airports in Daru, Kiunga, Wewak, Vanimo, Tabubil, Lihir, Buka, and Kieta remain closed. You should check with your airline that you meet one of the approved travel categories and will need to complete a Domestic Travel Application Form prior to travel. Curfews and restrictions on public transport and gatherings are in place in some provinces including Western Province and East New Britain. Further information about the measures introduced can be found on the PNG government website.
Nobody may enter Papua New Guinea except for health workers, flight crew, military personnel or those with a special written exemption from the Emergency Controller. International visitors should apply for the exemption, including the reasons for visiting, by contacting: covid19-admin.logistics@police.gov.pg. Anyone arriving must self-isolate in a government approved hotel for 14 days. You will be required to show evidence of your hotel reservation and approved exemption to purchase a flight ticket. There is a ban on cruise ships and leisure yachts with more than fifteen people on board, on land border crossings between Indonesia and Papua New Guinea, and on sea crossings between the Solomon Islands and Bougainville.
