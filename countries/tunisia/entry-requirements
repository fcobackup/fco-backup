The information on this page covers the most common types of travel and reflects the UK government’s understanding of the rules currently in place. Unless otherwise stated, this information is for travellers using a full ‘British Citizen’ passport.
The Tunisian authorities are responsible for setting and enforcing the rules for entry. If you’re unclear about any aspect of the entry requirements, or you need further reassurance, you should contact the Tunisian Embassy in London.
You should also consider checking with your transport provider or travel company to make sure your passport and other travel documents meet their requirements.
Entry rules in response to coronavirus (COVID-19)
Entry to Tunisia
From 8 March, the government announced that travellers from all countries, including the UK, no longer have to self-isolate at a government-approved hotel for 14 days on arrival. Travellers must instead self-isolate at their accommodation for 48 hours from their arrival and then take a COVID-19 PCR test.
All direct flights between the UK and Tunisia are currently suspended until further notice. Some indirect flights are in operation.
Travellers by air from Libya into Tunisia must also self-isolate for 48 hours. There is an exemption from self-isolation for travellers into Tunisia from Libya by land.
Travellers entering Tunisia from all other countries (where the new strain has not been detected) will be subject to the following measures that may change at short notice. You should check the latest rules with your airline or travel provider before travelling
You must take a PCR test less than 72 hours before travel and show evidence of the negative test result, with the date of the test clearly labelled, at your point of departure for Tunisia. Children under 12 years old are exempt from this requirement. You should not use the NHS testing service to get a test to facilitate your travel to another country. You should take a private test and ensure the test certificate includes the date of the test.
You must self-isolate at your accommodation for 48 hours from arrival and pay to take a COVID-19 PCR test 48 hours after arrival. If this test result is negative, you can leave self-isolation but must adhere very strictly to protective measures including social distancing and mask wearing. If the test result is positive, you must remain in self-isolation.

Regular entry requirements
Visas
British passport holders don’t need a visa for visits of up to three months. On arrival, security checks are sometimes carried out on British passport holders who were not born in the UK. This can take a few hours and you will need to be patient until clearance is given. These types of checks rarely take place on departure.
Overstay fines
If you stay in Tunisia for longer than the authorised period, you will have to pay a fine. This rule may not apply if you are vulnerable and current circumstances oblige you to remain in the country.
Passport validity
For stays of up to 3 months your passport should be valid for the proposed duration of your stay; you don’t need any additional period of validity on your passport beyond this.
UK Emergency Travel Documents
Tunisian authorities accept UK ETDs for entry to and exit from Tunisia. If you’re leaving Tunisia on an ETD, make sure you have a copy of the police report about the loss/theft of your full validity passport to present to the Immigration Officer.
Dual nationals
Dual British-Tunisian nationals should enter and leave Tunisia on their Tunisian passports.
