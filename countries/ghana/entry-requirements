Entry rules in response to Coronavirus
Entry to Ghana
Commercial flights via Kotoka International Airport will operate from 1 September. COVID-19 protocols at the airport are being finalised and may be subject to change as the new screening process evolves. See the guidance from the Ghana Civil Aviation Authority
At present all passengers arriving are required by the Government of Ghana to:
Wear a face-mask throughout their flight and upon landing in Accra.
All passengers will also be asked to complete self-declaration forms confirming they are fit to travel and provide details to facilitate contact tracing.
On arrival produce evidence of a negative Polymerise Chain Reaction (PCR) COVID-19 test result (a text message confirmation from NHS may not be sufficient). This test must have taken place within 72 hours of departure. Ffor passengers who have transited other countries before arriving in Ghana the first country of departure will be the reference point.
Undergo a temperature check on arrival.
On arrival all passengers will be subject to a mandatory COVID-19 test at Kotoka International airport. It is not yet clear what form this test will take. The test will be conducted in the airport at the passengers own expense. The cost has not yet been confirmed but media reports suggest up to $150 dollars per test. Please ensure you have access to sufficient funds in cash on arrival. Children under the age of five are exempt.
The Government of Ghana has stated results will be available within 30 minutes of the test taking place at the airport. As such passengers should be prepared for additional time to move through and exit the airport. During busy period when there may be a large number of passengers disembarking at the same time the testing area may become busy.
All arriving passengers should be prepared to comply with Ghana’s COVID-19 Health Protocols. This may, depending on the test result of individuals or others on the flight, involve time in quarantine or a Government Health facility. Quarantine and / or medical costs can be expensive so it is important that all passengers arrive with adequate access to financial resources. The Government of Ghana also advise that all arrivals should have valid insurance.
Transiting Ghana
Transit passengers, except those who were diverted to Accra for an emergency and where they will remain in the airport throughout, will also be subject to mandatory COVID-19 testing as outlined above.
Visas
Ghana hasn’t granted any visa exemptions or extensions for visitors during the pandemic so all British nationals will need to visit the Ghana Immigration Service (GIS) office in person to extend their visas. It isn’t possible to call about an individual case or to book an appointment in advance. Office opening hours are 8 am to 5 pm. The GIS office is off Ako Adjei overpass on Independence Avenue in Accra.
Regular entry requirements
Visas
You need a visa to enter Ghana. The visa service is suspended. Visit the Ghana High Commission website to stay up to date and to make an online application in due course.
Dual nationality
Ghana recognises dual nationality. To avoid visa fees, Ghanaian-British nationals should register with the Interior Ministry in Ghana and get a Dual Nationality card. Production of this card at point of entry into Ghana will indicate that a visa is not required.
Passport validity
Your passport should be valid for a minimum period of 6 months from the date of entry into Ghana.
UK Emergency Travel Documents
UK Emergency Travel Documents (ETDs) are not valid for entry or transit through Ghana. However, ETDs are accepted for exit from Ghana.
Yellow fever certificate requirements
Check whether you need a yellow fever certificate by visiting the National Travel Health Network and Centre’s TravelHealthPro website.
Volunteering
If you are travelling to work in a volunteer programme or for work experience you should be fully aware of the terms and conditions of your stay and be sure that you will be working for a reputable organisation before you commit yourself to travel.
