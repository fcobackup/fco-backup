Further information
The Ivorian authorities announced that from midnight on Sunday 22 March there will be no international flights to and from Côte d’Ivoire until further notice, except for humanitarian and security purposes. Land borders are also closed.
Air France has previously run ad-hoc flights following the announcement of flight restrictions, however government restrictions are increasing and further flights may become more limited. If any are announced the likelihood is that they will come available at very short notice and prioritise visitors and people who are vulnerable. If you wish to leave please send your details to British.Embassy.Abidjan@fco.gov.uk who will inform you if there is potential for you to get on a flight.
See additional advice on making travel plans to return to the UK, or what to do if you cannot depart immediately.
