Crime
Most visits by British nationals are trouble-free. However, there have been incidents of robbery, armed attacks and rape in the past. You should take sensible personal security precautions and maintain a high level of vigilance in public places. You are advised to avoid displaying valuables like cameras, smart phones or jewellery. Avoid isolated or poorer areas of towns and walking alone at night. Be cautious on quiet or isolated beaches in and around Libreville, and avoid them altogether at night.
Taxis in Gabonese cities operate like buses, picking up new passengers while there is still room in the car. They often take indirect routes. There have been reports of violent assaults and robberies on taxi passengers. Only use authorised taxis and preferably book one from a reputable company or through a restaurant or hotel. There have been reports of car-jackings in Libreville. You are advised to keep your car windows closed and doors locked if you are travelling at night. Do not stop to pick up strangers. Do not resist car-jackers. An immobiliser that operates after the vehicle has been driven a short distance or a tracking device may help with the recovery of your vehicle.
Local travel
Road conditions are poor in most local areas and driving can be hazardous. During the rainy season from October to mid-December and mid-February to May many roads are passable only with a four-wheel drive vehicle. Avoid travelling by road at night. Police checkpoints are common; you may be asked to show your passport, driving licence or vehicle registration documents.  
Air travel
The EU has published a list of air carriers that are subject to an operating ban or restrictions within the EU. British Government employees don’t use domestic flights run by Gabonese airline companies unless this is unavoidable.
Sea travel
There have been armed attacks on commercial shipping vessels in the Gulf of Guinea. Take extreme care when travelling in coastal waters.
Political situation
A presidential election was held in Gabon on 27 August 2016, the outcome of which led to violent clashes between demonstrators and security forces. Avoid all demonstrations, rallies and large public gatherings, even peaceful demonstrations have the potential to escalate.
