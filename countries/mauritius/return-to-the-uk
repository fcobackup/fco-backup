Air Mauritius special flight
Air Mauritius will run a special flight to London Heathrow, departing from Mauritius at 10.30am on 19 May.

If you wish to travel on the special flight on 19 May but you cannot afford the travel costs and have exhausted all other options for getting funds, you may be eligible to apply for an emergency loan from the government. This is a last resort option and you would need to repay the loan when you are back in the UK. For more information, you should contact the British High Commission via email.
Air Mauritius entered into voluntary administration on 22 April. If you have existing Air Mauritius tickets or plan to use the airline in the coming months, other than for the special flight on 19 May, look out for announcements from Air Mauritius or the administrator, Grant Thornton.
