Cases of coronavirus (COVID-19) have been confirmed in Uzbekistan. The Uzbekistan authorities have introduced a number of measures to limit the spread of the virus.
As at 16 March 2020 there have been six confirmed cases of coronavirus (COVID-19) in Uzbekistan. The Uzbek authorities have strengthened sanitary and epidemiological controls at ports of entry and border crossing points.
The Uzbekistan authorities have also stated that:
The entry into Uzbekistan of citizens of China, the Republic of Korea, Italy, Iran, France and Spain, and persons permanently residing in these countries, has been suspended. Additionally, individuals of any nationality who have visited these countries in the past 14 days will not be permitted entry to Uzbekistan.
British nationals arriving in Uzbekistan and who have visited the United Kingdom, the USA, Germany, Singapore, Hong Kong, Macao or Taiwan within 14 days of arrival are subject to home isolation/quarantine. You will be subject to monitoring and required to remain at your place of residence/stay for up to 14 days, not allowed to visit public places and required to avoid contact with other people excluding family members.
British nationals arriving from Thailand, Azerbaijan, Malaysia or UAE are subject to 14 days medical supervision at their place of stay/residence and are advised not to visit public or crowded places and to limit contacts with other people. Arrivals from these countries are subject to medical monitoring by medical personnel during the 14-day period. This will include physical examination, measurement of body temperature and medical consultations by telephone. If symptoms of acute respiratory viral infections are detected, the person will be hospitalised in a medical institution for the purpose of diagnosis and treatment.

Under the measures introduced by the Uzbek authorities, any person subject to quarantine or self-isolation who breaches these controls is liable to a minimum fine of 11 Million UZS (approx Â£900) or up to 3 years imprisonment.
These measures may be subject to change. Entry requirements may vary and further restrictions could be applied at short notice by the Uzbek authorities.
