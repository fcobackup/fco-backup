Read the Prime Minister’s address for the latest information.

This page gives you guidance on how to stay safely in Ecuador as a visitor, if you are unable to return to the UK.
Everyone should comply with the measures put in place in Ecuador to limit the spread of coronavirus (COVID-19).
Moving around in Ecuador
President Moreno announced a 30-day extension to the state of emergency, which will now last until 16 June.
As of 4 May, the Government introduced a new phase of “social distancing” to loosen up restrictions progressively according to the situation in each location. The system has three levels: red, amber and green. Each municipal government is responsible to determine whether they move from one stage to the next. You can find an interactive map showing the colour of each city through this online tool.
However, general nationwide restrictions remain throughout May:
Mandatory self-isolation for people over 60 years old, and people whose medical conditions make them vulnerable to COVID19
Mandatory use of facemasks in public spaces. Fines will be given to those who do not comply. Each city will define the cost of the fine.
All inter-province travel is prohibited, which includes travel by bus and by private cars.
All public gatherings are prohibited, including sporting events, museums and entertainment centres.
Supermarkets, pharmacies, take-away restaurants, petrol stations and banks can operate to 50% of their total capacity.
Schools will be closed nationwide, but classes will be delivered online.
Inter-province package delivery is allowed.
All businesses and industries must prepare a health prevention protocol to address COVID19.
Given that all municipalities in Ecuador will begin in “red light”, the curfew restricting all movement will apply from 2pm to 5am until 31 May, or until a change in colour is notified to the National Operations Committee. In general, journeys should be limited to essential trips, for example to buy food or medicine.
The province of Guayas (including the city of Guayaquil), which is the most affected by COVID-19, has been declared a National Security Zone, with the Armed Forces responsible for enforcing the curfew.
