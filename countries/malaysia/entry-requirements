This page has information on travelling to Malaysia. Check what you must do to return to the UK.
This page reflects the UK government’s understanding of current rules for people travelling on a full ‘British Citizen’ passport from the UK, for the most common types of travel.
The authorities in Malaysia set and enforce entry rules.
All travellers
Further information on entry requirements for Malaysia is available from the Malaysian authorities.
If you’re fully vaccinated
All fully vaccinated travellers can enter Malaysia without quarantining or needing to take a pre-departure test or test on arrival.
You must have received your final dose 14 days before travel to be considered fully vaccinated. In some cases, including if you are 60 years old or above, Malaysia requires a third booster dose to be considered fully vaccinated. Please see full details on these requirements on the MySafe Travel website.
Proof of vaccination status
Before travelling to Malaysia you must verify your overseas vaccine certificate through the mysafetravel portal and download the MySejahtera app and complete the traveller’s card via the app.
Malaysia will accept the UK’s vaccination record as acceptable proof of vaccination to complete this verification process. Your NHS appointment card from vaccination centres is not designed to be used as proof of vaccination and should not be used to demonstrate your vaccine status.
Entry to East Malaysia if you’re fully vaccinated
If you’re travelling to East Malaysia (Sabah or Sarawak) please consult the Malaysian High Commission/Embassy and your airline as regards to procedures and onward travel from Kuala Lumpur to these states. Sabah and Sarawak have additional immigration rules in place.
If you’re not fully vaccinated
If you are an adult (18 years and above) and are not fully vaccinated or partially vaccinated (according to Malaysia’s rules) you must comply with the following testing and quarantine requirements:
You must provide a negative PCR test result taken 2 days before departure and take a PCR or supervised lateral flow/RTK antigen test within 24 hours of arrival.
You must quarantine for 5 days. You will need to meet all costs associated with your quarantine. You will need to download the MySejahtera app and complete the traveller’s card via the app.
If you are a child (17 years and below) and not fully vaccinated or partially vaccinated (according to Malaysia’s rules) you do not need to quarantine on arrival or take a pre-departure or arrival test.
If you were hospitalised due to COVID-19 within 11-60 days before departure, you are also required to submit a fit to travel letter from the hospital.
If you have an onward domestic flight in peninsular Malaysia, you will undergo quarantine in Kuala Lumpur. Any onward flight to a regional airport will need to be booked at a later date.
If you are required to quarantine, the British High Commission is unable to assist you with not having to do it, regardless of your circumstances.
Entry to East Malaysia if you’re not fully vaccinated
If you’re travelling to East Malaysia (Sabah or Sarawak) please consult the Malaysian High Commission/Embassy and your airline as regards to quarantine procedures and onward travel from Kuala Lumpur to these states. Sabah and Sarawak have additional immigration rules in place.
If you’re transiting through Malaysia
You can transit (up to 24 hours only) via Kuala Lumpur International Airport (KLIA) as long as you remain airside.
Transit that requires passage through immigration (to collect bags, or to move between the two Kuala Lumpur terminals - KLIA and KLIA2) is not possible, unless you meet the general immigration requirements above.
Check your passport and travel documents before you travel
Check with your travel provider to make sure your passport and other travel documents meet their requirements.
Passport validity
If you are visiting Malaysia, your passport should be valid for 6 months from the date you arrive. If it is not, you may be refused entry and detained. You may also be refused entry if your passport is damaged or has pages missing.
Visas
British nationals do not need a visa to visit Malaysia. You will normally be given permission to stay for 3 months on arrival. Visas for longer stays or for non-tourist purposes must be obtained from the nearest Malaysian diplomatic mission before you travel.
The Malaysian authorities are running a vigorous campaign against illegal immigration. Do not overstay your visa, or violate the terms of entry. Even if you overstay for just a few days, you can be fined, detained, deported to the UK and blacklisted. Flight costs will be the responsibility of the individual.
If you’re travelling between Peninsular Malaysia and East Malaysia (sometimes known as Malaysian Borneo and comprising the states of Sabah and Sarawak) you will need to carry your passport. You must get an entry stamp in East Malaysia at your initial port of entry.
You should make and keep safe a copy of your passport and visa in case your passport is lost. It may take time to obtain a replacement visa. If you cannot present your original valid visa on exit you may be treated as an overstayer, fined and blacklisted.
Yellow fever certificate requirements
Check whether you need a yellow fever certificate by visiting the National Travel Health Network and Centre’s TravelHealthPro website.
UK Emergency Travel Documents
UK Emergency Travel Documents (ETDs) are accepted for exit from Malaysia. You’re likely to need to get a special exit pass from Malaysian Immigration before leaving and there will be a cost for this. If travelling to another country, other than the UK, you will need to check with the relevant Embassy if a visa is needed in the ETD. If you plan to use an ETD to enter or transit through Malaysia, check entry requirements with the nearest Malaysian Embassy or High Commission before you travel.
Dual nationals
Malaysia doesn’t recognise dual nationality. You can be refused entry if you’re found to be holding a Malaysian passport and one of a different nationality. For those people with dual nationality (not including Malaysian), we advise entering and exiting with the same passport.
Exchange control rules
You can import or export up to 10,000 Malaysian Ringgit without prior approval. There are no limits on the amount of foreign currency you can import or export, but you must declare any amount in excess of US$ 10,000. Penalties include a fine of up to RM 1 million and up to 3 years’ imprisonment. Further information can be found on the Royal Malaysian Customs Department website.
