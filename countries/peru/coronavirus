International travel
Passengers at the airport will need to follow strict regulations, including the mandatory use of masks and facial protectors (usually a clear plastic full-face covering) and social distancing
At present, commercial airlines are operating to and from Peru up to 8 hours flying time away.
KLM are flying from Lima to Amsterdam on a daily basis and Air France are flying from Lima to Paris on a weekly basis. However, these flights do not bring passengers into Peru. There are currently no direct inbound passenger flights from Europe to Peru.
If travelling via another country, it is essential you check the travel advice for that country, as some currently do not permit transit to/from the UK.
If you travel to Peru, you will need to show proof of a negative result from a COVID-19 PCR (molecular) test, issued no more than 72 hours before your flight.
All passengers arriving in Peru, irrespective of nationality, have to quarantine for 14 days. This can be in a home or accommodation anywhere in the country, in liaison with the health authorities. When the quarantine is to be completed outside Lima, you must arrive there within 24 hours after arrival in Peru. If upon arrival in Peru you test positive, you will have to self isolate in the Villa Panamericana or any other temporary centre in Lima or in the centres that the regional government assigns. You may end quarantine after 7 days if you take a PCR test on your 6th day in country and the result is negative. If you receive a positive result, you will need to quarantine where the health authorities decide.
