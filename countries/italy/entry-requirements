This information is for people travelling on a full ‘British citizen’ passport from the UK. It is based on the UK government’s understanding of the current rules for the most common types of travel. 
The authorities in Italy set and enforce entry rules. If you’re not sure how these requirements apply to you, contact the Italian Embassy in the UK.
Passport validity requirements
Italy follows Schengen area rules. Your passport must:
have a ‘date of issue’ less than 10 years before the date you arrive – if you renewed your passport before 1 October 2018, it may have a date of issue that is more than 10 years ago
have an ‘expiry date’ at least 3 months after the day you plan to leave the Schengen area (the expiry date does not need to be within 10 years of the date of issue)
Check with your travel provider that your passport and other travel documents meet requirements. Renew your passport if you need to.
You will be denied entry if you do not have a valid travel document or try to use a passport that has been reported lost or stolen.
Lost or stolen passports
If your passport is lost or stolen, you must renew your passport or apply for an emergency travel document. You cannot use a police report to leave Italy.
Visa requirements
You can travel without a visa to the Schengen area, which includes Italy, for up to 90 days in any 180-day period. This applies if you travel:
as a tourist
to visit family or friends
to attend business meetings, cultural or sports events
for short-term studies or training
The requirements for working in Italy are different. 
If you’re travelling to other Schengen countries as well, make sure your whole visit is within the 90-day visa-free limit. Visits to Schengen countries within the previous 180 days before you travel count towards your 90 days. If you overstay the 90-day visa-free limit, you may be banned from entering Schengen countries for up to 3 years.
If you cannot return to the UK before your visa-free limit expires, contact the nearest local immigration office (‘questura’) (in Italian).
Make sure you get your passport stamped on entry and exit.
If you’re a visitor, border guards will look at your entry and exit stamps to check you have not overstayed the 90-day visa-free limit for the Schengen area. 
If your passport is missing a stamp, show evidence of when and where you entered or left the Schengen area (for example, boarding passes or tickets) and ask the border guards to add the date and location in your passport. 
At Italian border control, you may need to:
show proof of your accommodation, for example, a hotel booking confirmation or proof of address for your own property 
show proof of your travel insurance
show a return or onward ticket 
prove that you have enough money for your stay – the amount varies depending on your accommodation
Staying longer than 90 days in a 180-day period 
To stay longer, you must meet the Italian government’s entry requirements. Check which type of visa or work permit you need with the Italian Ministry of Foreign Affairs. You’ll need to apply and then book an appointment.
If you’re in Italy with a residence permit or long-stay visa, this does not count towards your 90-day visa-free limit.

New Schengen entry requirements
The EU’s Entry/Exit System (EES) is expected to start in October 2025. It is not currently in operation. The European Union will inform about the specific start date of the EES before its launch.
Read more information on the EU Entry/Exit System.
Italy-Slovenia land border
There are temporary border checks at Italy’s border with Slovenia. Allow extra time for crossing the land border. Be ready to show your passport or residency card if you are asked by the border police.
Registering with the authorities
You must declare your presence (‘dichiarazione di presenza’) to the local immigration authority (‘questura’) within 8 days of arriving if you’ve come from another Schengen-area country and are not staying in a hotel or bed and breakfast. The ‘questura’ will give you a form to complete.
You can get more information from the Ministry of Foreign Affairs or Italian police force.
Travelling with people aged 17 and under
If you’re aged 17 or under, you cannot check into hotels or holiday accommodation without an accompanying adult.
British people aged 17 and under travelling without their parents or guardians do not need any authorisation stamped by the Embassy, even if they are resident in Italy. Only Italian children travelling without parents or guardians need such a document stamped by the local police.
See further advice on travelling abroad with people aged 17 and under, or travelling to the UK with people aged 17 and under.
Vaccine requirements

Customs rules
There are strict rules about goods you can take into and out of Italy. You must declare anything that may be prohibited or subject to tax or duty.
Taking food into Italy
You cannot take meat, milk or products containing them into EU countries. There are some exceptions such as powdered baby milk, baby food and special food or pet feed required for medical reasons.
Taking money into Italy 
Declare cash or travellers cheques if the value is 10,000 euros or more. You will get a certified declaration to show you brought it in with you. If you do not, your money could be seized when you leave.
