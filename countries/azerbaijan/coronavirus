Cases of coronavirus (COVID-19) have been confirmed in Azerbaijan. The Azerbaijani Government has introduced a number of measures to limit the spread of the virus.
Flights
Options for leaving Azerbaijan are becoming increasingly limited. If you wish to leave Azerbaijan you should make arrangements to do so as soon as possible. For information on how to return to the UK from Azerbaijan, see Return to the UK
Quarantine
The Azerbaijani authorities have informed that as of 15 March all nationals arriving from abroad will be placed in to state-run quarantine facilities. These facilities include Baku based hotels, hospitals or the Olympic Village. You may be quarantined with someone you do not know, and families could be separated in different rooms. It is unlikely you will have direct access to one another during the period of time you spend in quarantine if this is the case. Similar procedures are also in place for British nationals who show signs of potential COVID-19 infection while staying in Azerbaijan.
If you or a British national you know is quarantined, contact the British Embassy immediately. Call: +994 12 437 7878 or you can reach us via Facebook.
