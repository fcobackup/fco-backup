Entry to Dominica
Although the borders and airports (Douglas Charles and Canefield) are currently closed, they will open for nationals and residents on 15 July, and for non-nationals on 7 August.
Arrival protocols will be in place. Arriving passengers will have to complete an online questionnaire 24 hours before arrival, and have a PCR swab test with a negative result taken up to 72 hours before arrival. A thermal test and antibody blood test will be taken on arrival. If either test is positive, then a further PCR swab test will be carried out.
Mandatory 14 day quarantine will be necessary, self-isolating, in a Government facility, or in a certified hotel or guest house.
