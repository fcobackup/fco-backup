In the early hours of 26 November 2023 Wilberforce Barracks came under attack and there was heavy gunfire in the vicinity of Wilkinson Road (central area of Freetown). There was subsequently an escape of a large number of prisoners.
There is a heightened risk of crime and incidents of sporadic violence in the aftermath of these attacks. As of 20 December 2023, the nationwide curfew has been lifted across Sierra Leone. You may see additional security measures in place, including checkpoints in Freetown. Remain vigilant and co-operate with security forces.
