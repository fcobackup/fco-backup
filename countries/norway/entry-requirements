This page reflects the UK government’s understanding of current rules for people travelling on a full ‘British Citizen’ passport, for the most common types of travel.
The authorities in Norway set and enforce entry rules. For further information contact the embassy, high commission or consulate of the country or territory you’re travelling to. You should also consider checking with your transport provider or travel company to make sure your passport and other travel documents meet their requirements.
If you are travelling to Norway for work, read the guidance on visas and permits as the rules have changed since 1 January 2021.
Entry rules in response to coronavirus
Your ability to enter Norway will depend on your personal circumstances.
Demonstrating your COVID-19 status
Norway will accept the UK’s proof of COVID-19 recovery and vaccination record that contains a verifiable QR code at the border. Scottish travellers must have the latest version of the Scottish certification, which includes the verifiable QR code. If you are travelling with a printed PDF proof of vaccination status, it must date from 1 November to ensure that the certificate can be scanned successfully. Your NHS appointment card from vaccination centres is not designed to be used as proof of vaccination and should not be used to demonstrate your vaccine status.
For those with an English, Welsh, Northern Irish or Scottish NHS COVID Pass
Those with an English, Welsh, Northern Irish and Scottish NHS COVID Pass with a verifiable QR code will be allowed to travel to Norway. This applies only to those fully vaccinated with a vaccine approved by the European Medicines Agency or those who can prove they have recovered from COVID-19 during the past six months. You are considered fully vaccinated 7 days after your last dose. Travellers with a valid QR coded NHS COVID Pass will not be required to provide evidence of a negative test on arrival, complete an entry registration form, be tested at the border or quarantine after arrival. Norway also accepts the EU digital COVID certificate as proof of vaccination or previous illness.
A printed paper version of your English, Welsh, Northern Irish or Scottish NHS COVID Pass is acceptable as long as it has the QR code. Paper versions of the pass without a QR code will not be accepted.
For those without an English, Welsh, Northern Irish or Scottish NHS COVID Pass
For those without a QR coded English, Welsh, Northern Irish or Scottish NHS COVID Pass restrictions continue to apply.
Travellers from a dark red country (which currently includes the UK), without a valid QR coded NHS COVID Pass, must complete a self-declaration form within the 72 hours prior to arrival and may be tested on arrival.
Quarantine requirements for the UK, EU, EEA and Schengen countries are specific to each country.
From 4pm on 25 September, travellers from the UK without a valid QR coded NHS COVID Pass are required to stay in a suitable location e.g. hotel or home, for 10 days. However, a negative PCR test taken no earlier than three days after entry will allow you to end quarantine early. There are no quarantine requirements for children under 18. For guidance on what the Norwegian authorities regard as a ‘suitable location’ and how to quarantine, see the FHI website. You may be asked for evidence that your planned place of quarantine meets the requirements. For those without a suitable location to quarantine, government run quarantine hotels are available.

Regular entry requirements
Visas
The rules for travelling or working in European countries changed on 1 January 2021:
you can travel to countries in the Schengen area for up to 90 days in any 180-day period without a visa. This applies if you travel as a tourist, to visit family or friends, to attend business meetings, cultural or sports events, or for short-term studies or training.
if you are travelling to Norway and other Schengen countries without a visa, make sure your whole visit is within the 90-day limit. Visits to Schengen countries within the previous 180 days before you travel count towards your 90 days.
to stay longer, to work or study, for business travel or for other reasons, you will need to meet the Norwegian government’s entry requirements. Check with the Norwegian Embassy what type of visa and/or work permit, you may need
if you stay in Norway with a residence permit or long-stay visa, this does not count towards your 90-day visa-free limit
Any time you spent in Norway or other Schengen countries before 1 January 2021 does not count towards your 90-day visa-free limit.
At Norwegian border control, you may need to use separate lanes from EU, EEA and Swiss citizens when queueing. Your passport may be stamped on entry and exit. You may also need to:
show a return or onward ticket
show you have enough money for your stay
There are separate requirements for those who are resident in Norway. If you are resident in Norway, you should carry proof of residence as well as your valid passport when you travel. For further information on these requirements, see our Living in Norway guide.
Passport validity
Check your passport is valid for travel before you book your trip, and renew your passport if you do not have enough time left on it.
Make sure your passport is:
valid for at least 3 months after the day you plan to leave Norway, or any other Schengen country
less than 10 years old
The 3 months you need when leaving a country must be within 10 years of the passport issue date.
If you renewed your current passport before the previous one expired, extra months may have been added to its expiry date. Any extra months on your passport over 10 years may not count towards the minimum 3 months needed.
Svalbard
You’ll need your passport with you to travel to and enter Svalbard. For more information on visiting Svalbard, including coronavirus-related restrictions, see Visit Svalbard’s website.
UK Emergency Travel Documents
UK ETDs are accepted for entry, airside transit and exit from Norway.

Check with the Norwegian Embassy in London before travelling with pets.
