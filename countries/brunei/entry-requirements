They are required to take an ART at home on the day of their arrival (Day 1) and a RT-PCR test on Day 3 at an accredited private clinic. They are also required to undergo self-isolation for three days and until a negative RT-PCR result is obtained. Travellers will be charged $100 BND before travelling for both ART and RT-PCR.

Check your passport and travel documents before you travel
Visas
British Citizen passport holders may enter Brunei for up to 90 days without a visa. If you have another type of British nationality, check with Brunei immigration authorities about visa requirements.
Make sure the entry stamp in your passport indicates the validity of your stay. There are strict penalties for overstaying.
If you’re staying longer than 90 days and/or visiting for non-tourist purposes, you will need to get a visa from the nearest Brunei diplomatic mission before you travel.
Passport validity  
Your passport should be valid for a minimum period of 6 months from the date of entry into Brunei. 
Dual nationality
Brunei does not recognise dual nationality. You can be refused entry if you’re found to be holding two passports of different nationality. If you’re a dual national, it’s advisable to enter Brunei on the passport on which you exited your last country of departure. While in Brunei your nationality will be deemed to be that shown on the passport which you used to enter the country. This may affect the consular assistance that you receive in Brunei.
Yellow fever certificate requirements
Check whether you need a yellow fever certificate by visiting the National Travel Health Network and Centre’s TravelHealthPro website.
UK Emergency Travel Documents
UK Emergency travel documents (ETDs) are accepted for entry, airside transit and exit from Brunei. They should have at least 6 months validity. You’ll have to obtain an exit and entry visa from Brunei Immigration before you travel. Please be aware that same day ETDs are not available.
