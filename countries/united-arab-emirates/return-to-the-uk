The UAE authorities announced today, 23 March, that all passenger flights, including transit flights, will be suspended within 48 hours. If you are in the UAE, and it is essential that you return to the UK, you should urgently contact your airline or tour operator and arrange to leave now. Local restrictions mean that only UAE citizens are currently allowed to return to UAE.
If you are transiting through a UAE airport to another destination please check with your carrier before travelling.
Some routes to and from the United Arab Emirates by air, land and sea have been suspended. You should check with your travel provider before travelling.
We understand that passenger cruises are currently not allowed to dock in the UAE as a result of measures taken to combat coronavirus. A UAE-wide notice to mariners has issued. Vessels already in port have been allowed to disembark passengers at the end of cruises. The Cruise Line International Association (CLIA) has adopted an enhanced member health policy which all CLIA ocean member cruise lines are required to follow to address the coronavirus. If you are planning to travel on an international cruise that is due to call at any port in the UAE, contact your travel company for the latest information.
