Warning
FCDO advises against all travel to Russia.

You should also read FCDO’s overall travel advice.
Terrorism
There is a high threat of terrorist attack globally affecting UK interests and British nationals, including from groups and individuals who view the UK and British nationals as targets. You should remain vigilant.
UK Counter Terrorism Policing has information and advice on staying safe abroad and what to do in the event of a terrorist attack. Find out how to reduce your risk from terrorism while abroad.
Terrorism in Russia
Terrorists are very likely to try to carry out attacks in Russia.
Attacks could be indiscriminate and target:
popular tourist sites
seasonal, festive, or religious activities in public places
areas that are not controlled by security, such as open-air events and markets
transportation networks
Terrorist attacks in Moscow and St Petersburg resulted in large numbers of casualties. Russia’s aviation has also been targeted. Security forces have disrupted several plots in major Russian cities.
Terrorism in North Caucasus
Since 2015, Daesh has been active in North Caucasus. They have carried out a number of small-scale attacks (mainly in Dagestan), targeting security personnel. Levels of violence, and the risk of terrorism, could rise quickly.
Security services carry out regular counter-terrorism operations in the North Caucasus and across Russia. These can be at happen at short notice and may lead to travel restrictions.
Political situation
Russia’s invasion of Ukraine
Russia’s invasion of Ukraine continues. The situation is unpredictable and could escalate without warning. Stay alert and follow the advice of local authorities.
Russia has heightened security measures in place. Security measures are set by local authorities and will differ between regions. Security measures could be introduced at short notice. This could include curfews, restrictions on movements and public gatherings and seizure of private property.
Restrictions on publishing and distributing information
Journalists have been arrested for gathering and publishing information.
There are severe restrictions on publishing and distributing information related to the Russian armed forces and any military operations. People charged under these laws face heavy sentences.
If you publish or distribute information considered ‘fake’ or from non-official Russian government sources, including posting of sharing content on social media, you could be fined or face a prison sentences of up to 15 years.
International sanctions against Russia
In response to Russia’s invasion, the UK and other governments have placed sanctions on Russia, including on its airlines. This can affect the situation in Russia and anyone travelling there. See more information about Russian sanctions and what this means for British nationals.
International businesses and services have restrictions in place, including Mastercard and Visa, which means you may not be able to access money or other services. Read FCDO’s overall travel advice and entry requirements.
Protests and demonstrations
Since Russia’s invasion of Ukraine, there have been anti-war protests across Russia. Demonstrators have been detained.
Authorised rallies and demonstrations are allowed in cities and towns in Russia. Under Russian law, a single person can constitute a protest and could be subject to repercussions by Russian authorities. Unauthorised demonstrations can become violent, with a strong response from security forces.
Check local media for the latest information, be vigilant, and avoid any demonstrations or large gatherings that may be considered political. Do not take photographs of or film political activities.
Crime
Protecting your belongings
Be alert to the possibility of mugging, pickpocketing and theft in the main tourist areas, around the main railway stations, vehicles and hotel rooms. You should not:
leave your bags unattended
openly carry expensive items or anything that might identify you as a tourist
walk about late at night alone
look after possessions of people you do not know
agree to go to a bar or a club with someone you have just met
Be wary of groups of people begging.
Look after your passport, especially in major transport hubs and busy areas. British nationals have had passports stolen or lost in Moscow airports. Take care when passing through airports, particularly in the baggage collection area and outside the arrivals hall.
Drink spiking
Drink spiking, leading to robbery, violence or abuse, can happen. Victims are often left unconscious outside. This can be life-threatening in winter. Buy your own drinks and always keep them in sight.
Violent crime
Foreign visitors are not usually the targets of violent crime. However, in St Petersburg gangs have targeted tourists for street crime.
Dating services scams
Dating services scams have affected British nationals. Never send money or buy items for anyone you have not met in person.
Money transfer scams
Be wary of sending money through untraceable transfer services. British nationals have lost money when sending it to unknown recipients without checking they’re genuine.
Fake police checks
The police do not need a reason to stop, question or detain individuals. Fake police officers have harassed and robbed tourists. If you’re stopped, always insist on seeing identification. Report any harassment or crime to the nearest police office.
Laws and cultural differences
Passport checks
Always carry your passport with you as ID. Police carry out random checks, especially during periods of high security. You could be fined or detained for up to 48 hours if you cannot show your passport when asked. Copies are not accepted.
Drugs
Do not use or carry drugs. You can be prosecuted for possessing even small quantities of any drugs.
Restricted military areas
Access to certain areas, such as military and border zones, is restricted. You must get permission from local authorities before entering. You can find a list of restricted areas online (in Russian and the site may not be accessible from outside of Russia).
If you do not have permission, you may be arrested, fined or deported. Check with your tour operator or the Russian Embassy in the UK if you’re unsure whether a tour or excursion will take you into a restricted area.
Photographing military sites
Photography is not permitted at any military, secure or official sites (including airports). There may not be warning signs in locations where photography is banned. You could be detained or arrested if you break the law.
Using drones
Due to current military activities, some regions have prohibited the use of all drones. Check restrictions with the local authorities.
You must get permission from the Russian aviation authority (in Russian) before using any unmanned aircraft systems (drones) in Russian airspace. You must tell them the flight route at least 24 hours in advance and keep in regular contact with them before and during the flight. You will be fined if you do not comply.
Cybersecurity laws
There are increasing restrictions to limit accessibility and content posted on the internet, including social media platforms. Meta (Facebook and Instagram), Twitter and LinkedIn are blocked in Russia. Access to other websites can be unreliable.
More information is available from the Federal Service for Surveillance of Communications, Information Technology and Mass Media (in Russian).
Racial discrimination
Most visitors experience no problems but racial discrimination can happen in some areas. If you’re of African, Asian or Caribbean descent, you may receive unwanted attention in public places. Take care, particularly when travelling late at night.
LGBT+ travellers
Homosexuality is not illegal in Russia. However, attitudes towards the LGBT+ community and LGBT+ issues are less tolerant than in the UK and vary in different locations. Government officials have made derogatory comments to LGBT+ individuals. Legislation bans people from promoting ‘non-traditional sexual relations’ to minors. Foreign citizens could face fines, up to 15 days in jail, or deportation. Public displays of affection may receive negative attention. In November 2023, the Russian Supreme Court banned the so-called ‘international LGBT public movement’, designating it as ‘extremist’. This decision will come into force from January 2024.
In 2023, Russia was ranked 46 out of 49 European countries for LGBT+ rights by ILGA-Europe. There are no laws to protect LGBT+ people from discrimination on the grounds of sexual orientation or gender identity.
Recent laws targeting LGBT+ communities include:
in 2012, Moscow Pride was banned for 100 years
in 2022 , a ban on the ‘demonstration of LGBT information, promotion of non-traditional sexual relations and change of gender’ to children and adults through the internet, films, advertisement, audio visual services and books (the “gay propaganda” law)
in November 2023, the Russian Supreme Court banned the so-called ‘international LGBT movement’, designating it as ‘extremist’. The court provided no definition of ‘international LGBT public movement’. Being a member of and donating money to ‘extremist’ organisations are criminal offences. This decision will come in to force from January 2024. However, it is unclear how the authorities will implement the ruling.
Harassment, threats, and acts of violence towards the LGBT+ community have increased. Penalties for foreign nationals may include arrest and detention, fines and deportation.
The North Caucasus republics are particularly intolerant of the LGBT+ community. There have been reports of the arrest, torture and killing of gay men in Chechnya, allegedly conducted by Chechen regional authorities.
Read FCDO advice for LGBT+ travellers.
Religious activities
Some religious activities are restricted, including preaching and distributing religious materials.
Jehovah’s Witnesses are considered an extremist organisation in Russia. They can face harassment from authorities, including detention, particularly at places of worship.
Some other minority religious groups, like Scientologists, also face discrimination.
Transport risks
Road travel
If you’re planning to drive in Russia, see information on driving abroad and read the RAC Russia guide.
You need either a 1968 international driving permit (IDP) or a valid UK driving licence to drive in Russia. The 1949 IDP is not accepted anymore. You cannot buy an IDP outside the UK, so get one before you travel. You can buy an IDP in person from some UK post offices – find your nearest post office branch that offers this service.
Road safety in Russia is poor and road conditions unpredictable. Take care when driving, take account of weather conditions and consider avoiding driving at night. Do not drive alone at night or sleep in your vehicle on the side of the road. Do not pick up hitchhikers.
Traffic police will often stop drivers for spot checks.
Bringing vehicles into Russia
If you plan to drive into Russia, you must declare your vehicle to the customs authority on entry. You can bring a vehicle into Russia without paying import taxes for up to one year.
Green cards are no longer accepted as proof of car or road insurance. Check insurance requirements before entering.
For questions about bringing a vehicle into Russia, contact the Russian Embassy in the UK.
Avoiding unregistered taxis
British nationals travelling in unregistered taxis have been victims of crime. Taxis that look official can be unlicensed. You should:
use a local taxi app to call a registered taxi
ask your hotel to call a taxi or give you the number of a reputable company
agree the fare before getting into the taxi or check that the meter is working
Do not flag down a taxi or share a taxi with strangers.
Rail travel
Railway stations have airport-style security. Many railway services require passengers to show their passports on boarding.
If you are travelling by overnight train, store valuables in the container under the bed or seat. Do not look after luggage for other travelers or let it be stored in your compartment.
Do not leave your sleeping compartment empty, as some compartments only have a simple lock on the sliding door. On some trains, there may be an extra security device attached to the fitted handle or lock. There may also be a steel switch at head-height on the door panel which, when pulled down, prevents the closed door from being opened.
Air travel
Air space will close during drone attacks. This has led to frequent and unpredictable delays, diversions and cancellations to flights in and out of airports in European Russia.
There are restrictions on domestic flights to a number of airports in southern Russia, with disruption to internal flights to and from Moscow and other cities. Check the latest information with your airline or travel provider.
Air safety
The UK Air Safety List (ASL) lists all known airlines in Russia that do not meet international safety standards and are banned from operating commercial air services to, from, and within the UK. Check the UK Air Safety List when considering which airlines to fly with. The list is maintained by the Department for Transport, based on advice from the UK Civil Aviation Authority.
The UK government has sanctioned:
Aeroflot
Rossiya Airlines
Ural Airlines
Russian Railways
British nationals can buy flight tickets as long as the journey is starting in, or within, Russia without breaching UK sanctions. See more information from the Office for Financial Sanctions Implementation (PDF).
British government staff do not travel on banned airlines. If staff need to travel internally, they may use airlines which also fly to internationally to countries where international safety standards are maintained or on Western manufactured aircraft.
Travellers with limited mobility
Wheelchair access can be limited in some public areas. Facilities for people with limited mobility vary. They can be poor or non-existent in some areas.
See FCDO advice on disability and travelling abroad.
Natural disasters and extreme weather
Earth tremors
Earth tremors are recorded throughout the year without consequences. To learn more about what to do before, during and after an earthquake, see the website of the US Federal Emergency Management Agency.
Forest fires
There are areas of wildfires in western and southern Russia.
