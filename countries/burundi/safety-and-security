Crime
There’s a substantial risk of crime. Muggings at gun and knifepoint, bag snatching, pick-pocketing, burglary, car break-ins, and armed car hijackings have all been reported. Avoid walking in the streets or using public transport after dark, even in Bujumbura city centre, and don’t carry large amounts of money. Take care when withdrawing or exchanging cash, and avoid doing so at night.
Stay at hotels that have good security. Safeguard valuables and cash. Use hotel safes, where possible. Keep copies of important documents, including your passport and visa, separately. Be wary of who you plan to meet and where, and inform colleagues or family members of your plans.
Local travel
The security situation across Burundi remains changeable.
There have been armed incursions from eastern DRC into neighbouring border areas of Burundi. You should make contact with your destination before you set off and make sure that you allow enough time to complete your journey during daylight hours.
The FCDO continues to advise against all travel to Bubanza and Cibitoke provinces due to continued armed attacks.
The FCDO also advises against all travel to the following areas and roads for security reasons: • areas of Bujumbura Rural province west of the Rusizi river towards the Democratic Republic of Congo border, with the exception of the Rusizi Delta Nature Reserve • the road north of Bujumbura airport towards Cibitoke • the main road running west from Kayanza through the Kibira National Park • Ruvubu National Park
Road travel
The DRC border crossing at Gatumba-Uvira is open. All other land and maritime borders are closed with the exception of goods and cargo.
Public transport vehicles are banned from crossing the border with Rwanda and there are restrictions on Burundian food products being exported into Rwanda.
You can drive in Burundi on a full UK driving licence for the first 6 months after you arrive. You’ll then need to get a Burundi driving licence. There are only a small number of tarmac roads and these are sometimes in poor condition. Driving standards are poor and there are frequent serious accidents. Keep car doors locked and windows closed when driving. Access in to and out of Bujumbura city is controlled by police at night. Avoid travelling by road outside Bujumbura after dark. This is due to the security situation and road safety concerns.
Road blocks and document checks are common, and not always official. Carry a copy of your passport and visa, but you may be need to produce the originals. Reports of attempted robberies at fake checkpoints have increased.
Avoid travelling on collective and public transport (buses and motorbike taxis), due to poor vehicle maintenance and low driving standards.
Road infrastructure is poor and roads are frequently blocked or damaged by landslides, especially after heavy rain. Landslides have destroyed road bridges, making some routes impassable. Check local advice on road conditions when planning travel by road and have a contingency plan in case your preferred route is blocked.
Air travel
Commercial flights to Burundi are now operating at a reduced capacity. Please check with carriers for more information. See Coronavirus.
A number of carriers normally fly in and out of Burundi including: Rwandair, Ethiopian Airlines, Kenyan Airways and Brussels Airlines.
The EU has published a list of air carriers that are subject to an operating ban or restrictions within the EU.
Political situation
There have been violent attacks, including on opposition supporters. There are reports that arbitrary arrests, detentions and disappearances of Burundians, most often from civil society, independent media and pockets of society perceived to be anti-government, continue. The police have used live ammunition and tear gas against demonstrators.
Grenade attacks are common in Burundi, and can be politically motivated. There was a grenade attack on 25 May at a bus stop in Bujumbura.
You should avoid all large gatherings and remain vigilant at all times given security and health (COVID-19) risks.
Consular assistance
Consular support is not available from the British government in Burundi. However, the British High Commission in Kigali, Rwanda can provide consular support to British nationals. See Consular assistance
