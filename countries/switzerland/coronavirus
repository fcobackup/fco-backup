Travel in Switzerland
Switzerland has put measures in place to limit the spread of COVID-19.
You should follow the rules on hygiene and social distancing. These include:
Washing your hands regularly and thoroughly
Keeping a distance of at least 1.5 metres from other people
If it is not possible to maintain that distance, wear a face mask.
Wearing a face mask is compulsory when travelling on public transport, on platforms and in waiting areas, as well as at airports. Failure to do so is punishable by a fine. Children under the age of 12 are exempt from this requirement, as are individuals who are unable to wear a mask for medical reasons.
Cantons have imposed further restrictions, and you should check cantonal websites for further details.
Public spaces and services
Wearing face masks in enclosed public spaces is compulsory. Shops selling non-essential goods, restaurants, bars, clubs, cultural venues, and sports and leisure facilities are closed until 28 February. Takeaways and delivery services may remain open. Public gatherings, sporting and cultural activities, and meetings in private households are limited to a maximum of five people (including children).
For further information on these measures and exceptions, see the Swiss Government website.
