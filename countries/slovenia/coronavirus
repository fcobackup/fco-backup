Be prepared for your plans to change
No travel is risk-free during COVID. Countries may further restrict travel or bring in new rules at short notice, for example due to a new COVID-19 variant. Check with your travel company or airline for any transport changes which may delay your journey home.
If you test positive for COVID-19, you may need to stay where you are until you test negative. You may also need to seek treatment there.
Plan ahead and make sure you:

understand what your insurance will cover

COVID-19 vaccines if you live in Slovenia
Wherever possible British nationals should aim to be vaccinated in the country where they live. We will update this page when the Government of Slovenia announces new information on the national vaccination programme. You can sign up to get email notifications when this page is updated.
The Slovenian national vaccination programme started in December 2020 and is using the AstraZeneca, Pfizer-BioNTech, Janssen (Johnson and Johnson) and Moderna vaccines. The Government of Slovenia has stated that British nationals resident in Slovenia are eligible for vaccination. You should register your interest online via the zVEM service, and also notify your doctor in Slovenia. You will need your EMŠO (Identity card) number and your Slovene health insurance card. The vaccine registration facility is only available in Slovene, so you might need some assistance if you don’t speak Slovene.
Alternatively, you can go to one of the pop-up vaccination centres across the country (no appointment necessary) or view the current schedule (in Slovene).
Find out more, including about vaccines that are authorised in the UK or approved by the World Health Organisation, on the COVID-19 vaccines if you live abroad.
If you’re a British national living in Slovenia, you should seek medical advice from your local healthcare provider. Information about COVID-19 vaccines used in the national programme where you live, including regulatory status, should be available from local authorities.
If you receive your COVID-19 vaccination in Slovenia, you can get an EU Digital COVID Certificate from the national authorities. The Certificate proves that you have been vaccinated against COVID-19, received a negative test result, or recovered from COVID-19. It will help facilitate your travel within the EU and, in some countries, you can use it to demonstrate your COVID-19 status to businesses and other organisations.
