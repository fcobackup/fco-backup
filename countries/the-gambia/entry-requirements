The information on this page covers the most common types of travel and reflects the UK government’s understanding of the rules currently in place. Unless otherwise stated, this information is for travellers using a full ‘British Citizen’ passport.
The authorities in the country or territory you’re travelling to are responsible for setting and enforcing the rules for entry. If you’re unclear about any aspect of the entry requirements, or you need further reassurance, you’ll need to contact the embassy, high commission or consulate of the country or territory you’re travelling to.
You should also consider checking with your transport provider or travel company to make sure your passport and other travel documents meet their requirements.
Visas
For visits of less than a month, you don’t need to get a visa before you travel. British nationals are given a 28 day stamp in their passports on arrival. You can get further 28-day extensions from the Immigration Office in Banjul or the Tourist Police Stations in the Tourism Development Area.
If you’re planning to enter The Gambia for a period longer than 3 months, check entry requirements with the Gambian High Commission in London.
Passport validity
Your passport should be valid for the proposed duration of your stay.
Airport Development Fee

Passengers in transit and infants under 2 years old are exempt. Check with your travel company whether this fee has been included in your air ticket.
UK Emergency Travel Documents
UK Emergency Travel Documents (ETDs) are valid for entry and exit at Banjul airport.
