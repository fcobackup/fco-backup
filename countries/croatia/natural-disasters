Earthquakes
Small tremors are recorded several times a month throughout the year without consequences. To learn more about what to do before, during and after an earthquake, visit the website of the US Federal Emergency Management Agency.
On 22 March 2020, a 5.3 magnitude earthquake hit Zagreb and the surrounding areas causing damage to buildings and infrastructure. Aftershocks continue to be felt, including one on 23 April 2020, measuring approximately 3.0 on the Richter scale. An extensive repair and recovery operation is underway, but many roads and pavements remain hazardous due to the risk of further falling debris. Great care should be taken when walking or driving around the city.
Forest fires
Forest fires are very common during Croatia’s hot and dry summers. Take care when visiting or driving through woodland and forest areas. Make sure cigarette ends are properly extinguished, don’t light barbecues and don’t leave any rubbish, particularly empty bottles, behind.
Floods
Flash floods can occur with very little warning and can lead to dangerous water flows and disruption to transport and other networks. You should keep a close eye on weather forecasts and follow the advice of local authorities.
Monitor media reports and follow the advice of the local authorities if a forest fire, earthquake, floods or other natural disaster occurs in your area.
