Entry and borders
All scheduled international flights to and from Angola were suspended from 20 March until further notice.
The Government of Angola has also announced that nobody (apart from returning Angolan nationals or permanent residents) will be allowed into Angola after having visited China, South Korea, Iran, France, Spain, Portugal or Italy since December. All returning residents who have been to China, South Korea, Iran, France, Spain, Portugal or Italy will be placed in obligatory quarantine for 14 days upon arrival.
If you need further information about entry requirements, contact the local immigration authorities or the nearest Angolan Embassy. You should also check with your airline or travel company for the latest information. If you are in Angola and your visa has reached its expiry date, it will remain valid until further notice.
Local measures
The current State of Emergency has been extended until at least 25 April. This activated a series of measures to limit the spread of the virus, including:
significant restrictions on movement throughout the country. All citizens have been asked to remain at home
closure of most shops, other than those selling food or medicine
reduced public transport and suspension of domestic flights
The Angolan police are robustly enforcing these rules.
