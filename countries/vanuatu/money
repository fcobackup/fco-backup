The local currency is the Vanuatu Vatu (VUV). The use of credit cards is commonplace in Port Vila and Luganville but less so in the rest of Vanuatu, particularly away from tourist resorts. There are banking facilties and money exchange services in Port Vila through the following banks, ANZ, BSP (Bank South Pacific) and the National Bank of Vanuatu available 8.30am to 3.00pm Monday to Friday. Many offer ATM facilities covering most UK bank cards.
