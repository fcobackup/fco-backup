Nigeria is mainly a cash economy although the use of credit and debit cards is increasing - especially in the big cities. If you intend to use cash, make sure you bring enough foreign currency to cover costs. It is illegal to change money on the street and travellers cheques are difficult to cash. Credit card fraud is common, so take care if using your card. You should take advice from your card issuer before travelling if you intend to use your credit or debit card in Nigeria.
The Central Bank of Nigeria (CBN) has directed the redesign and issue of new N200, N500 and N1â€™000 Naira notes, which are in circulation though not in large quantities. Old Naira notes in circulation will remain legal tender only until Tuesday 31 January 2023. You are encouraged to check notes provided by currency exchange vendors will be valid for the duration of your travel to Nigeria, and to follow local CBN guidelines for disposal of old Naira notes before the 31 January 2023 deadline. Some commercial retailers have stopped accepting old Naira notes.
There is a possibility during this transition period of queues at banks, shops and petrol stations, for which you should plan accordingly.
