Any exceptional flights in the future are likely to depart from Buenos Aires. Regular domestic flights within Argentina, as well as all scheduled long distance trains and buses, are suspended until midnight on 26 April. There may be other options for travelling overland, such as taking a taxi or hiring a car, but you are only permitted to travel to Buenos Aires if you have a valid ticket for an international flight which departs within 24 hours of your arrival. Please also note that vehicles are unable to stop overnight so there must be a minimum of two drivers for long journeys.
If you need to spend a night in Buenos Aires, you will need to find accommodation to meet the requirements of the nationwide quarantine, which prohibits you from leaving your accommodation without justification. See Coronavirus
You can travel from your accommodation to the airport if you have a valid plane ticket and are not showing any symptoms of coronavirus.
If you are planning to travel overland to Buenos Aires, you will need:

a letter issued from the British Embassy confirming that you should be allowed to travel.
proof that you have a confirmed international flight departing within 24 hours of your arrival in Buenos Aires.
possible additional permissions depending on your route and means of travel. Please check this with the British Embassy, as far in advance of your departure as possible, by emailing returnfrom.argentina@fco.gov.uk with details of your planned journey.
If you are being driven, your drivers must also have the relevant permits allowing them to make the journey.
