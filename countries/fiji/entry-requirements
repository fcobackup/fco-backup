This information is for people travelling on a full ‘British citizen’ passport from the UK. It is based on the UK government’s understanding of Fiji’s current rules for the most common types of travel.
The authorities in Fiji set and enforce entry rules. If you’re not sure how these requirements apply to you, contact the Fiji High Commission in the UK.
COVID-19 rules
There are no COVID-19 testing or vaccination requirements for travellers entering Fiji.
Passport validity requirements
Your passport must have an ‘expiry date’ at least 6 months after the date you arrive in Fiji.
Visa requirements
You do not need a visa for visits of up to 4 months. If you plan to stay for longer than 4 months, apply for a visa from the Fiji Immigration Department.
At Fiji border control, you must also show:
an onward or return ticket
a valid visa for the next country you’re travelling to
If you’re visiting Fiji on business, you must apply for a business visitors permit, which is valid for 21 days.
Yacht entry
Yachts can only enter Fiji through Suva, Lautoka, Savusavu and Levuka. For other ports, such as Nadi and Denarau, you must have prior agreement from the Fijian authorities.
Travelling with children
If you are entering Fiji on a work or residency permit, and are travelling as a lone parent, you may need to have evidence of your parental responsibility. For further information contact the Fiji High Commission in the UK.
Vaccine requirements
To enter Fiji, you must have a certificate to prove you’ve had a yellow fever vaccination if you’re coming from a country listed as a transmission risk.
For full details about medical entry requirements and recommended vaccinations, see TravelHealthPro’s Fiji guide.
Customs rules
There are strict rules about goods you can take into or out of Fiji. You must declare anything that may be prohibited or subject to tax or duty.
Fiji customs has strict quarantine regulations and customs officers X-ray all luggage arriving at Nadi airport. They will confiscate most fresh foodstuffs, unless you’re arriving from a country with quarantine agreements with Fiji.
Taking money into Fiji
Declare cash in any currency worth 10,000 Fijian dollars or more. If you are found with undeclared cash, you could be prosecuted and get a fine or a prison sentence.  
Most tourist hotels and many restaurants accept credit cards. Not all ATMs accept the full range of credit cards. The Australian and New Zealand Bank (ANZ) and Westpac ATMs accept cards with the Visa, Mastercard, Maestro and Cirrus symbols.
