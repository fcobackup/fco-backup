The third World Nomad Games will take place in Cholpon-Ata, Bulan-Sogottu village and Kyrchyn gorge, Issyk-Kul oblast, from 2 to 8 September 2018. Information about the Games, including ticketing and the programme, can be found on the World Nomad Games website. You should note the road conditions in some parts of Issyk-Kul are poor and roadworks are likely to be ongoing during the Games. There will be increased road traffic and security checks in the area over that period, and you should expect delays if you’re planning to attend the Games.
Terrorist attacks in Kyrgyzstan can’t be ruled out. You should be vigilant in public places and follow security advice from the local authorities. See Terrorism.
