The information on this page covers the most common types of travel and reflects the UK government’s understanding of the rules currently in place. Unless otherwise stated, this information is for travellers using a full ‘British Citizen’ passport.
The authorities in the country or territory you’re travelling to are responsible for setting and enforcing the rules for entry. If you’re unclear about any aspect of the entry requirements, or you need further reassurance, you’ll need to contact the embassy, high commission or consulate of the country or territory you’re travelling to.
You should also consider checking with your transport provider or travel company to make sure your passport and other travel documents meet their requirements.
Entry rules in response to coronavirus
Entry to Burundi
Commercial flights to Burundi are now operating at a reduced capacity. Please check with carriers for more information. Land borders reopened from 1 August, although there have been difficulties reported in land border crossings.
All travellers to Burundi must have proof of a negative COVID-19 test issued in the last 72 hours. You should not use the NHS testing service to get a test in order to facilitate your travel to another country. You should arrange to take a private test.
Visitors to Burundi must get a visa before travel, via any Burundian diplomatic mission. The Burundi authorities currently will no longer issue new visas, and will only renew visas for those already in Burundi. Burundian authorities have confirmed that those whose visas expired since the flight suspension on 22 March are able to get extensions to their visas.
Quarantine requirements
All travellers to Burundi must have proof of a negative COVID-19 test issued in the last 72 hours. All travellers must then spend 72 hours in quarantine while awaiting the results of a COVID-19 test taken on arrival in Burundi. If any passenger on your flight tests positive, all passengers from that flight will be placed into quarantine for 14 days.
