There are currently no commercial options to return to the UK from Uganda. Since 22 March, all international flights to and from Uganda have been suspended. Cargo flights are permitted, but crew must observe strict guidelines. Land borders and lake ports are also closed, except for truck drivers.
We continue to work with the Government of Uganda, other embassies and airlines on options for helping British nationals who wish to return home.
The UK government has facilitated a special flight from Entebbe for British travellers, short term visitors and their direct dependents in Uganda to return to the UK. The flight will leave on 21 May.
Seats cost Â£559. All passengers must pay for their tickets.
To be eligible for a flight, you must:
be a British national, normally resident in the UK.
or be a dependant of and travelling with a British national
Vulnerable British nationals will be prioritised.
Vulnerable non-British UK residents with Indefinite Leave to Remain, and other foreign nationals, may be accommodated if there is sufficient capacity. Your eligibility, including your UK address, will be checked before your tickets are issued.
CTM are working on behalf of the Foreign and Commonwealth Office (FCO) to manage special flight bookings.
If you wish to travel, you must book tickets via the CTM website.
To register on the CTM website, you will need:
full passport and contact details for each traveller you are registering
your UK home address and postcode
your means of payment, such as credit or debit card details
The booking website is only available to British nationals. If you have difficulty registering online, you are a vulnerable non-British UK resident with Indefinite Leave to Remain, or another foreign national, you will need to contact us. To do so, send an SMS text message containing only your full name to +44(0)753 745 3853. A member of the CTM team will then be in touch.
Tickets will not be on sale at the airport. Do not travel to the airport without a confirmed ticket.

After your booking is confirmed
After your booking is confirmed we will send you an email with all the details you need including what time to be at the airport. You must print and take your confirmed itinerary from CTM with you to the airport.
Given the current restrictions on personal travel within Uganda, we are also considering how to get people to the airport. If the current restrictions are extended beyond 18 May and you are unable to travel to the airport independently, we will assist. Further details will be provided once your booking is confirmed.
Financial support for a flight
If you have exhausted all other options available to you for getting funds, you may be eligible to apply for an emergency loan from the government to cover the cost of the ticket. You would need to repay the loan when you are back in the UK.
Our partner CTM is also authorised to administer such loans on behalf of the FCO. If you cannot pay the cost of the ticket, send an SMS text message containing ONLY your full name to +44(0)753 745 3853 and someone from the CTM team will get in touch to assist.
