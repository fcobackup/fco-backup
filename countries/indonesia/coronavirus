Death from Covid-19 in Indonesia
If Covid-19 is given as cause of death and you would like to arrange a local cremation and repatriation of ashes, you will need to make contact with a local undertaker within 4 hours of the death registration to give your instructions. If you do not do this, it is likely that a local burial will take place.
You will also require a letter of no objection from the Embassy. This will be issued on the next working day.

Healthcare in Indonesia
For contact details for English speaking doctors, visit our list of healthcare providers.
A British national died of COVID-19 on 11 March 2020 in Bali. The standard of local medical care in Indonesia can be poor and some medical tests cannot be done reliably. As the government of Indonesia announces rising numbers of COVID-19 cases, there is an increasing risk that the healthcare system will come under significant further strain. Access to routine and emergency healthcare may be limited.

If you think you have COVID-19 symptoms, you should contact your nearest doctor or hospital. Detailed information about how patients with COVID-19 symptoms are handled can be found in our ‘living in Indonesia’ guide.
COVID-19 vaccines if you live in Indonesia
Wherever possible British nationals should aim to be vaccinated in the country where they live. As further information is available about the national vaccination programme, this page will be updated. Sign up to get email notifications.
The Indonesian Government is vaccinating by cluster. You may be eligible for vaccination at this time if you are resident in a tourist area particularly where large scale vaccination programs are initiated where the tourist sector is looking to restart or are a resident in possession of the correct documentation (KITAP/KTP). Please note access to the vaccine varies across the country.
You are also advised to check with your local health provider and also your local Government Office as to the status of your local rollout and eligibility.
The Medicines and Healthcare Products Regulatory Agency (MHRA) is the UK authority responsible for assessing the safety, quality and efficacy of vaccines. It has authorised the Pfizer/BioNTech, Oxford/AstraZeneca and Moderna vaccines for temporary supply and use in the UK. Find out more about MHRA approval for these vaccines.
British nationals living overseas should seek medical advice from their local healthcare provider in the country where they reside. Information about vaccines used in other national programmes, including regulatory status, should be available from the local authorities. This list of Stringent Regulatory Authorities recognised by the World Health Organisation may also be a useful source of additional information. Find out more information about the COVID-19 vaccines on the World Health Organization COVID-19 vaccines page.
