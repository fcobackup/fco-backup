Travel in Indonesia
Large-scale social restrictions (PSBB) in Jakarta are being eased in a number of stages. Essential services are available, but public activities (including schools, offices, religious activities, social and cultural gatherings and public transportation) continue to be limited to maintain social distancing. It is mandatory to wear a face mask when outside. Criminal sanctions may apply for violations of the restrictions. Similar restrictions apply in some other areas in Indonesia.
Public health measures by the Indonesian authorities include some restrictions on in-country air travel.
Foreign tourists continue to be able to travel on domestic flights within Indonesia to catch connecting international flights.
Passengers travelling on domestic flights may need:
a certificate issued in the previous 14 days to confirm that they are free of COVID-19
a completed airline travel declaration form
a letter from the British Embassy confirming that they are returning home
You should check the latest requirements with your airline directly. The Garuda airlines travel declaration form and our confirmation letter are available on our social media channels.
Accommodation
Accommodation, including hotels and private rental options, continue to be open for business across Indonesia. Social distancing measures are being applied in hotels.
Public places and services
Previous restrictions are gradually being eased and shops, bars and restaurants are resuming business, operating at 50% of their normal capacity and with social distancing of 1 metre. Restrictions remain on large public gatherings.
Healthcare in Indonesia
For contact details for English speaking doctors, visit our list of healthcare providers.
A British national died of COVID-19 on 11 March 2020 in Bali. The standard of local medical care in Indonesia can be poor and some medical tests cannot be done reliably. As the Government of Indonesia announces rising numbers of COVID-19 cases, there is an increasing risk that the healthcare system will come under significant further strain. Access to routine and emergency healthcare may be limited.
