Entry and borders
On 18 March 2020 the Chilean Government introduced a prohibition of the entry into the country for non-Chileans. This applies to all nationalities, with the exception of non-nationals with valid residency visas for Chile.
The Chilean authorities have closed all Ports to cruise liners.
Local measures
Chilean President Sebastian Piñera announced a 90-day ‘National State of Catastrophe’ on Wednesday 18 March 2020. A nationwide curfew (10pm to 5am) has been in place since 22 March.
Quarantines and sanitary cordons
Quarantines and sanitary cordons are in place for a number of districts in Santiago and in other parts of the country.
The country is deploying a flexible approach to bringing districts in and out of quarantine/sanitary cordons. New measures can be announced, and come into force shortly after, by the government at any time although changes are typically announced every Tuesday and are applied from Thursdays onwards.
The following measures are in place:
Quarantine orders for 14 out of Santiago’s 32 municipalities (until at least 7 May inclusive) – the northern halves of Ñuñoa and Central Santiago, El Bosque, San Bernardo (Norte), Puente Alto (Poniente), Independencia, Quinta Normal, Pedro Aguirre Cerda, La Pintana, San Ramon (Sur) and Estacion Central. From 10 pm on Tuesday, 5 May the municipalities of Central Santiago (Sur), Cerrillos, Quilicura and Recoleta will also enter in to quarantine.
Full quarantine is in place (until at least 7 May) for 4 other cities: Arica, Punta Arenas, Angol and Victoria. In addition, from 10 pm on Tuesday, 5 May the urban area of Antofagasta and the municipality of Mejillones will also enter into quarantine.
Sanitary cordons in place in Temuco (Araucanía) and Osorno (Los Lagos).
Information on zones in quarantine is available on the Google interactive map.
In those areas in quarantine, people are allowed to leave their residences only under certain circumstances, including for medical reasons, basic services, and public services. If you need to leave your residence for food supplies or medical reasons, you must get a permit from the Comisaria Virtual. Foreigners may use their passport number to access the system. The pages are only in Spanish. It is not possible to leave or enter a sanitary cordon without a “salvoconducto” (police authorization), also obtained via the Comisaria Virtual.
Health inspections
Checkpoints for health inspections are in force at various points around Santiago and elsewhere. In addition to checking the health of persons passing through, these checkpoints will be used to confirm that specific individuals who have been ordered to quarantine by medical authorities are not violating their quarantine. You will need to get a “Health Passport” prior to travel and present it at any checkpoint.

More information (in Spanish) is available on the Ministry of Health (Ministerio de Salud) website.
