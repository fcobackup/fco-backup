This page reflects the UK government’s understanding of current rules for people travelling on a full ‘British Citizen’ passport, for the most common types of travel.
The authorities in Sri Lanka set and enforce entry rules. For further information contact the embassy, high commission or consulate of the country or territory you’re travelling to. You should also consider checking with your transport provider or travel company to make sure your passport and other travel documents meet their requirements.
Entry rules in response to coronavirus (COVID-19)
Entry to Sri Lanka
Entry to Sri Lanka may be subject to quarantine measures depending on your vaccination status and pre-departure PCR test results. The Ministry of Tourism have published health protocols for arrivals to Sri Lanka, which can be downloaded from their website.
An online pre-travel health registration form needs to be completed by all UK travellers. Details can be found on the Sri Lanka Tourism Development Authority website.
COVID-19 travel insurance is now mandatory for all visitors. You can apply and pay through this link. If you have full insurance cover that specifically covers COVID-19, you will not be required to obtain COVID-19 travel insurance. Further details can be found on the Sri Lankan Tourism Development Authority website.
Evidence of a negative PCR test taken within 72 hours of the departure of your flight to Sri Lanka is required. You should not use the NHS testing service to get a test in order to facilitate your travel to another country. You should arrange to take a private test.
Entry requirements could change at short notice, and government websites are not always up to date. You should follow the instructions of the local authorities.
Cruise ship passengers will not be allowed to disembark in the country, including for temporary shore visits.
Children
Unvaccinated children below 12 years of fully vaccinated parents who are tourists or foreign nationals, are allowed to travel with fully vaccinated parents.
Unvaccinated children of 12 to 18 years of fully vaccinated parents who are tourist or foreign nationals, need to undergo Day 1 PCR testing at a Ministry of Health approved laboratory at Katunayake, a Quarantine Hotel or a Safe and Secure certified Level 1 Hotel. If the Day 1 PCR report is negative, they will be released from quarantine and will be allowed to go home or a hotel with fully vaccinated parents. They will not be further quarantined.
Children of 12 to 18 years who have obtained at least one dose of Pfizer vaccine (at least 2 weeks before travel) will be considered ‘fully vaccinated’.
Demonstrating your COVID-19 status
Sri Lanka will only accept the UK’s letter version of proof of COVID-19 recovery and vaccination record. They will not accept digital proof. Your NHS appointment card from vaccination centres is not designed to be used as proof of vaccination and should not be used to demonstrate your vaccine status.
Transiting Sri Lanka
Transit via Sri Lanka is permitted, as long as the connecting flight is within 10 hours of arrival. Travellers should check with their airline on the transit times. There are limited airside refreshment facilities available due to COVID-19 restrictions.
Visas
All visitors who have permission to travel to Sri Lanka are advised to apply online for an Electronic Travel Authorisation (ETA) to enter Sri Lanka. Further information on eligibility is available on the Department of Immigration and Emigration website.
Visitors can apply for an ETA on the ETA website.
On arrival visa facilities are available, however applying for an ETA before travel is advised for ease of travel and to prevent delays on arrival.
All visitors need to comply with the guidelines imposed for tourists by the Government of Sri Lanka.
If your visa is expiring you will need to apply for an extension through the Department for Immigration and Emigration. You should ring the Department for Immigration and Emigration on +94 70 710 1050 or visit their website to make an appointment.
