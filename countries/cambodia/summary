A pre-election political rally is planned by the Cambodian People’s Party (CPP) on Saturday 7 July. 100,000 people are expected at this event which will be held in the Koh Pich (Diamond Island) area of Phnom Penh. The event starts at 5:30am. Traffic disruption and delays should be expected around the city, including around the airport. Several processions will take place to and from the event from various areas of the city until around 2:00pm. Other rallies will be held between now and the general election on 29 July 2018. Avoid large gatherings, demonstrations and political meetings.
Political tensions remain high following the dissolution of the opposition Cambodia National Rescue Party (CNRP) on 16 November 2017. This followed the arrest of the CNRP leader Kem Sokha on 3 September 2017. Political rallies or disputes could trigger violent protests. Monitor local media closely and avoid all protests and demonstrations as they could turn violent. See Political situation
