Terrorists are very likely to try to carry out attacks in Belgium. Attacks could happen anywhere, including on public transport and transport hubs and in other places visited by foreigners. You should be vigilant in public places and follow the advice of local Belgian authorities.
There have been a number of high profile terrorist attacks across Belgium. On 25 August 2017, a man attacked 2 soldiers with a knife in Brussels. On 20 June 2017, Belgian security forces helped prevent a suspected terrorist attack at Brussels central station. On 6 August 2016, 2 police officers were attacked with a machete in the city of Charleroi. On 22 March 2016 co-ordinated terrorist attacks killed 32 and injured hundreds more at Brussels Zaventem airport and on the metro system.
The main threat is from extremists linked to Daesh (formerly referred to as ISIL). Daesh has claimed responsibility for attacks in Belgium.
Brussels hosts a number of international institutions (EU and NATO) and government and foreign embassy buildings which are sensitive locations.
There is considered to be a heightened threat of terrorist attack globally against UK interests and British nationals, from groups or individuals motivated by the conflict in Iraq and Syria. You should be vigilant at this time.
