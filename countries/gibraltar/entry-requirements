Entry rules in response to coronavirus (COVID-19)
The Government of Gibraltar has confirmed that air travel restrictions into Gibraltar due to COVID-19 have been lifted as from 21 June 2020. All incoming travellers with valid travel documents will be allowed entry into Gibraltar via the Gibraltar International Airport.
If you arrive in Gibraltar by land, air or sea and you have been to a ‘relevant area’ in the last 14 days you are required by law to report to the Gibraltar Borders and Coastguard Agency (if arriving by land or sea) or Gibraltar Port Authority (if arriving by sea).
A ‘relevant area’ is a country, area or territory outside of the European Union, but doesn’t include the UK, Jersey, Guernsey, Isle of Man, Andorra, Monaco, San Marino and the Vatican. It also excludes the list of countries included in the Schedule (Iceland, Liechtenstein, Norway, Switzerland, Australia, Canada, Georgia, Japan, New Zealand, Rwanda, South Korea, Thailand, Tunisia, Uruguay, and China).
If you have been in a ‘relevant area’ in the last 14 days it is required that you:
Self-Isolate for five days. If you are staying in a hotel, you must remain in your room and not use any of the public areas.
Do not use public transportation with the exception of a Gibraltar Taxi booked via the Gibraltar Taxi Association. You are required to inform them that you have arrived from a ‘relevant Area’. Call the local Gibraltar health line phone number 111 as soon as you reach the address where you will be isolating.
If you develop symptoms or feel unwell call 111 immediately even if you have been swabbed.
You must be swabbed on Day 1 and again on Day 5.
If you are not registered with the Gibraltar Health Authority (GHA) you must arrange a private swab.
See the Government of Gibraltar Press Release for more details.
On 22 September 2020 the Government of Gibraltar introduced a COVID-19 contact tracing online passenger locator and ‘relevant area form’ for passengers flying to Gibraltar. It is a legal requirement to complete a passenger locator form and inform the authorities if you have been in a ‘relevant area’ in the 14 days before your arrival in Gibraltar. You will only be able to complete this form once you have checked in and have been allocated your seat number.
If you are arriving on a flight at Gibraltar International Airport, you will need to fill in a passenger locator form online before you can pass through customs. The form will then be sent to you with a unique barcode via email. This will be scanned by the Gibraltar Borders and Coastguard Agency upon arrival. The form and further information can be found on the Government of Gibraltar website. See the Government of Gibraltar press release for more details.
