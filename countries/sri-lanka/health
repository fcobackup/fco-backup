If you have a health condition, or you are pregnant, you may need specialist healthcare abroad. Check whether your destination country can provide the healthcare you may need and ensure you have appropriate travel insurance for unexpected medical evacuation or local treatment.
See the Coronavirus travel health and Healthcare sections in the Coronavirus page for COVID-19 health information.
At least 8 weeks before your trip, check the latest country-specific health advice from the National Travel Health Network and Centre (NaTHNaC) on the TravelHealthPro website. Each country-specific page has information on vaccine recommendations, any current health risks or outbreaks, and factsheets with information on staying healthy abroad. Guidance is also available from NHS (Scotland) on the FitForTravel website.
General information on travel vaccinations and a travel health checklist is available on the NHS website. You may then wish to contact your health adviser or pharmacy for advice on other preventive measures and managing any pre-existing medical conditions while you’re abroad.
The legal status and regulation of some medicines prescribed or purchased in the UK can be different in other countries. If you’re travelling with prescription or over-the-counter medicine, read this guidance from NaTHNaC on best practice when travelling with medicines. For further information on the legal status of a specific medicine, you’ll need to contact the embassy, high commission or consulate of the country or territory you’re travelling to.
Looking after yourself during travel and when abroad is important. Information on travelling with mental health conditions is available in our guidance page. Further information is also available from the National Travel Health Network and Centre (NaTHNaC).
Medical treatment
The Sri Lankan healthcare system is under strain due to the ongoing economic situation in the country. Public hospitals may face shortages of imported medicines and medical equipment. Private hospitals are likely to have better supplies . Hospitals and other medical services may be affected by fuel shortages and power cuts. See Coronavirus
If you need emergency medical assistance during your trip, dial 011 2691111 and ask for an ambulance or dial 1990. You should contact your insurance/medical assistance company promptly if you are referred to a medical facility for treatment.
Emergency medical treatment isn’t easily available outside main cities, and you may have to be brought to Colombo for treatment. Fuel shortages may delay your ability to access emergency services. Medical facilities are not always of a standard expected in the UK, particularly outside Colombo. Treatment in private hospitals can be expensive and the options for repatriation to the UK or neighbouring countries in an emergency are limited and very expensive. Make sure you have adequate travel health insurance and accessible funds to cover the cost of any medical treatment abroad and repatriation.
Diseases
All regions of Sri Lanka experience outbreaks of the mosquito-borne dengue fever. You should take steps to avoid being bitten by mosquitoes.
