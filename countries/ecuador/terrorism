Although there’s no recent history of terrorism in Ecuador, attacks can’t be ruled out.
There have been two serious attacks in 2018. The first on 27 January, involved a car bomb detonated outside a police station in San Lorenzo, a town near the Colombian border in the Esmeraldas province. Twenty eight people were injured, and the Ecuadorean government declared a state of emergency in Esmeraldas. A further bomb attack on 20 March in Mataje, also close to the border, left 3 soldiers dead and 11 injured. Both attacks occurred within 20km of the border, an area to which the FCO advises against all travel.
There’s considered to be a heightened threat of terrorist attack globally against UK interests and British nationals, from groups or individuals motivated by conflict in Iraq and Syria. You should be vigilant at this time.
