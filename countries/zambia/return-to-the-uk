There remain commercial options to return to the UK from Zambia.
If you live in the UK and are currently visiting Zambia, you’re strongly advised to return now by commercial means. Don’t run the risk of getting stranded.
UK special charter flights will only operate for priority countries where commercial flights are not possible. You should not assume that these flights will become available in countries where commercial routes are operating. Please do not contact the contracted travel management company if no flight is advertised here.
Flights
Currently the only international flight option from Zambia is on Ethiopian Airways to Addis Ababa. As of 1 April, there are four flights a week between Lusaka and Addis Ababa. The flight schedule is subject to change, and flights may be cancelled if there are insufficient passengers. You should check the Ethiopia travel advice for guidance on transiting through Addis Ababa.
