This section has safety advice for regions of Guatemala. It only covers regions where FCDO has specific advice.
You should also read FCDO’s overall travel advice and safety and security advice.
Borders with Mexico, Honduras, El Salvador and Belize
Pay particular attention to your security in the border areas with Mexico, Honduras, El Salvador and Belize.
Take care near the Belize-Guatemala border because of the ongoing dispute between the 2 countries. Use only officially recognised border crossings.
Ixchiguan and Tajumulco
There is a risk of violence crime in the municipalities of Ixchiguan and Tajumulco in the department of San Marcos. Get advice from PROATUR, Guatemala’s tourist assistance service (see Getting help) if you plan to travel to these areas, including whether it is safe to climb the Tajumulco volcano.
Roads around Sololá, Panajachel and Lake Atitlán
PROATUR (see Getting help) gives advice on which routes to take when travelling in and around Sololá, Panajachel and Lake Atitlán. Avoid the Godinez bypass between Guatemala City and Panajachel (passing through Patzún). Use the Pan American Highway to Sololá instead. Also avoid the road between Cocales (Suchitepequez) and San Lucas Toliman (Atitlán) if possible. 
Boat services between towns on the shore of Lake Atitlán may be a safer alternative.
