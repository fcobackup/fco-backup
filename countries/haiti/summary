There have been sporadic, unpredictable and sometimes violent demonstrations, protests and roadblocks throughout Haiti since July 2018, with a notable increase in civil unrest since September 2019. The movement of goods and people into and within the country is often disrupted due to blocked roads and security incidents. As a consequence, there are sometimes fuel and food shortages. There are currently no UK diplomats in country.
Consular support is not available from the British Embassy in Haiti. If you are in Haiti and need help, you should contact the British Embassy in Santo Domingo, Dominican Republic. Our ability to offer consular support in Haiti from Santo Domingo is limited.
