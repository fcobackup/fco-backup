This page has information on travelling to Georgia. Check what you must do to return to the UK.
This page reflects the UK government’s understanding of current rules for people travelling on a full ‘British Citizen’ passport, for the most common types of travel.
The authorities in Georgia set and enforce entry rules.
All travellers
The Foreign Ministry website is regularly updated with details of the latest entry requirements.
If you’re fully vaccinated
If you’re fully vaccinated, you can enter Georgia by air without needing to test or quarantine. You will need to present a COVID-19 vaccine certificate confirming receipt of two full doses of the vaccine (or one dose in the case of Johnson & Johnson). If you arrive by land or sea, you will additionally need to present a negative PCR test taken within the previous 72 hours.
Find out if you qualify as fully vaccinated in Georgia on The Foreign Ministry website.
You should not use the NHS testing services to get a test in order to facilitate your travel to another country. You should arrange to take a private test.
Proof of vaccination status
Georgia will accept the UK’s proof of COVID-19 recovery and vaccination record and proof of COVID-19 vaccination issued in the Crown Dependencies. Your final vaccine dose must have been administered at least 14 days prior to travel. Your NHS appointment card from vaccination centres is not designed to be used as proof of vaccination and should not be used to demonstrate your vaccine status.
Residents of Georgia can also use a COVID-19 Green Pass issued by the National Centre for Disease Control (NCDC) to demonstrate their vaccine status.
If you’re not fully vaccinated
If you’re not fully vaccinated, you can enter Georgia provided your travel to Georgia originates in the UK or one of the other countries listed on the Ministry of Foreign Affairs website. You must submit a travel history in advance (complete an application form online), present a negative PCR test taken within the previous 72 hours and take a further PCR test at your own expense on your third day in Georgia.
If you’ve had COVID-19 in the last six months
If you present proof of having been infected with COVID within the previous 100 days and have had the first jab in a two-dose vaccination process, you do not need to test or quarantine to enter Georgia if you arrive by air. If you arrive by land or sea, you will need to present a negative PCR test taken within the previous 72 hours.
If you were infected more than 100 days previously or have no proof of recovery or vaccination status, you can enter Georgia provided your travel to Georgia originates in the UK or one of the other countries listed on the Foreign Ministry’s website. You must submit a travel history in advance, present on arrival a negative PCR test taken within the previous 72 hours and take a further PCR test at your own expense on your third day in Georgia.
Children and young people
Children aged 9 and under follow the rules for fully vaccinated travellers to enter Georgia and are exempted from any PCR tests.
If you’re transiting Georgia
There are no separate rules for transiting Georgia. You should follow the regulations outlined above depending on your vaccination status.
Exemptions
There are no exemptions to Georgia’s entry requirements.
Check your passport and travel documents before you travel
Passport validity
If you are visiting Georgia, your passport should be valid for at least six months from the date you arrive.
The agreement by the Georgian Government to recognise as valid for residence and visa purposes UK passports of British residents in Georgia that expired after 6 January 2020 or had less than six months’ validity when presented, has now expired.
If you are in Georgia, and your passport has expired, you should apply for a new full validity UK passport. Please use this guidance to complete the application form and submit it at the Visa Application Centre in Tbilisi. If your passport has expired and you need to travel urgently you may be eligible for an Emergency Travel Document. Please follow the passport guidance linked above for more information.
Check with your travel provider to make sure your passport and other travel documents meet their requirements.
Visas
British nationals do not need a visa to enter Georgia for visits of up to one year. If you wish to stay for longer, you would need to apply for a longer term visa category. Contact the Embassy of Georgia in London or visit the Georgian Ministry of Foreign Affairs website for more details on entry requirements.
If you are in Georgia for more than 183 days and take up any form of paid employment, you are automatically liable for income tax and must inform the Revenue Service of your employment, whether you are on a visitor’s permit or officially resident. Non-compliance will be fined.
Travel insurance
Make sure you have a valid travel insurance policy as you may be asked to provide evidence of this by your airline at check-in or by the immigration authorities upon arrival in Georgia. You may face difficulties if you cannot provide evidence of valid travel insurance.
Travelling with medicines
Georgia has a very strict anti-drugs policy, which can also cover prescription and non-prescription drugs or medicines, otherwise commonly available in the UK and the European Union. For example, non-prescription medicines containing codeine are illegal in Georgia. This can cause serious problems for travellers and in some cases lead to administrative and criminal proceedings. For further information on the legal status of a specific medicine, please contact your nearest Embassy of Georgia.
If you intend to travel with prescription medicine, you must carry a doctor’s prescription and ideally the original packaging. See Health.
UK Emergency Travel Documents
UK Emergency Travel Documents are accepted for entry, airside transit and exit from Georgia.
