Coronavirus guidance is being updated.
Read the Prime Minister’s statement for the latest information.

The information on this page covers the most common types of travel and reflects the UK government’s understanding of the rules currently in place. Unless otherwise stated, this information is for travellers using a full ‘British Citizen’ passport.
The authorities in the country or territory you’re travelling to are responsible for setting and enforcing the rules for entry. If you’re unclear about any aspect of the entry requirements, or you need further reassurance, you’ll need to contact the embassy, high commission or consulate of the country or territory you’re travelling to.
You should also consider checking with your transport provider or travel company to make sure your passport and other travel documents meet their requirements.
Restrictions in response to coronavirus
Entry
The New Zealand border is currently closed to almost all arrivals.
New Zealand citizens and residents returning to New Zealand may travel to New Zealand and do not need any formal exemption.
There are a small number of additional, limited exceptions to the ban on travelling to and entering New Zealand. The following people should seek approval from Immigration New Zealand (INZ) using the limited exceptions process:
Partners, dependent children (aged 24 years and under) and legal guardians of New Zealand citizens and residents.
Australian citizens and permanent residents who normally live in New Zealand
Essential health workers
Other essential workers who are specifically agreed to by the New Zealand Government
Samoan and Tongan citizens making essential travel
New Zealand-based partners and dependent children (aged 19 years and under) of a work or student visa holder who is in New Zealand
Critical humanitarian travel
Maritime crew
On 12 June, the Government introduced short term and long-term criteria for “Other Essential Workers” requests. Further information on the criteria, as well as full details of the current border closures and exceptions can be found on the INZ website. The website also includes information on how to submit a request for travel to New Zealand. A request for approval to travel to New Zealand can take up to two days to process.
On 9 April 2020, the Government announced that anyone entering the country will be required to undergo quarantine or managed isolation in an approved facility for a minimum of 14 days. Visit the New Zealand Ministry of Health website for more information.
On 3 June 2020, the Government indicated that everyone crossing the border would soon be required to undergo a COVID-19 test. The Government will provide further detail in due course.
Transit via New Zealand
There is a general suspension on transit through New Zealand. However, on 9 April 2020, the UK and New Zealand governments agreed a reciprocal transit arrangement. This permits British citizens and residents to transit through New Zealand airports within a 24-hour window. Conditions apply.
There are limits to which countries passengers can transit through after leaving New Zealand in order to reach their final destination. These are countries with which the New Zealand government has received a written undertaking that transits are permitted. This includes the United States of America, Canada, the United Kingdom, Switzerland, and Chile. The New Zealand government is working on establishing similar arrangements with other major transit hubs.
Given the current general suspension on transit through New Zealand, some travellers may find when checking in at point of departure that there is an initial ‘denial of boarding’. Should this happen, the check-in staff will be instructed to contact New Zealand Border Authorities. British nationals, so long as there is no other reason why boarding should be denied, will see this initial denial overridden and check-in should be able to be completed.
Onward travel to the Cook Islands
There have been no confirmed cases of coronavirus (COVID-19) in the Cook Islands, Tokelau, or Niue. The borders of the Cook Islands are open to all Cook Islanders and Cook Islands Permit Holders, who have been present in New Zealand for at least 30 days and whose main purpose of travel is to return home, or to take up or resume employment. Exemptions to the 30 day period can be sought from the Cook Islands Ministry of Immigration and Foreign Affairs. Further details on the conditions are available on the Cook Islands Covid-19 website.
The borders of the Cook Islands remain closed to all others, with a few exemptions. Exemption details are listed on the Cook Islands Covid-19 website and include persons ordinarily resident in the Cook Islands who are Cook Islanders, New Zealand passport holders, New Zealand permanent resident holders, Cook Islands work permit holders, or Cook Islands resident permit holders. Anyone seeking entry must obtain an exemption from the entry ban from the Cook Islands Ministry of Health.
Regular entry requirements
Visas
You don’t need a visa to enter New Zealand as a visitor for up to 6 months, but you will need to get a New Zealand Electronic Travel Authority (NZeTA) before you travel. The New Zealand Government has though introduced a temporary border closure at this time.
The NZeTA costs NZD $9 if applying via the dedicated mobile app, or NZD $12 if completed online. You will also need to pay an International Visitor Conservation and Tourism Levy (IVL) of NZD $35 when you apply. Once issued, the NZeTA is valid for up to two years. The New Zealand immigration authorities recommend that applicants allow up to 72 hours for processing.
On arrival in New Zealand, you will also need to satisfy the Immigration Officer that you meet the criteria for visa-free entry, which includes having an onward ticket and sufficient funds to support you during your stay. You can check the full criteria on the New Zealand Immigration website. The New Zealand Government has though introduced a temporary border closure at this time.
New Zealand’s immigration rules are strict, particularly regarding employment. Visitors cannot work in New Zealand.
For more information about visas, visit the New Zealand Immigration website or contact the nearest New Zealand High Commission.
Passport validity
Your passport should be valid for a minimum period of three months from the date of exit from New Zealand.
UK Emergency Travel Documents
UK Emergency Travel Documents (ETDs) are valid for entry into New Zealand when accompanied by a permanent residence, work or study visa. ETDs are accepted for holidaymakers as long as New Zealand is not the final destination. ETDs are also accepted for airside transit and exit from New Zealand.
Quarantine and bio security
New Zealand has very strict bio-security regulations. It is illegal to import most foodstuffs (meat and meat products, honey, fruit, dairy produce) and strict penalties are handed out to those breaking these rules. Take care when importing wood products, golf clubs, footwear, tents, fishing equipment and items made from animal skin. The immigration arrivals card has full details. If in doubt, declare items to a Ministry of Agriculture official or dump them in one of the bins available at the airport. Failure to comply with these regulations can result in a heavy fine of up to $100,000 or imprisonment.
Medication
There are some restrictions on bringing medication into New Zealand. Visit the New Zealand Customs website for more information. If you arrive in New Zealand with any prescription medicines, you must declare it on your passenger arrival card.
Yellow fever certificate requirements
If you’re travelling to the island of Niue, check whether you need a yellow fever certificate by visiting the National Travel Health Network and Centre’s TravelHealthPro website.
