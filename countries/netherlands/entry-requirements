This information is for people travelling on a full ‘British citizen’ passport from the UK. It is based on the UK government’s understanding of the Netherlands’ current rules for the most common types of travel.
The authorities in the Netherlands set and enforce entry rules. If you’re not sure how these requirements apply to you, contact the Netherlands Embassy in the UK.
COVID-19 rules
There are no COVID-19 testing or vaccination requirements for travellers entering the Netherlands. 
Passport validity requirements
The Netherlands follows Schengen area rules. Your passport must: 
have a ‘date of issue’ less than 10 years before the date you arrive – if you renewed your passport before 1 October 2018, it may have a date of issue that is more than 10 years ago
have an ‘expiry date’ at least 3 months after the day you plan to leave the Schengen area
Check with your travel provider that your passport and other travel documents meet requirements. Renew your passport if you need to.  
You will be denied entry if you do not have a valid travel document or try to use a passport that has been reported lost or stolen. 
Visa requirements
You can travel without a visa to the Schengen area, which includes the Netherlands, for up to 90 days in any 180-day period. This applies if you travel:
as a tourist
to visit family or friends
to attend business meetings, cultural or sports events
or for short-term studies or training
The requirements for working in the Netherlands are different.  
If you are travelling to other Schengen countries as well, make sure your whole visit is within the 90-day limit. Visits to Schengen countries within the previous 180 days before you travel count towards your 90 days. If you overstay the 90-day visa-free limit, you may be banned from entering Schengen countries for up to 3 years.
Make sure you get your passport stamped on entry and exit (until November 2024).
If you’re a visitor, border guards will look at your entry and exit stamps to check you have not overstayed the 90-day visa-free limit for the Schengen area.
If your passport is missing a stamp, show evidence of when and where you entered or left the Schengen area (for example, boarding passes or tickets) and ask the border guards to add the date and location in your passport.
See passport stamping if you live in the Netherlands.
Staying longer than 90 days in a 180-day period
To stay longer, you must meet the Dutch government’s entry requirements. Check which type of visa or work permit you need on the Dutch government website.
If you’re in the Netherlands with a residence permit or long-stay visa, this does not count towards your 90-day visa-free limit.
New Schengen entry requirements (planned for November 2024 onwards)
From November 2024, the new EU Entry/Exit System (EES) will start for all non-EU nationals, including British nationals, travelling in or out of the Schengen area. The Schengen area is made up of 29 European countries, 25 of which are EU Member States. The EES is a digital border system which registers non-EU visitors travelling into the Schengen area instead of stamping their passports.
You will need to have your fingerprints and your photo taken when entering the Schengen area. If you enter the Schengen area through Dover, Eurotunnel at Folkestone or St Pancras International, your fingerprints and photo will be taken before you leave the UK. You will also need to provide either your fingerprint or photo on exit.
You may experience longer queues at borders when the new system starts.

Border controls at Germany’s land borders 
A temporary reintroduction of border controls are currently in place at Germany’s land borders. 
See information from The Federal Ministry of the Interior and Community.
Vaccine requirements

Customs rules
There are strict rules about goods you can take into our out of the Netherlands. You must declare anything that may be prohibited or subject to tax or duty.  
Taking food and drink into the Netherlands
You cannot take meat, milk or products containing them into EU countries. There are some exceptions such as powdered baby milk, baby food and special foods or pet feed required for medical reasons. 
Taking money into the Netherlands
Declare cash or travellers cheques if the value is 10,000 euros or more. You will get a certified declaration to show you brought it in with you. If you do not, your money could be seized when you leave.
