On 24 April, the Belgian Government announced plans to gradually relax domestic measures. The Belgian Government publish updates on their website.
Entry and Borders
Entry and exit checks on the Belgian border have been reintroduced, in order to prevent non-essential travel. The Ministry of the Interior has indicated that all travellers to Belgium will be expected to produce either a Belgian ID (residence) card or a letter from their employer to prove that their travel is essential.
Those who are transiting through Belgium should carry valid ID/proof of residence for the destination country and evidence of onward travel. Those who are attempting to travel for non-essential reasons will not be granted entry. Check here for details on what is classified as essential travel.
All international arrivals are being instructed to self-quarantine at home. There are some limited exemptions, notably for passengers transiting Belgium to return to their country of residence. Details are available from the Belgian government.
Local Measures
The Belgian Government has published general information and advice (in English).
Local measures include limiting travel to journeys that are absolutely necessary. Such journeys include:
To buy food
To seek medical care
To exercise
Urgent family reasons including childcare or assisting vulnerable people
Journeys to work where working from home is not possible.
You must respect social distancing requirements at all times, including on public transport.
The wearing of masks is mandatory on public transport and in other public locations where it is not possible to maintain a 1.5 metre distance from others. Further details have been published by the Belgian Government (in English).
There are restrictions on group recreational, cultural and sporting activities. Restaurants (including those inside hotels), nightclubs and bars are closed.
The Belgian Government plans to gradually relax measures in phases, but this is subject to their ongoing assessment of local conditions and it is possible that measures may be reintroduced. You should check Belgian Government advice regularly for the latest detailed information.
Travel operators are restricting their services. British nationals who wish to leave Belgium are advised to contact their travel operator to make arrangements to do so as soon as possible. Find out how to return to the UK from Belgium.
