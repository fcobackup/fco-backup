This page has information on travelling to Togo.
This page reflects the UK government’s understanding of current rules for people travelling on a full ‘British Citizen’ passport from the UK, for the most common types of travel.
The authorities in Togo set and enforce entry rules. If you’re unsure how Togo’s entry requirements apply to you, contact its UK embassy, high commission or consulate.
All travellers
You will need a visa to enter or travel through Togo as a visitor. You are advised to get a visa before travel. Visas issued on arrival in Togo are limited to 7 days and getting an extension can be time-consuming. For more information and advice, contact the Embassy of Togo in London.
If you’re fully vaccinated
Fully vaccinated passengers do not require a PCR test to enter or depart Togo. Departing passengers must complete an online immigration and health form to present to immigration on departure.
Proof of vaccination status
Togo will accept the UK’s digital proof of COVID-19 vaccination record. They will not accept the UK’s letter version or proof of recovery. Your NHS appointment card from vaccination centres is not designed to be used as proof of vaccination and should not be used to demonstrate your vaccine status.
Togolese land borders are open to fully vaccinated travellers.
If you’re not fully vaccinated
Non-vaccinated passengers arriving in Togo must have a negative PCR test result dated no more than 5 days before departure. In addition, at least 24 hours before arrival non-vaccinated passengers (except for transit passengers who remain airside) must complete an online immigration and health form and pay for a PCR COVID-19 test (on the same website) to be taken on arrival at Eyadema Gnassingbe International Airport. The cost of the test is CFA 25,000 payable by credit/debit card or mobile money. You will need a print-out of the electronic receipt to be allowed to board the aircraft.
Travellers must self-isolate at their own accommodation until the second PCR test results are received within 24 to 48 hours by email.
Departing non-vaccinated passengers must complete an online immigration and health form and take a PCR test no more than five days before exit. The cost of the test is CFA 25,000. You will need a print out of the results and receipt to present to be allowed to pass through immigration control and board the aircraft.
