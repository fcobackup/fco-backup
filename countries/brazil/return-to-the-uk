The COVID-19 global pandemic has greatly reduced travel routes between Brazil and the UK. Direct commercial flights ceased on 3 April.
Commercial flight options
There are still a number of scheduled indirect flights to get back to the UK via Europe or the US. We continue to urge any UK tourists still in Brazil to take these options immediately, while they remain available, as their capacity is limited. We will continue to update information on how to return to UK on our Twitter feed.
The following airlines are still operating indirect routes back to the UK from Brazil:
Air France
KLM
Lufthansa
other options may be available.
These details are subject to change and there could be travel restrictions if you are connecting. Please check directly with the airline.
Registering with the British Embassy
The UK Government is working closely with commercial airlines to provide charter flights for British tourists and visitors around the world to return to the UK. Passengers are required to pay, and these are being arranged from countries where individuals are at greatest risk and where no commercial options are available. This does not currently include Brazil.
If you are a British national visiting Brazil, and may need help returning to the UK, please complete this form. British Nationals resident in Brazil should not complete the form.
You will need to pay for your return travel to the UK. If departure options are available but you cannot afford the travel costs and have exhausted all other options for getting funds, you may be eligible to apply for an emergency loan from the government. This is a last resort option and you would need to repay the loan when you are back in the UK.
For more information, you should contact Corporate Travel Management (CTM). CTM are a commercial partner of the FCO and are authorised to administer such loans on behalf of the FCO.
Travelling to the airport
Some domestic flights are also being impacted by travel restrictions and cancellations due to reduced demand. We advise booking your domestic connecting flight on the same ticket as your international flight to the UK, and to allow longer than usual for international connections.
Some passengers have experienced cancellations that have added up to 24 hour delays to their domestic flights. You should also check the status of your flight regularly so that you can rebook an earlier departure if your domestic connecting flight is cancelled.
Road
Some states have put in place restrictions on interstate travel and the situation could change quickly. We advise you check with your tour operator or car hire rental firm before making your journey. See the Safety and Security section.
Your journey home
The National Travel Health Network and Centre (NaTHNaC) provides advice on how to stay safe as you travel by air.
When you arrive back in the UK, follow the guidance for when you return to the UK on steps you should take to protect yourself and others.
There may be restrictions on public transit to airports. We advise checking locally before you travel and allow additional time to reach airports.
If you cannot leave Brazil
If you cannot leave Brazil at this time, see advice on staying in Brazil during coronavirus.
