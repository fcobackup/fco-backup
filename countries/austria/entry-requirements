The information on this page covers the most common types of travel and reflects the UK government’s understanding of the rules currently in place. Unless otherwise stated, this information is for travellers using a full ‘British Citizen’ passport.
The authorities in the country or territory you’re travelling to are responsible for setting and enforcing the rules for entry. If you’re unclear about any aspect of the entry requirements, or you need further reassurance, you’ll need to contact the embassy, high commission or consulate of the country or territory you’re travelling to.
You should also consider checking with your transport provider or travel company to make sure your passport and other travel documents meet their requirements.
Restrictions in response to coronavirus (COVID-19)
Entry to Austria
The Austrian Government has announced that a landing ban will be in place for all flights from the UK until 24 January 2021. This measure has been taken to prevent the spread of COVID-19. Exemptions will be in place for flights operating in the interests of the Austrian Republic; cargo flights; operational flights; ambulance and rescue flights; repatriation flights; aircraft transfer flights; flights transporting seasonal agriculture workers; and flights transporting healthcare and medical personnel.
Passengers wishing to return to the UK from Austria should contact their airlines.
All travellers arriving in Austria from the UK must quarantine for 10 days upon arrival in Austria. You have the option of taking a self-funded PCR or antigen test after 5 days (the day you arrive in Austria counts as day 0). If your result is negative, you will no longer need to stay in quarantine. You must fill out and sign a quarantine form, ideally before you travel. You will have to hand this in upon arrival.
The following exceptions do not need to quarantine:
Anyone transiting through Austria
Anyone commuting across borders for work or regular visits to immediate family and partners
Business travellers, if on entry you can show you have had a negative PCR or antigen test within the last 72 hours
Diplomats accredited to the Republic of Austria or Vienna-based international organisations, if on entry you can show they have had a negative PCR or antigen test within the last 72 hours
Entry to Austria without having to quarantine is possible if you have spent the 10 days preceding travel in a country on the Austrian government’s “Anlage A” list.
You should not use the NHS testing service to get a test in order to facilitate your travel to another country. You should arrange to take a private test.
Transit Austria
If you’re transiting through Austria without a stopover, you do not need a medical certificate if you can prove you are transiting.
Neighbouring countries may be restricting movement across borders and conducting health checks. Check the travel advice for any country you need to travel through.
Regular entry requirements
Visas
The rules for travelling or working in European countries changed on 1 January 2021:
you can to travel to countries in the Schengen area for up to 90 days in any 180-day period without a visa. This applies if you travel as a tourist, to visit family or friends, to attend business meetings, cultural or sports events, or for short-term studies or training
if you are travelling to Austria and other Schengen countries without a visa, make sure your whole visit is within the 90-day limit. Visits to Schengen countries within the previous 180 days before you travel count towards your 90 days
to stay longer, to work or study, for business or for other reasons, you will need to meet the Austrian government’s entry requirements. Check with the Austrian Embassy what type of visa and/or work permit you may need
if you stay in Austria with a visa or permit, this does not count towards your 90-day visa-free limit
Any time you spent in Austria or other Schengen countries before 1 January 2021 does not count towards your 90-day visa-free limit.
At Austrian border control, you may need to use separate lanes from EU, EEA and Swiss citizens when queueing. Your passport may be stamped on entry and exit. You may also need to:
show a return or onward ticket
show you have enough money for your stay
Passport validity
Check your passport is valid for travel before you book your trip, and renew your passport if you do not have enough time left on it.
You must have at least 6 months left on an adult or child passport to travel to most countries in Europe (not including Ireland).
If you renewed your current passport before the previous one expired, extra months may have been added to its expiry date. Any extra months on your passport over 10 years may not count towards the 6 months needed.
Travelling with children
If you are a single parent, or travelling with a child who is not your own, you will need documentary evidence of parental responsibility and a letter of consent. For further information on exactly what will be required at immigration contact the Austrian Embassy in London.
UK Emergency Travel Documents
UK Emergency Travel Documents are accepted for entry, airside transit and exit from Austria.
