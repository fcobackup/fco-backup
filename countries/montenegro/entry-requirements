This page reflects the UK government’s understanding of current rules for people travelling on a full ‘British Citizen’ passport, for the most common types of travel.
The authorities in Montenegro set and enforce entry rules. For further information contact the embassy, high commission or consulate of the country or territory you’re travelling to. You should also consider checking with your transport provider or travel company to make sure your passport and other travel documents meet their requirements.
Entry rules in response to coronavirus (COVID-19)
Entry to Montenegro
British citizens can enter Montenegro across all border crossings with at least one of the following:
a negative PCR test taken within 72 hours of travel
a negative rapid antigen test recognised by the European Commission, taken within 48 hours of arrival
a positive PCR test or rapid antigen test, which is older than 10 days and not older than 180 days since the day of the test, demonstrating recovery from COVID-19
Your most recent vaccine dose (including booster dose) must have been administered not earlier than 6 months prior to travel. See ‘Demonstrating your COVID-19 status’).
Children under the age of 18 do not require a test or proof of vaccination.
Demonstrating your COVID-19 status
Montenegro will accept the UK’s letter version of proof of COVID-19 vaccination record and proof of COVID-19 vaccination issued in the Crown Dependencies. They may not accept digital proof. Your most recent vaccine dose (including booster doses) must have been administered not earlier than 6 months prior to travel. Your NHS appointment card from vaccination centres is not designed to be used as proof of vaccination and should not be used to demonstrate your vaccine status.
Exemptions to providing a test or proof of vaccination
British nationals with temporary or permanent residence permits arriving without a valid test or proof of vaccination can enter Montenegro, but will be required to self-isolate for 10 days. Self-isolation means staying at the family accommodation or other facility, with monitoring of the health condition of that person, as well as all members of his/her family household by a competent epidemiological service, in accordance with the Decision of the Sanitary Inspection. That period can be shortened on day 3 from entry with a negative PCR test.
Land border crossings
Border crossings are open as normal, except border crossing Vuca from Rozaje to Tutin, and border crossing Metaljka from Pljevlja to Cajnice which are only open from 7am to 7pm.
Regular entry requirements
Visas
You can enter Montenegro for short-term stays of up to 90 days without a visa. The Montenegrin law considers “stays of 90 days” as 90 days in total in a 180-day period, counted from the first entry date.
On entering Montenegro, make sure the border police put an entry stamp in your passport. This helps avoid problems related to verifying the length of your stay in the country.
If you are in the UK the Montenegrin Embassy in London will be able to advise on what kind of visa you may need before travel to Montenegro.
If you wish to extend your stay once in Montenegro, you will need to apply for a visa or a temporary residence permit from the Montenegrin Ministry of Interior Affairs no later than one week before the 90-day period expires.
Passport validity
Your passport should be undamaged and in accordance with local law should be issued in the last 10 years and valid for at least 3 months after your planned date of departure from Montenegro.
If you hold dual citizenship, the Montenegrin authorities will consider you a citizen of the issuing state of the passport with which you entered Montenegro.
Border crossings
Only enter Montenegro through recognised border crossings.
If you are planning a mountaineering tour which involves crossing borders other than at an official border crossing point, contact the National Tourist Organisation for advice.
There may be additional delays on roads approaching the border crossings between Montenegro and neighbouring countries, given coronavirus-related restrictions. See Staying during Coronavirus section for further details.
Registration
By law you must register with the local police or tourism organisation in the town/city where you are staying within 24 hours of your arrival in Montenegro, unless you are staying in a hotel or other commercial accommodation where you’ll be registered automatically on checking in.
If you do not register you may be fined, detained or face a court appearance.
Customs requirements
The Montenegro Customs Administration advises travellers of the main regulations regarding import of food, medicines, flora and fauna species, animals, tobacco and alcoholic beverages and firearms, in their downloadable guide.
Although there is no limit to the amount of money you can bring into Montenegro, you should declare sums of money in excess of €10,000 (including travellers’ cheques or equivalent in other currencies). To take more than €10,000 out of the country you will need to provide proof that you brought the money in. Customs Officers at all border points issue declaration forms. On departure, you will need to return a certified copy of this declaration to customs. For sums of money in excess of €15,000 you should also have obtained a document which states the origin of the funds. If you fail to comply with these rules, your money may be confiscated.
To avoid customs charges, declare items of value like expensive jewellery, photographic and computer equipment.
UK Emergency Travel Documents
UK Emergency Travel Documents are accepted by Montenegrin authorities for entry, airside transit and exit from Montenegro and are valid forms of identity documents in Montenegro.
