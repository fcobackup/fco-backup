Travel in Costa Rica
The use of private vehicles is currently restricted for the entire country. Restrictions vary as the COVID-19 risk levels change. The restrictions are usually based on the last number of the licence plate. You should check local information.
You can drive in Costa Rica on a UK Driving Licence or an International Driving Permit while visiting as a tourist (max 90 days). Due to COVID-19, those who entered the country between 17 December 2019 and 30 November 2020, have had their permission to use a UK Driving Licence extended until 2 March 2021.
If resident for longer periods, you may need to obtain a Costa Rican licence. Drivers should produce their licence and passport if requested to do so by a police officer.
There is a requirement for use of face masks on public transport, which can vary with COVID-19 risk levels. Check official information.
The supply of hire cars may be reduced, as rental companies have been asked to lend their vehicles for deliveries of medical equipment and goods. Public transport is operational with some restrictions. Taxis can operate at all hours.
Accommodation
You should find accommodation that is suitable for your needs. Hotels and many other types of establishment are now being allowed to operate at varying levels of capacity (at 50 or 100%) depending on the level of COVID-19 alert in their location. Check Local Information. For tourist advice, including accommodation and travel, call +506-2299-5827 or via WhatsApp messaging at +506-8628-3247.

Healthcare in Costa Rica

To find a pharmacy (“farmacia”) look for one of the big national chains such as Farmacia Fischel, Farmacia Sucre, FarmaValue, Farmacia Saba, or Farmacia Santa Lucia, among others; a quick search online should help you to identify the nearest one open.
