The information on this page covers the most common types of travel and reflects the UK government’s understanding of the rules currently in place. Unless otherwise stated, this information is for travellers using a full ‘British Citizen’ passport.
The Senegal authorities have introduced new measures in relation to coronavirus (COVID-19). See Coronavirus.
It is not currently possible to obtain a “carte d’etranger”. If you have been in Senegal for over 3 months Senegalese authorities have told us this should not present a problem if you are trying to leave Senegal, provided that the 3 month period expired after the State of Emergency was put in place (23 March).
The authorities in the country or territory you’re travelling to are responsible for setting and enforcing the rules for entry. If you’re unclear about any aspect of the entry requirements, or you need further reassurance, you’ll need to contact the embassy, high commission or consulate of the country or territory you’re travelling to.
You should also consider checking with your transport provider or travel company to make sure your passport and other travel documents meet their requirements.
Visas
You don’t need a visa to travel to Senegal. If you intend to stay in Senegal for longer than 3 months, you’ll need to register with the local authorities in order to obtain a ‘Carte d’Etranger’ when it is possible to do so.
Passport validity
Your passport should be valid for at least 3 months from the date of entry into Senegal.
Evidence of return or onward travel
You may be refused entry if you don’t have evidence of return or onward travel.
UK Emergency Travel Documents
UK Emergency Travel Documents are accepted for entry into, transit through and exit from Senegal.
