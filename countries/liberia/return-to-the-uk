Liberia’s land borders are closed and international flights are suspended. There are currently no commercial options available to leave Liberia. We know this is concerning for British people trying to leave Liberia. The UK government is working closely with airlines, the Liberian authorities and other governments to make sure options are available for you to return to the UK as soon as possible
If you cannot leave Liberia at this time, see advice on staying in Liberia during coronavirus.
Future options
The Foreign and Commonwealth Office is in contact with airlines, the Liberia authorities and other governments to make sure commercial options for returning to the UK are available as soon as possible.
The government of Liberia intends to reopen the airport for commercial flights from 21 June. This reopening will depend on the Ministry of Health agreeing appropriate protocols for coronavirus prevention. Airlines are unlikely to resume normal scheduled services immediately. If you wish to travel, you should contact your airline or travel agent for confirmation of flight schedules.
This travel advice will be updated when departure options become available.

You will need to pay for your return travel to the UK. If departure options are available but you cannot afford the travel costs and have exhausted all other options for getting funds, you may be eligible to apply for an emergency loan from the government. This is a last resort option and you would need to repay the loan when you are back in the UK. For more information you should contact Corporate Travel Management (CTM). CTM are a commercial partner of the FCO and are authorised to administer such loans on behalf of the FCO.
