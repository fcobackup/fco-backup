Coronavirus travel health
Check the latest information on risk from COVID-19 for mainland Portugal, Madeira and the Azores on the TravelHealthPro website.
See the TravelHealthPro website for further advice on travel abroad and reducing spread of respiratory viruses during the COVID-19 pandemic.
Entry and borders
Mainland Portugal has introduced quarantine for travellers from the UK who are not fully vaccinated. See Entry requirements to find out what you will need to do when you enter Portugal.
Returning to the UK
When you return, you must follow the rules for entering the UK.
You are responsible for organising your own COVID-19 test, in line with UK government testing requirements. Check when you book that the testing service can provide the appropriate COVID-19 test. You will not need a prescription, but you will have to show your passport and confirmed travel bookings.
In Portugal, tests have to be booked in advance and paid for in full. It can take up to 24 hours for the results to be returned.
You can schedule a test at any private clinic in Portugal. Find one near you from this list of approved facilities.
If you are staying in the Algarve, look out for information on testing facilities at the airport on arrival, or find a clinic near you on the Algarve tourist authority’s website. Your hotel may also be able to help you arrange a test in time for your departure.
If you are travelling to Madeira or Porto Santo, you can book your return COVID-19 test after you have uploaded your RT-PCR test for arrival on the Madeira Traveller Registration platform. This test is free of charge and carried out at the hospital in Funchal and health centre in Porto Santo. Alternatively, schedule your own COVID-19 test at one of the clinics listed on the Madeira Tourist Authority website.
If you are travelling to the Azores, book your return COVID-19 test at a clinic on the island where you are staying. Ask your hotel or local tourist office for help in finding a clinic closest to you.
Be prepared for your plans to change
No travel is risk-free during COVID. Countries may further restrict travel or bring in new rules at short notice, for example due to a new COVID-19 variant. Check with your travel company or airline for any transport changes which may delay your journey home.
If you test positive for COVID-19, you will have to self-isolate for 10 days. If you continue to test positive, you may not be able to get a fitness-to-fly certificate. You may also need to seek treatment.
Plan ahead and make sure you:
can access money
understand what your insurance will cover
can make arrangements to extend your stay and be away for longer than planned

Using the beach
At the beach, follow the one-way entry and exit signs and use a mask until you reach your spot on the sand. Use a mask and footwear while using sanitary facilities. Place your sunshade and towel 3m from the next group and keep a social distance of 1.5m when walking along the sand. Before you set off, check the occupancy levels of the beaches near you and avoid the ones that are marked “red” and “amber”.
You can be fined up to €100 if you breach the regulations.
Autonomous Regions of Madeira and the Azores
You should follow the advice of the regional authorities on how best to protect yourself and others. While the state of emergency has ended, some restrictions remain in force. These are different to the mainland.

The Azores
The restrictions in place in the Azores vary from island to island depending on the level of risk. Check the restrictions in place on each island on the Visit Azores official website.
Face coverings
You must wear a face mask in all enclosed spaces. You should wear your face covering when you enter the building and keep it on until you leave. In cafes and restaurants, keep your mask on until you are seated.
You must also wear a face mask while walking along promenades and in other outdoor spaces where it is not possible to maintain a 2m social distance from people outside your family group.
These measures apply to everyone over the age of 10 on mainland Portugal and in the Azores, and from the age of 6 in Madeira and Porto Santo.
You can be fined if you breach the regulations.
Exemptions from wearing a face covering differ in Portugal compared to the UK. You may be exempt from using a face mask both indoors and out on medical grounds. You will have to show a declaration from your doctor as evidence that you have a health condition that prevents you from wearing a face covering. You should observe strict social distancing and limit the time you spend in common areas in enclosed spaces. For further information (in Portuguese) on exemptions, see decree-law 62-A/2020 (Article 3(2).

A PCR test taken within the previous 72 hours
An antigen test taken within the previous 48 hours
A rapid antigen self-test done within the previous 24 hours and certified by a health or pharmaceutical professional
A rapid antigen self-test, verified by management on arrival at your accommodation
This does not apply to children under the age of 12 (i.e up to and including 11), provided they are accompanied by an adult.

COVID-19 vaccines if you live in Portugal
Wherever possible British nationals should aim to be vaccinated in the country where they live. We will update this page when the Portuguese government announces any new information on the national vaccination programme. You can sign up to get email notifications when this page is updated.
Portugal has three vaccination plans. One for the mainland , one for Madeira and Porto Santo and one for the Azores (only available in Portuguese).
The Portuguese national vaccination programme started in December 2020 and is using the Pfizer-BioNTech, AstraZeneca and Janssen (Johnson and Johnson) vaccines. British nationals resident in Portugal who have a permanent or temporary healthcare user’s number are eligible for vaccination.
If you live in mainland Portugal, and you have a healthcare user’s number, you can schedule an appointment to be vaccinated or ask for an electronic ticket to attend a vaccination centre that is operating an “open house” system. Find out more from the health authority’s website (use Google Chrome to access the page in English). Please note that some weekend periods are reserved for specific age groups. If you cannot book an appointment because you are not within the target group, return to the website during the week.
If you live in mainland Portugal, and you do not have a healthcare user’s number, complete this form to get a temporary number and to schedule an appointment. You will need a Portuguese mobile number for this purpose.
If you live in Madeira, check the regional health authority’s website for information on how to register for the vaccine.
If you live in the Azores, use this form to register for the vaccine.
Find out more, including about vaccines that are authorised in the UK or approved by the World Health Organisation, on the COVID-19 vaccines if you live abroad.
If you live in the Lisbon area, use the vaccination centre located in Pavilion 3 at Lisbon University’s Sports Complex, near the Santa Maria Hospital.
Find out more, including about vaccines that are authorised in the UK or approved by the World Health Organisation, on the COVID-19 vaccines if you live abroad.
If you’re a British national living in Portugal, you should seek medical advice from your local healthcare provider. Information about COVID-19 vaccines used in the national programme where you live, including regulatory status, should be available from local authorities.
If you receive your COVID-19 vaccination in Portugal you can get an EU Digital COVID Certificate from the health authorities. It will help facilitate access to activities and services in Portugal, travel within the EU and to the UK. For further information visit the European Commission’s EU Digital COVID Certificate page.
