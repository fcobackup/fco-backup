The High Commission is continuing to carry out essential work including providing 24/7 consular assistance and support to British people in Rwanda.
Rwanda is generally safe and crime levels are relatively low, but street crime does occur. There have been reports of an increase in burglary, theft and mugging in Kigali in recent months. You should take precautions with valuables and remain vigilant. See Crime
The security situation near the border with the Democratic Republic of Congo (DRC) and Burundi remains unstable, and there have been armed attacks in Rwanda’s Nyungwe Forest and Volcanoes National Parks. If you’re travelling near the DRC or Burundi borders, you should be aware of the risk of attacks and Government of Rwanda security operations. Exercise caution and keep up to date with developments on the current situation, including via your tour operator, the local media and this travel advice. See Local travel
In July 2019 the World Health Organisation declared a Public Health Emergency of International Concern (PHEIC) following an outbreak of the Ebola virus in eastern DRC. The Rwandan government has put in place screening procedures for Ebola at all entry points, including land borders and at airports. Specific requirements remain in place for anyone wishing to enter Rwanda from Ebola-affected areas of DRC. See Health
If you’re abroad and you need emergency help from the UK government, contact the nearest British embassy, consulate or high commission.
Although there’s no recent history of terrorism in Rwanda, attacks can’t be ruled out. See Terrorism
