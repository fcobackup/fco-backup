Coronavirus guidance is being updated.
Read the Prime Minister’s statement for the latest information.

There are currently no regularly scheduled commercial options available to return to the UK from Morocco.
If you cannot leave Morocco at this time, see advice on staying in Morocco during coronavirus.
If you are a British national or national of another country normally resident in the UK and wish to return to the UK please send your full details, including name as it appears on your passport, nationality(s), location, email and contact telephone number to morocco@britishsupport.gov.uk . We will add your names to a waiting list and offer options to fly to EU destinations as/when there are available spaces on flights being organised by EU countries.
Flights
The British Embassy-organised commercial flight from Casablanca to London Stansted Airport on Friday 26 June is now fully booked. If you have a confirmed booking, you will receive on 24/25 June an email with details of transport arrangements from muster sites in key cities around Morocco to Casablanca Airport, along with a personalised letter of movement from the Embassy.
Future options
This travel advice will be updated with information on departure options that become available. Sign up for email alerts and follow the British Embassy Rabat on Twitter and Facebook.
You will need to pay for your return travel to the UK. If departure options are available but you cannot afford the travel costs and have exhausted all other options for getting funds, you may be eligible to apply for an emergency loan from the government. This is a last resort option and you would need to repay the loan when you are back in the UK. See the Finance Section below.
Your journey home: re-entering the UK
When you return, you must follow the rules for entering the UK. You:
need to provide your journey and contact details up to 48 hours before you’re due to arrive in the UK
are not allowed to leave the place you’re staying for the first 14 days you’re in the UK except in very limited situations (known as ‘self-isolating’)
See also the list of people who are exempt from the border rules.
The National Travel Health Network and Centre (NaTHNaC) also provides advice on how to stay safe as you travel by air.
