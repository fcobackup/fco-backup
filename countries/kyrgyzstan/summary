Following Parliamentary elections on 4 October large numbers of protesters have gathered in central Bishkek and other cities across the country. It is likely that these demonstrations will continue on subsequent days, and some may become violent. In some cases protesters have clashed with the police and tear gas and rubber bullets have been used. There are some reports of attacks on businesses and the possibility of looting. Vigilantes appear to be working alongside plain clothes police officers to protect property and prevent looting during the night. There are risks of clashes between different groups. You should avoid large crowds and any demonstrations, where possible move to a safe indoor location, and keep a low profile. Follow updates on local media and any instructions from the police or other authorities.
Terrorist attacks in Kyrgyzstan can’t be ruled out. You should be vigilant in public places and follow security advice from the local authorities. See Terrorism.
Take care if you travel to the Oblasts (Provinces) of Osh, Batken and Jalal-Abad. See Local travel
Skirmishes can occur along the disputed Kyrgyz-Tajik border. Previous incidents have involved both civilians and border guards and several have involved firearms. There are also occasional security incidents on the Kyrgyz/Uzbek and Kyrgyz/Kazakh borders. There’s a risk of further localised violence and border closures at any time. You should remain vigilant in border areas and check local media reports before you travel. See Local travel
You should also be aware that Kazakhstan has introduced new visa requirements, and currently has additional entry requirements in place. See the Visas Section of Travel Advice for Kazakhstan for more information.
Following protests in Kyrgyzstan after the Parliamentary elections on 4 October the Uzbek authorities have closed the Kyrgyz border to foreigners, including Kyrgyz citizens. It is possible that other border points could be closed at short notice, so you should check before travelling. Please also check with your airline or travel agent on the status of flights to Kyrgyzstan.
There is a high risk of earthquakes. See Natural Disasters
You must carry your passport, or a notarised copy of it, at all times. See Local laws and customs
Dual nationality isn’t recognised in Kyrgyzstan. If you enter Kyrgyzstan on a Kyrgyz passport and also hold British nationality the British Embassy can only provide very limited consular assistance. In cases of arrest or detention, consular access is unlikely to be granted.
If you’re abroad and you need emergency help from the UK government, contact the nearest British embassy, consulate or high commission.
