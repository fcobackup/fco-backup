Hurricane Oscar
A warning has been issued for Hurricane Oscar, which is expected to make landfall on the north-eastern coast of Cuba late Sunday 20 October. Heavy rainfall could lead to flash flooding in eastern Cuba on Monday and Tuesday. You should monitor updates from the US National Hurricane Center.
Power Outage
Cuba is experiencing a nationwide electrical grid shutdown following the failure of a major power plant. There is no electricity, except for where buildings have functioning generators. There is no information on when power will be restored. Emergency services are expected to continue operating but there are reports of internet and mobile outages. British Nationals should take precautions and monitor local media for updates.
Travel insurance
If you choose to travel, research your destinations and get appropriate travel insurance. Insurance should cover your itinerary, planned activities and expenses in an emergency.
