Political situation
In August 2017, at least 2 people were killed during demonstrations over demands to restore the 1992 constitution and a number of arrests were made. Protests by both the opposition and the government have continued sporadically since then, both in Lomé and across the country, with at least 12 deaths and over 80 people arrested. There have been sporadic outbreaks of violence, particularly in the north around the towns of Mango and Sokodé.
Political dialogue between the government and opposition is ongoing, but a resolution has not yet been reached and further marches and protests, by supporters of the government and opposition, are likely. You should exercise caution during these times, avoid crowds and demonstrations and monitor local media.
Crime
Violent crime, theft and pick-pocketing are common throughout Togo and you should be especially cautious in Lomé along the beach and in the markets. Attacks occur during daylight as well as at night. You should avoid travelling alone where possible, even within Lomé city limits, especially at night. You should be alert to the risk of car-jackings, including through staged accidents. It’s generally better not to resist armed attack.
Scams
British nationals are increasingly being targeted by scam artists operating in West Africa. The scams come in many forms: romance and friendship, business ventures, work and employment opportunities and can pose great financial risk to victims. You should treat with considerable caution any requests for funds, a job offer, a business venture or a face to face meeting from someone you have been in correspondence with over the internet who lives in West Africa.
Local travel
Exit and entry points at borders can be opened and closed at short notice. Be prepared for checks by the local police and military.
Road travel
Driving standards and road conditions in Togo can be poor. Avoid travelling outside towns and cities at night as roads are poorly lit. During the rainy season minor, unpaved roads may become impassable. You should stop at all control points on request, turn on interior vehicle lights and only continue when permission has been given to do so. You may encounter official and unofficial roadblocks.
Take care when using public transport; driving standards and vehicle maintenance are poor.
Sea travel
There have been incidents of piracy and armed robbery against large vessels in Togolese waters and those of neighbouring countries. Mariners should take appropriate precautions.
Swimming
You should take care if you decide to swim in the sea as ocean currents are very strong along the coast. There have been a number of drownings each year.
Consular assistance
The number of British visitors to Togo is low. The main type of incident for which British nationals need consular assistance in Togo is replacing lost and stolen passports. You should carry a photocopy of your passport at all times and keep your passport in a safe place.
Consular support is limited in Togo as there is no British Embassy. The Honorary Consul in Togo can offer limited consular assistance. British nationals should contact the British High Commission in Accra, Ghana who can provide consular support.
