The information on this page covers the most common types of travel and reflects the UK government’s understanding of the rules currently in place. Unless otherwise stated, this information is for travellers using a full ‘British Citizen’ passport.
The authorities in the country or territory you’re travelling to are responsible for setting and enforcing the rules for entry. If you’re unclear about any aspect of the entry requirements, or you need further reassurance, you’ll need to contact the embassy, high commission or consulate of the country or territory you’re travelling to.
You should also consider checking with your transport provider or travel company to make sure your passport and other travel documents meet their requirements.
Restrictions in response to coronavirus
Entry
The Government of Myanmar has suspended all international commercial passenger flights from any of its airports until 31 July. It will then review the situation.
At present Myanmar authorities can offer (reduced) 3 week quarantine arrangements for British nationals arriving in Myanmar on business visas and with a compelling case. A mixture of quarantine and self-isolation measures will apply in addition to medical checks. You or your employer must make your case to your nearest Myanmar Embassy and obtain permission in advance.
These arrangements are subject to change and at short notice.
All business visa arrivals will need to:
Have completed one week quarantine before boarding a flight to Myanmar. This can be verified by an employer’s, doctor’s or self-declaration. You may only leave your place of quarantine in the final 72 hours preceding travel to take a COVID-test.
Be temperature-checked on arrival in Myanmar and provide a “COVID-FREE” certificate issued in the previous 72 hours.
Complete 7 days quarantine in a government facility or government approved hotel (allocated on arrival).
Complete a further 7 days of self-isolation at home at a verifiable address.
Complete a further COVID test conducted by the National Health Laboratory during the second week of quarantine. The cost is MMK 150,000.
All other arrivals will remain subject to 28 days quarantine and must also have a “COVID-FREE” certificate issued in the 72 hours prior to entry.
Before travel, we advise that all visitors check with their nearest Myanmar Embassy to confirm their current visa will allow them entry, or the criteria for obtaining or renewing a visa.
Visas
British Nationals usually resident in Myanmar but currently away with expired business visas, should apply for a single entry business visa at your nearest Myanmar Embassy (with a sponsorship letter from your employer). You should then apply for a long term multi-entry visa in Myanmar when you return.
New tourist visa applications are currently suspended until 31 July.

Passport validity
Your passport should be valid for a minimum period of 6 months from the date of entry into Myanmar. The British Government has advised the Myanmar government of a “virtual six-month extension” for all British passports’ validity.
Yellow fever
Check whether you need a yellow fever certificate by visiting the National Travel Health Network and Centre’s TravelHealthPro website.
UK Emergency Travel Documents
UK Emergency Travel Documents (ETDs) are not valid for entry into Myanmar. However, ETDs are accepted for exit from Myanmar.
