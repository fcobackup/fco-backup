Restrictions in response to coronavirus
Restrictions on entry
Entry to the Czech Republic for UK nationals is limited to those with Czech residency, or residency in Slovakia, Hungary and Austria. If you do not hold residency in any of those countries, you may only enter the Czech Republic for certain purposes, including business, visiting family members, and study at university. Details outlining valid reasons for entry, along with information on the documents you will need to present and the restrictions you will need to follow are available on the website of the Czech Ministry of the Interior (see the second bullet point in section two ‘Conditions for entry to the territory of the Czech Republic and quarantine measures (from 11 May, 2020)’).
If you do not hold residency in the Czech Republic, Slovakia, Hungary or Austria, you will need to provide a valid reason for travel (see the link above) and comply with one of the following three options:
Option 1: Present a negative coronavirus test result on arrival
To follow this option, you must present a negative coronavirus test result on arrival. The test must be no more than four days old and the results should be recorded on the Medical Certificate available on the Ministry of Interior’s website. You will still need to restrict your movement in the Czech Republic to essential journeys only for the first 14 days, but will not need to fully self-isolate.
Option 2: Present a negative test result within 72 hours of arrival
If you enter the Czech Republic without a negative test result, you can choose to take a test within 72 hours of arrival in order to avoid self-isolation requirements. You must register by phone with the public health authority “Hygiene station” (Hygienická stanice) of the region where you will be staying to arrange the test. You can find contacts for Hygiene Stations here.
You must self-isolate until you receive your test results. If the test is negative, you may then leave your accommodation. But, as with option 1, you must restrict your movement within the Czech Republic to essential travel only. A list of testing sites is available here.
Option 3: Self-isolate for 14 days
If you do not take a test, you must still register on arrival by phone with the public health authority “Hygiene station” (Hygienická stanice) of the region where you will be staying, and then self-isolate at a given address for 14 days. You can find contacts for Hygiene Stations here.
For all the above options, there are no restrictions on travelling to your place of residence from the airport or border. You are allowed to use public transport or a taxi. However, you must take responsibility for following social distancing rules.
You will need to show your residency card when boarding flights or an international coach, or when crossing a land border into the Czech Republic. Family reunification is possible, but subject to restrictions. Up to date guidance, including the certificate template with which to present your test results at the border, can be found on the website of the Czech Ministry of Interior.
The Czech government has announced a new system of entry requirements to take effect from 15 June, with different rules for travel from three categories of countries; high, medium and low risk. A list of those countries can be found in Czech on the Ministry of Health website.
The UK has been a designated ‘high risk’ country. From the 15 June, if you have Czech residency, you will be able to travel from the UK to the Czech Republic for any reason, as long as you present a negative Covid-19 test result upon arrival. The test must have been taken in the previous four days. If you do not have a negative test result, you may enter but will be required to self-isolate for fourteen days.
Individuals with Czech residency travelling from countries designated by the Czech Government as ‘medium or low risk’, will be able to enter the Czech Republic for any reason, without a test result and without self-isolating.
Individuals without Czech residency will only be able enter the Czech Republic freely if travelling from countries designated ‘low risk’ by the Czech Government. If travelling from ‘medium or high risk’ countries, you will need to provide a negative test result, taken in the last four days, or self-isolate for fourteen days.
Transit through the Czech Republic from a third country
UK nationals resident in other countries can transit from a third country through the Czech Republic without Czech residency if they have a letter of confirmation from the British Embassy and can demonstrate their purpose is to travel straight back to the UK. Alongside an official letter from the Embassy, those intending to transit the Czech Republic must provide evidence of onward travel and meet the requirements set out below to cover their mouth and nose.
If you would like to transit through the Czech Republic from another country in order to return to the UK, contact the British Embassy in Prague on +420 257 40 2111 (choosing option 1 for English, then option 4 for consular assistance) at least 24 hours before making your journey, to request a letter of confirmation to allow you to transit the Czech Republic. You will need to provide:
full name, date of birth, and passport/ID number for each individual making the journey
intended route, including date, time (approximate) and location of entry to, and exit from, the Czech Republic
number plate of any vehicle to be used to cross the border
flight details for those seeking a flight connection, or intended route for those seeking to drive across the Czech Republic
You should also contact your travel provider to confirm your journey can go ahead.
Further information is available on Ministry of Interior’s website.
