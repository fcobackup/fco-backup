All travellers
If you choose to travel to Syria against FCDO advice, you will need to get a visa and security clearance before you travel.
In June 2013, the Syrian regime issued a law stating that individuals who enter Syrian territories illegally will be punished by a prison sentence of 5 to 10 years and/or a fine of 5 to 10 million Syrian pounds.
If you’re fully vaccinated
If you’re fully vaccinated, you can enter Syria without needing to test but you may be required to isolate.
If you’re not fully vaccinated
If you’re not fully vaccinated, you’ll need to show proof of a negative PCR test (taken no more than 72 hours before entry) when entering Syria. See information on getting a test before entry.
Check your passport and travel documents before you travel
If you are visiting Syria, your passport should be valid for a minimum period of 3 months from the date of entry into Syria – local authorities may ask you to produce a copy of your passport; you should carry a copy with you at all times.
Check with your travel provider to make sure your passport and other travel documents meet their requirements.
Previous travel to Israel
If you have an Israeli stamp in your passport or Emergency Travel Document it is highly likely that you will be refused entry into Syria, regardless of your nationality.
