This advice reflects the UK government’s understanding of current rules for people travelling on a full ‘British citizen’ passport from the UK, for the most common types of travel.
The authorities in Chile set and enforce entry rules. If you’re not sure how these requirements apply to you, contact the Chilean Embassy in the UK.
COVID-19 rules
There are no COVID-19 testing or vaccination requirements for travellers entering Chile.
Passport validity requirements
Your passport should have an ‘expiry date’ after the day you plan to leave Chile.
Check with your travel provider that your passport and other travel documents meet requirements. Renew your passport if you need to.
You will be denied entry if you do not have a valid travel document or try to use a passport that has been reported lost or stolen.
Visa requirements
You can visit Chile for up to 90 days without a visa.
The Chilean immigration authorities will give you a tourist card (‘tarjeta de turismo’), an A5-sized white form. Keep it safe and give it to immigration when you leave the country. If you lose it, Chilean police investigations (PDI) allows you to request a copy online (choose ‘Duplicado de tarjeta de turismo’). You can also go to the nearest PDI office.
To stay longer (to work or study, for business travel or for other reasons), you must meet the Chilean Government’s entry requirements.
Travelling with children
 If you’re travelling with children aged 17 and under, check the website of the Chilean Ministry of Foreign Affairs (website in Spanish) for what documents you need to show.
British-Chilean dual nationality
British-Chilean dual nationals must enter and leave Chile using their Chilean passport. Chilean entry and exit requirements for dual nationals may change without notice. For further information check with the Chilean Embassy in the UK.
Travelling with dual national children
Before a dual national child aged 17 or under leaves Chile, you must get authorisation to travel from a Chilean notary  (‘notaría’) if the child is travelling:
alone
with only one parent or guardian
with friends or relatives
If a child was born in Chile, they must have a Chilean passport to leave the country.
Travelling to Rapa Nui (Easter Island)
To enter Rapa Nui (Easter Island) you must:
complete a Rapa Nui entry form
show a return ticket
show a reservation registered with SERNATUR, the national tourism service (select region ‘Valparaiso’ and comuna ‘Rapa Nui’ to refine your search for accommodation) or an invitation letter from the provincial delegation
Vaccination requirements
At  least 8 weeks before your trip, check the vaccinations and certificates you need in TravelHealthPro’s Chile guide.   
Customs rules
There are strict rules about goods you can take into or out of Chile. You must declare anything that may be prohibited or subject to tax or duty.
