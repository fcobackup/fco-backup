Entry and borders
See Entry requirements to find out what you will need to do when you arrive in Cambodia.
Returning to the UK
When you return, you must follow the rules for entering the UK.
You are responsible for organising your own COVID-19 test, in line with UK government testing requirements. The National Institute of Public Health in Phnom Penh is able to provide a health certificate for travel, other health providers may be available. You can also call the COVID-19 hotline on 119 for advice.
Be prepared for your plans to change
No travel is risk-free during COVID. Countries may further restrict travel or bring in new rules at short notice, for example due to a new COVID-19 variant. Check with your travel company or airline for any transport changes which may delay your journey home.
If you test positive for COVID-19, you may need to stay where you are until you test negative. You may also need to seek treatment there.
Plan ahead and make sure you:
can access money
understand what your insurance will cover
can make arrangements to extend your stay and be away for longer than planned
Travel in Cambodia
On 22 May, the Royal Cambodian Government relaxed COVID-19 measures in Phnom Penh lifting the curfew in yellow zones, and permitting in-restaurant dining and alcohol sales.
The curfew in Siem Reap has been extended until 4 June.
You’re expected to wear a face covering in public places. A fine may be imposed on those that refuse.
Accommodation
Hotel and private rental accommodation is available throughout Cambodia. Some hotels have closed and remain so, and we advise that you contact hotels directly when booking. The majority of hotels will ask to take your temperature on arrival and ask you to complete a declaration in relation to your recent travel history and whether you have any symptoms related to COVID-19.
Some services and facilities in hotels may not be available e.g. leisure facilities.
Public places and services
Many public places and services such as gyms, casinos, karaoke rooms and nightclubs remain closed until further notice. You should contact venues ahead of events.
We strongly recommend that you wear masks, clean your hands and maintain social distancing in all public places.

Many medications that would require a prescription in the UK can be bought over-the-counter in Cambodia. However, you may not find a brand you are familiar with and many pharmacies sell counterfeit or out of date products. The main branch of Pharmacie de la Gare in Phnom Penh can provide medications without a prescription and can deliver medications across the country. Before you travel, you should discuss with your doctor alternative brands of medication for your condition.

COVID-19 vaccines if you live in Cambodia
Wherever possible British nationals should aim to be vaccinated in the country where they live. As further information is available about the national vaccination programme, this page will be updated. Sign up to get email notifications.
The Royal Government of Cambodia has announced that all foreign nationals who are currently residing and working in Cambodia can get vaccinated against COVID-19 at no charge, in accordance with Cambodian COVID-19 Vaccination Plans. There is no need to register with the British Embassy.
If you live in Cambodia, you should follow the process set out by the Royal Government of Cambodia, which will be handled by the Ministry of Labour and Vocational Training (MLVT) or your local authority, depending on your visa status. The vaccination programme covers those with Ordinary Visas (Visa E) and work permits issued by the MLVT. In this case you will need a valid passport, valid visa and valid work permit and should register via your employer, your landlord or building management.
If you hold a different type of visa, including Visa K, foreigners married to Khmer citizens, retirees or another type of legal long term residence, you will need a valid passport and visa to register alongside Khmer Citizens, via the local authority, your landlord or building management.
The vaccination programme in Phnom Penh is being rolled out district by district. You should contact your employer, landlord or building management to confirm which vaccination site you should attend.
It may take time for you to successfully register as processes are implemented. If you do not have a valid visa you should contact the General Department of Immigration to rectify this or consider returning to the UK.
The Medicines and Healthcare Products Regulatory Agency (MHRA) is the UK authority responsible for assessing the safety, quality and efficacy of vaccines. It has authorised the Pfizer/BioNTech, Oxford/AstraZeneca and Moderna vaccines for temporary supply and use in the UK. Find out more about MHRA approval for these vaccines.
British nationals living overseas should seek medical advice from their local healthcare provider in the country where they reside. Information about vaccines used in other national programmes, including regulatory status, should be available from the local authorities. This list of Stringent Regulatory Authorities recognised by the World Health Organisation may also be a useful source of additional information. Find out more information about the COVID-19 vaccines on the World Health Organization COVID-19 vaccines page.
