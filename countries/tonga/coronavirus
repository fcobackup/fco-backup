COVID-19 vaccines if you live in Tonga
Wherever possible British nationals should aim to be vaccinated in the country where they live. As further information is available about the national vaccination programme, this page will be updated. Sign up to get email notifications.
The second phase of the national vaccine rollout began on Thursday 24 June and is expected to continue until 9 July. The Ministry of Health’s schedule is available on their website. This phase of the rollout is mainly focused on administering second doses for those who have already been vaccinated, and people should have received a card with the date for their second dose at the time of their first vaccination. Anyone who has received their first dose but does not know the date for their second dose should contact the Ministry of Health via their website.
People who have not received a first dose yet are encouraged to pre-register for future rollouts of the vaccine on the Ministry of Health’s website.
You should monitor the Tongan Ministry of Health website and Facebook page for more information.
The Medicines and Healthcare Products Regulatory Agency (MHRA) is the UK authority responsible for assessing the safety, quality and efficacy of vaccines. It has authorised the Pfizer/BioNTech, Oxford/AstraZeneca and Moderna vaccines for temporary supply and use in the UK. Find out more about MHRA approval for these vaccines.
British nationals living overseas should seek medical advice from their local healthcare provider in the country where they reside. Information about vaccines used in other national programmes, including regulatory status, should be available from the local authorities. This list of Stringent Regulatory Authorities recognised by the World Health Organisation may also be a useful source of additional information. Find out more information about the COVID-19 vaccines on the World Health Organization COVID-19 vaccines page.
