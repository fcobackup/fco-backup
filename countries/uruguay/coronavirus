International travel
There are commercial options to return to the UK from Uruguay. You should check availability with your travel agent, but options include:
Iberia and Air Europa via Madrid
LATAM via Sao Paulo and Santiago
American Airlines via Miami
Eastern Airlines via Miami
You should check Travel Advice and entry requirements for any country that you will transit on your return. You should have your travel booked to your final destination before starting any journey, as you may not be allowed to board your flight without proof.
You will need a negative PCR test taken no more than 72 hours before your flight before you are allowed to board.
Travelling via Sao Paulo
Air passengers are allowed to freely transit Brazil as long as they do not leave the international airport area and have a ticket for onward travel.
Entry and borders
See Entry requirements to find out what you will need to do when you arrive in Uruguay.
Returning to the UK
When you return, you must follow the rules for entering the UK.
You are responsible for organising your own COVID-19 test, in line with UK government testing requirements.
Be prepared for your plans to change
No travel is risk-free during COVID. Countries may further restrict travel or bring in new rules at short notice, for example due to a new COVID-19 variant. Check with your travel company or airline for any transport changes which may delay your journey home.
If you test positive for COVID-19, you may need to stay where you are until you test negative. You may also need to seek treatment there.
Plan ahead and make sure you:
can access money
understand what your insurance will cover
can make arrangements to extend your stay and be away for longer than planned
