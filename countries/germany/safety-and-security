Crime
Protecting your belongings
Crime levels are similar to the UK. Take sensible precautions to avoid mugging, bag snatching and pickpocketing. Be particularly vigilant at airports, railway stations and crowded public gatherings. Do not leave valuables unattended.
Passport theft
If your passport has been lost or stolen, get a police report from the nearest police station.
Laws and cultural differences
Personal ID
You don’t have to carry your passport with you in Germany. However, if you’re asked to show your passport and don’t have it with you, police may escort you to where your passport is being kept so that you can show it to them.
Outdoor activities and adventure tourism
Skiing and avalanches are a risk in some areas. Always check the local snow and weather conditions when you arrive. Read more information about avalanche risk from the European Avalanche Warning Service.
Transport risks
Road travel
If you are planning to drive in Germany, see information on driving abroad and read the RAC Germany guide.
Licences and permits
You need either a 1968 international driving permit (IDP) or a valid UK driving licence to drive in Germany. The 1949 IDP is not accepted anymore. You cannot buy an IDP outside the UK, so get one before you travel. You can buy an IDP in person from some UK post offices – find your nearest post office branch that offers this service. If you’re driving a vehicle that doesn’t belong to you, you may also need written permission from the registered owner. The minimum age for driving a car in Germany is 18.
Driving a British car abroad
You may need a UK sticker to drive your car outside the UK. These have replaced GB stickers. Check the guidance on displaying number plates if you are driving outside the UK.
The German Federal Transport Ministry has more information on the validity of non-German driving licences.
If you live in Germany, check the Living in Germany guide for information on requirements for residents.
Driving regulations
Some inner city areas have an environmental zone (‘Umweltzone’). Only vehicles that meet specific exhaust emission standards can enter. See the German Environment Agency and Federal Ministry for the Environment, Nature Conservation, Nuclear Safety and Consumer Protection for more information. It is illegal to take part in motor vehicle races or rallies on German roads.
