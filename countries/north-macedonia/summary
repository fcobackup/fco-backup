On 30 December, North Macedonia cancelled a ban on direct flights from the United Kingdom. For further information regarding flights, please contact your travel operator or airlines.
The government also cancelled the requirement for passengers arriving from the UK to self-isolate on the basis of their travel history. No PCR test is required. You may still need to self-isolate for health reasons (if you have coronavirus, if you have had contact with someone with coronavirus, of if you are waiting for the outcome of a PCR test).
The Ministry of Interior has advised that those who are already self-isolating (having arrived from the UK after 20 December) should continue to self-isolate unless the Ministry or government announces otherwise.
There is a general threat from terrorism. There may be increased security in place over the festive period, including at Christmas markets and other major events that might attract large crowds. You should remain vigilant and follow the advice of the local authorities.
On 14 February 2019, the UK government was informed that the Republic of Macedonia was henceforth known as the Republic of North Macedonia.
