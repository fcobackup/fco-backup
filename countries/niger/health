Warning
FCDO advises against all travel to Niger.

Before you travel check that:
your destination can provide the healthcare you may need
you have appropriate travel insurance for local treatment or unexpected medical evacuation
This is particularly important if you have a health condition or are pregnant.
Emergency medical number
Call 15 and ask for an ambulance.
Public emergency services can be slow to respond. Some private medical clinics also have ambulance services.
Contact your insurance company promptly if you’re referred to a medical facility for treatment.
Vaccinations and health risks
At least 8 weeks before your trip check:
the latest information on vaccination recommendations and health risks in TravelHealthPro’s Niger guide
where to get vaccines and whether you have to pay on the NHS travel vaccinations page
Medication
The legal status and regulation of some medicines prescribed or bought in the UK can be different in other countries.
Read best practice when travelling with medicines on TravelHealthPro.
The NHS has information on whether you can take your medicine abroad.
Healthcare facilities in Niger
Medical facilities are poor, even in Niamey. Serious medical treatment would require evacuation to Europe. Make sure you have adequate travel health insurance and accessible funds to cover the cost of any medical treatment abroad and repatriation.
Private hospitals and clinics include:
Polyclinic Magori (+227 2074 1291, or +227 2074 3347 in an emergency)
Clinique Gamkalley (+227 9696 4886, or +227 2073 4639 in an emergency)
Travel and mental health
Read FCDO guidance on travel and mental health. There is also mental health guidance on TravelHealthPro.
