Although there’s no recent history of terrorism in Suriname, attacks can’t be ruled out.
On 24 May 2018 a message, claiming to be from ISIS, was posted on Facebook. The message referenced the trial of 2 defendants on charges of attempting to recruit personnel in Suriname on behalf of ISIS, and threatened reprisals against the University, some schools and the prison holding the defendants. As a precaution, the police and army have been stationed at these locations. You should take sensible precautions, comply with the local authorities and review your own security arrangements.
There’s a heightened threat of terrorist attack globally against UK interests and British nationals, from groups or individuals motivated by the conflict in Iraq and Syria. You should be vigilant at this time.
