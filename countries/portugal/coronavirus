Portugal declared a state of emergency on 18 March. This activated a series of measures including significant restrictions on movement throughout the country. On 30 April, the Portuguese government announced the transition to a state of public calamity and the implementation of a three-stage de-escalation plan to gradually ease current confinement and mobility measures. Starting on 4 May, each stage of the plan will last 2 weeks. Progression through the stages will depend on the continued control of the COVID-19 outbreak in Portugal.
The plan available in Portuguese includes:
Public places and transport
The maintenance of social distancing measures and hand hygiene at all times
The ongoing need for social isolation of anyone with COVID-19 symptoms
The ongoing civic duty to stay at home, except:
- to buy food or other essential times;
- to go to work if unable to work from home;
- to go to hospital or health centres;
- to carry out caring or similar duties or in case of real need;
- to exercise outdoors and at some facilities and to walk pets;
The mandatory use of non-surgical masks in enclosed spaces, such as supermarkets, shops, beauty salons, schools, public services and on public transport.
Public gatherings of more than 10 people are banned. Public transport capacity is limited to two thirds. Public services are accessible by appointment only and attendance at funerals is restricted to family members. When they reopen on 18 May, restaurants, cafes and bars will be limited to 50% capacity.
Campsites and motorhome parks
Campsites and motorhome parks remain closed to tourists and visitors. If you are a permanent resident of a campsite or motorhome park you will not be affected.
Ports and vessels
Cruise ships can berth at ports on mainland Portugal, but passengers can only disembark if they are Portuguese nationals or residents. Recreational vessels and private yachts are still not permitted to dock, except for refuelling or taking on supplies. Passengers may only disembark to return to their country of origin and once they have completed 14 days’ self-quarantine on board, starting from the day the vessel entered Portuguese territorial waters.
Madeira and the Azores
The regional governments of Madeira and the Azores have announced similar de-escalation measures starting on 4 May. They continue to recommend against all but essential travel to and from the archipelagos until further notice. If you are travelling to these regions you will still be subject to health screening and mandatory quarantine for a period of 14 days. If you are travelling to Madeira, complete and submit this online form 24-48 hours before arrival. If you are travelling to the Azores, complete and submit this form 24-48 hours before arrival.
Mobility between municipalities on the island of São Miguel will continue to be restricted until further notice, except:
to buy food or other essential items
to go to work (and provided you have an explanatory letter from your employer)
to go to hospital or health centres
to carry out caring or similar duties or in case of real need
Cruise ships and yachts will not be permitted to dock at any of the ports in Madeira, Porto Santo or the Azores.
