If you’re planning to return to the UK from Myanmar, for information on flights and what you’ll need to do to meet UK entry rules before you leave. While Myanmar’s international airports are closed to standard commercial flights, passengers can still buy tickets for special relief flights until 17 April. Flights cannot be booked online but can be booked direct with the airlines or travel agent. Flight connections to the UK can be affected at short notice by COVID-19 restrictions being imposed on countries through which you may need to transit.
Flights
The Myanmar DCA (Department of Civil Aviation) announced on 30 May 2020 that in order to effectively control the spread of COVID-19 and its variants it would stop all commercial flights. In March 2022 it announced commercial flights would resume on 17 April 2022. In the meantime Yangon’s airport remains open and there are several weekly ‘relief flights’ operating to hub airports across South East Asia. Most of these are commercially bookable, either direct with the airlines or through a travel agent. Flight connections to the UK can be affected at short notice by COVID-19 restrictions being imposed on countries through which you may need to transit.
It is important that you book early. From 21 May 2021 the Ministry of Transport and Communication has instructed airlines to send the list of all passengers, leaving Myanmar by air, to the Ministry of Foreign Affairs 5 days in advance of the flight.
The airport can be very hot so have plenty of water with you. Wi-Fi is often not available. You should complete all paperwork including your Locator form before you go to the airport. Land borders are currently closed to foreign nationals.
All travellers should check with the embassies of respective transit countries for the latest transit, entry and COVID-19 testing requirements before making ticket purchases.
You should ensure that you meet the baggage allowance restrictions for all your flights, as some travellers have found the allowance on the second leg to be lower than that of the first. If you exceed the allowance on any leg of your journey excess baggage charges will be applied and will only be payable in US dollars.
Your journey home: before you leave Myanmar
It is important to note that airlines and transit locations may have their own requirements for COVID tests and you should check this in advance of travel.
If you do not have a valid British Passport, the British Embassy can issue emergency travel documents or emergency passports should you need to leave the country in the near future. More details can be found on the emergency travel document page.
If you intend to bring a pet back to the UK from Myanmar, you should check the regulations. Your pet will be required to spend four months in quarantine on arrival in the UK due to rabies controls. The only exception to this requirement would be if the pet has been vaccinated against rabies at least three months before travelling and has proof of a positive titre test.
The National Travel Health Network and Centre (NaTHNaC) provides advice on how to stay safe as you travel by air.
