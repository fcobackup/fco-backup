Coronavirus travel health
Myanmar is currently experiencing a surge in COVID-19 cases. Check the latest information on risk from COVID-19 for Myanmar on the TravelHealthPro website
See the TravelHealthPro website for further advice on travel abroad and reducing spread of respiratory viruses during the COVID-19 pandemic.
International travel
As of 1 February 2021, Myanmar’s airports have been shut to regular commercial air services until the end of September. Several relief flights however continue to operate and can be booked commercially. Flights cannot be booked online but can be booked direct with the airlines or travel agent. Neighbouring countries have also closed their land borders to Myanmar. Singapore has stopped all passengers from Myanmar from transiting the country. For further information, see Return to the UK.
Residents of the United Kingdom, or those who have visited the United Kingdom within the previous 14 days, are currently unable to enter Myanmar. Those not travelling from the United Kingdom, including British Nationals, should check the requirements for travel from that country to Myanmar with the relevant Myanmar Embassy or Consulate General.
Entry and borders
See Entry requirements to find out what you will need to do when you arrive in Myanmar.
Returning to the UK
When you return, you must follow the rules for entering the UK.
Be prepared for your plans to change
No travel is risk-free during COVID. Countries may further restrict travel or bring in new rules at short notice, for example due to a new COVID-19 variant. Check with your travel company or airline for any transport changes which may delay your journey home.
If you test positive for COVID-19, you may need to stay where you are until you test negative. You may also need to seek treatment there.
Plan ahead and make sure you:
can access money
understand what your insurance will cover
can make arrangements to extend your stay and be away for longer than planned
Travel in Myanmar
A limited schedule of domestic flights is operating, though the rules for access to these is not clear. You are advised to stay home at night, and minimise movement during the day, avoiding crowds. If you do still attempt to travel domestically, please note that you may encounter checkpoints on your journey. You should contact individual airlines for details, and should comply with all the relevant guidance and regulations while travelling.
In some areas there may be local requirements for visitors from other parts of the country, including the requirement to take a COVID-19 test in advance of travel, and to quarantine on arrival. You should check with local authorities for information on possible local preventative measures.
Some areas in Myanmar are under a state of martial law, whilst others have curfews and ‘Stay at Home’ orders in place. You should ensure you are aware of local rules and restrictions before you travel. Since 13 May 2020, it has been compulsory for anyone going out in public in Myanmar to wear a facemask. Failure to wear one will result in a fine.
It is recommended that foreigners carry:
passport
Form C (immigration document)
Foreigner’s Registration Certificate
Myanmar Driver’s Licence (if you own a car)
a copy of your passport information page
a copy of your Myanmar visa
a copy of your immigration stamp showing when you last entered Myanmar.
Accommodation
There have been reports that some local authorities are carrying out checks to make sure all foreign visitors are staying in registered hotels and guest houses, not in private apartments. This is a requirement under Myanmar law and is a condition of your visa.
Some hotels have reopened but many tourist resorts remain closed.
Public places and services
Restaurants have been told to close or only offer take away or delivery. Some shopping centres require customers to register their details upon entry. You must wear a face mask in all public places.
As a result of the recent military coup in Myanmar, COVID-19 restrictions and policies may change without notice. Many restrictions and policies that existed before the coup have not been formally rescinded. Following the spike in covid cases from June 2021, a number of areas have been placed under ‘stay at home’ orders across Yangon as well as other parts of Myanmar. You are advised to follow local media for updates or with your townships.
Healthcare
If you’re currently in Myanmar and are displaying symptoms of coronavirus, you should consult your healthcare provider.
If you test positive for the virus, you’re highly likely to be transferred to a government quarantine hospital until you have recovered. However, the situation is serious and we are aware that there is very limited possibility, if any, of being referred to a hospital for treatment, whether government or private. If you have underlying health problems you should consider leaving Myanmar as soon as possible. There is a severe shortage of oxygen and a long waiting list for supplies. Whether you have health insurance or not, the shortage of beds means you will not be able to have hospital care. Patients are obliged to use a government facility even if they have private insurance. Patients in government hospitals are expected to make their own arrangements for bringing in food and other essential supplies. Lone travellers will not be allowed out of isolation to buy food or make phone calls.
The coronavirus pandemic is expected to put significant pressure on Myanmar’s medical facilities. They may not be able to offer routine care.
It may be difficult for you to travel to a neighbouring country for medical attention. Most regional centres are refusing COVID patients from Myanmar. You should check your personal arrangements with your healthcare provider.
Prescriptions from the UK are not accepted in Myanmar. Most hospitals, both government and private, have their own pharmacies. A government hospital will provide a prescription for collection at their pharmacy once a patient has been assessed. To attend a private hospital or clinic you must first register, following an assessment any prescription can be collected at the pharmacy on their premises. Pre-COVID, specific foreign medicines unavailable in Myanmar, could be ordered from Bangkok but suppliers are currently unable to transport these medicines due to COVID restrictions. Medication is sourced locally with supplies from India and Europe. It is therefore recommended that anyone on regular medication brings sufficient supplies with them or is able to have their medication couriered from the UK.

COVID-19 vaccines if you live in Myanmar
Information about the vaccine programme in Myanmar is currently quite limited, and the wider political and security situation may affect any planned rollout. As more information becomes clear, this page will be updated.
The Medicines and Healthcare Products Regulatory Agency (MHRA) is the UK authority responsible for assessing the safety, quality and efficacy of vaccines. It has authorised the Pfizer/BioNTech, Oxford/AstraZeneca and Moderna vaccines for temporary supply and use in the UK. Find out more about MHRA approval for these vaccines.
British nationals living overseas should seek medical advice from their local healthcare provider in the country where they reside. Information about vaccines used in other national programmes, including regulatory status, should be available from the local authorities. This list of Stringent Regulatory Authorities recognised by the World Health Organisation may also be a useful source of additional information. Find out more information about the COVID-19 vaccines on the World Health Organization COVID-19 vaccines page.
