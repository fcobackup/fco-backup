Barbados designates the UK as a high-risk country. Travellers from the UK must arrive with a negative PCR test taken by a certified or accredited laboratory within 72 hours of arrival.
On arrival, you will be required to quarantine at government approved facilities (a designated holding hotel or approved villa at your own expense, or a government facility free of charge), and undertake a further test 4-5 days after the first accepted negative test. If this second test is negative you will no longer be subject to quarantine. Check the Barbados Travel Protocols carefully for full details of these requirements.
If you test positive for COVID-19 at any point during your stay in Barbados you will be required to self-isolate until the Barbadian authorities are satisfied you have recovered. This may be undertaken at an approved hotel or villa, at your own expense. See the Barbados Travel Protocols for full details.
If you are notified that you have been in close contact with a positive COVID-19 individual you will be required to quarantine. This may be undertaken at an approved hotel or villa, at your own expense. See the Barbados Travel Protocols for full details.
