Visas
From Friday 20 March the visa exemption scheme will be suspended for one month for all visitors to which it previously applied, including visitors from the UK.
All those who wish to visit Indonesia must obtain a visa from the relevant Indonesian Mission in accordance with the purpose of their visit. Upon application, you must provide a health certificate issued by the relevant health authorities from your respective country.
Health screening and self-isolation
All visitors will also be required to present their health certificate at check-in ahead of any scheduled travel. Failure to present a health certificate may result in you being denied entry or transit in Indonesia. You should comply with any additional screening measures put in place by the authorities.
Upon arrival at Indonesian airports, all visitors must also complete and submit a Health Alert certificate to the Health Quarantine Office.
The Government of Indonesia requires that travellers from countries in which the World Health Organisation (WHO) has evidence of local transmission of COVID-19 should self-isolate for 14 days on arrival in Indonesia.
More information is available regarding coronavirus in Indonesia via the Ministry of Health.
Healthcare
A British national died of COVID-19 on 11 March 2020 in Bali. The standard of local medical care in Indonesia can be poor and some medical tests cannot be done reliably. As the Government of Indonesia announces rising numbers of COVID-19 cases, there is an increasing risk that the healthcare system will come under significant further strain. Access to routine and emergency healthcare may be limited.
Further information
If you need further information about entry requirements, contact the local immigration authorities or the nearest Indonesian Embassy. You should also check with your airline or travel company for the latest information.
