The Foreign and Commonwealth Office (FCO) advise against all travel to:
the provinces of Kasaï, Kasaï Central, Kasaï Oriental, Haut-Uele, Haut Lomami, Ituri, North Kivu (except the city of Goma - see below), South Kivu (except the city of Bukavu - see below), Maniema and Tanganyika in eastern DRC
areas to the west and east of Kananga, including Tshikapa and Mwene-Ditu (as shown on the map)
within 50km of the border with the Central African Republic and South Sudan.
The FCO advise against all but essential travel to:
the city of Goma in North Kivu province
the city of Bukavu in South Kivu province
the districts of N’djili and Kimbanseke in Kinshasa
Presidential elections took place on 30 December 2018, provisional results were announced on 10 January and the new president was inaugurated on 24 January. Opposition candidates have called for peaceful protests against the result.
Public gatherings and demonstrations can be called with little or no notice and can quickly turn violent in DRC. In all instances, you should remain vigilant and be aware of disruptions to journeys around Kinshasa, as well as to and from N’Djili airport. If a demonstration or disturbance takes place, leave quickly and don’t attempt to watch or photograph it.
The security situation in eastern DRC remains unstable. The continued presence of armed groups, military operations against them, intercommunal violence and an influx of refugees from neighbouring countries all contribute to a deterioration in the political, security and humanitarian situation. There are continued reports of kidnappings, including of staff from international NGOs.
Consular support is severely limited in parts of DRC. The lack of infrastructure throughout the country and continued insecurity in eastern DRC often prevent the British Embassy in Kinshasa from being able to extend normal levels of consular assistance to British nationals anywhere in the DRC other than Kinshasa. There are limits to the assistance the FCO can provide in a crisis, depending on the security and transport situation. You should not assume that the FCO will be able to provide assistance to leave the country in the event of serious unrest.

Street crime and robbery, including by individuals posing as plain clothes police, is common. You should avoid using any taxis in DRC. If you must take a taxi, use a privately booked one. Don’t hail taxis in the street. Beware of gangs promising you cut price gold and diamonds. International non-governmental organisations in Kinshasa and Goma have been targeted. Take extra care at night. See Crime

If you’re abroad and you need emergency help from the UK government, contact the nearest British embassy, consulate or high commission.
