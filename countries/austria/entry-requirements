This page has information on travelling to Austria. Check what you must do to return to the UK.
This page reflects the UK government’s understanding of current rules for people travelling on a full ‘British Citizen’ passport, for the most common types of travel.
The authorities in Austria set and enforce entry rules. You can read an English version of the rules from the Austrian transport ministry but it can take time to be updated and translated from the German version. The Austrian embassy in London also has information for travellers..
You should also check with your airline.
All travellers
“3G” entry rules
All travellers must show either proof of full vaccination, recovery from COVID-19 in the past 180 days or a negative test to enter Austria. PCR test results are valid for 72 hours from the time of sampling; Antigen test results are valid for 24 hours. Lateral flow self-tests are not accepted.
Without a negative test result or proof of vaccination/recovery at the time of entry, you must fill in a pre-travel clearance form and enter 10-day quarantine. You can leave quarantine early with a negative PCR test result.
If you’re fully vaccinated
If you’re fully vaccinated you must show proof of this to enter Austria.
Without proof of vaccination at the time of entry, you must fill in a pre-travel clearance form and enter 10-day quarantine. You can leave quarantine early with a negative PCR test result.
Proof of vaccination status
For two-shot vaccines (e.g. AstraZeneca, Pfizer, Moderna), you must show that you received the second injection or a booster no more than 270 days before arrival.
For the Johnson & Johnson vaccine, you must show that you received a booster no more than 270 days before arrival.
Different vaccine validity rules apply once in Austria: two-dose vaccinations are only valid for 180 days (210 days for under 18 year olds). A booster is still valid for 270 days.
Austria will accept the UK’s proof of COVID-19 recovery and vaccination record and proof of COVID-19 vaccination issued in the Crown Dependencies.
Austrian immigration officials will insist on QR codes, as provided by the UK COVID Pass, as proof of vaccinations and boosters, and have denied entry to those without this evidence. Your NHS appointment card from vaccination centres is not designed to be used as proof of full vaccination.
Residents of Austria
Residents of Austria or another EU/EEA state who cannot provide proof of vaccination, recovery or a negative test result must fill in a pre-travel clearance form and enter quarantine for 10 days. You can leave quarantine with a negative PCR test result.
If you’re not fully vaccinated
If you are not fully vaccinated and don’t qualify for exemptions, then you will need to prove recovery or have a negative test.
If you’ve had COVID-19 in the past year
You can enter Austria with proof of recovery from a COVID-19 infection in the past 180 days.
You can use the UK COVID Pass app or the EU Covid Pass to prove recent infection. Printed versions and medical certificates of vaccination or recovery are also accepted. An NHS email/SMS of a positive test is not sufficient to prove recovery.
Children and young people
Children under the age of 12 do not need proof of vaccination/recovery or a test if the adult accompanying them does not need to quarantine.
For anyone born before 1 September 2006, the adult entry rules apply.
If you’re transiting through Austria
For a transit journey without a stopover in Austria, neither a pre-travel clearance nor proof of vaccination/past infection/negative test are required. During transit, you can only make essential stops, such as to refuel or use the toilet. You may need to show proof of your final destination.
Exemptions
There are some exemptions such as for HGV drivers, or for residents but quarantine might be required.
HGV drivers
HGV drivers from the UK entering Austria do not have to show a negative COVID-19 test, proof of vaccination or proof of recovery and do not have to quarantine.
Check your passport and travel documents before you travel
Passport validity
If you are planning to travel to an EU country (except Ireland), or Switzerland, Norway, Iceland, Liechtenstein, Andorra, Monaco, San Marino or Vatican City, you must follow the Schengen area passport requirements.
Your passport must be:
Issued less than 10 years before the date you enter the country (check the ‘date of issue’)
valid for at least 3 months after the day you plan to leave (check the ‘expiry date’)
You must check your passport meets these requirements before you travel. If your passport was issued before 1 October 2018, extra months may have been added to its expiry date.
Contact the embassy of the country you are visiting if you think that your passport does not meet both these requirements. Renew your passport if you need to.
Visas
You can travel to countries in the Schengen area for up to 90 days in any 180-day period without a visa. This applies if you travel as a tourist, to visit family or friends, to attend business meetings, cultural or sports events, or for short-term studies or training.
If you are travelling to Austria and other Schengen countries without a visa, make sure your whole visit is within the 90-day limit. Visits to Schengen countries within the previous 180 days before you travel count towards your 90 days.
To stay longer, to work or study, for business or for other reasons, you will need to meet the Austrian government’s entry requirements. Check with the Austrian Embassy what type of visa and/or work permit you may need.
If you are travelling to Austria for work, read the guidance on visas and permits.
If you stay in Austria with a residence permit or long-stay visa, this does not count towards your 90-day visa-free limit.
Passport stamping
Check your passport is stamped if you enter or exit the Schengen area through Austria as a visitor. Border guards will use passport stamps to check you’re complying with the 90-day visa-free limit for short stays in the Schengen area. If relevant entry or exit stamps are not in your passport, border guards will presume that you have overstayed your visa-free limit.
You can show evidence of when and where you entered or exited the Schengen area, and ask the border guards to add this date and location in your passport. Examples of acceptable evidence include boarding passes and tickets.
You may also need to:
show a return or onward ticket
show you have enough money for your stay
If you are resident in Austria, read our Living in Austria guide for passport stamping information.
Travelling with children
If you are a single parent, or travelling with a child who is not your own, you will need documentary evidence of parental responsibility and a letter of consent. For further information on exactly what will be required at immigration contact the Austrian Embassy in London.
UK Emergency Travel Documents
UK Emergency Travel Documents are accepted for entry, airside transit and exit from Austria.
