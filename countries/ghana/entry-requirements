The information on this page covers the most common types of travel and reflects the UK government’s understanding of the rules currently in place. Unless otherwise stated, this information is for travellers using a full ‘British Citizen’ passport.
The authorities in the country or territory you’re travelling to are responsible for setting and enforcing the rules for entry. If you’re unclear about any aspect of the entry requirements, or you need further reassurance, you’ll need to contact the embassy, high commission or consulate of the country or territory you’re travelling to.
You should also consider checking with your transport provider or travel company to make sure your passport and other travel documents meet their requirements.
Entry rules in response to Coronavirus
Entry to Ghana
Kotoka International Airport is open. Commercial flights are operating to and from Ghana. Check with your travel company for the latest information. Land and sea borders remain closed. COVID-19 protocols at the airport may be subject to change as the new screening process evolves. See the guidance from the Ghana Civil Aviation Authority.
Passengers travelling to Ghana are required to undergo a COVID test 72hrs before departure; complete additional health declaration forms on arrival; and undergo a further COVID test on arrival:
Coronavirus tests before departure
On 21 April the Government of Ghana introduced the mandatory digitisation of all COVID-19 tests for international air travel, with the implementation of the Trusted Travel Scheme. Passengers travelling to Ghana are now required to:
Take a Polymerise Chain Reaction (PCR) COVID test with one of the listed providers within 72 hours of departure. Visit https://africacdc.org/trusted-travel/ for a certified list of providers. You should not use the NHS testing service to get a test in order to facilitate your travel to another country
Create an account at https://trustedtravel.panabios.org/ with the same email address and mobile telephone number you give your PCR test provider. Log on and select check-in; select UK and Ghana as your departure and destination countries; select lab tests (TT); select the matching lab test from the drop down options; click save; provide your flight and passport details as requested; click save to generate a Travel Code (TC); your TC code is then generated for you to copy or download
If your provider is unable to upload your test certificate on your behalf you should enter your TT or BIOMARS code from your PCR certificate, or upload the certificate yourself
We also recommend travelling with hard copy proof of this negative Polymerise Chain Reaction (PCR) COVID-19 test result
Children under the age of 5 are exempt. For passengers who have transited other countries before arriving in Ghana, the first country of departure will be the reference point.
The same arrangements apply to passengers aged 11+ departing from Ghana to the UK, and you may not be allowed to board flights without uploading a certified Polymerise Chain Reaction (PCR) COVID test. Visit https://africacdc.org/trusted-travel/ for a certified list of providers in Ghana. We also recommend travelling with hard copy proof of this negative Polymerise Chain Reaction (PCR) COVID-19 test result, to present on departure.
If the UK is your final destination, check-in staff will also confirm your UK passenger locator form has been completed and that all passengers aged 5+ have evidence of day 2 and 8 tests booked in UK.
Additional forms and checks upon arrival
On arrival to Ghana, passengers are also required by the Government of Ghana to:
Complete an online health declaration form pre-departure. All passengers may also be asked to complete hard copy self-declaration forms on the flight, confirming they are fit to travel and providing details to facilitate contact tracing.
Wear a face-mask throughout their flight and upon landing in Accra.
Undergo a temperature check on arrival.
Take a mandatory COVID-19 test at Kotoka International airport. The test is an antigen fluorescent immunoassay test and it will be conducted before baggage is collected at a cost of $150 per passenger. Payment should be made online prior to boarding. Children under the age of five are exempt.
During busy periods when there may be a large number of passengers disembarking at the same time the testing area may become busy. Test results are normally ready within one hour, depending how busy the airport is. The pre departure area where test results are collected can also get busy. You can check your results online while you wait. Be prepared for additional time to move through and exit the airport.
Quarantine requirements
All arriving passengers should be prepared to comply with Ghana’s COVID-19 Health Protocols. If you test positive for COVID-19 on arrival you will be taken to mandatory quarantine in a Government Health facility. Quarantine and / or medical costs can be expensive so it is important that all passengers arrive with adequate access to financial resources. In these circumstances a PCR test is normally carried out on day two or three. That test result will normally be ready within 48 hours. The quarantine process is managed by Ghana Health Service.
The Government of Ghana also advise that all arrivals should have valid insurance. It is more important than ever to get travel insurance and check it provides sufficient cover. See the FCDO’s guidance on foreign travel insurance.
Transiting Ghana
Transit passengers, except where they will remain in the airport throughout or those who were diverted to Accra for an emergency, will also be subject to mandatory COVID-19 testing as outlined above.
Visas
Ghana hasn’t granted any visa exemptions or extensions for visitors during the pandemic so all British nationals will need to visit the Ghana Immigration Service (GIS) office in person to extend their visas. It isn’t possible to call about an individual case or to book an appointment in advance. Office opening hours are 8 am to 5 pm. The GIS office is off Ako Adjei overpass on Independence Avenue in Accra.
Regular entry requirements
Visas
You need a visa to enter Ghana. Ghana’s UK visa service is operating. Visit the Ghana High Commission website to stay up to date and to make an online application in due course.
Dual nationality
Ghana recognises dual nationality. To avoid visa fees, Ghanaian-British nationals should register with the Interior Ministry in Ghana and get a Dual Nationality card. Production of this card at point of entry into Ghana will indicate that a visa is not required.
Passport validity
Your passport should be valid for a minimum period of 6 months from the date of entry into Ghana.
UK Emergency Travel Documents
UK Emergency Travel Documents (ETDs) are not valid for entry or transit through Ghana. However, ETDs are accepted for exit from Ghana. To leave Ghana on an ETD, you will need to visit the Ghana Immigration Service (GIS) to complete the exit formalities. GIS is located on John Kasavubu Road, Independence Avenue, Accra; Tel: +233 302 224445/221667 or visit the GIS website.
Yellow fever certificate requirements
You will be expected to present a yellow fever certificate on arrival in Ghana.
Volunteering
If you are travelling to work in a volunteer programme or for work experience you should be fully aware of the terms and conditions of your stay and be sure that you will be working for a reputable organisation before you commit yourself to travel.
Residents
If you live in Ghana you should register with the National Identification Authority (NIA) of Ghana and get a non-citizen Ghana card. This applies to:
foreign nationals permanently resident in the country
foreign nationals resident in the country for at least 90 days in any calendar year
foreign nationals aged 6 years and above
A non-citizen Ghana card is required to apply for a residence permit, for admission into educational institutions in Ghana, for all financial transactions including opening a bank account, payment of taxes, registration of sim cards, and applications for public or government services, facilities, approvals and permissions. You can complete this registration process at any one of the following places:
