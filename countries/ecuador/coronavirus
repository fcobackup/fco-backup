Cases of coronavirus (COVID-19) have been confirmed in Ecuador. The Ecuadorean authorities have introduced a number of measures to limit the spread of the virus.

Entry and borders
With effect from 16 March, and throughout April, international arrival flights have been suspended, and foreign nationals are no longer admitted by air, land or sea. The same restriction applied to Ecuadorean nationals and foreign residents from midnight on 16 March. Land borders have also been closed following decisions from the Peruvian and Colombian authorities.
All passengers arriving from abroad before midnight on 15 March were required to fill in a declaration form with their itinerary and specific local contact details, and are subject to mandatory self-isolation for 14 days. This will be at the individual’s own expense, in hotels or private accommodation. The Ministry of Health has published more information on coronavirus protocols that also allows direct messaging with the Ministry (Spanish only).
The National Emergency Operations Committee has confirmed that all airports will be operative for pre-authorised international flights with humanitarian purposes and cargo.
Travel to the Galapagos
All travel to the Galapagos has been suspended with effect from 16 March. However, the Government is working to arrange flights back to mainland Ecuador. A flight option to Quito and Guayaquil is open for Saturday 11 April. Tickets can be purchased through the TAME website.

Visas
The Ministry of Foreign Affairs has confirmed that all tourist visas will be granted automatic extension if they expire while the state of emergency is in place.
Safe passage documents
Authorities are requiring individuals to have a safe passage document when travelling between provinces and to the airport. Email BritishEmbassy.Quito@fco.gov.uk to get a safe passage document. A consular officer will respond as quickly as possible.
It is very important that you carry documents that justify your movement, including a confirmed booking, your passport and the safe passage document referred above. If you do not have a flight booking but want to travel to the airport to try and get a place for a waitlisted flight, please contact the Embassy by email BritishEmbassy.Quito@fco.gov.uk to confirm what documents to bring with you.
Safe passage documents are required for each individual. Once you have filled out the form, you will need to send a copy or photo via email to the Ministry of Foreign Affairs at dcp@cancilleria.gob.ec so they can confirm validity if you are stopped.
Drivers and taxis need to arrange their own safe passage document through the Government website.
Local measures
President Moreno declared a state of emergency on 16 March that will last for 60 days.
All public gatherings are prohibited. All public services, except health, security and risk management, are closed nationwide. Only supermarkets, pharmacies, take-away restaurants, petrol stations and some banks will be open.
All national parks, museums and entertainment centres have been closed until further notice. All school and universities classes are suspended throughout April. Schools in the Andean region will not reopen this semester.
A strict nationwide curfew has been applied since 25 March. This restricts all movement from 2pm to 5am. The province of Guayas (including the city of Guayaquil), which is the most affected by COVID-19, has been declared a National Security Zone, with the Armed Forces responsible for enforcing the curfew. Restrictions will remain the same nationwide until 20 April. Thereafter the Government intends to announce a new traffic light system for restrictions depending on the situation in each Province.
For all of April, inter-province travel is prohibited, which includes travel by bus and in private vehicles.
Journeys should be limited to essential trips, for example to buy food or medicine. From 6 April, new restrictions for private vehicles apply nationwide, as follows:
Licence plates ending in 1 and 2 can circulate on Mondays.
Licence plates ending in 3 and 4 can circulate on Tuesdays.
Licence plates ending in 5 and 6 can circulate on Wednesday.
Licence plates ending in 7 and 8 can circulate on Thursdays.
Licence plates ending in 9 and 0 can circulate on Fridays.
No private car is allowed to circulate on Saturdays and Sundays.
Wearing facemasks in public spaces is now mandatory throughout Ecuador. Fines will be given to those who do not comply. Each city will define the level of its fines. In Quito, fines for not wearing a facemask will be from USD 100 to USD 200. The Mayor of Quito announced additional restrictions on 16 March. Within Quito, all movement in public spaces is prohibited – except for those people buying essential supplies and medicines, health workers and emergency service personnel.
All buses, private vehicles and bicycles are prohibited from circulating, except for the delivery of food and medicines. These measures will apply for 15 days. A safe passage document is not required if you need to buy food and medicine.
You should find secure accommodation while these restrictions remain in force. The Government has emphasised that these measures will be enforced robustly and infringements will be sanctioned. You should ensure you comply, including with self-isolation measures. Check specific details on self-isolation (Spanish only).
