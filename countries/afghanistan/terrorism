Terrorists are very likely to try to carry out attacks in Afghanistan.
UK Counter Terrorism Policing has information and advice on staying safe abroad and what to do in the event of a terrorist attack. Find out more about the global threat from terrorism.
Multiple violent groups operate in Afghanistan that hold strong anti-Western views; this could make any UK interest or person a target. Attacks include bombs (roadside and other), suicide bombs (either on foot or by vehicle), indirect fire (rockets and mortars), direct fire (shootings and rocket propelled grenades), kidnappings and violent crime. Daesh continue to be a serious threat. They are fiercely hostile to the UK and other western countries.
Hotels used by the former government of Afghanistan and western nationals, ministries, military establishments, airports (including Kabul International) and religious sites have been attacked and further attacks are increasingly likely. Installations and life support facilities have been subject to attacks in recent years, specifically for their link to Western countries. Avoid visits to public places frequented by foreigners, including hotels, restaurants, shops and market places, especially at particularly busy and congested times of day. In light of the increased risks you are advised not to stay in hotels, particularly in Kabul (such as the Serena Hotel).
Make sure your accommodation is secure, and review your security measures regularly.
Kidnap
The risk of being kidnapped throughout Afghanistan remains a very high and constant threat. At least 4 foreign nationals have been kidnapped in Kabul since July 2016, some of whom remain in captivity:
in January 2020, an international commercial contractor was kidnapped in Kabul or in a nearby province: the victim remains missing
on 2 August 2018, 3 international workers were killed shortly after kidnap in Kabul
Over 100 westerners have been kidnapped in Afghanistan since 2001, a number of them have been British nationals. The motivation and desire to undertake kidnapping in Afghanistan is likely to continue. You should take the utmost care, vary routines and avoid setting regular patterns of movement. You should take professional security advice while in the country.
Those engaged in tourism, humanitarian aid and some other development work, journalism or business sectors are viewed as legitimate targets. If you are kidnapped, the reason for your presence is unlikely to serve as a protection or secure your safe release.
The long-standing policy of the UK government is not to make substantive concessions to hostage takers. The UK government considers that paying ransoms and releasing prisoners builds the capability of terrorist groups and finances their activities. This can, in turn, increase the risk of further hostage-taking. The Terrorism Act (2000) makes payments to terrorists illegal.
