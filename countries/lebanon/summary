COVID-19 entry restrictions for Lebanon
Before you travel, check the ‘Entry requirements’ section for Lebanon’s current entry restrictions and requirements. These may change with little warning. Monitor this advice for the latest updates and stay in contact with your travel provider.

If you plan to pass through another country to return to the UK, check the travel advice for the country you’re transiting.
Lebanon is experiencing a prolonged and severe economic crisis. The situation is unpredictable and could deteriorate without warning. If you are in Lebanon at this time, or considering travel, you should read our Safety and security page.
Basic commodities (fuel, medicines, food) have become increasingly scarce. Electricity in Lebanon is also very limited. The availability and quality of medical treatment is affected by the economic crisis and fuel shortages. See ‘Shortages’ and ‘Local medical care’ for further information and how to prepare yourself.
Whilst consular assistance is available 24/7 by phone or online, in-person consular support is severely limited in parts of Lebanon where we advise against all travel and limited where we advise against all but essential travel. In the event of deterioration in the political or security situation, the British Embassy may be increasingly limited in the assistance that it can provide. Do not rely on the FCDO being able to evacuate you in an emergency.
If you’re abroad and you need emergency help from the UK government, contact the nearest British embassy, consulate or high commission.
If you’re planning travel to Lebanon, find out what you need to know about coronavirus there in the Coronavirus section. For information about COVID-19 vaccines, see the Coronavirus page.
During the COVID-19 pandemic, it is more important than ever to get travel insurance and check it provides sufficient cover. See the FCDO’s guidance on foreign travel insurance.
Crime, including bag theft, property crime and sexual harassment in public spaces, has increased as a result of the economic decline in Lebanon. This includes in Beirut. See Safety and security.
A conflict with Israel could spark with little warning and lead to a rapid escalation in violence. There have been exchanges with the Israeli Defence Forces across the Blue Line in the South of Lebanon. This has included cross-border shelling, rocket fire and air strikes on Lebanon. See Security situation
Terrorists are very likely to try to carry out attacks in Lebanon. You should be vigilant at all times, avoid crowds and crowded places and follow the advice of the Lebanese authorities. Previous attacks have targeted the security forces, as well as locations where Western visitors may congregate. You should follow the advice of the local authorities, and check local news and this travel advice regularly. See Terrorism
There’s a heightened risk of terrorism against aviation. Additional security measures have been in place on flights departing from Lebanon to the UK since March 2017. You should co-operate fully with security officials.
Groups within Lebanon, including Hizballah, are proscribed under the Terrorism Act 2000 and the Counter Terrorism (Sanctions) (EU Exit) Regulations 2019. Offences committed under the act – including funding and supporting proscribed organisations – may be liable to prosecution in the UK.
On 4 August 2020 a large explosion occurred in the port area of Beirut causing widespread damage to buildings and infrastructure in the city and surrounding areas. Many of the buildings have not been repaired yet. You should exercise caution in affected areas as buildings may not be safe.
On 25 July 2022, the Ministry of Public Health issued a statement warning about the possibility of the collapse of the Beirut grain silos in the Beirut port area. Since this date there have been a number of partial collapses of one of the silos which have emitted clouds of dust into the vicinity. There is a continued risk of further silo collapse and travellers should remain aware. We recommend avoiding the area within 500m of the grain silos; recommend against travel along the Charles Helou Highway in the area around the port (between Beirut River and the George Haddad intersection); and recommend carrying an FFP2 or KN95 mask at all times in Beirut. You should follow the instructions of the security forces. See Safety and security
There is a high risk of forest fires in Lebanon, particularly during the summer months. See Natural disasters
There are unexploded ordnance and land mines in many places. You should avoid travelling away from established paths, especially when hiking. This is particularly a concern in southern Lebanon. See Local travel
