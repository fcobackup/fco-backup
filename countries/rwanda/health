FCDO advises against all but essential travel to parts of Rwanda.

This is particularly important if you have a health condition or are pregnant.
Emergency medical number

Contact your insurance company quickly if you’re referred to a medical facility for treatment.
Vaccine recommendations and health risks
At least 8 weeks before your trip:

Marburg virus disease (MVD)
On 20 December 2024, the Government of Rwanda announced the end of the outbreak of Marburg virus disease that began on 27 September 2024. The outbreak was linked to contact with fruit bats in a mine near Kigali.
The last confirmed case of Marburg virus disease was reported on 30 October 2024. There remains a risk of re-emergence of the disease linked to viral persistence in body fluids of recovered patients and the potential animal reservoir in the country, so if visiting or working in caves inhabited by fruit bat colonies, you should wear gloves and other appropriate protective clothing (including face masks).
Check the latest situation with local authorities before travelling. You can find more information on Marburg virus disease from the WHO, and TravelHealthPro.
