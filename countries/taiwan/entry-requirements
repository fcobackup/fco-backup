This page has information on travelling to Taiwan.
This page reflects the UK government’s understanding of current rules for people travelling on a full ‘British Citizen’ passport from the UK, for the most common types of travel.
Rules to enter Taiwan change frequently. You should keep up to date with the latest information on the websites of the Central Epidemic Command Center, National Immigration Agency, Ministry of Foreign Affairs and the Taipei Representative Office in the UK.
The authorities in Taiwan set and enforce entry rules. If you’re unsure how Taiwan’s entry requirements apply to you, please contact your local Taipei representative office or embassy.
All travellers
On 12 September 2022, Taiwan reinstated visa-exempt entry for British passport holders. British visitors are permitted to spend up to 90 days in Taiwan under this scheme for tourism, international exchanges and business purposes.
If you are unsure whether you are permitted to enter Taiwan, or have further questions about the resumption of the visa-exempt entry scheme, you should contact your local Taipei representative office or embassy before you attempt to travel. Entry procedures are being regularly reviewed so may change at short notice.
Passengers entering Taiwan under the visa-exempt entry scheme will be required to follow the epidemic prevention requirements set out below.
Epidemic prevention requirements for passengers arriving in Taiwan
International arrivals in Taiwan will be expected to observe a 7 day “self-initiated epidemic prevention” period. The authorities will no longer provide a free self-administered rapid COVID-19 test kit for international arrivals. Rapid test kits can still be purchased locally if required. You will only need to take a rapid test if you develop symptoms during your 7 day self-initiated epidemic prevention period.
Passengers arriving in Taiwan from overseas are permitted to take public transport from the airport. You are allowed to leave your accommodation at any time, without needing to take a COVID-19 rapid test during your 7 day self-initiated epidemic prevention period. But you should wear a mask while outside of your accommodation.
You should refer to the Taiwan Centers for Disease Control (CDC) or contact their helpline on 1922 for further information.
Alien Resident Certificate (ARC) and Alien Permanent Resident Certificate (APRC) holders
If you already hold a valid Alien Resident Certificate (ARC) or Alien Permanent Resident Certificate (APRC), you do not require a visa to enter Taiwan. For more information, you should visit the website of the Taiwan Centers for Disease Control (CDC). If you are in Taiwan you can also contact the ‘Information for Foreigners in Taiwan’ helpline on 0800-024-111.
If you are unsure if you are permitted to enter Taiwan, or you have further questions about entry restrictions and conditions, you should contact your local Taipei Representative Office (TRO) or airline before you attempt to travel. Entry procedures are being regularly reviewed, so may change at short notice.
Youth Mobility Scheme Visas
British nationals in Taiwan who hold a Youth Mobility Scheme (YMS) visa are able to apply to switch in Taiwan to a working visa or a visa to study a degree course at undergraduate level or higher.
All applications should be submitted to the Bureau of Consular Affairs (BOCA) for consideration. You will then be able to apply for an Alien Resident Card at your local National Immigration Agency (NIA) Service Center once your application has been approved. You should contact the Bureau of Consular Affairs or National Immigration Agency for further information.
Children and young people
Children under the age of 12 would be subject to the same quarantine requirements as their parents or legal guardians. You can accompany your children if they test positive for COVID-19. Refer to the Taiwan Centers for Diseases Control website or contact their helpline on 1922 for information on testing facilities.

If you’re transiting through Taiwan
Transiting is when you pass through one country or territory on the way to your final destination.
International transits are now permitted at airports in Taiwan. For further information, you should contact your airline.
Check your passport and travel documents before you travel
If you are visiting Taiwan your passport should be valid for 6 months from the date you arrive.
If you are a resident in Taiwan, your passport must be valid for 6 months from the date you arrive.
Check with your travel provider to make sure your passport and other travel documents meet their requirements.
Visas
You may spend up to 90 days in Taiwan without a visa. You can then extend this by a further 90 days once you have entered Taiwan. If you plan to stay in Taiwan for longer than 180 days you must have a visa before you arrive.
Specific rules exist for naturalised British Citizens born in the People’s Republic of China and holders of British National (Overseas) passports wishing to enter under the visa waiver scheme.
If you stay beyond the period of your visa (‘overstay’ your visa), you will be fined and risk being deported from Taiwan.
For further information on entry requirements, contact the Taipei Representative Office in London, 50 Grosvenor Gardens, London, SW1W 0EB, telephone: 020 7881 2650 or in Edinburgh, 1 Melville Street, Edinburgh EH3 7PE, telephone: 01312 206886.
Passport validity
Your passport should be valid for a minimum period of six months from the date of entry into Taiwan.
Customs regulations
You should not enter Taiwan with animal products without prior authorisation as those caught smuggling products may face heavy fines. Due to recent reports of African Swine Fever Virus (ASF) in pork products, particularly from the People’s Republic of China (PRC), local authorities have increased quarantine checks and inspections.
