Borders and travel
The Bulgarian Government has announced severe restrictions on international travel, forbidding entry to British nationals, except for those with permanent or long term residence in Bulgaria. These restrictions remain in place in spite of the recent relaxation of some domestic measures.
Commercial flights are operating at a reduced level. Most land borders are closed for passenger traffic. If you need to travel, plan ahead and before you travel check border information published by the Ministry of Interior (English and Bulgarian).
Local measures
Measures include:
cancellation of cultural and sporting events
closure of many shops, although food shops and pharmacies remain open
closure of most bars and restaurants
closure of schools and universities
a requirement to wear face masks whilst in public indoor areas (i.e. shops) and outside when social distancing is not possible
a ban on groups of more than two adults congregating together
The police are strictly enforcing these measures. Failure to comply could result in a 300 to 1,000 lev (£135-£450) fine.
On 6th May 2020 a number of domestic restrictions have been rescinded. However, note that those relating to entering Bulgaria by land/air/sea still remain in force, see Borders & Travel
