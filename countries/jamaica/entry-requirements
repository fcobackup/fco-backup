The information on this page covers the most common types of travel and reflects the UK government’s understanding of the rules currently in place. Unless otherwise stated, this information is for travellers using a full ‘British Citizen’ passport.
The authorities in the country or territory you’re travelling to are responsible for setting and enforcing the rules for entry. If you’re unclear about any aspect of the entry requirements, or you need further reassurance, you’ll need to contact the embassy, high commission or consulate of the country or territory you’re travelling to.
You should also consider checking with your transport provider or travel company to make sure your passport and other travel documents meet their requirements.
Restrictions in response to coronavirus
Entry to Jamaica
From 1 July, the following measures will apply to travellers to Jamaica:
Prior to checking in for a flight to Jamaica, you must get authorisation to enter from the Visit Jamaica website
Residents and people visiting family or friends need to secure authorisation from the Ministry of Health and Wellness
From 10 July, visitors from high risk places such as Florida, New York, Arizona and Texas will be required to upload a valid Polymerase Chain Reaction (PCR) test result, no more than seven days old. Approval for travel will be subject to the upload of the test result.
Testing and Screening on arrival
All travellers arriving in Jamaica will be tested for Covid-19 and screened for symptoms at the airport.
Quarantine requirements
All travellers arriving in Jamaica will be subject to the following quarantine requirements:
If you are COVID19 symptomatic or test positive upon arrival in Jamaica, you can expect to be confined at an appropriate location, including a Government facility.
If you are a British citizen who is resident in Jamaica, you and your family will be required to observe self-isolation for 14 days at your designated home.
British tourists can expect to be tested for COVID19 upon arrival and spend their time in Jamaica only within the COVID Resilient Zone along the northern coastline resort areas.
Persons who arrive in Jamaica who are not staying at resorts will undergo risk assessments and will be required to make an appointment at a testing location and do a PCR test. They should remain under quarantine orders while they await their test results.
British citizens visiting family or friends in Jamaica will be tested for COVID19 upon arrival. If negative, you will be required to be in quarantine at your intended address for 14 days.
Business travellers can expect to be tested for COVID19 upon arrival at the airport and await the result at a designated hotel or other place. They can conduct their business if the results are negative, observing local protocols.
Regular entry requirements
Visas
British nationals don’t need a visa to visit Jamaica. Visitors are usually granted entry for a maximum of 90 days.
The date by which you must leave Jamaica will be stamped in your passport. If you wish to extend your stay beyond this date you will need to apply to the Jamaican Passport, Immigration and Citizenship Agency. Overstaying without the proper authority can result in detention and/or a fine.
For further information about entry requirements, see the website of the Jamaican High Commission.
Passport validity
Your passport should be valid for the proposed duration of your stay; you don’t need any additional period of validity on your passport beyond this.
UK Emergency Travel Documents
UK Emergency Travel Documents (ETDs) are accepted for entry to and exit from Jamaica. If you’re travelling via the USA using an ETD, you’ll need to get a US visa as ETDs are not valid for entry into the United States under the Visa Waiver Programme (VWP).
Yellow fever certificate requirements
Check whether you need a yellow fever certificate by visiting the National Travel Health Network and Centre’s TravelHealthPro website.
Arrival and departure taxes
Arrival and departure taxes are usually included in the cost of your ticket, but this isn’t always the case for charter flights. Departure tax is US $35 for air passengers. Check with your carrier if you’re unsure whether the tax has been included in your ticket. Landing fees for cruise ship passengers are usually included in the cost of the cruise.
Customs regulations
You can bring local currency (Jamaican dollars) into the country. However, you must declare on your customs form all currencies and monetary instruments over the value of US$10,000.
Personal imports of meat and dairy products from the UK are banned. Customs officials may search baggage and will destroy banned foodstuffs.
