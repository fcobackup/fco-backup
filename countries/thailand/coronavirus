Cases of coronavirus (COVID-19) have been confirmed in Thailand. The Thai authorities have introduced a number of measures to limit the spread of the virus.
Entry and borders
Thailand has introduced additional screening measures for passengers flying to Thailand from all countries. These will apply to passengers travelling to Thailand from all destinations. You should be aware that some scheduled flights are being cancelled and options may become more limited.
All passengers will need to present a medical certificate signed by a medical professional confirming no evidence of the coronavirus infection in the previous 72 hours, and also present evidence of medical insurance of no less than US$100,000 which covers COVID-19. Failure to meet these requirements will mean passengers are not permitted to board their flight even if they are transiting airside to another international destination.
Upon arrival in Thailand, passengers will be asked to present their health certificate and insurance details to disease control officials. Passengers will also need to present a completed T8 form with their name, nationality, passport number, active mobile phone number and e-mail address, or show that they have filled out this same information on the ‘AOT Airport of Thailand’ mobile application. Disease control officials may decide that some passengers be subject to a 14 day quarantine or self-isolation period within Thailand. You are advised to keep up to date with the latest information on boarding procedures on the website of the Civil Aviation Authority of Thailand, and the website of the Ministry of Public Health for information about quarantine and self-isolation procedures.
Due to the uncertainty surrounding the coronavirus situation the British Embassy is currently able to issue a letter to support all applications from British Nationals to extend existing visas, if you need this. If you have a tourist visa you do not need the letter for your first extension, which you can apply for at an immigration office.
Transit passengers
On 25 March the Civil Aviation Authority of Thailand provided an exemption from the above requirements for transit passengers until 2359 on 31 March, Bangkok time. Until that time, transit passengers will be permitted to transit Thailand if they present a ‘Fit to Fly’ health certificate when checking in and remain in designated Thai airport transit areas (for a maximum period of 24 hours).
Almost all of Thailand’s land borders are closed. If you intend to cross overland please check the latest situation.
Thai authorities may introduce further measures. You can monitor the latest updates from Thailand’s Ministry of Public Health on its website, and refer to their Q&A for travellers.
British nationals in Thailand who wish to return to the the UK, should see Returning to the UK for more information.
Social measures
On 17 March, Thai authorities introduced measures that place restrictions on public gatherings, popular tourist events such as full moon parties and Songkran celebrations. On 21 March the Governor of Bangkok announced a further set of restrictions in Bangkok including closing malls and markets from 22 March – 12 April. Supermarkets, pharmacies, sections in malls selling foodstuffs and restaurants offering takeaway service remain open. Many entertainment venues such as pubs and clubs, and educational institutions are already closed. Other provinces have imposed similar restrictions.
On 24 March, Thai authorities announced that an emergency decree will be in force from 26 March for one month. Details of any further restrictions will be released in the coming days. Also on 24 March the Thai authorities introduced instructions that all passengers must wear masks on all trains. You should follow the advice of the authorities.
All British nationals in Thailand are advised to remain up to date with the latest health advice provided by Thailand’s Ministry of Public Health and updates from the Thai Government on the situation.
