Travel in Italy
All travellers entering Italy must comply with the regulations of the region they are visiting. Public transport links may be less frequent and seating limited to comply with social distancing measures. Masks must be worn on board public services. Taxi and car hire options are widely available.
Rail services are returning to their usual timetables, but there are still some reduced domestic services and international travel is limited. Some cross-border bus companies have cancelled their services.
From 15 August, Italian flagged cruise ships can recommence sailings, available to residents of Schengen countries. Passenger ferry schedules remain subject to change and cancellations. Speak to your tour operator or transport provider for the latest information.
More information on all these requirements is available from the Ministry of Foreign Affairs or the European Union’s Re-Open EU page.
Public spaces and services
Italian society has broadly reopened following the initial Coronavirus lockdown, however the following measures are in place:
Social distancing of one metre must be observed.
The use of masks is mandatory in all public spaces, whether outdoors or indoors. You should pay close attention to signage when travelling and carry a mask with you at all times.
Only six people can sit together at a restaurant, bar or café. These venues must close by midnight and from 6pm can only serve customers who are seated at a table.
Some regions have introduced nightly curfews or restrictions on movement; you should check regional websites to see if these will apply to you.
Seating will be preassigned within theatres, cinemas and concert venues and has been limited to permit social distancing.
Dance activity in nightclubs and open air venues has been suspended and parties are not permitted.
Museums and archaeological sites are open but entry must be pre-booked.
Parks are open and outdoor exercise is permitted, subject to social distancing.
Funerals are permitted to take place with limited attendance. Churches can celebrate mass, weddings and baptisms. Receptions following civil and religious ceremonies are limited to 30 people.
Regional authorities in Italy are empowered to adjust these measures in keeping with local requirements; regional differences may therefore apply in addition to the restrictions listed above. Measures may also vary between towns; local mayors were recently given powers to close some public spaces from 9pm if they choose.
Note that many restaurants and venues are asking patrons to provide their name and contact details before using their services.
If you are a British national resident in Italy, we advise carrying proof of your residence in Italy when transiting through airports or other transport hubs.
You can find more information on measures on the Ministry of Health website (in English) and Frequently Asked Questions on the Ministry of Foreign Affairs website (in English).
Healthcare in Italy
