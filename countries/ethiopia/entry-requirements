Warning
FCDO advises against all travel to parts of Ethiopia.

This information is for people travelling on a full ‘British citizen’ passport from the UK. It is based on the UK government’s understanding of Ethiopia’s current rules for the most common types of travel.
The authorities in Ethiopia set and enforce entry rules. If you’re not sure how Ethiopia’s entry requirements apply to you, contact the Ethiopian Embassy in the UK. 
COVID-19 rules
There are no COVID-19 testing or vaccination requirements for passengers entering Ethiopia. 
Passport validity requirements 
Your passport must be: 
valid for at least 6 months from the date you arrive in Ethiopia 
machine-readable 
Visa requirements 
You need a visa and a valid travel document to enter Ethiopia, including a passport or emergency travel document (ETD). Visitors without valid documents can be detained and fined. 
You do not need a visa if you have a valid Ethiopian Diplomatic ID Card, Ethiopian Temporary Residents Permit or Ethiopian Origin ID (Yellow Cards).
Leave the country before your visa expires or get an official extension if needed. The penalty for overstaying is 10 US dollars a day. You will not be allowed to leave until you pay in full.  
Available visa lengths are 30 days or 90 days, with extensions available for an additional 30 or 90 days. 
Applying for a visa  
Get a visa from the official Ethiopian e-visa platform.   
If you visit Ethiopia on a tourist visa, you cannot take employment, including voluntary employment. If you break the rules, you can get heavy fines or be imprisoned. 
Vaccine requirements  
To enter Ethiopia, you must have a certificate to prove you’ve had a yellow fever vaccination if you’re coming from a country listed as a transmission risk.
For full details about medical entry requirements and recommended vaccinations, see TravelHealthPro’s Ethiopia guide..
Customs rules 
There are strict rules about goods that you can take into or out of Ethiopia.
If you plan to take in specialist equipment, the Ethiopian Embassy in London advises you check with your tour operator or local contact before you travel as special customs regulations may apply.  
Contact the Press Office for more information and advice.
Taking money into Ethiopia 
You can carry up to 3,000 Ethiopian birr when entering or leaving Ethiopia. An exception is when travelling to Djibouti from Ethiopia, in which case you can carry up to 10,000 birr. Your cash can be seized and you could get a prison sentence if you go over the limits. 
When you enter or leave Ethiopia, you must declare any cash over 10,000 US dollars (or equivalent in other currencies). Residents of Ethiopia, including resident British nationals, must declare any cash over 4,000 US dollars.
If you leave Ethiopia by airplane with cash above these amounts, you must show the customs declaration form you got when you entered Ethiopia, or the bank advice note if you purchased currency locally.  
If leaving by land with amounts over the stipulated limits, you must show the customs documents given when you arrived in the country. 
If entering Ethiopia through a land border you must declare cash over 500 US dollars (or equivalent). 
Keep your receipt if you change currency into birr. Without a receipt you are unlikely to be able to change leftover money back at the end of your trip.
