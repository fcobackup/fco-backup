Terrorists are very likely to try to carry out attacks in Cameroon, particularly in the Far North region. Attacks could be indiscriminate, including in places visited by foreigners such as restaurants, bars, markets, hotels, shopping centres and places of worship.
It is possible that terrorist groups including Boko Haram and Islamic State West Africa will try to carry out attacks on hotels or public venues in Cameroon including the capital Yaoundé. In recent years, their activities have been concentrated in the Far North.
There is a high threat of terrorist attack globally affecting UK interests and British nationals, including from groups and individuals who view the UK and British nationals as targets. You should remain vigilant at all times.
UK Counter Terrorism Policing has information and advice on staying safe abroad and what to do in the event of a terrorist attack. Find out how to reduce your risk from terrorism while abroad.
Kidnapping
Westerners have previously been kidnapped by Boko Haram in northern Cameroon and there remains a heightened threat of kidnap to western nationals in the region, including in the major cities and along the border between the Far North region and Nigeria. Boko Haram has publicly threatened Cameroon with attacks and kidnappings due to Cameroon’s involvement in the regional fight to counter Boko Haram.
British nationals are viewed as legitimate targets, including those engaged in tourism, humanitarian aid work, journalism or business sectors. If you’re kidnapped, the reason for your presence is unlikely to serve as a protection or secure your safe release.
The long-standing policy of the British Government is not to make substantive concessions to hostage takers. The British Government considers that paying ransoms and releasing prisoners builds the capability of terrorist groups and finances their activities. This can, in turn, increase the risk of further hostage-taking. The Terrorism Act (2000) makes payments to terrorists illegal.
Terrorist groups operating in Cameroon
Boko Haram and Islamic State West Africa
Boko Haram or Jama’at Ahl as-Sunnah lid-Da’wah wa’l-Jihad (JASDJ) is an Islamist terrorist group operating in Nigeria, Cameroon, Chad and Niger. The group aspire to establish a Sharia State in Nigeria and West Africa, de-stabilise the Nigerian government and remove western influence from the country.
In March 2015, Daesh (formerly referred to as ISIL) accepted a pledge of allegiance by Boko Haram. In August 2016, the group split into two factions: Islamic State in West Africa (ISWA) and JASDJ or Boko Haram. ISWA is affiliated with Daesh core in Iraq and Syria and has expressed an intention to target Nigerian government, Christian and western interests. Both Boko Haram and ISWA are active in the north of Cameroon.
