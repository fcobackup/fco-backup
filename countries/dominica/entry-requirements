Entry to Dominica
Borders and the Douglas Charles airport are now open for nationals and non-nationals arriving in Dominica.
Screening on arrival
Arrival protocols are in place. Arriving passengers must complete an online questionnaire 24 hours before arrival, and have a PCR swab test with a negative result taken up to 72 hours before arrival. A thermal test and antibody blood test will be taken on arrival. If either test is positive, then a further PCR swab test will be carried out. This will be at the traveller’s expense. Please refer to the Dominica government’s website for current information on arriving and departing from Dominica.
If positive a mandatory 14 day quarantine will be necessary, self-isolating, in a government facility, or in a certified hotel or guest house.
