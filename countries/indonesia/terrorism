Terrorists are very likely to try to carry out attacks in Indonesia. Terrorist groups have the capacity and intent to carry out attacks at anytime and anywhere in the country. Type of attacks have included suicide bombings and small-arms fire, targeting public and crowded places.
The threat from Islamist extremism remains high, though the Indonesian authorities continue to disrupt attack planning, including arresting alleged terrorists reportedly in the advanced stages of preparation.

On 14 January 2016 a terrorist attack took place near the Sari Pan Pacific Hotel and Sarinah Plaza on Jalan M.H. Thamrin in central Jakarta. The attack included a number of explosions and gun battles. Eight people died and a number were injured, including foreigners. The last major attack before this was on 17 July 2009 when the JW Marriot and Ritz-Carlton hotels in Jakarta were bombed. One British national was killed. Small-scale attacks occur on a regular basis and further attacks are likely.
Indonesian government, law enforcement interests and places of worship are regularly targeted by extremists. Western interests are also at risk.
Attacks could be indiscriminate, including in places frequented by foreigners. Beach resorts, bars and restaurants, hotels, markets, shopping malls hosting major international brand outlets, tourist attractions, places of worship, foreign embassies, ferry terminals and airports are all potential targets.
Be vigilant and take care at all times. You should regularly review your security arrangements and be particularly vigilant during holiday periods including the Christmas and New Year period, Chinese New Year (16 February 2018), Nyepi (Balinese New Year, 17 March 2018), Easter and Independence Day (17 August) which can be a time of heightened tension and increased risk.
There is a risk of kidnapping at sea in and around the waters of Indonesia. This risk is higher in the Sulu and Celebes seas.
The long-standing policy of the British government is not to make substantive concessions to hostage takers. The British government considers that paying ransoms and releasing prisoners increases the risk of further hostage taking.
There is considered to be a heightened threat of terrorist attack globally against UK interests and British nationals, from groups or individuals motivated by the conflict in Iraq and Syria. You should be vigilant at this time.
