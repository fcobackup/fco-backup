Terrorism  
There is a high threat of terrorist attack globally affecting UK interests and British nationals, including from groups and individuals who view the UK and British nationals as targets. Stay aware of your surroundings at all times.      
UK Counter Terrorism Policing has information and advice on staying safe abroad and what to do in the event of a terrorist attack. Find out how to reduce your risk from terrorism while abroad. 
Terrorism in Sudan 
Terrorists are likely to try and carry out attacks in Sudan
Terrorism attacks could be indiscriminate, including in places frequented by foreigners, such as: 
transport hubs 
hotels 
restaurants 
places of worship 
major gatherings 
Stay aware of your surroundings, keep up to date with local media reports and follow the advice of local authorities.  
Red Sea military activity 
There is a military response to Houthi militants’ attempts to disrupt international shipping in the Red Sea. The military activity is limited to the Red Sea and Yemen, but travel advice for nearby countries could change at short notice. You should monitor travel advice and follow instructions from local authorities. 
Security situation  
There is an ongoing conflict across Sudan following violent clashes, which started in April 2023. 
Crime 
There has been widespread violent crime in Khartoum since the start of the conflict. There have also been reports of a large increase in crime in other cities and areas of Sudan. 
 Types of crime include: 
looting 
burglaries and home invasions 
theft 
muggings 
demands for money at checkpoints 
mobile phone and bag-snatching, including drive-by bag-snatching by thieves on motorbikes 
aggressive begging, including attempts to open the doors of stopped vehicles 
To reduce the risk to yourself and your belongings, you should: 
not leave valuable items on display 
keep doors locked and windows closed when driving  
If you’re stopped or attacked, comply with demands and do not resist. 
Criminal kidnap 
There is a high threat of detention, including kidnap, enforced disappearances and unlawful arrest across Sudan. There have been a number of recent incidents where British nationals and other westerners have been detained against their will. 
Humanitarian aid workers and journalists are viewed as legitimate targets.
Mobile phone and internet access 
There are regular communication blackouts. Mobile phone and internet services are not always available. Telecommunications networks could be disrupted without warning. 
Laws and cultural differences  
Personal ID 
It is a legal requirement to carry photographic ID, such as a passport, with you at all times. 
Dress code 
Non-Muslim women do not have to wear a veil or cover their heads. Men and women should dress modestly and respect local customs and sensitivities. 
Ramadan  
Sudan is an Islamic country. Respect local traditions, customs, laws and religions. Make sure your actions do not cause offence, especially during the holy month of Ramadan or if you intend to visit religious areas.
Alcohol and drug laws 
Non-Muslims are allowed to drink alcohol in Sudan, but not in the presence of Muslims. However, you may still be arrested for drinking alcohol regardless of the circumstances. 
There are severe penalties for drug trafficking. 
Using cameras in secure areas 
Due to the conflict, it is not advisable to take photographs in secure areas in Sudan. Do not take photographs or use a mobile phone camera close to: 
government buildings 
military installations 
public utilities, including petrol stations 
other sensitive areas, such as bridges and airports  
Plain-clothed public security officers operate in these areas. 
LGBT+ travellers 
Same-sex sexual activity is illegal in Sudan and not tolerated in Sudanese society. This includes inviting guests into hotel rooms.   
Read more advice for LGBT+ travellers. 
Relationships outside marriage 
It’s illegal to have extramarital relations and there are severe penalties. It’s illegal to live together, or to share the same hotel room, with someone of the opposite sex if you’re not married or closely related. 
Guests in hotel rooms 
It’s illegal to invite guests into your hotel room. Business meetings should take place in hotel lobbies or meeting rooms, not hotel rooms. Tourist police patrol the hotels, and British nationals have reported problems with Sudanese authorities about this. 
Technical equipment 
You might need a licence to use some technical equipment in Sudan, including: 
satellite phones 
listening or recording devices 
radio transmitters 
powerful cameras or binoculars 
Contact the Sudanese Embassy in the UK before travelling for more information. 
Money 
It’s difficult to use non-Sudanese credit or debit cards, and most banks and ATM machines will not let you withdraw cash. Bring US dollars with you to Sudan.  
You may be able to exchange US dollars dated 2006 onwards (older ones will not be exchanged), but this will be difficult due to the current conflict.  
British pounds are rarely exchanged. Only change money through banks or official exchange bureaus.  
Transport risks  
Road travel 
If you are planning to drive in Sudan, see information on driving abroad.  
You can use a UK photocard driving licence to drive in Sudan for up to 3 months. If you still have a paper driving licence, you may need to update it to a photocard licence.  
Road conditions and safety 
Road travel will involve heightened levels of risk due to the current conflict and should only be undertaken if strictly necessary. 
Road conditions are poor. Roads, even major ones, might: 
be untarred or unsurfaced 
have potholes 
be used by pedestrians, donkey-carts and rickshaws
At night, there is generally no street lighting and many vehicles do not have lights. Many drivers in Sudan do not have a licence or insurance. 
Road traffic accidents are common. There is a high risk of traffic accidents when using public transport or vehicles for hire, such as rickshaws and ‘amjad minivans’. 
Sudanese law prohibits the use of mobile phones while driving. 
Air travel 
Khartoum International Airport is closed following the outbreak of violence in April 2023.   
The Foreign, Commonwealth & Development Office (FCDO) understands that some commercial flight operations leaving Port Sudan Airport have started, operated by Egypt and Badr Airlines. There are no Sudanese airlines which currently meet the standards required to operate direct flights to the UK or EU. 
The UK Air Safety List (ASL) lists all known airlines in Sudan that do not meet international safety standards and are banned from operating commercial air services to, from, and within the UK. Check the UK Air Safety List when considering which airlines to fly with. The list is maintained by the Department for Transport, based on advice from the UK Civil Aviation Authority. 
Sea travel 
There is a significant risk of piracy in the Gulf of Aden and Indian Ocean. The threat assessment of the combined international naval counter-piracy forces is that sailing yachts should not enter the designated high-risk area, due to the risk of hijacking. 
If you go ashore along the Red Sea coast, make sure you have reviewed the relevant country travel advice and have the correct documentation for entry. 
Extreme weather and natural disasters 
Find out what you can do to prepare for and respond to extreme weather and natural hazards. 
Rainy season 
Flash flooding can happen during the rainy season from July to October. Risks at this time of year include: 
flooding that can make areas inaccessible by road, including areas south of Khartoum 
dry riverbeds (‘wadis’) being hit by flash floods, with many only being passable on a major road
