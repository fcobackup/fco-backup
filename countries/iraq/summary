Large protests have been taking place in central Baghdad and across Iraq since 24 October, following a period of unrest in early October. While many demonstrations have been peaceful, there have been frequent violent clashes between Iraqi Security Forces and protesters, resulting in significant casualties including loss of life. There may be restrictions on movement, and the Iraqi authorities have discretion to impose curfews as they deem necessary. You should continue to remain vigilant, follow the advice and instructions of local authorities, avoid any protests, demonstrations or large gatherings, and keep up to date with developments via local media and this travel advice.
According to Iraqi law you must have a visa before you travel, even if you’re intending to travel to the Kurdistan Region of Iraq. See Visas
The Iraqi Prime Minister announced the defeat of Daesh in Iraq on 9 December 2017. However, terrorists are still very likely to try to carry out attacks in Iraq. There’s also a high threat of kidnapping throughout the country. You should remain vigilant and monitor media reports. See Terrorism
Coalition forces, including the UK, continue to carry out targeted airstrikes against Daesh in northern and western Iraq. Areas liberated from Daesh are likely to contain remnants of war and improvised explosive devices.
The security situation throughout Iraq remains uncertain, and could deteriorate quickly. You should monitor media reporting and make sure you have robust contingency plans in place.
The government of Iraq is taking measures to improve the structural integrity of the Mosul Dam as there is a risk the dam could fail. It’s currently impossible to accurately predict if or when this might occur. See Local travel
If you’re abroad and you need emergency help from the UK government, contact the nearest British embassy, consulate or high commission. Consular support is severely limited in Iraq. The British Embassy in Baghdad and the British Consulate-General in Erbil operate a limited consular service by appointment only. The Embassy and Consulate-General’s ability to visit locations across Iraq is limited and travel to unsecure areas to deliver consular services may not be possible.
Take out comprehensive travel and medical insurance before you travel.
