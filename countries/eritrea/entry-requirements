The information on this page covers the most common types of travel and reflects the UK government’s understanding of the rules currently in place. Unless otherwise stated, this information is for travellers using a full ‘British Citizen’ passport.
The authorities in the country or territory you’re travelling to are responsible for setting and enforcing the rules for entry. If you’re unclear about any aspect of the entry requirements, or you need further reassurance, you’ll need to contact the embassy, high commission or consulate of the country or territory you’re travelling to.
You should also consider checking with your transport provider or travel company to make sure your passport and other travel documents meet their requirements.
Entry rules in response to coronavirus (COVID-19)
Entry to Eritrea
All land borders are closed and are not expected to re-open in the near future. Some international flights have resumed. See International Travel.
Regular entry requirements
Visas
For information about entry requirements, contact the local immigration authorities or the nearest Eritrean embassy. You should also check with your airline or travel company for the latest information.
Passport validity
Your passport should be valid for a minimum period of six months from the date of entry to Eritrea and have at least two clear pages adjoining one another in your passport.
Dual nationals
Dual British/Eritrean nationals entering Eritrea will be classed as Eritrean nationals by the Eritrean authorities. The Eritrean authorities consider all British nationals holding either Eritrean or PFDJ identity documents (including out of date documents) as Eritrean nationals. The British Embassy is unable to gain consular access to, or obtain information on dual nationals if detained by the authorities or otherwise in need of assistance. Dual nationals entering Eritrea on an Eritrean identity card rather than an Eritrean passport will need an exit visa from the Immigration Office in Asmara to leave the country.
Foreign currency
Foreign visitors must declare all foreign currency over 10,000 US dollars or equivalent on entering the country. There is no limit on the amount that can be brought in. Make sure you have had your completed foreign currency declaration form approved and stamped before you leave the airport.
If you declared currency on arrival, when you leave you will have to show that any foreign currency missing was exchanged at a branch of ’Himbol’, the State foreign currency exchange. If you spend any US dollars at an official hotel you must get a receipt to present along with the currency declaration form when you leave the country.
You’re not permitted to take more than 500 Nafka (ERN) out of Eritrea.
If you fail to comply with these regulations you may face prosecution leading to a heavy fine, as well as a delay to your departure.
Yellow fever certificate requirements

UK Emergency Travel Documents
UK Emergency Travel Documents are accepted for entry, airside transit and exit from Eritrea.
