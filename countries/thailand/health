Mpox
Travellers arriving from countries where mpox transmission has been recorded in the previous 21 days are asked to complete a health declaration form for contact tracing. If you are suspected of having mpox, you will be isolated in a hospital and prevented from travelling further until the results of a PCR test for mpox are known. This can mean at least 1 day of isolation.
if the result of your test is negative, you will be allowed to resume travelling;
if the result of your test is positive, you must continue your isolation in hospital, and be monitored by health officials. Patients will be discharged after an isolation of approximately 21 days or when they are no longer considered to be infectious.
During your stay in Thailand, if you develop symptoms of mpox, you can seek medical advice at nearby hospital facilities, or contact Thai Department of Disease Control’s national hotline for mpox 1422. Check your travel health insurance cover before you travel.

Air quality
High levels of air pollution can occur in major urban areas, including in Bangkok and Chiang Mai, which is also affected by regional smoke haze. The high pollution and PM 2.5 counts, occasionally enter the unhealthy and hazardous levels. This may aggravate bronchial, sinus or asthma conditions. Children, the elderly and those with pre-existing medical conditions may be especially affected. You can check air quality levels for many cities in real time on the World Air Quality Index website.
