There are currently extremely limited commercial options available to return to the UK from DRC. Current Government of DRC restrictions mean that no scheduled passenger flights are permitted to enter or leave DRC, with the exception of specially arranged flights.
UK special flight
Booking for the UK special flight for British tourists, short term visitors and their direct dependants to return to the UK on 14 May has now closed. There are currently no further special flights organised from DRC.
This travel advice will be updated with further information on any future special flights and other options to leave DRC as soon as this is available.
This travel advice will be updated when departure options become available. Sign up for travel advice email alerts and follow the British Embassy Twitter and Facebook.
Special Air France flight
Air France have arranged for a special flight to leave the Democratic Republic of Congo on Sunday 17 May and arrive in Paris at 21:10 where you can find onward connections. See UK Travel Advice for France.

Travel to the airport
Passengers should make their way to the airport at the time advertised on their booking ticket. You should not travel to the airport unless you have a confirmed ticket.
All passengers will have their temperature checked on arrival at the airport and anyone displaying coronavirus (COVID-19) symptoms will not be allowed to travel. Please bring your own mask or face covering and gloves as you will not be allowed into the airport without them. Public Health England guidelines for flights will be enforced on the flights.
Your journey home
The National Travel Health Network and Centre (NaTHNaC) provides advice on how to stay safe as you travel by air.
When you arrive back in the UK, follow the guidance for when you return to the UK on steps you should take to protect yourself and others.
Future travel options
If you wish to leave DRC, you should also register your interest to leave by email to Kinshasa.Consular@fco.gov.uk. If you cannot leave DRC at this time, see advice on staying in DRC during coronavirus.
You will need to pay for your return travel to the UK. If departure options are available but you cannot afford the travel costs and have exhausted all other options for getting funds, you may be eligible to apply for an emergency loan from the government. This is a last resort option and you would need to repay the loan when you are back in the UK. For more information, you should contact Corporate Travel Management (CTM). CTM are a commercial partner of the FCO and are authorised to administer such loans on behalf of the FCO.
