Warning
FCDO advises against all travel to Afghanistan.

Only very limited medical facilities are available in Afghanistan. There is no guarantee local health practitioners will be available.
Before you travel check that:
your destination can provide the healthcare you may need
you have valid and appropriate travel insurance for local treatment or unexpected medical evacuation
This is particularly important if you have a health condition or are pregnant.
Emergency medical treatment
There is no public ambulance service in Afghanistan, including Kabul. If you need urgent attention, speak directly with a local medical practitioner and use local transport to get to hospital when safe to do so. Ambulances sent by hospitals may require payment or evidence of insurance before they treat you.
Contact your insurance company quickly if you’re referred to a medical facility for treatment.
Vaccine recommendations and health risks
At least 8 weeks before your trip:
check the latest vaccine recommendations for Afghanistan
see where to get vaccines and whether you have to pay on the NHS travel vaccinations page
See what health risks you’ll face in Afghanistan, including:
diarrhoeal diseases and other gastrointestinal infections
measles and other viral infections
respiratory tuberculosis
malaria
