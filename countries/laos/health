Coronavirus (COVID-19)
Check the latest information on risk from COVID-19 for Laos on the TravelHealthPro website
See the healthcare information in the Coronavirus section for information on what to do if you think you have coronavirus while in Laos.
At least 8 weeks before your trip, check the latest country-specific health advice from the National Travel Health Network and Centre (NaTHNaC) on the TravelHealthPro website. Each country-specific page has information on vaccine recommendations, any current health risks or outbreaks, and factsheets with information on staying healthy abroad. Guidance is also available from NHS (Scotland) on the FitForTravel website.
General information on travel vaccinations and a travel health checklist is available on the NHS website. You may then wish to contact your health adviser or pharmacy for advice on other preventive measures and managing any pre-existing medical conditions while you’re abroad.
The legal status and regulation of some medicines prescribed or bought in the UK can be different in other countries. If you’re travelling with prescription or over-the-counter medicine, read this guidance from NaTHNaC on best practice when travelling with medicines. For further information on the legal status of a specific medicine, you’ll need to contact the embassy, high commission or consulate of the country or territory you’re travelling to.
While travel can be enjoyable, it can sometimes be challenging. There are clear links between mental and physical health, so looking after yourself during travel and when abroad is important. Information on travelling with mental health conditions is available in our guidance page. Further information is also available from the National Travel Health Network and Centre (NaTHNaC).
Health risks
UK health authorities have classified Laos as having a risk of Zika virus transmission. For information and advice about the risks associated with Zika virus, visit the National Travel Health Network and Centre website
The 2022 rainy season has seen an increase in Dengue cases. Dengue and Malaria are endemic, so you should increase precautions to avoid being bitten by mosquitos. Visit the NaTHNaC website for additional guidance and advice on Malaria in Laos.
Water borne, food borne and other infectious diseases are common and serious outbreaks occur from time to time.
There have been outbreaks of avian influenza (also known as bird flu) in poultry in Laos. The risk to humans is very low, but as a precaution you should avoid contact with domestic, caged or wild birds and make sure poultry and egg dishes are thoroughly cooked.
Air quality
Regional air pollution, up to unhealthy levels, can affect areas of Laos, and may aggravate heart, lung or respiratory conditions. Children, the elderly and those with pre-existing medical conditions may be especially affected. You can find advice on air quality and possible mitigation on the World Health Organization (WHO) website. You can check air quality levels for some cities in Laos in real time on the World Air Quality Index website.
Medical treatment
Medical care in Laos is basic and outside the capital there are no reliable facilities to deal with medical emergencies. Medical evacuation is difficult to organise and very expensive. Make sure you have adequate travel health insurance and accessible funds to cover the cost of any medical treatment abroad and repatriation.
There are limited mental health services or care facilities in Laos. Professional treatment including medication is difficult and expensive to obtain. Emergency mental health treatment is likely to need transfer to a country offering appropriate facilities. Always make sure your travel insurance policy covers any pre-existing mental health conditions.
If you need emergency medical assistance during your trip, dial 1195 or 030 5257239 and ask for an ambulance. You should contact your insurance/medical assistance company promptly if you’re referred to a medical facility for treatment. You may be asked to pay for the use of an ambulance and any treatment you may need in advance. Usually you will get a receipt that can be used to claim on your insurance.
Voluntary ambulance services also operate in Vientiane free of charge:
Vientiane Rescue (telephone: 1623 or (0)20 5666 8825)
Lao Red Cross Rescue (telephone: +856 (0)20 5996 6111 or (0)20 2200 5563
Note that these phone lines and emergency services telephone numbers are seldom staffed by English speakers. Make sure anyone attending an accident is wearing a uniform identifying himself or herself as ‘Vientiane Rescue’ or ‘Lao Red Cross’. There have been reports of bogus companies who are not trained in first aid charging for attending accidents.
International clinics, large hospitals and larger pharmacies are able to fulfil or source most prescription requirements. In more remote areas this may be more difficult, please plan ahead before travelling.
