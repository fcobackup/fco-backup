This page has information on travelling to Thailand.
This page reflects the UK government’s understanding of current rules for people travelling on a full ‘British Citizen’ passport, for the most common types of travel.
The authorities in Thailand set and enforce entry rules. If you’re unsure how Thailand’s entry requirements apply to you, contact its UK embassy, high commission or consulate.
All travellers
You do not need to present COVID-19 related document such as certificate of vaccination and COVID-19 test results upon arrival in or transit through Thailand.
As of 9 January, if you are visiting Thailand and then travelling to a country that requires a RT-PCR test for entry, you will need to purchase medical insurance prior to your arrival in Thailand that provides cover for Covid-19 treatment.
Check your passport and travel documents before you travel
Passport validity
Your passport must have at least 6 months’ validity remaining from your date of entry into Thailand. You may be refused entry to Thailand if your passport is damaged or has pages missing.
If you’re a dual national, you must leave Thailand on the same passport you used to enter. If you do not, you may experience difficulties as you pass through immigration.
Visas
British passport holders arriving by air or land can enter Thailand for 45 days without a visa (a ‘visa exemption’).
If you wish to stay in Thailand for more than 45 days, or wish to work in Thailand, you need a valid visa, which you must obtain before you travel. You are legally required to have a valid passport in Thailand. If you need to renew or apply for a new British passport, see Overseas British passport applications.
If you have queries about visas or entry requirements, you can speak to either the Royal Thai Embassy, Thai Immigration Bureau, Thai Ministry of Foreign Affairs, or local Immigration Office.
If you plan to stay for more than 45 days or you will work in Thailand, you must get the appropriate visa before you travel. For more information, contact the nearest Thai Embassy or Consulate.
If you stay beyond the period of your visa (‘overstay’ your visa), you will be fined 500 baht per day up to a maximum of 20,000 baht. You also risk being held in detention, deported at your own expense, and banned from re-entering Thailand for up to 10 years. The enforcement of penalties for overstaying is strict, and conditions in detention centres can be harsh.
Yellow fever certificate requirements
Check whether you need a yellow fever certificate by visiting the National Travel Health Network and Centre’s TravelHealthPro website.
UK Emergency Travel Documents
UK Emergency Travel Documents (ETDs) are accepted for entry, airside transit and exit from Thailand. The purpose of the visit to Thailand using an ETD and whether approval is granted, is entirely at the discretion of the Thai authorities. They consider applications on a case-by-case basis. If you are planning to enter Thailand using a UK ETD, you should contact the nearest Thai Embassy or Consulate before you travel to seek advice about whether an ETD will be accepted and if so is a visa required.
