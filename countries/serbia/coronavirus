Serbia has put measures in place to limit the spread of coronavirus (COVID-19).

The Serbian Ministry of Health website gives up to date information on the number of cases confirmed and tests carried out in Serbia. This website also includes helpline telephone numbers. A State of Emergency is currently in place in response to the global pandemic of coronavirus (COVID-19).
Entry and borders
All airports in Serbia are currently closed to international passenger flights as are all borders, except for freight traffic. These measures, and those taken by neighbouring countries, mean there are now no commercial means of arriving in Serbia, or leaving Serbia to return to the UK. The Serbian Government has announced plans to re-open airports for commercial passenger flights no earlier than 18 May. Announcements on further measures for international arrivals, including for quarantine and/or self-isolation are expected in due course.
Serbian passport holders (including dual nationals) who enter on occasional special repatriation flights arranged by the Serbian government are subject to mandatory testing for COVID-19, medical quarantine until well if tested positive, and mandatory quarantine at home for 28 days if negative.
Countries neighbouring Serbia have also introduced restrictions. Please check country-specific FCO Travel Advice for details. Some exemptions have been identified, including international cargo transport by road or river (time limits apply when in transit).
General advice about flights
If you have booked, or are looking to book, flights between Serbia and the UK in May, you should be aware that there is no guarantee of when the current restrictions on air travel will be lifted. We recommend that you contact your airline for the latest information.
Visas
The right to remain in Serbia for foreign nationals has been extended until the end of the State of Emergency.
Local measures
A nationwide curfew is in place between the hours of 6pm and 5am Monday to Friday, and continuously over weekends from 6pm Friday to 5am Monday morning. On the public holiday weekend of 30 April to 4 May, the curfew will run continuously from 6pm Thursday 30 April to 5am Saturday 2nd May. On Saturday 2nd May and Sunday 3rd May, the curfew will run daily from 6pm-5am. There is a ban on public gatherings of more than 2 people.
People aged over 65 in urban areas, and people over 70 in rural areas, may not leave their homes at any time except for a period of one hour between 6pm and 1am. They can also leave their homes to shop for groceries in designated shops from 4am to 7am on Fridays (with the exception of the public holiday on Friday 1 May). On that day, they will be permitted to leave their homes on two occasions for a period of one hour. During these times they can go no further than 600 metres from their homes.
Public transport (including inter-city transport) will gradually resume operation across the country from 4 May, with public transport in Belgrade resuming on 8 May. Mechanics, green markets, hairdressers/beauty salons and some small shops are now allowed to open alongside food/grocery stores and pharmacies. Parks, playgrounds and public spaces are also reopening. Restaurants and cafes remain closed except for delivery.
Schools and universities remain closed until further notice. Some kindergartens and day care facilities will re-open from 11 May.
There may be further restrictions to limit the spread of coronavirus. Infringements of these procedures may result in fines and/or a prison sentence. If you are currently in Serbia, check news outlets regularly for up to date information.
If you need further information about entry requirements, contact the local immigration authorities or the nearest Serbian Embassy or Consulate. You should also check with your airline or travel company for the latest information.
