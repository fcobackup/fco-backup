Warning
FCDO advises against all but essential travel to parts of Ecuador.

This section has safety advice for regions of Ecuador. It only covers regions where FCDO has specific advice.  
You should also read FCDO’s overall travel advice and safety and security advice.  
Within 20km of the Ecuador-Colombia border 
FCDO advises against all but essential travel to areas within 20km of the Ecuador-Colombia border, except for these areas in Carchi province: 
El Ángel Ecological Reserve  
Rumichaca border crossing 
the town of Tulcán 
the Pan-American Highway  
This is due to the presence of organised crime linked to the production and trafficking of drugs. 
The security situation can change quickly in areas outside the 20km border zone, including Esmeraldas, Carchi and Sucumbíos provinces. There are illegal armed groups and criminal gangs in these areas. If you are travelling to these areas, including Cuyabeno, the Napo River, and the El Ángel Ecological Reserve, where there are ecolodges, you should: 
stay alert and take local advice 
pay close attention to warnings issued by the Ecuadorean authorities  
travel during daylight hours with a reputable, official guide 
have an emergency plan and good communication systems in place 
be aware some lodges are far from a major hospital  
If you cross the northern border at Tulcán (Rumichaca official land border point), enter and exit the town on the Pan-American Highway.  
Lago Agrio (also known as Nueva Loja) the main town in Sucumbíos province, and San Lorenzo, in Esmeraldas province, are both within the 20km border zone where FCDO advises against all but essential travel. 
Guayaquil 
There have been several security incidents in and around Guayaquil in 2023, including an increase in murders and small explosions. There have also been fatal armed attacks against the police and prosecutors. While these incidents were not in tourist areas of Guayaquil, you should stay alert and monitor local news and advice.
