This page has information on travelling to Lesotho. Check what you must do to return to the UK.
This page reflects the UK government’s understanding of current rules for people travelling on a full ‘British Citizen’ passport from the UK, for the most common types of travel.
The authorities in Lesotho set and enforce entry rules.
All travellers
All travellers entering Lesotho will be screened for coronavirus. You should comply with any additional screening measures.
Travellers showing symptoms of coronavirus will be required to self-isolate at their permanent or temporary residence or may be placed in an isolation facility in a government hospital at their own expense.
If you’re fully vaccinated
Fully vaccinated travellers (i.e. those who have taken a full course of a WHO-recognised COVID-19 vaccine) are allowed to enter Lesotho with a valid vaccination card or certificate. The last dose must have been taken at least 14 days before travel.
Proof of vaccination status
You must present proof that you have been fully vaccinated to enter Lesotho.
You can use a certificate with a unique identifier such as a verifiable QR or bar code.
Lesotho will accept the UK’s proof of COVID-19 recovery and vaccination record and proof of COVID-19 vaccination issued in the Crown Dependencies. Your final vaccine dose must have been administered at least 14 days prior to travel. Your NHS appointment card from vaccination centres is not designed to be used as proof of vaccination and should not be used to demonstrate your vaccine status.
Residents of Lesotho
Fully vaccinated residents should follow the same rules as other vaccinated travellers. You will be expected to present a valid vaccination card or certificate.
If you’re not fully vaccinated
Partially vaccinated and unvaccinated travellers must show a negative PCR test result that was obtained no more than 72 hours before arrival at the border.
Travellers departing from the UK should not use the NHS testing service to get a test in order to facilitate your travel to another country. You should arrange to take a private test.
Residents of Lesotho
Unvaccinated or partially vaccinated Basotho and Lesotho Residence Permit holders may take a Rapid Antigen Test when entering Lesotho at their own cost, or may be offered free vaccination.
Children and young people
Children 5 years and below are exempted from requiring vaccination or a negative COVID-19 test.
If you’re transiting through South Africa
All visitors to Lesotho must travel through or transit via South Africa. See our South Africa travel advice page for further information.
Check your passport and travel documents before you travel
Passport validity
Your passport should be valid for a minimum period of 90 days from the date of exit from Lesotho. You must have at least 2 blank pages in your passport when you present it at immigration to enter or leave Lesotho.
Visas
British nationals can obtain entry visas on arrival. Overstaying without proper authority is a serious matter. You may be held in detention.
UK Emergency Travel Documents
UK Emergency Travel Documents are accepted for entry into, transit and exit from Lesotho. Your Emergency Travel Document should have a minimum of 6 months remaining validity.
Yellow fever certificate requirements
Check whether you need a yellow fever certificate by visiting the National Travel Health Network and Centre’s TravelHealthPro website.
South Africa
If you intend to visit South Africa before or after travelling to Lesotho your passport should have at least 2 additional blank pages when you present it at immigration to enter or leave South Africa.
Travelling with children via a South African airport
If you’re transiting through a South African airport with children, see our South Africa travel advice page for information and advice about the documents you’ll need to carry.
Returning to the UK
The same requirements set out above are also required on exiting Lesotho. In addition, travellers who have recently recovered from COVID-19 and cannot obtain a negative PCR certificate may present a letter of exemption from the Ministry of Health.
Lesotho residents in permitted categories may re-enter Lesotho using the same PCR test that they presented on exit for a period of 14 days from the test date.
Where a negative COVID-19 PCR test is required, this should show:
the name of the traveller (which must correspond with their travel document)
a serial number which is not duplicated
clear and visible proof that the certificate was issued within 72 hours
the date on which the swab was taken and the date the results were provided to the traveller
the name of the testing laboratory approved by the Minister responsible for health
Lesotho residents may re-enter Lesotho using the same PCR test that they presented on exit for a period of 14 days from the test date.
