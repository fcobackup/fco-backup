Travel in Ecuador
The Ecuadorean government provides coronavirus-related information on the Coronavirus Ecuador website. The Ministry of Health also provides an information page. However, the most updated information is accessible via their Twitter account.
Public spaces and services
As of 13 September, curfew restrictions are no longer in place. Power to impose controls and tailor regulations is now devolved to local municipalities and to other competent authorities (amongst others, health, transport and education). Ecuador´s National Emergency Operations Committee (COE) will continue to operate nationwide to review the COVID-19 situation.
A national public health emergency remains in place. The general nationwide biosecurity measures include:
extra precaution advised for people over 60 years old, and those whose medical conditions make them vulnerable to COVID-19
mandatory use of face masks in public spaces.
all individuals to comply with social distancing measures and practice frequent hand washing
schools at all levels and universities remain closed nationwide. Classes will be delivered online
remote working continues to be encouraged
public gatherings are prohibited without specific permissons
authorised labs to undertake COVID-19 tests
a nationwide tracing app ( ̔ASI Ecuador̕ ) is available to alert people if they have been in contact with a confirmed COVID-19 case during the last 15 days. The app is supported via Bluetooth and maintains the confidentiality of users
New phase of restrictions
The central government´s “red, amber, green” alert system is no longer in force.
Each municipal government is responsible for determining their specific restrictions, including any maximum capacity for public transport and institutions; operations capacity of private businesses; the circulation of private vehicles against licence plate numbers; health prevention protocols for all businesses and industries, amongst others. These restrictions are still uncertain. You can follow their social media channels to obtain the most up to date notifications, bearing in mind that these can change at any time:
Quito: @MunicipioQuito; Guayaquil: @alcaldiagye; Cuenca: @MunicipioCuenca; Galapagos: @CGGalapagos
Ecuador’s National Emergency Operations Committee (COE) also has a website with their official resolutions (Spanish only).
Within the national health emergency, the Ecuadorean Ministry of Health will continue to issue the required health prevention measures, including PCR tests and any mandatory self-isolation (Aislamiento Preventivo Obligatorio – APO) requirements. All COVID-19 measures will continue to be enforced robustly and infringements will be handled by the related competent authorities.
Quito’s restrictions
Quito Municipality has launched a campaign to increase testing and triage.
In addition to the standard general biosecurity measures, you must carry an identity card at all times. All public gatherings are suspended. Pubs, nightclubs and gyms are also closed until further notice. All sport activities that cannot comply with the minimum distancing requirements are also suspended temporarily.
Shops, supermarkets, restaurants and banks can operate at 50% capacity; cinemas and theatres at 30% capacity; and the municipality´s public transport, bus terminals and interstate and tourist transport can operate at a maximum 50% capacity.
Private cars will be allowed to circulate through the “Hoy Circula” system, as follows:
During odd months (January, March, May, July, September and November): Monday, Wednesday and Friday: vehicles with licence plates ending in odd numbers (1, 3, 5, 7 and 9); Tuesday, Thursday and Saturday: vehicles with licence plates ending in even numbers (2, 4, 6, 8 and 0); Sundays: All vehicle plate numbers.
During even months: (February, April, June, August, October and December): Monday, Wednesday and Friday: vehicles with licence plates ending in ending in even numbers (2, 4, 6, 8 and 0); Tuesday, Thursday and Saturday: vehicles with licence plates ending in odd numbers (1, 3, 5, 7 and 9); Sundays: All vehicle plate numbers.
The Municipality can issue special safe passage documents (“salvoconducto”) for private vehicles which can justify their need to circulate outside the “Hoy Circula” restrictions. There will be an interim period for private vehicles with former special safe passage documents, issued by the central transport authority, to use and replace them with the Municipality documents by 31 October 2020.
Infringements to any of the above restrictions will be handled by Quito´s local government.
