Coronavirus travel health
Check the latest information on risk from COVID-19 for Peru on the TravelHealthPro website.
See the TravelHealthPro website for further advice on travel abroad and reducing spread of respiratory viruses during the COVID-19 pandemic.
International travel
Peru’s international borders remain closed and Lima’s international airport is only servicing domestic flights. Some airlines have been able to operate charter flights (only for repatriation purposes from a Peruvian Air Force base in Callao but these are subject to change or cancellation). The Peruvian government is currently reviewing this arrangement and further information will be published here as and when we have it. If you wish to register your interest in any forthcoming repatriation flights to Europe with the British Embassy in Lima, please write to belima.enquiries@fco.gov.uk. Please note that such flights may arise at short notice and are unlikely to be direct to the United Kingdom.

Travel in Peru
On 15 March 2020, Peru announced a national State of Emergency, which has now been extended until 31 August 2020. The regulations are:
A nationwide curfew, including in Lima, between the hours of 10pm to 4am, Monday to Sunday
An extended curfew, between the hours of 8pm and 4am Monday to Saturday, and all day on Sunday in the regions of Arequipa; Ica; Junin; Huanuco; San Martin; within the Madre de Dios region, Tambopata province only; within the Ancash region, Santa, Casma and Huaraz provinces only; within the Moquegua region, Mariscal Nieto and Ilo provinces only; within the Tacna region, Tacna province only; within the Puno Region, Puno and San Roman provinces only; within the Huancavelica region, Huancavelica province only; within the Cajamarca regions, Cajamarca, Jaen and San Ignacio provinces only; within the Amazonas region, Bagua, Condorcanqui and Utcubamba provinces only; within the Apurimac region, Abancay and Andahuaylas provinces only; and within the Cusco region, Cusco and the La Convencion provinces only.
special measures are in place for those under 14 and over 65, and people at risk. These individuals should only leave their home once a day for up to an hour.
everyone must wear face masks outside of homes
in addition to wearing a face mask, everyone must wear facial protectors (usually a clear plastic full-face covering) when on public transport.
Future changes to curfew rules will be announced by the President.
These restrictions may not apply if you have a travel permit (salvo-conducto) from the Peruvian authorities. These are mainly issued for those with confirmed bookings to leave Peru, but there may be exceptions if you do not have a flight yet, but want to travel within Peru from one region to another.
If this applies to you, contact the British Embassy who will make a request to the Peruvian authorities. Depending on your destination region, you may have to spend some time (possibly two weeks) on quarantine immediately after arrival. The exact location of the quarantine will be decided by the regional government upon arrival.
You should note before being able to move from one region of Peru to another, the local government may first require you to submit a medical certificate, following a rapid COVID-19 test, stating that you are free from infection.
You should note that after 10 July the Peruvian government will only issue internal travel permits (salvo-conductos) to those who are travelling from or via regions still under lockdown and only for repatriation purposes.
Relaxing of restrictions
The Peruvian government has approved a four-phase Economic Reactivation Plan, between May and August which involves relaxing some restrictions and reopening some industry sectors such as Industry and Mining, Construction, Trade and Tourism and Services. For Tourism and Services, the plan involves reopening or restarting the following:
first phase (May): Restaurants (via delivery), hotels and storage
second phase (June): Inter-provincial transport and flights, restaurants (restricted service); some malls and commercial centres have re-opened
third phase (July): International flights, restaurants and hotels operating normally
fourth phase (August): Leisure activities, conventions, meetings, gatherings
This planned relaxation of industry restrictions remains under review and continues to change. The government has not yet set a date for the re-start of commercial international travel.
