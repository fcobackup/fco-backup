Before you travel check that:
your destination can provide the healthcare you may need
you have appropriate travel insurance for local treatment or unexpected medical evacuation
This is particularly important if you have a health condition or are pregnant.
Emergency medical number
There is no central public ambulance service. Some private providers operate in the main cities. In an emergency, call the local hospital.
Contact your insurance company quickly if you’re referred to a medical facility for treatment.
Vaccine recommendations and health risks
At least 8 weeks before your trip:
check the latest vaccine recommendations for Nepal
see where to get vaccines and whether you have to pay on the NHS travel vaccinations page
See what health risks you’ll face in Nepal.
Altitude sickness is a risk in parts of Nepal, particularly in tourist and trekking areas. Read more about altitude sickness on TravelHealthPro.
There are seasonal outbreaks of dengue fever, especially in the south-east of Nepal, but cases have been reported across much of the country. Several cases were also recorded in Kathmandu during 2022. If you’re travelling in any area where dengue is prevalent, take extra precautions to avoid mosquito bites.
Cholera is endemic in various parts of Nepal. Every year there are reports of outbreaks, particularly in the hilly districts in the west of the country. There have been confirmed cases of cholera in Kathmandu, Nepalganj city in western Nepal and in Doti, Bajhang and Gorkha districts.
Air pollution is a hazard to public health, particularly in Nepal’s cities and especially during December to April. Children, the elderly, and those with pre-existing medical conditions may be especially affected. More information about outdoor air quality is available from TravelHealthPro.
Medication
The legal status and regulation of some medicines prescribed or bought in the UK can be different in other countries.

Healthcare in Nepal
Medical treatment is expensive at western travellers’ clinics in Nepal. Healthcare is poor in most places outside the Kathmandu Valley and Pokhara. It may be difficult to get rapid helicopter evacuation if you fall ill or suffer a serious accident in a remote area of the country. Make sure you have adequate travel health insurance and accessible funds to cover the cost of any medical treatment abroad, repatriation and evacuation by helicopter. This usually costs between £1,000 and £2,000 or more per flying hour.
