The information on this page covers the most common types of travel and reflects the UK government’s understanding of the rules currently in place. Unless otherwise stated, this information is for travellers using a full ‘British Citizen’ passport.
The authorities in the country or territory you’re travelling to are responsible for setting and enforcing the rules for entry. If you’re unclear about any aspect of the entry requirements, or you need further reassurance, you’ll need to contact the embassy, high commission or consulate of the country or territory you’re travelling to.
You should also consider checking with your transport provider or travel company to make sure your passport and other travel documents meet their requirements.
Entry rules in response to coronavirus (COVID-19)
Entry to Lesotho
Movement across the border is restricted to those providing essential goods and services, those with medical emergencies (with permits) and certain other limited categories.
Those permitted to enter Lesotho must present a negative COVID-19 PCR test taken within 72 hours. This should show:
the name of the traveller (which must correspond with their travel document)
a serial number which is not duplicated
clear and visible proof that the certificate was issued within 72 hours
the date on which the swab was taken and the date the results were provided to the traveller
the name of the testing laboratory approved by the Minister responsible for health
The border crossing points at Maseru Bridge, Caledonspoort (Butha Buthe), Maputsoe Bridge, Qacha’s Nek Bridge and Vanrooyens Gate (Mafeteng) remain open to those providing essential goods and services, those with medical emergencies and limited other categories of traveller, but this is subject to change at short notice. Their hours of operation are reduced due to the COVID-19 related curfew in South Africa. See our travel advice for South Africa for further information.
Limited passenger air services between Johannesburg and Moshoeshoe International Airport have restarted. The categories of persons allowed entry and the COVID-19 PCR test requirements are the same as for the land borders.
If you wish to enter or exit Lesotho, you’ll need a negative PCR COVID-19 test taken within 72 hours of travel. You should not use the NHS testing service to get a test in order to facilitate your travel to another country. You should arrange to take a private test.
Truck drivers, Basotho students studying in South Africa and others who cross the border daily are permitted to cross for 14 days before a further test is required.
Transiting via South Africa
All visitors to Lesotho must travel through, or transit via, South Africa.
Individuals returning to the UK from Lesotho may transit through South Africa via land borders. However, direct flights between South Africa and the UK have been suspended.
See our Travel Advice for South Africa for further information.
Screening on arrival and departure
Everyone entering Lesotho will be screened for coronavirus.
Individuals entering or leaving Lesotho must provide evidence of a negative PCR COVID-19 test, taken within 72 hours of travel.
You should comply with any additional screening measures.
Quarantine requirements
Travellers showing symptoms of coronavirus will be required to self-isolate at their permanent or temporary residence or may be placed in an isolation facility in a government hospital at their own expense.
Data collection
Travellers entering Lesotho may be required to provide details of where they will be staying to aid the Government’s efforts to tackle COVID-19.
If you need further information about entry requirements, contact the local immigration authorities or the nearest Lesotho High Commission.
