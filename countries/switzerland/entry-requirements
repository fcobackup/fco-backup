The information on this page covers the most common types of travel and reflects the UK government’s understanding of the rules currently in place. Unless otherwise stated, this information is for travellers using a full ‘British Citizen’ passport.
The authorities in the country or territory you’re travelling to are responsible for setting and enforcing the rules for entry. If you’re unclear about any aspect of the entry requirements, or you need further reassurance, you’ll need to contact the embassy, high commission or consulate of the country or territory you’re travelling to.

Entry rules in response to coronavirus (COVID-19)
Travelers from the UK are not permitted entry to Switzerland. UK nationals and other non-Swiss nationals arriving from a “high risk-country” or outside the Schengen area are not permitted entry to Switzerland. Only the following categories of people are permitted entry:
Swiss and Liechtenstein nationals;
Holders of the following documents:

a cross-border permit (G permit),
an FDFA legitimation card;

Holders of a ‘laissez passer’ issued by a Swiss representation in cases of ‘individual special necessity’.
Further information and a list of ‘high risk countries’ can be found on the website of the State Secretariat of Migration.
These restrictions do not apply to UK nationals who are legally resident in Switzerland; you will need to show proof of residence. These restrictions do not apply to UK nationals who are travelling from other Schengen countries.
If you do not hold a residence permit, or do not have your permit with you but are resident in Switzerland, or are otherwise exempted, you will need to apply for a ‘laissez passer’ from the Swiss Embassy in London.
From 8 February, travellers from ‘high risk countries’, including the UK, will need to present a negative COVID-19 test result (rapid antigen test or PCR), carried out less than 72 hours before arrival.

Regular entry requirements
Visas
The rules for travelling or working in European countries changed on 1 January 2021:
you can travel to countries in the Schengen area for up to 90 days in any 180-day period without a visa. This applies if you travel as a tourist, to visit family or friends, to attend business meetings, cultural or sports events, or for short-term studies or training.
if you are travelling to Switzerland and other Schengen countries without a visa, make sure your whole visit is within the 90-day limit. Visits to Schengen countries within the previous 180 days before you travel count towards your 90 days.
to stay longer, to work or study, for business travel or for other reasons, you will need to meet the Swiss government’s entry requirements. Check the Swiss Embassy what type of visa and/or work permit, if any, you may need.
if you stay in Switzerland with a visa or permit, this does not count towards your 90-day visa-free limit.
There are separate requirements for those who are resident in Switzerland. If you are resident in Switzerland, you should carry proof of residence as well as your valid passport when you travel. For further information on these requirements, see our Living in Switzerland guide.
Passport validity
Check your passport is valid for travel before you book your trip, and renew your passport if you do not have enough time left on it.
You must have at least 6 months left on an adult or child passport to travel to most countries in Europe (not including Ireland).
If you renewed your current passport before the previous one expired, extra months may have been added to its expiry date. Any extra months on your passport over 10 years may not count towards the 6 months needed.

UK Emergency Travel Documents
UK Emergency Travel Documents (ETDs) are accepted for entry, airside transit and exit from Switzerland.
