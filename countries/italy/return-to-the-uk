There are commercial options to return to the UK from Italy.
UK special charter flights will only operate for priority countries where commercial flights are not possible. You should not assume that these flights will become available in countries where commercial routes are operating. Do not contact the contracted travel management company if no flight is advertised here.
Flights
Many airlines and airports serving Italy are resuming service, but may not be operating to their usual schedules. You are strongly advised to check your airline’s website, as well as the website for the airport you are intending to fly to for the latest information. You should also expect to be asked to wear a face mask throughout your flight and within the airport terminal.
Travel via neighbouring countries
You should check travel advice for any countries you plan to travel through ahead of your journey.
Financial assistance for travel
You will need to pay for your return travel to the UK. If departure options are available but you cannot afford the travel costs and have exhausted all other options for getting funds, you may be eligible to apply for an emergency loan from the government. This is a last resort option and you would need to repay the loan when you are back in the UK. For more information, you should contact Corporate Travel Management (CTM). CTM are a commercial partner of the FCO and are authorised to administer such loans on behalf of the FCO.
Your journey home: re-entering the UK
When you return, you must follow the rules for entering the UK. You:
need to provide your journey and contact details up to 48 hours before you’re due to arrive in the UK
are not allowed to leave the place you’re staying for the first 14 days you’re in the UK except in very limited situations (known as ‘self-isolating’)
See also the list of people who are exempt from the border rules.
The National Travel Health Network and Centre (NaTHNaC) also provides advice on how to stay safe as you travel by air.
