There are currently no commercial options available to return to the UK from Peru. Borders have closed indefinitely since 16 March.
Future travel options
Between 26 March and 15 April, the FCO chartered five British Airways flights to help British nationals in Peru return to the UK.
The UK government is working closely with airlines, the Peruvian authorities and other governments to make sure options are available for you to return to the UK as soon as possible, including from difficult to reach locations in Peru.
If you cannot leave Peru at this time, see advice on staying in Peru during coronavirus.
Sign up for travel advice email alerts and follow the British Embassy on Twitter and Facebook.
If you would like to register your details with the British Embassy in Lima to be included in communications about possible flights out of Peru, write to lima.escalations@fco.gov.uk and include your full name, date of birth, UK passport number, e-mail address and mobile number. The Embassy sometimes hears of flights leaving Peru at short notice. In your e-mail you should indicate if you would be happy for us to share your details with other Embassies and airlines.
Travel to the airport
Curfew and movement restrictions may not apply if you have a travel permit (salvo-conducto) from the Peruvian authorities to travel to flights or on pre-arranged transport.
If you need a salvo-conducto, you must contact the British Embassy who will request one on your behalf. You should note that the Peruvian authorities mainly issue salvo-conductos for those with pre-arranged international flights.
Your journey home
The National Travel Health Network and Centre (NaTHNaC) provides advice on how to stay safe as you travel by air.
If youâ€™re returning home before 8 June, follow the guidance for when you return to the UK on steps you should take to protect yourself and others. From 8 June there will be new rules for entering the UK.
