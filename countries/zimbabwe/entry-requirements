This information is for people travelling on a full ‘British citizen’ passport from the UK. It is based on the UK government’s understanding of Zimbabwe’s current rules for the most common types of travel.
The authorities in Zimbabwe set and enforce entry rules. If you’re not sure how these requirements apply to you, contact the Zimbabwean Embassy in the UK.
COVID-19 rules
There are no COVID-19 testing or vaccination requirements for travellers entering Zimbabwe.
Passport validity requirements
To enter Zimbabwe, your passport must have:
an ‘expiry date’ at least 6 months after the date you arrive
3 blank pages, in case you need to enter Zimbabwe and exit through one of the neighbouring countries or if you need to leave at short notice
Check with your travel provider that your passport and other travel documents meet their requirements. Renew your passport if you need to.
You will be denied entry if you do not have a valid travel document or try to use a passport that has been reported lost or stolen.
Visa requirements
You must have a visa to visit Zimbabwe. Most visitors get their visa on arrival.
Applying for a visa
The visa on arrival is usually granted for 30 days. Take enough US dollars with you in small notes to pay for your visa. See information on visa fees from the Zimbabwean Embassy.   
It is possible to apply for an e-visa before you travel, with options for single entry or double entry visas at different prices.
You can also use the KAZA Univisa in Zimbabwe. It is valid for travel between Zimbabwe and Zambia and for day trips into Botswana. The KAZA Univisa is available at Harare, Bulawayo and Victoria Falls airports and at the land borders at Victoria Falls (Zimbabwe-Zambia border) and Kazungula (Zimbabwe-Botswana border). It costs 50 US dollars and is valid for 30 days.
It is no longer possible to get a visa from the Zimbabwean Embassy in London.
To extend or renew visas or permits, go in person to the Government of Zimbabwe Immigration Department.
To stay longer or to work or study, or for business travel, you must meet the Zimbabwean government’s entry requirements. You must have a temporary work permit if you’re volunteering or doing missionary work.
Zimbabwean temporary travel documents
Zimbabwean temporary travel documents (TTDs) are not valid for re-entry to the UK. You could be stranded in Zimbabwe if you travel using this document.
Vaccine requirements
To enter Zimbabwe, you must have a certificate to prove you’ve had a yellow fever vaccination if you’re coming from a country listed as a transmission risk.
For full details about medical entry requirements and recommended vaccinations, see TravelHealthPro’s Zimbabwe guide.
Customs rules
There are strict rules about goods that you can take into or out of Zimbabwe. You must declare anything that may be prohibited or subject to tax or duty.
Arms embargo
There is a UK arms embargo against Zimbabwe. It is an offence in UK law to take firearms into Zimbabwe, even if you plan to bring them back to the UK.
Gemstones
Do not carry any precious or semi-precious stones without the correct paperwork.
Pornographic material
It is illegal to carry or import pornographic material.
Taking money into and out of Zimbabwe
Declare cash or travellers cheques if the value is 10,000 US dollars or more. You will get a certified declaration to show you brought it in with you. It is illegal to leave Zimbabwe with cash worth more than 2,000 US dollars.
Journalists
If you’re working as a journalist (for example, as a reporter or news photographer), you must get accreditation before you travel from the Zimbabwean Embassy in the UK. If you do not have proper accreditation, you risk arrest, detention in difficult conditions, a fine and deportation.
