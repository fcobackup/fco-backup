Disruption in Bolivia
There are large political protests and blockades across the country, which could intensify at any time. The protests will hinder road transport across the country and may turn violent. The protests and blockades are in place in all 9 departments and on roads connecting major cities. In La Paz, affected areas include the centre of the city near Plaza Murillo and the area of Sopocachi near the Plaza Avaroa. Stay away from political protests and government buildings, and follow the advice of the police.
