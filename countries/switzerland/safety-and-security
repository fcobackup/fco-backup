Terrorism 
There is a high threat of terrorist attack globally affecting UK interests and British nationals, including from groups and individuals who view the UK and British nationals as targets. Stay aware of your surroundings at all times.     
UK Counter Terrorism Policing has information and advice on staying safe abroad and what to do in the event of a terrorist attack. Find out how to reduce your risk from terrorism while abroad.
Terrorism in Switzerland
Terrorist attacks in Switzerland cannot be ruled out.
Crime
There is a low rate of serious crime in Switzerland. However, there have been increased reports of petty theft, especially in larger cities, at Geneva airport and on trains to and from Geneva.
Protecting yourself and your belongings
Take sensible precautions to avoid mugging, bag-snatching and pickpocketing. Be particularly alert at airports, railway stations and in crowded areas. Do not leave your valuables unattended.   
Laws and cultural differences
Illegal drugs
Illegal drugs, including cannabis, carry severe penalties. You should expect a long jail sentence and heavy fines for possessing, using or smuggling illegal drugs, including when transiting through the airport.
Airports in Switzerland have excellent technology and security for detecting illegal items. This is also used to scan the baggage of transiting passengers.
Face-covering ban
In Ticino and St Gallen, it’s illegal to cover your face in public, including for tourists. Do not wear balaclavas, full veils or any other garment or mask that hides your face. You could get a fine of 100 to 10,000 Swiss francs if you do not comply.
Outdoor activities and adventure tourism
Hiking, mountaineering and extreme sports
Adventure sports can be risky. British nationals in the Swiss Alps have been involved in accidents and have been hospitalised or died.
Check the company you are using is well-established and that your travel insurance covers any specific activity.
For sports activities like skiing, potholing and mountaineering, and for sports classed as particularly dangerous (for example, off-piste skiing, mountain biking, climbing, paragliding or BASE jumping), you could get into difficulty and need emergency rescue. Your insurance should include:
mountain rescue services
helicopter costs
repatriation to your home country or transfer to neighbouring countries for treatment
See ‘Altitude sickness’ in Health.
Skiing and winter sports
Read FCDO advice about preparing for winter sports abroad. See the guidance on avalanches in ‘Extreme weather’.
Transport risks
Road travel
If you are planning to drive in Switzerland, see information on driving abroad and read the rules of the road in the RAC’s Switzerland guide. The guide lists driving regulations and other legal requirements you need to be aware of.
Road users must observe Switzerland’s traffic laws, including speed limits, rules on alcohol intake and child security. Traffic police strictly enforce these regulations. Any serious breach can result in heavy fines or imprisonment.
You can use a UK photocard driving licence to drive in Switzerland. If you still have a paper driving licence, you may need to update it to a photocard licence or get the 1968 version of the international driving permit (IDP) as well.  
Check if you need a UK sticker to drive your car outside the UK.
If you are visiting Switzerland, you may be able to use your Blue Badge in some circumstances. Check local parking rules.
Tolls
You must buy and display a vignette (sticker) to travel on Swiss motorways. You can buy one at most border crossings, petrol stations, post offices, by phone (+800 1002 0030) or buy a vignette online. If you do not have a vignette, you could get a large fine.
If you’re involved in a car accident, use the orange emergency phones to ask for help.
Road conditions
Roads outside urban areas are narrow and winding. Road conditions can deteriorate fast, even in summer, especially during heavy rainfall and snowfall at higher altitudes. Reduce your speed significantly to suit the conditions.
Alpine winters make driving difficult. Equip your car with winter tyres and snow-chains. Check road conditions before you depart. Carry water, food, warm clothing and medicines in your vehicle.
Find the latest information on road conditions using the Swiss government’s ‘Easy answers’ website.
Accessibility
The official Switzerland Tourism website has useful information for travellers in wheelchairs or with impaired mobility who are travelling in Switzerland.
Extreme weather and natural hazards
Find out what you can do to prepare for and respond to extreme weather and natural hazards.
Alpine conditions  
Check weather forecasts and conditions and make sure you’re properly equipped for the worst-case scenario. Always carry a map, compass, GPS and fully charged mobile when travelling outside urban areas. Do not undertake any activity alone and consider hiring a guide for expert advice. Always leave copies of your itinerary with someone.
These alpine hazards exist throughout the year:
avalanches and snowdrifts
landslides and flooding
glacial crevasses and hollows
rockfalls
thunderstorms
altitude sickness
sun exposure
sudden weather changes
Avalanches
Avalanches are a risk, particularly during heavy snow. Off-piste skiing is very dangerous due to the risk of avalanches. Follow safety instructions and warnings. Consider carrying search equipment. Avalanche beepers (receivers) are the most common rescue devices and when properly used, are the fastest way of locating an avalanche victim.
Conditions on roads in mountainous areas can quickly become difficult in winter. Carry water, food, warm clothing and medicines in your vehicle.
Check the latest avalanche risk at the Federal Office of Meteorology and Climatology.
For more information, visit the official Switzerland Tourism website.
Wildfires
There is a heightened risk of wildfires in summer, especially after a period of drought.     
Fires in mountainous areas can lead to rockfalls. Wildfires also cause travel disruption in wider areas.
Always check the bans on open fires for the area you’re visiting and:
leave no litter
make sure cigarette ends are properly extinguished
use only designated concrete-based barbecue areas and douse coals before you leave
Causing a forest fire in a place where there’s a ban is illegal, even if unintentional, and can lead to a fine of up to 20,000 Swiss francs.
If you see a wildfire, call the fire department on 118.
