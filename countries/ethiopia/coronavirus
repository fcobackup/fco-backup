Health
What to do if you have symptoms
Residents and people already in Ethiopia who start to feel symptoms should self-isolate and call the Ethiopian coronavirus helplines on either 8335 or 952. You will be asked some questions and may need to be tested.
If you test positive but have mild or no symptoms, you will need to self-isolate at home where possible. The health authorities will make follow up checks by phone or in person. If you test positive and cannot self-isolate you will need to stay at a government designated isolation centre until you have recovered and tested negative with follow up tests. Visitors on holiday who are not staying with family and friends, cannot self-isolate at ‘home’ and will not be allowed to choose where to self-isolate.
Those experiencing more serious symptoms will be provided healthcare at a designated hospital.
Private healthcare facilities
Private healthcare facilities used by the international community with the capability to respond to coronavirus cases exist, but capacity is limited. Most private healthcare facilities continue to offer treatment for other illnesses or injuries. You should check with your insurance company which facilities they recommend and phone the healthcare facility before you visit.
