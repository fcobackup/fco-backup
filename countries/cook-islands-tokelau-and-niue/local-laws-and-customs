Laws and customs are very different from those in the UK. Be aware of your actions to ensure that they do not offend. You’re strongly advised to familiarise yourself with, and respect local laws and customs.
Shopping, food and drink all have any tax included in the price. Tipping isn’t expected.
Maximum penalties for possession or importation of even small quantities of drugs are severe, these include deportation or imprisonment.
Plug sockets and plugs are the same as in Australia and New Zealand. Sometimes the plug has only two pins with no earth (otherwise described as “ungrounded”).
Consensual same-sex sexual activity is no longer illegal following a change to the law, effective 1 June 2023, however public displays of affection may be considered offensive. See our information and advice page for the LGBT+ community before you travel.
