Cases of coronavirus (COVID-19) have been confirmed in Papua New Guinea. The Papua New Guinean authorities have imposed a State of Emergency to limit the spread of the virus. Domestic flights have been suspended, and movement between provinces strictly controlled. Curfews and restrictions on public transport and gatherings are in place in some provinces, including the National Capital District (Port Moresby), Central Province, Western Province and East New Britain. Further information about the measures introduced can be found on the PNG government website.
Nobody may enter Papua New Guinea except for health workers, flight crew, military personnel or those with a special written exemption from Emergency Controller. Anyone arriving must self-isolate in a government designated facility for 14 days. There is a ban on cruise ships and leisure yachts with more than fifteen people on board, on land border crossings between Indonesia and Papua New Guinea, and on sea crossings between the Solomon Islands and Bougainville.
