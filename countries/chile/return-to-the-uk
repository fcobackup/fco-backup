You will need to pay for your return travel to the UK. If departure options are available but you cannot afford the travel costs and have exhausted all other options for getting funds, you may be eligible to apply for an emergency loan from the government. This is a last resort option and you would need to repay the loan when you are back in the UK. For more information, you should contact Corporate Travel Management (CTM). CTM are a commercial partner of the FCO and are authorised to administer such loans on behalf of the FCO.
Travelling to the airport
If you are travelling to the airport to catch a flight from one of the areas under quarantine or curfew, please ensure you have your passport (and your boarding pass if you have one) with you. Please use a recognised taxi service or airport transfer whose driver should have the requisite permissions.
Visas
If you plan to fly back to the UK please ensure you have not overstayed on your visa – this could affect your departure.
Arrival in the UK
When you arrive back in the UK, follow the guidance for when you return to the UK on steps you should take to protect yourself and others.
