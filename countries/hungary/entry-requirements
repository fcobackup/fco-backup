The information on this page covers the most common types of travel and reflects the UK government’s understanding of the rules currently in place. Unless otherwise stated, this information is for travellers using a full ‘British Citizen’ passport.
The authorities in the country or territory you’re travelling to are responsible for setting and enforcing the rules for entry. If you’re unclear about any aspect of the entry requirements, or you need further reassurance, you’ll need to contact the embassy, high commission or consulate of the country or territory you’re travelling to.
You should also consider checking with your transport provider or travel company to make sure your passport and other travel documents meet their requirements.
If you are travelling to Hungary for work, read the guidance on visas and permits as the rules have changed since 1 January 2021.
Entry rules in response to coronavirus (COVID-19)
Entry to Hungary
Hungary has closed its border to most foreign nationals due to the coronavirus pandemic. There are some limited circumstances in which foreign nationals, including UK nationals, may be allowed entry.
Residents or family
UK nationals may enter Hungary if they hold a permanent residence permit or a permit allowing them to stay in Hungary for at least 90 days, and can present their documents to the authorities at the border. UK nationals travelling with a family member who is a Hungarian citizen or resident should also be allowed entry.
Others
Persons in possession of Immunity Certificates issued by the Hungarian authorities may enter Hungary without facing COVID-19 restrictions and with no mandatory quarantine.
UK nationals may also enter Hungary if they are travelling in the following circumstances:
arriving for the purpose of business or trade activity - see below
transiting through Hungary through travel corridors – see below
operating cargo transport
people able to prove credibly that have recovered from COVID-19 within 6 months of their travel
as part of a military convoy
people travelling on diplomatic or official passports
Business and trade activity
Foreign (including UK) nationals entering Hungary for business purposes, and representatives of foreign (including UK) companies with a stake in Hungary (i.e. joint venture) may enter the country without restrictions. On entry, unless in possession of a Hungary issued Immunity Certificate, you will need to show proof of an essential business requirement for entering Hungary, e.g. an official letter from your company that includes contact details for verification purposes, or an invitation to a business event. You can provide this on paper or electronically. You will be subject to a temperature check on arrival (see below – Testing / screening on arrival) but are not subject to quarantine measures.
Transiting through Hungary
Unless in possession of a Hungary issued Immunity Certificate, you must provide proof that you entering Hungary is for the purposes of travelling directly to another destination outside Hungary; you must also explain the reason you are travelling and demonstrate that you are able to transit to your final destination, providing, for example, a hotel reservation or proof of address in another country, a travel ticket, or similar evidence.
Throughout the transit you can use only specified routes, dedicated petrol and rest stations and specific border crossing points (more information on transit is available in Hungarian).
Pre-travel exemption
It is also possible to apply to the authorities for an exemption to enter Hungary in a further set of specific circumstances. To enter on this basis, you must gain permission in advance of travelling. You will need to show that you are travelling to Hungary for:
court proceedings
business activities justified by central government, demonstrated with a letter of invitation issued by an administrative body, an independent regulatory body or an autonomous public administration body
accessing healthcare with a referral
studying or taking an exam, with certification from an education institution
travelling to the point of departure for cargo-related transit
participation in family events, eg marriage, baptism, funeral
care of a relative
participation in a sporting, cultural or church event of major international importance
any other justifiable reason
You should apply for an exemption in advance using the online form on the police website. While the forms are in the Hungarian, you may complete your submission in Hungarian or English.
Entry rules may change at short notice. You can find the latest announcements on the Hungarian government website (in English).
Testing / screening on arrival
Unless in possession of a Hungary issued Immunity Certificate, all people entering Hungary will be subject to a temperature check on arrival. Unless resident in Hungary, foreign nationals will be denied entry should they show signs of COVID-19.
Unless in possession of a Hungary issued Immunity Certificate, most people entering Hungary must agree to enter mandatory quarantine, usually at home. You must notify the authorities of the location. If you have a suitable device, you must download software for police to monitor your quarantine. If on-site checks cannot be carried out in any other way, those in quarantine must allow police to enter their home.
If you have no place of residence in Hungary and have no Hungary issued Immunity Certificate, you must enter quarantine at a government-designated location. Quarantine is legally enforced and a fine of around £375 equivalent is levied for breaking the rules.
It is possible to leave quarantine early following two negative COVID-19 tests within 5 days of each other but at least 48 hours apart. Tests are self-funded and your local environmental health office will need to give permission for you to leave quarantine for testing, and also to end quarantine early after showing evidence of two negative test results.
The price of coronavirus tests are capped at Ft 19,500. Having the test conducted at home may incur an additional charge. See the list of environmental health offices in Budapest (in Hungarian); you must contact the office covering your place of residence. There is no single registry of environmental health offices outside Budapest; you will need to carry out an internet search for your local ‘Népegészségügyi Osztály’.
The government’s website has a list of medical centres (in Hungarian) where testing is available. Some offer home testing for an additional fee.
Regular entry requirements
Visas
The rules for travelling or working in European countries changed on 1 January 2021:
you can travel to countries in the Schengen area for up to 90 days in any 180-day period without a visa. This applies if you travel as a tourist, to visit family or friends, to attend business meetings, cultural or sports events, or for short-term studies or training
if you are travelling to Hungary and other Schengen countries without a visa, make sure your whole visit is within the 90-day limit. Visits to Schengen countries within the previous 180 days before you travel count towards your 90 days
to stay longer, to work or study, for business travel or for other reasons, you will need to meet the Hungarian government’s entry requirements. Check with the Hungarian Embassy what type of visa and/or work permit you may need
if you stay in Hungary with a visa or permit, this does not count towards your 90-day visa-free limit
Any time you spent in Hungary or other Schengen countries before 1 January 2021 does not count towards your 90-day visa-free limit.
At Hungarian border control, you may need to use separate lanes from EU, EEA and Swiss citizens when queueing. Your passport may be stamped on entry and exit. You may also need to:
show a return or onward ticket
show you have enough money for your stay
There are separate requirements for those who are resident in Hungary. If you are resident in Hungary, you should carry proof of residence as well as your valid passport when you travel. For further information on these requirements, see our Living in Hungary guide.
Passport validity
Check your passport is valid for travel before you book your trip, and renew your passport if you do not have enough time left on it.
You must have at least 6 months left on an adult or child passport to travel to most countries in Europe (not including Ireland).
If you renewed your current passport before the previous one expired, extra months may have been added to its expiry date. Any extra months on your passport over 10 years may not count towards the 6 months needed.
UK Emergency Travel Documents
UK Emergency Travel Documents are accepted for entry, airside transit and exit from Hungary.
Fines
Entry into Hungary can be barred if you have failed to pay a previous fine in Hungary. Contact the Hungarian Embassy in London for guidance on paying any outstanding fines before you next enter Hungary.
Customs regulations
Community regulations ensure the free movement of goods between EU member states. This means that no customs procedures are required for exporting goods from Hungary to another EU member state and/or for importing goods from a member state to Hungary. The export and import of goods purchased for non-commercial purposes (for personal use or as gifts) while travelling is not restricted, however, the transport of certain goods (such as: pets, hunting weapons, alcohol and tobacco products, medicines containing drugs, etc.) within the European Union is restricted or subject to special permissions.
Check the customs regulations before entering or leaving Hungary on the National Tax and Customs Administration of Hungary website.
