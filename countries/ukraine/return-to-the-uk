All scheduled flights, train and bus services to and from Ukraine have been suspended, with many border crossings closed. Although airlines are selling tickets for commercial flights after this date, the Ukrainian government said on 21 May that they would not consider the resumption of air transportation until after 15 June.
Special flights
SkyUp and Ukrainian Airlines have run a small number of non-scheduled special flights from Kyiv to a number of European destinations. SkyUp have announced a direct flight to London on 3 June. Timings of flights can change at short notice so please be alert for any updates from the airline after you buy a ticket.
If you manage to book a flight to leave Ukraine via a third country, you will need evidence of onward travel, for example, a flight ticket to your next destination. Measures imposed by some third countries to combat coronavirus include restricting entry of foreign nationals and suspending flight operations in those countries. Please check FCO Travel Advice for other countries on your route and with any airlines for flights you may wish to take. You should consult Customer Service’s interactive map for information on the status of checkpoints at Ukraine’s borders.
We know that this situation is concerning for British people trying to leave Ukraine. The UK government is working closely with airlines and other governments to make sure options are available for you to return to the UK as soon as possible.
Future travel options
You will need to pay for your return travel to the UK. If departure options are available but you cannot afford the travel costs and have exhausted all other options for getting funds, you may be eligible to apply for an emergency loan from the government. This is a last resort option and you would need to repay the loan when you are back in the UK.
For more information, you should contact Corporate Travel Management (CTM). CTM are a commercial partner of the FCO and are authorised to administer such loans on behalf of the FCO.

The National Travel Health Network and Centre (NaTHNaC) provides advice on how to stay safe as you travel by air.
