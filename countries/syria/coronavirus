Coronavirus guidance is being updated.
Read the Prime Ministerâ€™s statement for the latest information.

Syria has announced a number of measures and restrictions to limit the spread of the virus.
Consular support is not available from the British government from within Syria, as all services of the British Embassy in Damascus are suspended and all diplomatic and consular staff have been withdrawn. If you need to speak to a consular officer in the UK, call the FCO in London on +44 (0)20 7008 1500.
Travel and borders
Most routes into and out of Syria are currently totally or partially closed.
On 22 March, the Syrian authorities banned all flights to and from Syria. Some non-commercial flights continue to use the airport and the Syrian authorities have allowed limited repatriation flights, primarily aimed at repatriating Syrian nationals.
Land crossings to neighbouring countries are largely closed, though some have exemptions in place e.g. for commerce and certain individuals only. Further restrictions, including border closures, may be introduced without notice.
Public measures
Authorities across Syria have introduced lock-down measures. While some restrictions are easing in some areas, many measures remain in place. These include movement restrictions, curfews, closures of businesses and bans on public and private gatherings. Implementation may vary and restrictions may be tightened again at short notice.
