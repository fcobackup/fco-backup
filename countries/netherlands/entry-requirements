This page has information on travelling to the Netherlands.
This page reflects the UK government’s understanding of current rules for people travelling on a full ‘British Citizen’ passport from the UK, for the most common types of travel.
The authorities in the Netherlands set and enforce entry rules. If you’re unsure how the Netherlands entry requirements apply to you, contact its UK embassy, high commission or consulate.
All travellers from the UK do not require a negative pre-departure test for travel to the Netherlands, regardless of their vaccination status. However, other entry requirements remain in place. These vary, depending on your vaccination status. Please see below for further details.
If you’re fully vaccinated
Fully vaccinated UK nationals who can provide acceptable proof of vaccination, which includes the UK COVID Pass, are allowed to enter the Netherlands.
If you have received a booster (or third dose), you are considered fully vaccinated for entry into the Netherlands. There is currently no expiry date for booster jabs. If you have not received a booster (or third dose), but have received two doses of a vaccine approved for use by Netherlands, then you qualify as fully vaccinated, if one of the following applies:
at least 14 days and no more than 270 days have passed since receiving the second dose of a two-dose vaccine (BioNTech/Pfizer, Moderna, AstraZeneca) or;
at least 28 days and no more than 270 days have passed since receiving the Janssen (Johnson & Johnson) vaccine
Find out if you qualify as fully vaccinated in the Netherlands on the website of the Dutch government.
All travellers are advised to take a self-test immediately after arriving in the Netherlands and again on day five – this is not an obligation and is therefore not enforced.
If you are travelling via France or Belgium, check FCDO Travel Advice for those countries, as testing requirements and validity may differ. The Dutch border police carry out random checks at the land borders to check compliance with entry requirements.
Proof of vaccination status
Dutch authorities will accept the UK’s proof of COVID-19 vaccination record and proof of COVID-19 vaccination issued in the Crown Dependencies, in paper or digital form. Your final vaccine dose must have been administered at least 14 days prior to travel, and 28 days in the case of the Janssen (Johnson & Johnson) vaccine. Proof of vaccination is valid for 270 days from the final dose of your primary vaccination. An NHS appointment card from vaccination centres does not qualify as proof of vaccination. Travellers must also present a vaccine declaration form.
Residents of the Netherlands
UK nationals who are legally resident in the Netherlands are allowed to re-enter the country regardless of their vaccination status, but will need to show one of the following:
a residency permit
a certificate of application
They may be subject to questioning by Dutch border authorities when they arrive in the Netherlands.
This measure does not apply to those travelling to the Netherlands from a country that is on the list of safe countries/regions, published by the Dutch government.
All travellers are advised to take a self-test immediately after arriving in the Netherlands and again on day five – this is not an obligation and is therefore not enforced.
If you’re not fully vaccinated
If you’re not fully vaccinated or a legal resident of the Netherlands, you are only allowed to enter the Netherlands from the UK if you meet the requirements of an exemption category of the EU entry ban, as established by the Dutch government. Under this entry ban, non-EU/EEA nationals and nationals of non-Schengen states arriving from outside the Schengen area will not be permitted entry to the Netherlands for non-essential purposes, unless they are fully vaccinated or meet other exemption requirements. An overview of all exemption categories can be found on the website of the Dutch government. Examples include:
Partners of UK nationals who hold a Netherlands residence permit issued under Article 50 TEU (Withdrawal Agreement). Partners must meet the criteria set out by the Dutch government and must carry with them a copy of their partner’s residence permit. See the Dutch government’s website for further information and the full criteria travellers must meet
Close family members of seriously or terminally ill patients, or those attending the funeral of a close family member. Travellers must complete a form before travelling
Grandparents visiting their new born grandchildren. Travellers must complete a form before travelling
Divorced parents visiting any child(ren) who are minors. Travellers must complete a form before travelling
Travellers who are not fully vaccinated and who do not meet requirements of an EU entry ban exemption category, are not allowed to enter the Netherlands from the UK.
All travellers are advised to take a self-test immediately after arriving in the Netherlands and again on day five – this is not an obligation and is therefore not enforced.
If you’ve had COVID-19 in the past 180 days
You are able to use the NHS COVID Pass to demonstrate proof of COVID-19 recovery when entering the Netherlands. The date of issue must be more than 11 days ago, and less than 180 days ago. A valid recovery certificate exempts you from the EU entry ban. Travellers should also carry a recovery declaration.
Residents of the Netherlands
UK nationals who are legally resident in the Netherlands are allowed to re-enter the country regardless of their vaccination status, but will need to show one of the following:
a residency permit
a certificate of application
They may be subject to questioning by Dutch border authorities when they arrive in the Netherlands.
This measure does not apply to those travelling to the Netherlands from a country that is on the list of safe countries/regions, published by the Dutch government.
All travellers are advised to take a self-test immediately after arriving in the Netherlands and again on day 5 – this is not an obligation and is therefore not enforced.
Children and young people
Travellers aged 12 and over must complete a vaccination declaration to demonstrate their vaccination status. Children under the age of 18 travelling with their vaccinated parent(s) or legal guardian(s) are exempt from this requirement. Teachers are considered supervisors performing a similar role to guardians; therefore, children under the age of 18 travelling with teachers on a school trip are also exempt from this requirement. Children aged 11 and under do not need to show proof of vaccination to enter the Netherlands.
Dutch border authorities have strengthened their precautions against child abduction. Parents (particularly fathers) travelling in sole charge of their children are regularly stopped for further checks at Schiphol airport and occasionally prevented from boarding flights.
You should carry a signed consent letter for travelling abroad with a minor and associated documents (outlined in the form). See also Get permission to take a child abroad.
If you’re transiting through the Netherlands
Transiting is when you pass through one country on the way to your final destination.
Travellers from the UK are allowed to change planes in the Netherlands if:
they are travelling from a country/region on the Dutch government’s list of safe countries, or;
they are fully vaccinated, or;
the purpose of their trip falls under one of these EU entry ban exemption categories:
They are travelling through the Netherlands to a non-EU/Schengen country. Travellers must prove that they have a connecting flight that departs within 48 hours of arrival in the Netherlands. Travellers must not leave the airport’s transit zone, or;
They are travelling through the Netherlands to another EU/Schengen country. Travellers must carry proof that they have permission to enter the EU/Schengen country in question.
Travellers who change planes in the Netherlands who continue their journey within 1 day upon arrival in the Netherlands, do not need to show a proof of vaccination, proof of recovery or negative test result, providing they do not leave the airport.
If you are travelling via France or Belgium, check FCDO Travel Advice for those countries, as testing requirements and validity differ.
Further information about transiting through the Netherlands can be found on the website of the Dutch government.
Exemptions
HGV drivers
HGV drivers from the UK entering the Netherlands do not have to show a negative COVID-19 test, proof of vaccination or proof of recovery. They must carry an employer’s declaration to demonstrate the essential nature of their travel. More information is available on the website of the National Association of Transport Operators.
Check your passport and travel documents before you travel
Passport validity
If you are planning to travel to an EU country (except Ireland), or Switzerland, Norway, Iceland, Liechtenstein, Andorra, Monaco, San Marino or Vatican City, you must follow the Schengen area passport requirements.
Your passport must be:
Issued less than 10 years before the date you enter the country (check the ‘date of issue’)
valid for at least 3 months after the day you plan to leave (check the ‘expiry date’)
You must check your passport meets these requirements before you travel. If your passport was issued before 1 October 2018, extra months may have been added to its expiry date.
Contact the embassy of the country you are visiting if you think that your passport does not meet both these requirements. Renew your passport if you need to.
Visas
You can travel to countries in the Schengen area for up to 90 days in any 180-day period without a visa. This applies if you travel as a tourist, to visit family or friends, to attend business meetings, cultural or sports events, or for short-term studies or training.
If you are travelling to the Netherlands and other Schengen countries without a visa, make sure your whole visit is within the 90-day limit. Visits to Schengen countries within the previous 180 days before you travel count towards your 90 days.
To stay longer, to work or study, for business travel or for other reasons, you will need to meet the Dutch government’s entry requirements. Check with the Netherlands Embassy what type of visa and/or work permit you may need.
If you are travelling to the Netherlands for work, read the guidance on visas and permits.
If you stay in the Netherlands with a residence permit or long-stay visa, this does not count towards your 90-day visa-free limit.
Passport stamping
Check your passport is stamped if you enter or exit the Schengen area through the Netherlands as a visitor. Border guards will use passport stamps to check you’re complying with the 90-day visa-free limit for short stays in the Schengen area. If relevant entry or exit stamps are not in your passport, border guards will presume that you have overstayed your visa-free limit.
You can show evidence of when and where you entered or exited the Schengen area, and ask the border guards to add this date and location in your passport. Examples of acceptable evidence include boarding passes and tickets.
You may also need to:
show a return or onward ticket
show you have enough money for your stay
