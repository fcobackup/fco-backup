Stay at home
Only go outside for food, health reasons or work (but only if you cannot work from home)
If you go out, stay 2 metres (6ft) away from other people at all times
Wash your hands as soon as you get home
Do not meet others, even friends or family.
You can spread the virus even if you don’t have symptoms.

Photographing government buildings and military installations is not allowed. If in doubt, ask first. You need a permit to take photographs of the ‘tank graveyard’ in Asmara. You can apply for one at the Ministry of Tourism.
Telephone networks are often unreliable and may only work for limited periods each day outside Asmara and larger towns. There are no agreements between Eritrean mobile telephone providers and international providers. You will not be able to receive or send calls or SMS text messages from any overseas mobile phone network on arrival in Eritrea. A resident’s permit is required to buy a local SIM card. There have been unconfirmed reports that phone calls made on the local mobile phone network are recorded.
All electronic items (laptops, mobile phones, cameras etc) should be declared upon arrival. Failure to do so may result in their confiscation by Eritrean customs officials when you depart.
Dress modestly, especially in lowland and predominantly Muslim areas. Shorts and T-shirts are likely to draw attention.
Homosexual behaviour is illegal, although the penalties are unclear. Be discreet. See our information and advice page for the LGBT community before you travel.
