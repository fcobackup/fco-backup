You can spread the virus even if you don’t have symptoms.

The use of ATMs and credit cards is confined to a limited number of hotels and other businesses in the larger cities. Most ATMs and businesses will only accept local bank cards, not international credit or debit cards. You should check in advance whether the supplier (eg business, hotel etc) is able to accept your international debit or credit card. It’s understood that only certain branches of certain banks (PNP Paribas, Société Générale and Credit Populaire d’Algérie) have ATMs that can service international credit or debit cards, and even these don’t always work. Algeria has strict foreign exchange laws and the Dinar can’t be exported. Only exchange money at bureaux de change in the international airports and larger hotels, or at banks in the main cities. Don’t change money on the streets or via individuals that may approach you at the airport.
