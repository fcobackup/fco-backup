Forest fires
Forest fires often occur during the summer months. Forest fires are highly dangerous and unpredictable. Take care when visiting or driving through woodland areas. Make sure cigarette ends are properly extinguished, don’t light barbecues and don’t leave empty bottles behind. Causing a forest fire is treated as a criminal offence in Portugal even if unintentional. If you see a forest fire, call the emergency services on 112.
