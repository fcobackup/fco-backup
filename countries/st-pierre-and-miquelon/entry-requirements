Entry rules in response to coronavirus (COVID-19)
The information on this page covers the most common types of travel and reflects the UK government’s understanding of the rules currently in place. Unless otherwise stated, this information is for travellers using a full ‘British Citizen’ passport.
The authorities in the country or territory you’re travelling to are responsible for setting and enforcing the rules for entry. If you’re unclear about any aspect of the entry requirements, or you need further reassurance, you’ll need to contact the embassy, high commission or consulate of the country or territory you’re travelling to.
You should also consider checking with your transport provider or travel company to make sure your passport and other travel documents meet their requirements.
Everyone should comply with the measures put in place in St Pierre & Miquelon to limit the spread of coronavirus (COVID-19).
Entry to St Pierre & Miquelon
All travellers over the age of 11 must undertake a test for COVID-19 within 72 hours before departure for St Pierre & Miquelon. The test is obligatory and the traveller must show proof of a negative result before embarking.
To enter St Pierre & Miquelon travellers will also need to produce an ‘attestation’ and self-certified document affirming that they have no COVID symptoms and that to their knowledge they have not been in contact with any person confirmed positive within the last 14 days.
You should check with your travel operator and the local Prefecture’s advice ahead of travel.
Airlines may refuse boarding to anyone who does not produce both proof of a negative result and the self-certified document. Upon arrival, all travellers will be subject to a 7-day quarantine, followed by a second PCR test. The website of the local Prefecture will have further details.
These entry requirements are subject to change. For further information on the entry restrictions in place for French Overseas Territories, please see the French government’s website before travelling.
