There are currently no regular commercial options available to return to the UK from Maldives, following decisions taken by commercial airlines. However, some flights are occasionally being arranged when demand arises.
If you are still in Maldives, please register with the British High Commission by emailing BHC.MaleGeneral@fco.gov.uk or direct messaging on Twitter
Future travel options
The UK government is working closely with airlines, the Maldivian authorities and other governments to make sure options are available for you to return to the UK as soon as possible.
This travel will be updated with information on any other departure options. Sign up for travel advice email alerts and follow the British High Commission on Twitter.
You will need to pay for your return travel to the UK. If departure options are available but you cannot afford the travel costs and have exhausted all other options for getting funds, you may be eligible to apply for an emergency loan from the government. This is a last resort option and you would need to repay the loan when you are back in the UK. For more information, contact Corporate Travel Management (CTM). CTM are a commercial partner of the FCO and are authorised to administer such loans on behalf of the FCO.
