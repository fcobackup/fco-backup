Entry and borders
See Entry requirements to find out what you will need to do when you arrive in Barbados.
Returning to the UK
When you return, you must follow the rules for entering the UK.
You may require a pre-departure test. Information about the pre-departure tests which Barbados provides can be found in the Barbados Travel Protocols. Further information can be obtained by phoning (+1246) 628 4150 or emailing travelprotocols@visitbarbados.org. You are responsible for organising your own COVID-19 test, in line with UK government testing requirements.
Be prepared for your plans to change
No travel is risk-free during COVID. Countries may further restrict travel or bring in new rules at short notice, for example due to a new COVID-19 variant. Check with your travel company or airline for any transport changes which may delay your journey home.
If you test positive for COVID-19, you will be assessed by a member of staff from the government’s quarantine facilities for 24 hours. You may be transferred to the Government’s quarantine facility, Harrison’s Point, for further assessment and treatment. You can stay there for no cost until you have recovered. Conditions at the government quarantine facilities are generally basic and not necessarily equivalent to a tourist hotel with the associated services.
Alternatively, you may be eligible for the Government’s home isolation programme and you have the option of requesting to self-isolate at your own expense at a government-approved isolation hotel, villa or property until you have recovered. Strict rules are in place for this self-isolation. The option to self-isolate in an approved hotel, villa or property is not a right – the decision will be made by healthcare professionals. Full details can be found in the Barbados Travel Protocols.
Plan ahead and make sure you:
can access money
understand what your insurance will cover
can make arrangements to extend your stay and be away for longer than planned
Travel in Barbados
Everyone should comply with the measures put in place in Barbados to limit the spread of coronavirus (COVID-19). Details of these measures can be found at the Barbados Government Information Service website and / or Facebook page and the Visit Barbados Travel Protocols.
The Government’s COVID-19 protocols may be subject to change at short notice and you should therefore review these regularly.
All persons arriving in Barbados are required to wear face masks at all times whilst on airport grounds. Persons will also have their temperature taken.
In moving around Barbados, follow social distancing protocols.
Masks are mandatory in all public spaces, including out-of-doors unless you are exercising. You can expect to have your temperature taken and you may be asked to supply your contact details when entering some premises. Regular washing of hands is encouraged and you can expect to be asked to clean your hands using hand sanitizer on entering a building.
You may be required to quarantine and/or undergo a further COVID-19 test at any stage of your stay if the Barbados authorities deem that you have been in close contact with a COVID-19 positive individual or mandatory monitoring highlights potential COVID-19 symptoms.
There is currently a curfew in place from 9pm to 5am. Indoor parties are prohibited. There are restrictions on size of gatherings outdoors.
The Barbadian authorities will seek to prosecute people who breach COVID-19 protocols, including those who break quarantine protocols, which may result in a fine and/or prison sentence.
