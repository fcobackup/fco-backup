Coronavirus guidance is being updated.
Read the Prime Minister’s address for the latest information.

Crime
Violent crime isn’t common in Luxembourg cities, but incidents of burglaries are on the increase. Ensure you take adequate precautions to secure your home, particularly during the traditional holiday periods in August and around Christmas.
Pickpockets operate on buses and in train stations, particularly the Luxembourg Gare (main train station). Be aware of your immediate surroundings, keep your bags within sight, and avoid displaying high value items.
Hotel lobbies, especially in the Findel area, are reported to be hot spots for thefts and pickpocketing.
Report any thefts in person to the nearest local police within 24 hours and get a police report crime number.
Scams
Foreign visitors and residents can be targeted by scam artists. These can cause great financial loss. If you receive an e-mail claiming to be from Her Majesty’s Revenue and Customs (HMRC) offering a tax refund on provision of your bank details you should make absolutely sure that it is not part of a scam.
Public transport
If you travel on public transport you must buy a ticket and validate it either on platform before your travel or on the bus. Check validation rules on the ticket before you travel. You’ll be fined on the spot if you travel without a ticket or with a ticket that hasn’t been validated. For more detailed information, see the Angloinfo website.
Taxis
It’s safer to use official taxis (on clearly marked taxi stands). Always check the fare per km before getting in as some taxis can charge highly inflated prices. Taxi drivers charge 25% extra on Sundays.
Road travel
Licences and documents
You can drive in Luxembourg with a UK driving licence. Driving licence rules will stay the same until 31 December 2020.
If you’re living in Luxembourg, check the Living in Guide for information on requirements for residents.
Driving regulations
Many of the driving rules on Luxembourg’s roads are different to those in the UK:
the minimum age for driving a car is 18
driving is on the right
mobile phones may only be used ‘hands free’ while driving
priority is given to traffic from the right in towns - drivers must stop for traffic joining from the right unless a yellow diamond sign or other priority road sign has been posted
you must use headlights on full-beam outside towns and cities at night and in times of low visibility
Keep vehicle registration and car insurance documents with you to prove you’re the legal owner and the car is properly insured. Failure to do so could lead to a fine and confiscation of the vehicle. On the spot fines are common. It’s easy to cross into neighbouring countries without realising it. Keep your passport with you for identification.
All vehicles should have winter tyres when temperatures are zero or below.
Drink-drive laws are strictly enforced. You can be arrested for having a blood alcohol content of 0.05%. See the European Commission,RAC guide on driving in Luxembourg.
Road safety
In 2018 there were 36 road deaths in Luxembourg (source: Department for Transport). This equates to 6.0 road deaths per 100,000 of population and compares to the UK average of 2.8 road deaths per 100,000 of population in 2018.
Heavy goods vehicles
Heavy goods vehicles exceeding 7.5 tons, with or without a trailer, intended for the transport of goods from Belgium or Germany to France are prohibited on public roads in Luxembourg from Saturday 9:30pm to Sunday at 9:45pm, and on the days before public holidays from 9:30pm to the following day at 9:45pm.
