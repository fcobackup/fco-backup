Public spaces and services
The Slovak government has imposed restrictions on public life to counter the spread of COVID-19.
There are nationwide restrictions on movement outside the home. A nationwide curfew with stricter lockdown measures is in place for a 20 hour period each day from 5am to 1am the following day between 1 January and 24 January. Exemptions to the curfew include:
Going to a food shop or chemist.
Accessing essential services such as banking, petrol stations and post offices.
Going to work, but your employer must provide you with a letter explaining that your work cannot be done from home. You should carry the letter with you in case the authorities ask to see it.
Taking a child to school or to another parent or guardian.
For medical appointments including C19 testing, care of relatives and of pets
Journeys in order to travel abroad, or to return home from foreign travel
Attending the funeral, marriage or christening of a close relative.
Walking a dog or cat within a distance of 1000 metres.
Visiting the countryside or doing individual sport but only within your district (in the case of Bratislava and Kosice, within the city boundary).
Visits to and meetings with other households are no longer allowed. People do not need to leave their current two-household bubble immediately, but after leaving it no new bubbles are allowed.
Ski resorts are closed.
Hotel guests may remain in their hotel until 10 January, but no new bookings are permitted.
Full details of the curfew and its exemptions (in Slovak only) are on the Slovak Government website
Other important previous measures also remain in force:
Facemasks must be worn outdoors in all built-up areas, such as towns and villages. The wearing of facemasks remains compulsory indoors, including on public transport and in shops. Masks are not required in the countryside if you are with others from the same household or can maintain a five-metre distance
Local public transport is running, but face masks are compulsory
Restaurants, bars and cafés may only operate a takeaway service
The number of people in shops is restricted and temperature checks may be carried out at the entrances. You must maintain a two metre distance when queuing. Supermarkets and chemists have reserved shopping hours between 9am and 11am for those over 65
