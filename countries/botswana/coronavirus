Local measures
The Government of Botswana declared a State of Public Emergency on 31 March, which has since been extended to six months.
A number of other measures in response to the coronavirus pandemic have been introduced, including extending the current lockdown until 7 May. There will be a phased lifting of the lockdown rules from 8-14 May and 15-22 May.
Everybody in Botswana must stay at home during the lockdown except to buy essential supplies such as food, medicine or power/fuel, which requires a travel permit. Only certain categories of key workers are exempt.
You should comply with these requirements wherever you are staying in Botswana and continue to follow the advice of the Government of Botswana and local authorities. More detail on the phased lifting of the lockdown rules will be shared by the Government of Botswana in due course. You can find the latest updates and travel permit forms at the Government of Botswana’s Facebook page.
International travel
There are currently no commercial flights in to or out of Botswana. Medical evacuation flights remain possible. The Botswana authorities have also closed land border posts with neighbouring countries. Only citizens and residents will be allowed entry. Returning residents, including from the UK, will be subject to a 14-day mandatory quarantine period in government facilities.
If you need further information about entry requirements, contact the local immigration authorities or nearest Botswana Embassy or High Commission. You should also check with your airline or travel company for the latest information.
Flights in to and out of Botswana from South Africa are affected by South Africa’s own COVID-19 response. Follow our travel advice for South Africa for information on South African entry requirements, and consult your nearest South African High Commission.
