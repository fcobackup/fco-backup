The Government of El Salvador has announced that the country is operating two official currencies: the US dollar and Bitcoin. Bitcoin became legal tender in September 2021, but may not yet be accepted everywhere. British Nationals considering using Bitcoin should ensure that they understand the processes and risks involved, and that they have access to US dollars if they need them.
It is almost impossible to change pounds sterling anywhere in El Salvador, so you should bring a mixture of cash and travellersâ€™ cheques in US dollars. US$50 and US$100 notes are generally not accepted in many smaller restaurants, bars and shops. US$100 and US$50 notes may be exchanged in banks on arrival, but it is advisable to bring smaller denominations with you.
Regular ATMs and Bitcoin ATMs are widely available particularly in San Salvador and La Libertad. You should inform your bank of your travel plans before you travel to avoid your card being blocked.
