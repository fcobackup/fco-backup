Crime
The local equivalent to the UK ‘999’ emergency lines are: 1190 for fire, 1195 for ambulance and for police: 1191, 241162, 241163, 241164, and 212703. The Tourist Police can be contacted in Vientiane on 021-251-128.
Petty crime can occur, especially in tourist areas and outside banks after customers have withdrawn money. When you’re withdrawing money from ATMs or across the counter be aware of who may be watching. Try to have someone with you and avoid carrying passport, debit and credit cards, and cash in the same bag, to prevent a total loss. There are regular reports of random bag snatches, many being carried out by people on motorcycles. Take sensible precautions, hold your bags on the side away from the road, and do not have valuables on display.
Safes provided in hotels and guesthouses aren’t necessarily secure. Consider using your own lock where possible. Take care of your possessions if you’re travelling long distances, or overnight, by public transport. Be particularly vigilant travelling at night by bicycle or motorcycle, especially if you’re alone. Stick to well-used, well-lit roads and carry a personal alarm if possible. Be aware of your surroundings and avoid unlit roads, especially if you’re alone.
Do not leave your passport as a deposit or guarantee when hiring motorcycles. There have been reports of rental companies arranging for rented motorcycles to be deliberately stolen or damaged resulting in the retention of the passport and payment of a heavy fine. Always make sure your travel insurance covers medical and other costs associated with motorcycle rental and accidents.
Local law enforcement responses to crimes, even violent crimes, are often limited. Foreigners attempting to report crimes have reported finding police stations closed, emergency telephone numbers unanswered, or police lacking transportation or authorisation to investigate crimes that occur at night. It is recommended that you enlist the staff at your accommodation to assist with reporting a crime.
Political situation
Specific events or political disputes may trigger violent protests. You should avoid any demonstrations or large gatherings of people. Keep yourself informed of local developments.
Local travel
Unexploded mines and ordinances are a hazard throughout Laos, and kill a number of people each year. The risk is particularly high in Xieng Khouang Province (Plain of Jars), Luang Prabang Province and areas of the Lao-Vietnamese border, formerly the Ho Chi Minh Trail. Mined areas are often unmarked. Do not stray off main routes in rural areas, and do not pick up metal objects.
There have been attacks on infrastructure and armed clashes with anti-government groups reported as recently as March 2021 in Xaisomboun Province. Further skirmishes may occur.
Take care near the border with Myanmar. This is a well-known drugs trade route where armed groups operate.
There have been small-scale clashes between anti-government groups and government troops in isolated areas along the Lao-Thai border. The local law enforcement agencies have limited capability to counter these threats.
You should get permission from the village chief, district head, provincial governor or national tourism authority for any travel perceived as out of the ordinary, including business, extensive photography, or scientific research of any kind.
You may be stopped by the police at any time, particularly in the evening, and asked to show identification papers before being allowed to travel on. You should comply with requests to stop at checkpoints and roadblocks.
In 2016, there were a number of roadside attacks along Route 13 between Kasi and Phou Kon in Vientiane Province. Although none have been reported recently, you should be vigilant and take extra care if you travel on this road.
Drugs
There have been reported incidents where both male and female tourists have had drinks or food spiked with drugs and in some cases been assaulted. Never leave food or drink unattended. Be careful about taking drinks from strangers at bars, clubs, restaurants and parties.
For confidential, empathetic and non-judgemental support and for guidance with local officials please call the embassy number 24/7 to speak to a consular officer +856 30 770 0000.
All recreational drugs including marijuana are illegal in Laos and penalties which include fines, deportation and prison are harsh. These include the death penalty with a number of Lao nationals having been sentenced to this in 2019.
Air travel
A list of recent incidents and accidents can be found on the website of the Aviation Safety network.
In 2015, the International Civil Aviation Organisation carried out an audit of the level of implementation of the critical elements of safety oversight in Laos.
The FCDO cannot offer advice on the safety of individual airlines. However, the International Air Transport Association publishes a list of registered airlines that have been audited and found to meet a number of operational safety standards and recommended practices. This list is not exhaustive and the absence of an airline from this list does not necessarily mean that it is unsafe.
A departure tax is now included in the price of the air ticket and is no longer paid separately in cash.
Road travel
Roads in Laos are in poor condition and vehicles are not generally maintained to UK standards. Other road users might not show the same level of consideration as in the UK. Travel after dark significantly increases the risk of an accident, as vehicles often do not have lights. Livestock also stray on to the roads causing accidents.
The recently opened Vientiane to Vang Vieng section of the China-Laos Expressway is the first contained high-speed road in Laos, with posted speed limits between 80 and 120km/h. Take care when using this route, as some local users will be unfamiliar with this type of carriageway, and there are vehicle restrictions in place. There have also been reports of animals straying onto the carriageways.
You should also be aware that social media posts regarding the time taken to transit this road are visible to law enforcement officers, and may be used in traffic offence prosecutions.
Motorbike rentals might not automatically provide a helmet, budget to purchase one locally. Take extra care when using public transport or shared vehicles, which might be overcrowded and unsafe. You can report road accidents to a dedicated police number +856 20 5666 9090.
If you’re involved in a road accident you will have to pay compensation for third party property damage and injury, even if you’re not at fault. As a general rule, the Lao authorities will overwhelmingly find in favour of Lao citizens, regardless of the situation. Lao insurers only meet a small proportion of the costs of an accident and will not cover this compensation.
Water-based activities
Travel on the Mekong River by speedboat and slow-boat can be dangerous, especially when water levels are low. Make sure you travel with a company that provides lifejackets.
White water rafting, kayaking, tubing and other water-based activities, including swimming in the Mekong, are dangerous and incidents of drowning and serious injuries have been reported. Laos does not have the same health and safety expectations as in the UK. There might not be warning signs or safety advice provided, even where it is needed. Take great care and check your travel insurance policy to ensure that you’re covered for these activities.
