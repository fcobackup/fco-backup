The currency in Georgia is the Georgian Lari.
Although prices are occasionally quoted in US dollars and euros, Georgian law requires that all goods and services are paid for in local currency.
Credit and debit cards are widely used in Tbilisi, but less so in the regions. ATMs can be found in major towns. Travellersâ€™ cheques are not widely accepted. Ensure you have sufficient cash if travelling to rural or remote areas.
