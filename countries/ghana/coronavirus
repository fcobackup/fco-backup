Cases of coronavirus (COVID-19) have been confirmed in Ghana. The Ghanaian authorities have introduced a number of measures to limit the spread of the virus.
The Government of Ghana has set out guidance to curb the spread of coronavirus: gatherings of 25 or above are no longer allowed to take place unless it is a funeral, people are strongly advised to wash their hands, use hand sanitisers and avoid shaking-hands with one another. People are advised to adhere to strict social distancing.
On 27 March, the Government of Ghana announced a restriction of movement in Greater Accra and Greater Kumasi effective from 01:00 GMT 30 March until 13 April. This has now been extended to 27 April. Everyone must stay at home during this period, however you may go out for essential items, such as food, medicine or water. Inter-city movement is prohibited, except for those providing essential services. See the Ministry of Information for full details on the restriction of movement, including a list of affected areas.

Entry and borders
Given the rise of the number of cases of coronavirus (COVID-19) in Ghana, on 21 March the Government of Ghana announced the closure of the country’s borders, effective from 12.01am GMT 23 March until further notice. The border closure will see the suspension of all international flights into Ghana and all international flights out of Ghana. This means British Nationals cannot enter Ghana at the current time.
Further information
The Government of Ghana has also published four numbers for anyone feeling unwell (+233) 055 2222 004, 055 2222 005, 050 9497700 and 055 8439 868.
