Cases of coronavirus (COVID-19) have been confirmed in Nepal. The Nepali authorities have introduced a number of measures to limit the spread of the virus.
Booking for the UK special flights has now closed. There are currently no further special flights organised from Nepal. For information on how to book, see Return to the UK.
We are receiving reports of some incidents in parts of Nepal of some foreign tourists being threatened or intimidated by locals, allegedly in relation to coronavirus. Such incidents are rare, although have increased in recent days. If you experience such problems, you should return immediately to your accommodation (if safe), or to the local law enforcement agencies (phone 100), or contact the Embassy at +977 (0)1 423 7100.
Travel restrictions
The Government of Nepal announced its intention to deny entry to Nepal to certain foreign nationals, including British nationals until at least 30 April. Until then, Nepal’s land-based entry crossings into Nepal are closed to foreigners from third countries.
Local measures
The Government of Nepal has extended the current internal movement restrictions across the country until at least 27 April. If you are safe where you are, you should remain there except for essential movements, such as for food or medical reasons, unless you are seeking to return to Kathmandu in order to leave. Please monitor our social media for advice. Nepali media reports that some stores are open in the early mornings or evenings, though this may vary by location. Additional useful information may be found on our social media channels. Restrictions on movement may be strictly enforced, with reports that police are detaining people who are judged to be undertaking non-essential movements.
All outside movement, except for emergencies or to purchase essentials, will be prohibited. Anyone who defies this order could face a jail sentence and/or a fine.
Testing and isolation for COVID-19 is limited to certain Government hospitals, where services are basic.
Permissions for mountaineering expeditions for Spring 2020 (including existing permissions) have been suspended.
You should check the Department of Immigration website for the latest information. Keep up to date with information from your tour operator, transport or accommodation provider on the impact on any existing travel plans.
