International travel
Passengers at the airport will need to follow strict regulations, including the mandatory use of masks and facial protectors (usually a clear plastic full-face covering) and social distancing.
KLM has requested permission for a weekly repatriation flight – every Thursday – from Lima to Amsterdam. Tickets will be made available on the KLM Peru and Air France Peru websites (both available in English).
These flights are predominantly for citizens of EU Member States plus passport holders from the UK, Norway, Liechtenstein, Iceland and Switzerland. Citizens of these countries can enter the Netherlands and continue their journey by plane or over land (train, bus, car).
Airlines from France, Spain and the United States have also requested permission for repatriation flights. It is essential to check the rules of every country you pass through on your journey home as rules may vary from country to country and change regularly. Please follow our social media pages and those for The Netherlands, Spain, France and the US for the latest information.

Travel in Peru
On 15 March 2020, Peru announced a national State of Emergency, which has now been extended until 31 October 2020. The regulations are:
A nationwide curfew between the hours of 11pm and 4am
A ban on the use of private cars on Sundays
An extended curfew all day on Sunday until 4 am on Monday in the regions of Cusco, Puno, Moquegua and Tacna, and within the Ayacucho region, Huamanga province only; within the Apurimac region, Abancay province only; and within the Huanuco region, Huanuco, province only.
social and family gatherings and visits are prohibited
special measures are in place for those under 12 and over 65, and people at risk.
children under 12 must stay at home. Each day they are allowed to leave their house for 60 minutes but must remain within 500 meters of their house, and avoid crowded places. When outside, children must be accompanied by an adult who lives with them and maintain a two-meter social distance
people over 65 and those who have underlying health conditions must stay at home, with some exceptions; risk groups must not receive visits at home and must avoid the physical contact with people who leave their home
everyone must wear face masks outside of homes
in addition to wearing a face mask, everyone must wear facial protectors (usually a clear plastic full-face covering) when on public transport.
Future changes to curfew rules will be announced by the President.
These restrictions may not apply if you have an internal travel permit (salvo-conducto) from the Peruvian authorities. These are only issued to those who are travelling from or via regions still under lockdown and only for repatriation purposes (for those with confirmed bookings to leave Peru).
If this applies to you, contact the British Embassy who will make a request to the Peruvian authorities. Depending on your destination region, you may have to spend some time (possibly two weeks) in quarantine immediately after arrival. The exact location of the quarantine will be decided by the regional government upon arrival.
You should note before being able to move from one region of Peru to another, the local government may first require you to submit a medical certificate, following a COVID-19 test, stating that you are free from infection.
Relaxing of restrictions
The Peruvian government has approved a four-phase Economic Reactivation Plan, between May and August which involves relaxing some restrictions and reopening some industry sectors such as Industry and Mining, Construction, Trade and Tourism and Services.
This planned relaxation of industry restrictions remains under review and continues to change.
Commercial international travel started on 5 October within the Latin American region. Passengers need to wear a face mask and a face shield/visor and need to have proof of a negative result from a COVID-19 PCR (molecular) test taken 72 hours before the commercial flight. Repatriation flights to Europe are expected to continue. Commercial internal travel (within Peru) is only permitted in regions and during dates and times that are not under lockdown.
Accommodation
Accommodation in Peru is available. IPERU, the Peruvian Tourism Information Agency, is offering details of suitable accommodation if you need them.
Public places and services
Public places and services have started to open gradually following the relaxation of restrictions set out by the government.
