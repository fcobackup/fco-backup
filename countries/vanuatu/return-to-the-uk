There are currently no commercial options available to return to the UK from Vanuatu as the borders are closed.
The last international flight left Vanuatu on 23 March. No further commercial services are expected to operate until further notice.
We know this is concerning for British people trying to leave Vanuatu. The UK government is working closely with airlines, the Vanuatu authorities and other governments to make sure options are available for you to return to the UK as soon as possible.
If you cannot leave Vanuatu at this time, see advice on staying in Vanuatu during coronavirus.
Future travel options
This travel advice will be updated when departure options become available. Sign up for travel advice email alerts and follow the British High Commissioner on Twitter and our Facebook page.
You will need to pay for your return travel to the UK. If departure options are available but you cannot afford the travel costs and have exhausted all other options for getting funds, you may be eligible to apply for an emergency loan from the government. This is a last resort option and you would need to repay the loan when you are back in the UK. For more information, contact Corporate Travel Management (CTM). CTM are a commercial partner of the FCO and are authorised to administer such loans on behalf of the FCO.
Travel via Australia or New Zealand
The government of Australia has announced that entry to the country will only be permitted to Australian citizens or permanent residents. This follows a similar announcement by New Zealand from 19 March. See Entry requirements
