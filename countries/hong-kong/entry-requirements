This page has information on travelling to Hong Kong.
This page reflects the UK government’s understanding of current rules for people travelling on a full ‘British Citizen’ passport from the UK, for the most common types of travel.
The authorities in Hong Kong set and enforce entry rules. If you’re unsure how Hong Kong’s entry requirements apply to you, contact its UK embassy, high commission or consulate.
All travellers
Although Hong Kong is now part of the People’s Republic of China, it remains a Special Administrative Region (SAR) with its own immigration controls. You can visit Hong Kong for up to 6 months without a visa. However, during the COVID-19 pandemic, different entry requirements are being applied in Hong Kong. For up-to-date advice on entry requirements and restrictions, please visit the Hong Kong SAR Government’s website.
Hong Kong residents and vaccinated non-Hong Kong residents who have visited the UK are permitted to enter Hong Kong.
Travellers departing for Hong Kong will need to provide a negative rapid antigen test result for COVID-19, taken no more than 24 hours prior to departure, or a negative PCR test taken no more than 48 hours before departure. You should keep photos showing the negative rapid antigen test result or the test report for a negative polymerase chain reaction-based nucleic acid test. You can also voluntarily declare the test result via the Department of Health’s electronic health declaration form. Further details can be found on the Hong Kong SAR Government’s website.
Flights may be subject to scheduling change at short notice. Ensure you keep in close contact with your airline and be prepared to change your plans.
Testing on arrival
The Hong Kong Government continues to advise all inbound travellers to conduct daily rapid antigen tests from the day of arrival into Hong Kong (i.e. Day 0) and Day 5 after arrival.
If you test positive for COVID-19, you will be required to self-isolate for a minimum of 5 days at your original accommodation or hotel. Further details can be found in the latest guidance issued by the Hong Kong SAR Government.
Proof of vaccination status
Fully vaccinated travellers are permitted to enter Hong Kong.
Hong Kong will accept the UK’s proof of COVID-19 recovery and vaccination record and proof of COVID-19 vaccination issued in the Crown Dependencies. Your last vaccine dose must have been administered at least 14 days prior to travel. Your NHS appointment card from vaccination centres is not designed to be used as proof of vaccination and should not be used to demonstrate your vaccine status. Children under the age of 12 who are not vaccinated will be allowed to enter Hong Kong.
Travel between Hong Kong, Macao and mainland China
Quarantine -free travel between Hong Kong and mainland China will resume from 8 January 2023. Hong Kong residents and foreign visitors in Hong Kong who wish to travel to mainland China should make a quota booking on the HKSARG’s online booking system if they are travelling via land border control points (i.e. Lok Ma Chau, Man Kam To, Shenzhen Bay, or Hong Kong-Zhuhai-Macao Bridge). For those entering mainland China by flight, ferry, or shuttle buses connecting the Hong Kong-Zhuhai-Macao Bridge, a quota booking is not required as long as they hold valid transport tickets. On their return to Hong Kong from mainland China, a quota booking is not needed.
All travellers crossing the border must present a report of negative PCR test taken no more than 48 hours before their departure.
People in Hong Kong can enter Macao test-free and quarantine-free. Those departing from Macao must present a negative rapid antigen test result for COVID-19, taken no more than 24 hours prior to departure, or a negative PCR test taken no more than 48 hours before departure. If they have been to mainland China in the past 7 days, travellers must present a negative PCR test taken no more than 48 hours before departure.
Ferry crossings between Hong Kong and Shenzhen or Macao have resumed. The high-speed rail service connecting mainland China is expected to restart operation soon.
If you’re not fully vaccinated
Hong Kong residents who are not fully vaccinated will be able to enter Hong Kong. Non-residents who are not fully vaccinated and have visited places outside mainland China, Macao or Taiwan within the past 7 days, will be denied entry into Hong Kong.
If you are unable to be fully vaccinated due to medical reasons, you may still be permitted entry to Hong Kong. You will be required to show proof of the relevant medical reason certified by a medical practitioner before boarding a flight to Hong Kong.
Children under the age of 12 who are not vaccinated will be allowed to enter.
If you’ve had COVID-19 in the past year
If you have previously infected with COVID-19 and have received one dose of COVID-19 vaccine, you will be considered fully vaccinated.
After recovering from Covid-19 you may continue to test positive for some time after, however, you may still enter Hong Kong if you can provide evidence of a negative rapid antigen test taken within 24 hours of your scheduled departure time.
Children and young people
More information and detailed guidelines for International Arrivals are available on the Hong Kong SAR Government Coronavirus web page.
Hong Kong residents of any age are permitted to enter Hong Kong, whether they are vaccinated or not.
For non-Hong Kong residents, there are different vaccination requirements depending on the age group. For non-Hong Kong residents:
12-17 years old travellers need to show proof of vaccination to enter Hong Kong. If they have received a BioNTech vaccination, a single dose will be accepted. Those who are not able to get fully vaccinated due to medical reasons may still be permitted entry to Hong Kong. They will be required to show proof of the relevant medical reason certified by a medical practitioner before boarding a flight to Hong Kong.
Children aged 0-11 are permitted to enter Hong Kong, even if they are not vaccinated.
If you’re transiting through Hong Kong
Transit services at Hong Kong International Airport, including those connecting mainland China, have resumed.
If you are transiting via Hong Kong International Airport, you are no longer required to provide evidence of a pre-departure PCR test before boarding your flight to Hong Kong, unless your destination is mainland China. In such cases, you should present a negative PCR test taken no more than 48 hours before departure. If in doubt, you should check with your travel agent or airline before travelling and check the Hong Kong International Airport website.
All passengers transiting Hong Kong Inter-national Airport may be subject to advanced screening measures, including temperature checks. Passengers deemed to have a high temperature will undergo further checks by the Port Health Office at the airport.
