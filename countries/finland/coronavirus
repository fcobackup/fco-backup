Cases of coronavirus (COVID-19) have been confirmed in Finland. The Finnish authorities have introduced a number of measures to limit the spread of the virus, including recommended self-isolation for 14 days for anyone travelling to Finland from abroad.
The Finnish authorities have declared a state of emergency in response to Coronavirus (COVID-19). Finnish borders will be closed initially between 19th March and 13th April to all non-resident foreign nationals entering the country, with some limited local exemptions. British residents should display an ID card or other proof of residence when arriving in Finland. Non-resident British nationals are permitted to enter Finland for limited essential or compassionate reasons with evidence for their travel, see the Finnish Border Guard website for more information. Passengers are allowed to transit through Helsinki Airport as long as they can verify acceptance at their final destination. Commercial means of returning to the UK by flight continue, but this may change at short notice. British nationals who wish to leave Finland should contact their travel operator to make arrangements to do so as soon as possible.
The Finnish Ministry of Health and Social Affairs has opened a Coronavirus hotline (open Monday – Friday, 0800 – 2100 and Saturday, 0900 – 1500) on +358 (0)2 95 535 535. The Finnish Institute for Health and Welfare has up to date information on Coronavirus in Finland.
Further information on coronavirus, including advice on preparing for foreign travel and helping reduce the spread of the virus, is available from Public Health England and on the TravelHealthPro website.
