From 4 July, Hungary is exempt from the FCO advice against all non-essential international travel. This is based on the current assessment of COVID-19 risks.
Travel is subject to entry restrictions
UK nationals and all other arrivals from the UK, will have to undergo a medical examination for COVID-19 when entering Hungary. You will need to self-isolate for 14 days unless you can provide upon arrival two negative COVID-19 tests, taken 48 hours apart and within five days of your entry date.
If you show signs of COVID-19 on arrival, entry to Hungary may be denied or you may be asked to go into government quarantine for 14 days.
See Entry requirements for more information before you plan to travel.

There are occasional political demonstrations in Budapest and elsewhere in the country. Some take place on or close to important national holidays with a political relevance, such as 15 March (anniversary of 1848 Revolution) and 23 October (anniversary of 1956 anti-Soviet Uprising). Peaceful political demonstrations have occasionally ended in violence. You should avoid all political demonstrations, monitor the media coverage of local events and be aware of your surroundings at all times.
Although there’s no recent history of terrorism in Hungary, attacks can’t be ruled out. See Terrorism
If you’re abroad and you need emergency help from the UK government, contact the nearest British embassy, consulate or high commission.
