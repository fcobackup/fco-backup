With effect from Friday 20 March at 11:59 local time, the LF Wade international airport will close for incoming passenger flights for two weeks. Non-residents of Bermuda will no longer be landed on Bermuda with immediate effect. Only returning residents will be allowed on flights to Bermuda until Friday 20 March at 11:59PM. Cargo flights will not be affected.
The seaport is closed to visiting vessels, but essential cargo operations bringing food, medicine, medical supplies and other essential goods will still continue to arrive in Bermuda.
Schools are now closed until 6 April.
Non-resident visitors to Bermuda should follow local advice and guidance. We strongly encourage any non-resident visitors on holiday to Bermuda to consider leaving as soon as possible to avoid difficulties they will face if travel out of the territory and the wider region are further restricted and they are unable to get home.
You should check the Bermuda Government website for more information.
