Entry and borders
Land borders are closed until 18 May. Restrictions remain in place to prevent foreign nationals who do not have a valid residence permit from entering Croatia. Croatians and their family members are allowed to return to the country. Exemptions are in place to permit the travel of healthcare professionals, EU (and UK nationals until December 2020) returning to their place of residence, goods carriers, cross border workers, diplomatic and military personnel, and passengers in transit. British citizens are permitted to leave Croatia and it remains possible to return to the UK by air and road. Further information about these restrictions can be found on the Croatian government website
A compulsory 14 day period of self-isolation remains in place for those entering Croatia from a number of European destinations, including the United Kingdom. Restrictions on travel may change at any time. You are advised to check the latest regulations before travelling.
Those refusing self-isolation will be denied entry into Croatia and be instructed to return to their point of origin. The Croatian Government has warned that failure to comply with public health decisions may result in fines or criminal charges being brought.
Local measures
Restrictions are in place to control the spread of the disease. These include shorter store opening times, a ban on mass gatherings, limited public transport and the closure of non-essential businesses and services. You should follow the latest instructions from the local authorities here.
Visas
On 27 March Croatian immigration authorities announced that foreign travellers to Croatia who are unable to leave due to COVID-19 restrictions will not face sanctions for overstaying the conditions of their stay. Those who are unable to leave on time are advised to contact their nearest police station to register their continued stay and to prevent complications upon departure.
