Crime
Most visits to the Dutch Caribbean are trouble-free. However, petty theft and street crime occur. There is violent crime amongst members of the illegal drugs world, but this rarely affects tourists. The main tourist areas are generally safe, but you should take sensible precautions. Avoid remote areas at night. Do not take valuables to the beach. Make sure purses and handbags are closed and not easy to snatch.
The islands of the Dutch Caribbean continue to be used to smuggle illegal drugs from South America to Europe and North America. You should have a heightened sense of awareness of this problem and never leave bags unattended. Under no circumstances should you discuss or agree to carry a package for anyone. Some airports have installed “body scanners” and you may be required to have a scan. Dutch authorities generally screen all baggage and passengers from the Dutch Caribbean.
Local travel
When taking a taxi, always check that it is a registered one and negotiate the price before taking the ride. Most taxis do not have meters.
Road travel
Traffic drives on the right-hand side. Main road conditions are relatively good, but roads can become slippery when wet and potholes can appear after serious showers.
Air Travel
Safety concerns have been raised about INSEL Air. The US authorities have prohibited their staff from using the airline while safety checks are being carried out. UK government officials have been told to do the same as a precaution. Due to reconstruction of the airport, passengers may experience brief delays upon arrival and departure, and minor inconveniences as the scale of services is limited.
Political situation
