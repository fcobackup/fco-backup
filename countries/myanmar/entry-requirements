This page reflects the UK government’s understanding of current rules for people travelling on a full ‘British Citizen’ passport, for the most common types of travel.
The authorities in Myanmar set and enforce entry rules. For further information contact the embassy, high commission or consulate of the country or territory you’re travelling to. You should also consider checking with your transport provider or travel company to make sure your passport and other travel documents meet their requirements.
Entry rules in response to coronavirus
Entry to Myanmar
Residents of the United Kingdom, or those who have visited the United Kingdom within the previous 14 days, are currently unable to enter Myanmar. Those not travelling from the United Kingdom, including British Nationals, should check the requirements for travel from that country to Myanmar with the relevant Myanmar Embassy or Consulate.
If you are on a flight transiting via the United Kingdom, you will only be allowed to enter Myanmar if your transit time was for six hours or fewer. This is subject to short notice changes. Prior to travel you should check with the Myanmar Embassy in London.
If you are travelling to Myanmar for work, read the guidance on visas and permits as the rules have changed since 1 January 2021.
New tourist visa applications are currently suspended.
At present Myanmar authorities can offer business visas to foreign nationals with a compelling case. You or your employer must make your case to your nearest Myanmar Embassy and obtain permission.
These arrangements are subject to change and at short notice.
Testing/Screening on arrival
There are temperature checks for all arrivals. Arrivals must provide evidence of a negative COVID-19 test result. You should not use the NHS testing service to get a test in order to facilitate your travel to another country. You should arrange to take a private test.
Testing requirements ahead of entry to Myanmar are subject to change. Confirmation should be sought from the relevant Myanmar Embassy or Consulate well in advance of your departure.
Quarantine requirements
Arrivals in Myanmar must enter government-arranged quarantine for a period of 10 days. You will be allotted your quarantine facility on arrival. You may have no choice. You are likely to be placed in the same government quarantine facility or hotel as all the other people on your flight. You will be provided with food, for which you will be charged.
You should confirm your quarantine requirements with the relevant Myanmar Embassy or Consulate before you travel.
All travellers will be tested for COVID-19 by RT-PCR on day 3 and day 7 during the quarantine period and will be required to pay for the testing fees. Travellers who test positive for COVID-19 will be immediately isolated and taken to a medical facility. Foreign nationals will be expected to pay the medical costs and other costs related to isolation and treatment in designated health facilities.
You may be required to do more than one COVID-19 test before you leave quarantine, even if you test negative.
If hospitalised with coronavirus, patients are obliged to use a government facility even if they have private insurance. Patients in government hospitals are generally expected to make their own arrangements for bringing in food and other essential supplies. Lone travellers will not be allowed out of isolation to buy food or make phone calls.
These arrangements are subject to change and at short notice. Confirmation should be sought from the relevant Myanmar Embassy or Consulate well in advance of your departure.
Data collection
On arrival, passengers may be asked to fill in a paper form giving your name, contact details and address.
Regular entry requirements
Before travel, we advise that all visitors check with their nearest Myanmar Embassy or Consulate to confirm your current visa will allow you entry, or the criteria for obtaining or renewing a visa.
Visas
British nationals must apply for a visa to enter Myanmar. If you have any queries about visas or entry requirements you should check with your nearest Myanmar embassy.
Passport validity
Your passport should be valid for a minimum period of 6 months from the date of entry into Myanmar.
Yellow fever
Check whether you need a yellow fever certificate by visiting the National Travel Health Network and Centre’s TravelHealthPro website.
UK Emergency Travel Documents
UK Emergency Travel Documents (ETDs) are not valid for entry into Myanmar. They are accepted for exit from Myanmar but a valid visa has to be added to the ETD once the document is issued. You will need a passport photo for Immigration. Please ensure you check with the relevant Embassy if you propose to transit through another country and also with your airline. A visa can take several days to issue and some countries may not allow them on an ETD.
