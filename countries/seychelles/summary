Community transmission of COVID-19 has been confirmed in Seychelles. The Government of Seychelles has issued new travel measures that will remain in place until further notice.
If you’re living in Seychelles or intend to travel to Seychelles, you’re strongly advised to familiarise yourself with these measures and to follow public health guidelines. The Ministry of Health in Seychelles has issued a list of new and additional measures on the Ministry of Health website. You should avoid travelling unnecessarily within the country, including between islands. You should wear a mask and observe social distancing at all times when in public. See Coronavirus
Inter-island public transport is operating with revised timetables and guidelines for passengers. If you intend to travel between islands, you should consult the relevant ferry and airline service schedules. See Coronavirus page
Most visits to Seychelles are trouble-free.
You should exercise caution when swimming, especially with children. Currents can be strong and drownings occur. Beaches which are safer at certain times of the year can be dangerous for swimming at other times. See Swimming
There is a problem with drugs in Seychelles, in particular heroin. Crime levels have risen as a result; there has been an increase in break-ins, robberies, burglaries and opportunist thefts against residents, expatriates and tourists. There were robberies and attacks at, and around, Cote D’Or beach on the island of Praslin in late 2017. Police responded with increased foot patrols and lighting. They advise visitors to take care when walking in this area, particularly at night. You should take sensible precautions to safeguard yourself and your possessions. See Crime
Piracy remains a significant threat in the Gulf of Aden and Indian Ocean. See Sea travel
Some UK networks do not allow roaming in Seychelles. You can buy local SIM cards in Victoria. You should check with your UK service provider to make sure that you can use a different SIM card in your phone before you travel.
Terrorist attacks in Seychelles cannot be ruled out. See Terrorism
If you’re abroad and you need emergency help from the UK government, contact the nearest British embassy, consulate or high commission.
