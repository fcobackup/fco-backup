Internet search of the words ‘COVID testing near me’ will bring up many private and local testing facilities (fees can vary). You may want to check with the relevant Embassy that the test you decide on meets the entry requirements for the country in question.

The Cyprus government has announced the launch of a help desk to assist travellers with queries regarding the use of the Cyprus Flight Pass. This service is accessible by telephone +(357) 2484 1234 and through the Cyprus Flight Pass e-platform. You should continue to track developments through the Republic of Cyprus Information Office.
