Travel in Lebanon
On 30 November the Lebanese government amended the curfew hours that had previously been in place. Movement is now prohibited between 11pm and 5am. Supermarkets and banks will be open until 10pm. Restaurants and gyms will also be open until 10pm and will operate at 50% capacity. Bars, pubs, coffee shops and night clubs will be closed. Public and private gatherings such as weddings and funerals have been banned throughout the country until further notice. You should check with organisers before attending any function.
Beirut International airport will remain open, as well as sea and land borders. All passengers are required to have their tickets with them when transferring to and from the airport. Some exemptions to COVID-19 restrictions are applied to aid workers. For further clarification, aid workers should contact the United Nations for advice.
When traveling around Lebanon, including to and from the airport, private cars should have no more than four people in them (including the driver). Wearing masks for all passengers is obligatory.
Fabric masks covering the mouth and nose must be worn when outside the home and in vehicles (unless travelling alone, or exercising). Individuals must maintain a safe distance from one another and avoid crowded areas. Those over the age of 65 years old are advised to stay home and not go out unless absolutely necessary.
Lebanese authorities may issue fines, impose road blocks, or imprison those violating these measures for up to three years. You should comply with all measures introduced by the Lebanese authorities and obey the instructions of the security forces. These measures may be changed at short notice.
