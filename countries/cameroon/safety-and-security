Crime
Mugging and armed banditry are a problem throughout Cameroon but particularly in Yaoundé, Douala, Ngaoundere and Bafoussam.
Avoid isolated or poorer areas of towns; for example in Yaoundé: - La Briquetterie and Mokolo market; and in Douala: Nkololun, New Bell - Akwa, Bonaberi and Village. Avoid walking around at night, particularly alone.
Be vigilant in public places. Trouble can flare up unexpectedly (eg at football matches). Make sure car doors are locked when driving around. Avoid wearing jewellery and only carry small amounts of cash and valuables.
Close and lock all doors and windows, particularly at night. Make sure burglar proof metal bars are installed. Identify callers through spy holes before opening doors, especially late at night.
Petty theft is common on trains, coaches and bush taxis and around bus stations and hotels. Taxis in cities operate like buses, picking up passengers while there is still room in the car. They often take indirect routes and many don’t meet basic safety requirements. There have been reports of violent assaults and robberies on taxi passengers. Only use trusted taxis and preferably book one from your hotel or restaurant.
Car-jackings, kidnappings and armed robberies have occurred along roads close to the borders with Central African Republic, Chad and Nigeria, and along the Bamenda-Banyo, Bafoussam-Banyo, Bafoussam-Doula and Yaounde-Garoua Boulai-Ngaoundere roads.
There have been incidents of kidnapping and hostage taking in the Far North, North, Adamawa, East, North West and South West regions of Cameroon over the past year. The long-standing policy of the British government is not to make substantive concessions to hostage takers. The British government considers that paying ransoms and releasing prisoners increases the risk of further hostage taking.
Foreign visitors and residents are often targets of scam artists. The scams come in many forms, and can cause significant financial loss. Scammers also target individuals and companies in the UK via websites, chat-rooms and by email. Advance fee scams are common in Cameroon. Cases involving the alleged adoption of children have been reported. Be very cautious about sending money or travelling to Cameroon to adopt a child where the information has come from a website or through emails. Cameroon does not have adoption agencies. Many victims are persuaded to pay large amounts of money before they suspect anything.
If you need to contact the Police, call 117. If you have been a victim of fraud from a police official, you should call 1500. If you need to contact the fire service, please call 118.
Local travel
There is an increased risk of displacement of Nigeria-based extremists into the Far North region following the declarations of a state of emergency in Nigeria’s Borno and Adamawa states. An increased presence of Nigerian extremists in Far North region had already been observed before the declaration, and there is also a general threat of kidnapping and armed banditry. If you’re in the Far North region, you should leave.
There is also a risk of displacement of Nigeria-based extremists into Cameroon’s North and Adamawa regions which border Nigeria’s Adamawa state. There has been an increased number of kidnappings in Cameroon’s Adamawa region across 2018. The ability of the High Commission to offer consular services in the Far North, North and Adamawa regions is limited.
The FCO advise against all travel to within 40 km of the border with Chad because of armed banditry, including poachers in Bouba Ndjida National Park in the North region.
The FCO advise against all travel to within 40 km of the border with the Central African Republic (CAR). There have been incursions by armed men from CAR and there have been fatalities. Armed banditry and kidnapping remains a risk. Numerous kidnappings have occurred in the period March to July 2015.
Take great care if you travel to the northern regions of Cameroon by road. The eastern route via Garoua-Boulai and Meiganga involves driving close to the border with CAR. The western route requires travel along the Bamenda-Banyo axis. The central route via Yoko requires travel on very poorly maintained roads through largely uninhabited areas, crossing a number of bridges in a poor state of repair. There is no fuel available on the route. If you must attempt this drive, carry plenty of water, sufficient fuel to enable you to turn back if necessary, a spare tyre and a satellite phone or VHF radio to summon assistance if required.
North West and South West (Anglophone) regions
The FCO advise against all travel to the North West and South West regions, except Limbe in Fako division, where the FCO advise against all but essential travel.
General strikes (or ‘ghost towns’) are called in the North West and South West (Anglophone) regions for each Monday, with additional days often called in particular periods including February and October. Violence and travel disruption is regularly reported on these days. You should be vigilant, monitor local media and avoid travelling within the region on such days.
There was an extended general strike imposed by armed separatists in February 2019, with reports of violence and loss of life. Urban transport in towns and cities was affected and vehicular traffic in and out of the region was restricted. Incidents of sporadic gunfire also occurred, including shooting in Bamenda, Buea and the outskirts of Limbe. Movement in and out of the North West and South West regions has now resumed, but there remains a risk of violence.
There have also been multiple clashes between the Cameroonian security forces and armed groups over the past year in many places in the North West and South West regions. In January and February 2019, clashes between the army and armed separatists were reported in the towns of Bafut, Tubah, Ndu, Widikum and in Lebialem division. Restrictions including night curfews and a ban on public meetings, which were imposed following violent and deadly clashes in 2017, remain in place. There is a high risk of violent criminality, especially at night. If you decide to travel to, or within, areas of the Anglophone regions where the FCO advise against all travel or all but essential travel, you should consider carefully the risks of travel, monitor developments closely, keep a low profile and minimise your movements.
Piracy is a threat in the Gulf of Guinea and particularly in the waters around the Niger Delta and the Bakassi Peninsula. Cameroon’s Rapid Intervention Brigade (BIR) patrol the waters. The ferry that operates between Limbe/Tiko in Cameroon and Calabar in Nigeria passes through areas where pirates operate. The Bakassi Peninsula is made up of mangrove forests and isolated islands that are difficult to police. Mariners should seek professional security advice and take appropriate precautions.
The FCO advise against all travel to Ndian division in the South West. Armed groups operate in this area. Clashes between the army and armed separatists have led to casualties. There is a high threat of kidnapping in Ndian division. The Korup National Park falls inside the area to which the FCO advise against all travel.
In November 2018, groups of students were kidnapped in Bamenda and Kumba and released after a few days. There were reports of deaths in some towns and villages in the Anglophone regions on 7 October last year and the days after, as a result of clashes between separatists and government security forces. A police station was attacked in Mile Four (Bonadikombo), Limbe in September last year. A security checkpoint was attacked at Mutengene (Tiko) along the road to Limbe in June 2018. Armed men violence on workers of some of the rubber and banana plantations along the main road between Mungo and Tiko has led to abandonment of farms. Other clashes have occurred in Bolifamba (Mile 16), Tole and Muea in Buea. An American missionary was killed near Bamenda in October last year. A Tunisian road technician was killed in a rescue operation in March 2018 in the South West. In June 2018, armed Anglophone separatist groups erected barricades on several spots along the Buea – Muyuka – Kumba road in the South West Region for several days. Travelers were stranded. There were clashes with the army as a result, with casualties. Spontaneous roadblocks and separatist checkpoints recur within the two regions. Kidnapping for ransom is common.
Lake Nyos
Lake Nyos in the North West Province emitted carbon dioxide suffocating about 1,700 people in 1986. There were no warning signs that this would happen and it could happen again at any time. There is also a concern that the wall of the dam holding back Lake Nyos is not sufficiently strong. Nearby Lake Mounoun is also saturated with CO2.
Road travel
Avoid all travel by road at night in rural areas, particularly on the Yaoundé-Douala trunk road, where accidents are common. Plan your journey carefully and travel in convoy, where possible. As mobile phone coverage is limited you should consider taking a VHF radio or satellite phone.
You can drive using a UK driving licence or International Driving Permit on first arrival, but you should obtain a Cameroonian licence from the Delegation of Transport as soon as possible.
Make sure any car you hire is adequately insured, preferably by written confirmation from the insurance company (rather than the car hire firm). If you are hiring a driver and car, make sure you are not liable for any accident or damage.
Apart from the major routes, roads in Cameroon are generally in poor condition. Many are badly pot-holed. Street lighting, where it exists, is poor. Pedestrians and stray animals on roads are a hazard. Many vehicles are poorly lit and badly driven.
Roadblocks set up by the police or gendarmerie, are common throughout Cameroon. You may be asked to show your passport, driving licence or vehicle registration documents. There are regular reports of uniformed members of the security forces stopping motorists on the pretext of minor or non-existent violations of local vehicle regulations in order to extort small bribes. Don’t pay bribes; ask the officer to provide a ticket, setting out the alleged offence so that you can pay at a local court.
Air travel
There is only one local airline operating between a few of the major cities, Camair-co. Scheduled flights are subject to frequent delays and cancellations. Several international airlines fly into Cameroon.
Rail travel
There is a railway from Douala-Yaounde-Ngaoundere. On Friday 21 October 2016, a train leaving Yaoundé en route to Douala derailed at Eseka (120km from Yaounde and 160km from Douala). Official sources in Cameroon confirmed the death of at least 80 people with over 500 injured. Passenger travel between Yaounde and Douala has been suspended following the train derailment. Travel between Ngaoundere and Yaounde by train is still possible.
Political situation
There are occasional isolated incidents of political unrest around the country. Be vigilant at all times, and avoid political demonstrations and rallies.
