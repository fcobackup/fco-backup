Terrorism
There is a high threat of terrorist attack globally affecting UK interests and British nationals, including from groups and individuals who view the UK and British nationals as targets. Stay aware of your surroundings at all times.
UK Counter Terrorism Policing has information and advice on staying safe abroad and what to do in the event of a terrorist attack. Find out how to reduce your risk from terrorism while abroad.
Terrorism in Turkmenistan
Although there’s no recent history of terrorism in Turkmenistan, attacks cannot be ruled out.
Border restrictions
Turkmen land border crossings can be subject to occasional and unannounced closures. The borders with Afghanistan and Iran are particularly sensitive.
Laws and cultural differences
Personal ID
Police sometimes carry out checks of identity documents. Always carry a copy of the photo page and the visa page of your passport, and keep your passport separately in a safe place.
Ramadan
Turkmenistan is a majority Muslim country. Ramadan is a holy month for Muslims. The dates vary by year and country. In 2025, Ramadan is expected to start around the end of February and finish around the end of March. During this time, do not:
eat, drink, smoke or chew gum in public in the daytime, including in a car or taxi
play loud music or dance
wear revealing clothes
swear in public
You should also:
check opening hours of shops and restaurants
be aware that if hotels and restaurants are providing food or drink in fasting hours, they may separate you from Muslim guests, for example with screens
be aware that driving may be erratic, particularly when people are trying to get home at dusk
be patient and show tolerance

Alcohol laws and bans
It is illegal to drink alcohol in any communal spaces, including:
parks or public squares
forests or beaches
train stations, airports or sea ports
underpasses
government offices
If you’re caught drinking alcohol in these places you can get a fine of 100 manats.
Smoking and e-cigarette bans
It is illegal to smoke outside or in any communal spaces unless they contain a designated smoking area.
Illegal drugs and prison sentences
If you’re found guilty of possession or use of illegal drugs, you could face a lengthy prison sentence in very basic conditions.
Taking photos in secure areas
Check before taking photos of or near airports, military infrastructure, police stations, government buildings or embassies. The guards at the presidential palace may tell you not to take photos of it.
The Turkmen can be sensitive about having their picture taken without their consent.
Internet and mobile network
Internet connections outside the larger hotels can be unreliable. Many social media apps and websites are blocked, including YouTube, X, Facebook and WhatsApp. Access to Yahoo, Gmail and Hotmail is often difficult. VPNs are illegal in Turkmenistan and are usually blocked as soon as the authorities identify them.
There is a single state-owned mobile telephone provider, Altyn Asyr, which uses the TM CELL brand. Altyn Asyr does not provide a roaming service and the quality of the network is low.
Relationships with Turkmens
The Turkmen authorities sometimes prosecute Turkmen women if they start a sexual relationship with a foreign man, who may be fined and deported.
LGBT+ travellers
Male same-sex sexual activity is illegal, and punishable by a prison sentence. Same-sex relationships generally meet with disapproval in Turkmen society. Avoid showing affection in public.

Transport risks
Road travel
If you are planning to drive a hire car or a UK vehicle, see information on driving abroad.
You’ll need to have both the 1968 version of the international driving permit (IDP) and your UK driving licence with you in the car. You cannot buy an IDP outside the UK, so get one before you travel.
Driving standards are poor. Road travel at night outside cities is particularly dangerous because of the condition of the roads. There is a 60km/h speed limit in much of Ashgabat, enforced by both static speed cameras and police with mobile speed cameras. There are no signs warning of speed cameras.
Taxis
Licensed taxis are clearly identified and are white or yellow. Avoid unlicensed taxis.
Although taxis have meters, drivers will usually ask foreign nationals for a fee of around 20 manat. They might also ask for payment in US dollars, but this is illegal. Most taxi drivers do not speak much English.
Extreme weather and natural disasters
Find out what you can do to prepare for and respond to extreme weather and natural hazards.
Earthquakes
There is a risk of earthquakes – usually tremors, but stronger earthquakes have happened too. Ashgabat was largely destroyed by an earthquake in 1948, when up to 100,000 people were killed.
The US Federal Emergency Management Agency has advice about what to do before, during and after an earthquake.
