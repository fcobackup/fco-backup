The information on this page covers the most common types of travel and reflects the UK government’s understanding of the rules currently in place. Unless otherwise stated, this information is for travellers using a full ‘British Citizen’ passport.
The authorities in the country or territory you’re travelling to are responsible for setting and enforcing the rules for entry. If you’re unclear about any aspect of the entry requirements, or you need further reassurance, you’ll need to contact the Embassy, High Commission or Consulate of the country or territory you’re travelling to.
You should also consider checking with your transport provider or travel company to make sure your passport and other travel documents meet their requirements.
Entry rules in response to coronavirus (COVID-19)
Entry to the Netherlands
The Dutch Government has announced that from 1 January 2021, non-EU/EEA nationals and nationals of non-Schengen states, including UK nationals, will not be permitted entry to the Netherlands for non-essential purposes due to EU-wide COVID-19 restrictions. Visit the Dutch Government’s website for a list of exemptions. This measure does not apply to UK nationals who are legally resident in the Netherlands, who will be allowed to re-enter the country, but will need to demonstrate they have a residency permit, a certificate of application or a document with their address, and may be subject to questioning by Dutch border authorities when they arrive in the Netherlands.
The Dutch Government requires all international travellers aged 13 and above who are travelling to the Netherlands by aeroplane, passenger ferry, train or coach to be in possession of a negative PCR COVID-19 test taken within 24 hours of departure for the Netherlands. You do not need to present a negative test if you are travelling from a country that is listed on the list of ‘safe countries’ published by the Dutch Government. As of 16 March 2021, a negative PCR COVID-19 test result taken within 72 hours of arrival in the Netherlands will also be accepted, provided you also present a negative rapid (antigen/LAMP) test taken within 24 hours of departure for the Netherlands. More information on these requirements and a list of limited exceptions can be found on the Dutch Government’s website.
The Dutch government will not accept the results of self-administered tests. This applies to both the PCR and the rapid (antigen/LAMP) test requirements. There is an exemption for hauliers, for whom self-administered tests will be accepted.
Travellers, including transit passengers, should check the Dutch Government’s website for comprehensive information on testing requirements and exemptions.
Hauliers are exempt from PCR testing requirements, but until 00:01 on 1 May 2021, hauliers who have been in the UK for more than 48 hours will need to present a negative rapid (antigen/LAMP) COVID-19 test, taken no more than 24 hours before boarding the ferry. See the Dutch Government’s website for more information on rapid testing requirements for hauliers.
After 00:01 on 1 May 2021, hauliers from the UK will no longer be required to present a negative test result to enter the Netherlands.
Passengers travelling via Eurostar or Eurotunnel should check our travel advice for France, as testing requirements and validity differ.
More details on test requirements, including exemptions, are available on the Dutch Government’s website. The Dutch government has published a checklist for travel to the Netherlands.
You should not use the NHS testing service to get a COVID-19 test in order to facilitate your travel to another country. You should arrange to take a private test. A list of private providers of coronavirus testing is available here.
The test requirements do not replace the requirement to self-isolate for 10 days upon arrival (see below).
If you are travelling via Belgium or France, check FCDO Travel Advice for those countries.
Testing/screening on arrival
If you’re travelling to or from the Netherlands by air you must complete a health screening form and have it ready to show on request during your journey, whether you are at the departure airport, on the aircraft or at the arrival airport. This form is not required if travelling to the Netherlands by road or ferry.
You may be refused permission to travel based on your health screening form.
On arrival in the Netherlands your health screening form will be checked by public health and security authorities.
Quarantine requirements
The Dutch Government has a colour-coded system of high-risk (orange/red) and lower risk (yellow) countries and regions. Travellers entering the Netherlands from high-risk (orange/red) regions or countries are required to self-isolate for 10 days upon arrival, unless stated otherwise in the Dutch travel advice. The UK is currently listed as a high-risk country.
You may leave quarantine to take a PCR test on day 5 after arriving in the Netherlands. If the result is negative, you can end your self-isolation that day. If the test result is positive, you need to continue quarantining and you will receive further instructions from the local health authorities. See the Dutch government’s website for full details of quarantine requirements.
Testing to end quarantine early is only possible if your stay in the Netherlands is longer than 5 days. If your stay is 5 days or shorter, you should self-isolate for the entire duration of your stay. Even if your test on day 5 is negative, the Dutch government advises you to take extra care and avoid people in higher-risk groups until after day 10.
You can make an appointment in advance to get tested for free on day 5 of your self-isolation by calling the municipal health service (GGD) on 0800 1202 (or +31 850 659 063 if you are calling from a foreign phone). You can also make an appointment online, but this is only possible on the day of your test.
Further information on self-isolation in the Netherlands can be found on the Dutch Government’s website (in English).
Data collection
Local health authorities may use passenger data to carry out contact tracing for passengers arriving from high-risk (orange) countries.
Regular entry requirements
Visas
The rules for travelling or working in European countries changed on 1 January 2021:
you can travel to countries in the Schengen area for up to 90 days in any 180-day period without a visa. This applies if you travel as a tourist, to visit family or friends, to attend business meetings, cultural or sports events, or for short-term studies or training
if you are travelling to the Netherlands and other Schengen countries without a visa, make sure your whole visit is within the 90-day limit. Visits to Schengen countries within the previous 180 days before you travel count towards your 90 days
to stay longer, to work or study, for business travel or for other reasons, you will need to meet the Dutch government’s entry requirements. Check with the Netherlands Embassy what type of visa and/or work permit you may need
if you stay in the Netherlands with a visa or permit, this does not count towards your 90-day visa-free limit
Any time you spent in the Netherlands or other Schengen countries before 1 January 2021 does not count towards your 90-day visa-free limit.
At Dutch border control, you may need to use separate lanes from EU, EEA and Swiss citizens when queueing. Your passport may be stamped on entry and exit. You may also need to:
show a return or onward ticket
show you have enough money for your stay
There are separate requirements for those who are resident in the Netherlands. If you are resident in the Netherlands, you should carry proof of residence as well as your valid passport when you travel. For further information on these requirements, see our Living in the Netherlands guide.
Passport validity
Check your passport is valid for travel before you book your trip, and renew your passport if you do not have enough time left on it.
You must have at least 6 months left on an adult or child passport to travel to most countries in Europe (not including Ireland).
If you renewed your current passport before the previous one expired, extra months may have been added to its expiry date. Any extra months on your passport over 10 years may not count towards the 6 months needed.
Before you travel, make sure your passport is in good condition. The Netherlands authorities often impound damaged passports and some travellers have had to get an emergency travel document to leave the country.
Travelling with children
Dutch border authorities have strengthened their precautions against child abduction. Parents (particularly fathers) travelling in sole charge of their children are regularly stopped for further checks at Schiphol airport and occasionally prevented from boarding flights.
You should carry a signed authorisation form for travelling abroad with a minor and associated documents (outlined in the above link). See also Get permission to take a child abroad.
UK Emergency Travel Documents
UK Emergency Travel Documents (ETDs) are accepted for entry, airside transit and exit from The Netherlands.
Moving to the Netherlands
If you intend to live in the Netherlands, you should get important documents (birth certificate and marriage certificates) officially certified (apostilled) at the FCDO Legalisation Office.
