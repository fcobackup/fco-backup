The New Zealand Government has announced temporary restrictions on travellers in response to coronavirus (COVID-19).
Most commercial flights from New Zealand to the UK have now been suspended, and flight availability is extremely limited. The UK operated a series of charter flights from New Zealand to help British tourists, short term visitors and their direct dependants to return to the UK.
Commercial flights
If you wish to return to the UK, the Air New Zealand/British Airways route via Los Angeles is still flying. Both airlines plan to operate this route throughout May and possibly beyond, depending on demand. The border restrictions announced for the U.S. on 20 April will not affect transit through Los Angeles International Airport (LAX) for British Nationals travelling from New Zealand. You should check the travel advice for the USA for the full detail on transit restrictions.
We understand from Qatar Airways that flights scheduled for departure from Auckland in June have been postponed to later in the year â€“ potentially not before October. Flights will still depart from Sydney, Melbourne and Perth.
Transit through Australia is restricted, but you can apply for exemptions. Full details can be found in our Australia Travel Advice.
Travelling to the airport
Foreign nationals in New Zealand can use public or private transport to travel to the airport in order to connect with international flights to their home country. During Alert Level 2, there are rules on how to use public transport: check the Alert Level 2 guidance for details. Further information is available on public transport in Auckland and public transport in Christchurch.

The first group of flights departed Auckland on 24, 28 April and 2 May and Christchurch on 26 and 30 April, flying to London Heathrow via Hong Kong.
In response to demand, the UK set up a second group of flights, which departed Auckland on 11, 15 May and Christchurch on 13 May, also to London Heathrow via Hong Kong.
