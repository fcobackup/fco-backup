The information on this page covers the most common types of travel and reflects the UK government’s understanding of the rules currently in place. Unless otherwise stated, this information is for travellers using a full ‘British Citizen’ passport.
The authorities in the country or territory you’re travelling to are responsible for setting and enforcing the rules for entry. If you’re unclear about any aspect of the entry requirements, or you need further reassurance, you’ll need to contact the embassy, high commission or consulate of the country or territory you’re travelling to.
You should also consider checking with your transport provider or travel company to make sure your passport and other travel documents meet their requirements.
Entry rules in response to coronavirus (COVID-19)
Entry to Finland
Finland has announced it will be restricting travel and suspending passenger flights from the United Kingdom from Monday 21 December until Monday 11 January.
Finnish borders remain closed to non-resident foreign nationals entering the country, with some exemptions. Non-resident British nationals are permitted to enter Finland for limited essential or compassionate reasons with evidence for their travel. Visit the ‘Restriction Category 2’ section on the Finnish Border Guard website for further details of exemptions. Border controls have been lifted for travel between Finland and a number of different countries and there is currently no requirement to self-isolate when entering Finland from these countries (see the Finnish Border Guard website for the current list). The restrictions on travel continue to be in force for travel between Finland and the United Kingdom and are reviewed regularly. Visit the Finnish Border Guard website for more information.
British residents should display an ID card or other proof of residence when arriving in Finland.
The Finnish Institute for Health and Welfare (THL) recommends that people travelling to Finland from the UK on or after 7 December 2020 should be tested for the coronavirus even if they do not show symptoms of the disease. Testing is available at Helsinki-Vantaa airport and is free of charge. Further information on testing can be found on the THL website.
Quarantine requirements
When arriving in Finland, you must avoid unnecessary close contact with others and self-isolate for a period of 10 days. The self-isolation period can be reduced if you undertake two voluntary tests (for more details visit the THL website)
Transiting Finland
There are no Finnish restrictions on cross-border traffic with other states in the Schengen area for commuter and other essential traffic. Restrictions for other travellers remain in place. See the Finnish Border Guard website for more information.
Passengers are allowed to transit through Helsinki Airport as long as they can verify acceptance at their final destination. Finavia strongly recommend that passengers use facemasks as they travel round airports in Finland, and Finnair have made the wearing of facemasks mandatory for passengers aged seven or over on their flights. Please check your carrier’s requirements before travelling.
Regular entry requirements
Visas
The rules for travelling or working in European countries changed on 1 January 2021:
you can travel to countries in the Schengen area for up to 90 days in any 180-day period without a visa. This applies if you travel as a tourist, to visit family or friends, to attend business meetings, cultural or sports events, or for short-term studies or training
if you are travelling to Finland and other Schengen countries without a visa, make sure your whole visit is within the 90-day limit. Visits to Schengen countries within the previous 180 days before you travel count towards your 90 days
to stay longer, to work or study, for business or for other reasons, you will need to meet the Finnish government’s entry requirements. Check with the Finnish Embassy what type of visa and/or work permit you may need
if you stay in Finland with a visa or permit, this does not count towards your 90-day visa-free limit. Any time you spent in Finland or other Schengen countries before 1 January 2021 does not count towards your 90-day visa-free limit.
At Finnish border control, you may need to use separate lanes from EU, EEA and Swiss citizens when queueing. Your passport may be stamped on entry and exit. You may also need to:
show a return or onward ticket
show you have enough money for your stay
Passport
Check your passport is valid for travel before you book your trip, and renew your passport if you do not have enough time left on it.
You must have at least 6 months left on an adult or child passport to travel to most countries in Europe (not including Ireland).
If you renewed your current passport before the previous one expired, extra months may have been added to its expiry date. Any extra months on your passport over 10 years may not count towards the 6 months needed.
ETDs
UK Emergency Travel Documents (ETDs) are accepted for entry, airside transit and exit from Finland.
