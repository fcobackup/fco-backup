Due to heavy snowfall in the mountains, there is an increased risk of avalanches. In the regions of Valais, Central Switzerland and Graubünden, several villages are cut off due to the closure of road and train connections. This currently includes Zermatt, Andermatt and Samnaun. Road and rail connections to Davos have now been restored after a temporary closure, but there remains a high risk of avalanches. At this stage the World Economic Forum (WEF) is not affected.
