This page has information on travelling to Qatar.
This page reflects the UK government’s understanding of current rules for people travelling on a full ‘British Citizen’ passport from the UK, for the most common types of travel.
The authorities in Qatar set and enforce entry rules. If you’re unsure how Qatar’s entry requirements apply to you, contact its UK embassy, high commission or consulate.
All travellers
The requirements for entering Qatar can be found on the Ministry of Public Health website, along with full details of Qatar’s travel and return policy.
With effect from Sunday 4 September all visitors travelling to Qatar aged 6 and above regardless of vaccination status, must bring a PCR test certificate with a negative result valid for 48 hours or a Rapid Antigen test certificate valid for 24 hours ahead of the scheduled departure time of the flight to Qatar. A Rapid Antigen self-test will not be considered valid for travel.
Visitors must also register via Ehteraz, the Ministry of Public Health’s pre-registration platform at least three days before arrival.
You must complete and sign an ‘undertaking and acknowledgement form’ prior to arrival. This form is available on the Ministry of Public Health website, pre-registration platform, and airline online booking form.
All visitors should download the Ehteraz app and activate this on arrival, through the use of either a local or international sim card.
You may be required to pass through thermal screening or temperature checks on arrival into Qatar at air, land or sea ports.
If you are fully vaccinated
Entry requirements for Qatar are the same for all travellers, regardless of COVID-19 vaccination status.
If you are not fully vaccinated
Entry requirements for Qatar are the same for all travellers, regardless of COVID-19 vaccination status.
Children and young people
Entry requirements for Qatar are the same for all travellers aged 6 and above, regardless of COVID-19 vaccination status. Minors age 0-5 years are exempt from testing requirements.
Residents
British nationals holding a Qatar residence permit no longer require prior approval to return to Qatar.
Residents will need to undergo a rapid antigen test within 24 hours of arrival. This applies to all residents regardless of age and vaccination status. The test can be administered at either a primary health care centre or private clinic/hospital – see the list of accredited COVID-19 testing healthcare facilities. Rapid antigen self-tests are not accepted. For further information visit the Ministry of Public Health website.
If you’re transiting through Qatar
Transiting is when you pass through one country on the way to your final destination.
Transiting through Qatar is permitted for travellers who meet the requirements of their final destination country.
There are no additional requirements for transiting passengers, even if you choose to use the transit hotel within the airport.
Travellers cannot remain in the transit area for more than 24 hours between flights, regardless of whether you are using the transit hotel within the airport.
Further information about transiting through Qatar can be found on the webpage for Hamad International Airport.
Check your passport and travel documents before you travel
Check with your travel provider to make sure your passport and other travel documents meet their requirements.
Passport validity
If you are visiting Qatar your passport should be valid for a minimum of 6 months from the date you arrive.
If you are a resident of Qatar your passport must be valid on arrival.
Visas
You can get a free 30-day tourist visa-waiver on arrival in Qatar if you’re travelling on a full British Citizen passport. If you’re travelling for any purpose other than tourism, and/or hold one of the other types of British passport, you must get a visa before you travel.
If you need to stay longer than 30 days, you must extend your visa waiver before it expires through the Ministry of Interior. If you fail to do so, you may receive an overstay fine, which must be paid before leaving Qatar.
You can find further information on visa requirements and extensions on the Qatar Ministry of Interior website
UK Emergency Travel Documents
UK Emergency Travel Documents (ETDs) are not valid for entry into Qatar. However, ETDs are accepted for airside transit and exit from Qatar. If you are seeking to exit Qatar on an ETD because your full validity passport has been lost or stolen, you must obtain a police report in order to do so. These reports can be obtained at any police station in Qatar. You should allow sufficient time to collect this report as they can take up to 2 days to be processed. Without this report you may experience difficulties at the airport. If the holder of the ETD is a new-born child with no previous passport or identification, an exit permit is required before exiting Qatar. These can be obtained from the Immigration Office in Al Gharrafa. If your destination is not the UK you will need proof of residency for your destination country. An emergency travel document does not grant you entry. You are responsible for checking you have the correct documents to enter your destination country.
Living and working in Qatar
If you’re applying for a residence permit, you will have to undergo a medical test including blood tests and a chest X-ray. The tests screen for diseases including, but not restricted to, HIV/AIDS, Tuberculosis, Hepatitis B and C. Testing positive may lead to further tests and possible deportation.
