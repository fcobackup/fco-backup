Before you travel check that:
your destination can provide the healthcare you may need
you have appropriate travel insurance for local treatment or unexpected medical evacuation
This is particularly important if you have a health condition or are pregnant.
Emergency medical number
There is no general emergency medical number in the Democratic Republic of the Congo (DRC). If you have a medical emergency which requires an ambulance, contact a hospital to make this request.
Contact your insurance company quickly if you’re referred to a medical facility for treatment.

Ebola
There are occasional outbreaks of Ebola in DRC. The authorities and the World Health Organisation declared the last outbreak over in September 2022. See more information on Ebola and similar diseases.

Healthcare facilities in DRC
FCDO has a list of English-speaking doctors in DRC.
There is also guidance on healthcare if you’re living in DRC.
Medical care is extremely limited. The Centre Prive d’Urgence (CPU) clinic in Kinshasa is able to cope with basic health problems and to stabilise a patient after most serious accidents. Outside Kinshasa, Western-standard medical facilities are almost non-existent. Medical evacuation to South Africa (or elsewhere) could be necessary. Make sure you have adequate travel health insurance and accessible funds to cover the cost of any medical treatment abroad and repatriation.
If you take medication regularly, make sure you bring enough for your time in the DRC, and that it is in properly marked packaging.
Travel and mental health
