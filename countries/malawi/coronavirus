The Malawian authorities have introduced a number of precautionary measures in response to the coronavirus (COVID-19) pandemic.
The Ministry of Health is now screening all travellers on arrival. Individuals showing with symptoms of coronavirus may be moved into a treatment facility. Self- isolation for 14 days will be mandatory for all those travelling: (a) from the UK; (b) from the European Union; (c) from the SADC region, where that country has confirmed local transmission of coronavirus; (d) from other countries with more than 700 cases; or (e) from countries with more than 100 new cases reported in 24 hours.
Visitors from high-risk countries for coronavirus, including the United Kingdom, are no longer permitted to enter Malawi unless they have a residence permit.
