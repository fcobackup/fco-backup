Ecuador is situated in an area of intense seismic activity. There is a high risk of earthquakes, volcanic eruptions and tsunamis. You should make sure you are aware of the risks and are familiar with the relevant safety and evacuation procedures.
In the event of a natural disaster, you should monitor official channels. The Ecuadorean National Geophysical Institute - IGEPN and the National Service for Risk and Emergency Management are the only official channels responsible for providing information and instructions. The ECU911 emergency services may also provide useful information. Follow the advice of the local authorities.
For information on seismic-volcanic activity, follow “IGEPNecuador” on Facebook (in Spanish).
Earthquakes
Given the high risk of earthquakes across Ecuador, you should familiarise yourself with safety procedures and particularly the instructions in your hotel. Further information on what to do before, during and after an earthquake is available from the US Federal Emergency Management Agency website.
Monitor the official sources above for accurate information and news. Aftershocks may occur, so remain calm, follow any instructions given locally, and keep your emergency backpack at hand.
Earthquakes and aftershocks can cause landslides, which can block roads.
The last major earthquake (7.8 magnitude) was on 16 April 2016, and caused extensive damage and hundreds of fatalities. The coastal provinces of Manabí and Esmeraldas were the worst affected, though the earthquake was also felt strongly in the capital, Quito.
Seismologists assess the risk of earthquakes in the province of Esmeraldas on the north-western coast as particularly high because of its proximity to the convergence of the Nazca and South American plates.
Tsunami
There is a high risk of tsunamis along the coast and in the Galapagos Archipelago. There is a network of sirens in Esmeraldas and Manabí provinces which will sound in case of a tsunami alert. You should familiarise yourself with evacuation routes maps and follow the advice of the local authorities.
Mountains and volcanoes
There are numerous active and potentially active volcanoes in the highlands of Ecuador and the Galapagos Archipelago, some of which are currently in a state of eruption. Ash fall from active volcanoes can disrupt national and international flights across the country and can also pose health hazards, especially for travellers with existing respiratory problems. Airports can close at short notice due to ash fall, check with your airline and the airport website before travelling to the airport.
There is a high risk of ‘lahars’ around glaciated volcanoes such as Cotopaxi. These are flows of water, mud, lava and debris which can be extremely destructive. The towns of Latacunga and Salcedo and low-lying areas in the valley to the east of Quito are particularly vulnerable (Los Chillos and Rumiñahui).
Ecuadorean law stipulates that anyone wishing to climb a glaciated mountain must be accompanied by an officially accredited guide.
The Sangay volcano, located in the Amazon region (Morona Santiago province), experienced an increase in its volcanic activity on 12 August. The eruption cycles, some with lava flow and ash emissions towards the west and southwest, are affecting the provinces of Chimborazo and Guayas provinces. Check with your airline for possible flight cancellations due to ash flow. From 16 August 2022, the internal eruption levels have returned to normal, but there are still reports of slight ash fall in Chimborazo province. You can check the current alerts in place for volcanoes (in Spanish). You should follow instructions issued by the local authorities, including, for example, wearing masks and goggles, and keeping away from the volcano and the Upano and Volcano rivers.
The Reventador volcano (Napo province) currently has access restrictions.
Rainy seasons
Rainy season usually runs from December to May. The irregular ‘El Niño/La Niña’ climatic phenomenon occurs every few years and can cause unusually heavy rains, widespread flooding and a hotter climate across Ecuador. The risk of landslides is higher at times of heavy rainfall, which can cut off roads.
During heavy rainy seasons, you should monitor local media and discuss your itinerary with your tour operator to avoid disruption. You should also avoid river crossings due to potential strong currents, and take care in affected areas. If you are planning to undertake climbing and high mountaineering, seek official advice from local authorities and tour operators. In the coastal region you should seek local advice on tidal activity and take appropriate precautions.
Forest fires
Forest fires occur in many areas of Ecuador, but especially in Pichincha province. This is due to high temperatures, strong winds and little rain, but also people lighting fires. If you see a fire call 911.
