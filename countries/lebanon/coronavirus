Travel in Lebanon
Lebanon has declared a total curfew which it will lift gradually to allow more businesses to operate. Movement is generally prohibited. You must not leave your accommodation. All hospitality businesses and public institutions will close and banks are operating a greatly reduced service. There are some exemptions for essential work and you can apply by mobile phone or internet to leave your accommodation to undertake certain activities such as medical appointments, chemists and food shopping. Food delivery services are operating, including in the evenings.
The Lebanese government have introduced an online system where you can request an exemption from the curfew for essential purposes e.g. going to a chemist, medical appointment or to buy food. You can do this online via this link.
Beirut International airport will remain open, but land and sea borders will close, apart from for those transiting Beirut airport who hold tickets for flights on that day. All passengers are required to have their tickets with them when transferring to and from the airport. Some exemptions to COVID-19 restrictions are applied to aid workers. For further clarification, aid workers should contact the United Nations for advice.
When travelling to and from the airport, private cars should have no more than four people in them (including the driver). Wearing masks for all passengers is obligatory. Given the total curfew, you are advised to book taxis to and from the airport ahead of time.
Fabric masks covering the mouth and nose must be worn when outside the home and in vehicles (unless travelling alone).
Lebanese authorities may issue fines, impose road blocks, or imprison those violating these measures for up to three years. You should comply with all measures introduced by the Lebanese authorities and obey the instructions of the security forces. These measures may be changed at short notice.
Keep up to date with information from your tour operator, transport or accommodation provider on the impact on any existing travel plans.
Accommodation
Hotels and private rentals are available. You should check that accommodation is open and receiving guests before booking, and request information on the measures being taken to prevent the spread of COVID-19.
