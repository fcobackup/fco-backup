This page gives you guidance on how to stay safely in Kenya as a visitor, if you are unable to return to the UK.
Everyone should comply with the measures put in place in Kenya to limit the spread of coronavirus (COVID-19).
Moving around in Kenya
A daily nationwide curfew is in effect, from 7pm to 5am (local time). During this window, everyone must stay at home or indoors, except for essential service workers. An extension of the curfew for 21 days was announced on 25 April.
Road, rail and air movements are restricted in and out of the Nairobi Metropolitan area, Mombasa, Kwale and Kilifi Counties. An extension of these restrictions for a further 21 days came into effect on 26 April. A similar travel suspension for an initial 21 day containment period has been applied to Mandera County, starting on 22 April. Movements within those designated areas are still permitted.
The government of Kenya has directed that face masks must be worn in public places, including supermarkets, and when using public and private transport. Social distancing rules have also been extended to apply during the use of private vehicles. Car owners are now limited to carrying 50% of their vehicle’s passenger capacity. This means five-seater vehicles will only be allowed to carry one passenger in addition to the driver, while seven-seater vehicles will only be allowed two passengers in addition to the driver.
All bars are closed until further notice. Restaurants can operate ‘takeaway’ services only.
The government has directed public places to set a maximum capacity to conform to social distance requirements of at least 1.5 metres. You can also expect shops, supermarkets and public transport systems to implement measures to ensure social distancing.
All meetings, conferences and events of an international nature have been banned. Kenyan citizens have been advised to avoid crowded places and to work remotely where possible.
Visas
If you need to renew your visa, the Kenyan Immigration Department has announced that visitor pass extensions will be processed online from 13 April 2020. Guidance on how to do so, as well as apply for other forms of documentation such as residence permits, is available from the Kenyan Immmigration Department.
Health
Pharmacies and other shops selling essential products remain open, though business hours may be affected by the daily nationwide curfew.
The authorities are conducting random temperature screenings in spaces frequented by the general public. If you show signs or symptoms of coronavirus and are able to self-isolate, you can expect to be directed to do so. If you cannot self-isolate, you can expect to be taken into a State health facility by the Kenyan authorities.

Finance
There is a range of financial support from the government that you can access while you are unable to return due to coronavirus restrictions.
If you’re in Kenya and have exhausted all other options to cover essential living costs while you wait to return home, you could apply for an emergency loan for your living costs from the UK government. This is a last resort option for those most in need and you would need to repay the loan when you are back in the UK. Apply for an emergency loan.
