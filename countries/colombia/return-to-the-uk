According to latest Colombian Government advice, airports are closed to international traffic until 1 September.
UK special flights
On 1 and 4 May, the FCO organised 2 special flights from Colombia to help British tourists, short-term visitors and their direct dependents return to the UK. There are currently no further government-organised flights planned from Colombia.
Future travel options
The British embassy is in contact with airlines, the Colombian authorities and other governments to make sure commercial options for returning to the UK are available as soon as possible.
This travel advice will be updated when departure options become available. Sign up for email alerts and follow the British Embassy on Twitter page and Facebook.
Call the British Embassy on +57 1 326 8300 or complete the contact form with your details (full name, location and description of your situation), to be alerted when options become available.
If you cannot leave Colombia at this time, see advice on staying in Colombia during coronavirus.
You will need to pay for your return travel to the UK. If departure options are available but you cannot afford the travel costs and have exhausted all other options for getting funds, you may be eligible to apply for an emergency loan from the government. This is a last resort option and you would need to repay the loan when you are back in the UK. If you need to discuss financial assistance for other departure options please call the British Embassy on +57 1 326 8300.
Travel to the airport
Permits from the local authorities to travel to the airport are no longer required. Your booking confirmation will suffice.
Your journey home: re-entering the UK
When you return, you must follow the rules for entering the UK. You:
need to provide your journey and contact details up to 48 hours before you’re due to arrive in the UK
are not allowed to leave the place you’re staying for the first 14 days you’re in the UK except in very limited situations (known as ‘self-isolating’)
See also the list of people who are exempt from the border rules.
The National Travel Health Network and Centre (NaTHNaC) also provides advice on how to stay safe as you travel by air.
