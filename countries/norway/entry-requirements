The information on this page covers the most common types of travel and reflects the UK government’s understanding of the rules currently in place. Unless otherwise stated, this information is for travellers using a full ‘British Citizen’ passport.
The authorities in the country or territory you’re travelling to are responsible for setting and enforcing the rules for entry. If you’re unclear about any aspect of the entry requirements, or you need further reassurance, you’ll need to contact the embassy, high commission or consulate of the country or territory you’re travelling to.
You should also consider checking with your transport provider or travel company to make sure your passport and other travel documents meet their requirements.
Entry rules in response to coronavirus
Entry to Norway
Norway has reintroduced restrictions for travellers form the UK. From midnight on Friday 21 August, all travellers from the UK will be required to quarantine for 10 days on arrival.
From 15 July, Norway is allowing entry for those resident in some Schengen or EU/EEA countries (which until the end of the year includes the UK) that have a sufficiently low level of coronavirus transmission.
UK nationals resident in a Schengen or EU/EEA country with a high risk of infection may enter but are required to self-quarantine for 10 days. Arrivals from these counties are required to travel directly to an appropriate place of quarantine, preferably using private transportation. Those who must use public transport should use a facemask during the journey. For countries outside the Nordics, Schengen or EU/EEA, restrictions continue to apply.
For more details on which countries and regions are exempt, see the Norwegian Institute of Public Health website. The list of countries is being reviewed at least every 14 days with amendments made as the transmission situation changes.
A free Coronavirus testing service is available at many international airports in Norway. Taking a test is not mandatory and a negative result does not exempt you from quarantine.
You can travel to Norway to begin work, provided that the work is imminent. In order to gain entry you will need to bring a copy of your work contract. If you are coming to Norway to work on a temporary assignment you should also bring evidence of this. Those who come to Norway to work are required to follow the quarantine regulations.
From 1 July, students who have been accepted on courses for the 2020/2021 academic year can enter Norway.
For more information, contact the Norwegian Embassy in London. Detailed guidance is available on the UDI website.
Transiting Norway
Non-residents are still able to transit via Norwegian airports as long as the final destination is not within Norway, but please check with your airline before departing.
Cruises
The Foreign, Commonwealth & Development Office (FCDO) advises against cruise ship travel at this time. This is due to the ongoing pandemic and is based on medical advice from Public Health England.
A number of Norwegian ports are restricting passenger embarkation and disembarkation. The situation can change rapidly so check with your cruise provider for the latest information.
Visas
The Norwegian authorities have confirmed that if your visa has expired or is at risk of expiring, you will be not punished if you overstay. You are not required to notify UDI or the police, but are asked to try to leave as quickly as possible.
Regular entry requirements
Visas
If you hold a British Citizen passport, you don’t need a visa to enter Norway. If you’re planning to stay longer than 3 months, see our Living in Norway guide and contact the Norwegian Embassy with any further questions.
The rules on travel will stay the same until 31 December 2020.
Visas from 1 January 2021
The rules for travelling or working in Europe will change from 1 January 2021:
You will be able to travel to countries in the Schengen area for up to 90 days in any 180-day period without a visa for purposes such as tourism. This is a rolling 180-day period.
Therefore, if you’re travelling to Norway, previous visits to the Schengen area within the 180 days before your date of travel would count against the 90-day limit.
If you are travelling visa-free to Norway and to other countries in the Schengen area, make sure your whole visit is within the limit.
To stay for longer, to work or study, or for business travel you will need to meet the entry requirements set out by Norway. This could mean applying for a visa or work permit. You should check with the Norwegian Embassy what type of visa, if any, you will need.
Periods of stay authorised under a visa or permit will not count against the 90-day limit.
The European Commission has not yet set out how the limit of 90 days in any 180-day period for visa-free travel will be implemented for those who are already travelling in the EU or Schengen Area on 31 December 2020.
If you are travelling to Norway before 31 December 2020 and will stay until 1 January 2021 or later, you should check with the Norwegian Embassy for information on how the 90-day visa-free limit will apply to you. This also applies if your stay includes travel to other Schengen area countries.
At border control for Norway, you may need to:
show a return or onward ticket
show you have enough money for your stay
use separate lanes from EU, EEA and Swiss citizens when queueing
Your passport may be stamped on entry and exit.
Passport validity
Your passport should be valid for a minimum period of 3 months beyond your intended period of stay. Further details on entering Norway can be found on the UDI website.
Passport validity from 1 January 2021
From 1 January 2021, you must have at least 6 months left on an adult or child passport to travel to most countries in Europe (not including Ireland).
If you renewed your current passport before the previous one expired, extra months may have been added to its expiry date. Any extra months on your passport over 10 years may not count towards the 6 months needed.
Check your passport is valid for travel before you book your trip. You will need to renew your passport before travelling if you do not have enough time left on your passport.
Svalbard
You’ll need your passport with you to enter Svalbard.
UK Emergency Travel Documents (ETDs)
UK ETDs are accepted for entry, airside transit and exit from Norway.
Pets
Check with the Norwegian Embassy in London before travelling with pets.
