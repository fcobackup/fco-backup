One commercial option to return to the UK from Albania remains.
If you live in the UK and are currently visiting Albania, you’re strongly advised to return now by commercial means. Don’t run the risk of getting stranded.
UK special charter flights will only operate for priority countries where commercial flights are not possible. You should not assume that these flights will become available in countries where commercial routes are operating. Please do not contact the contracted travel management company if no flight is advertised here.
Flights
Air Albania are operating a flight from Tirana to London on Saturday 2 May. Tickets will be on sale soon via the Air Albania website. At present there are no other flights planned to the UK.
Travelling to the airport
The Albanian authorities have suspended all public transport. Taxis will be allowed movement from Monday 27 April. If you are returning to the UK via Air Albania and you need to travel to Tirana International Airport, you should provide the private vehicle/taxi driver with a copy of your flight ticket in case he/she is stopped by the local police en route to the airport.

You will need to pay for your return travel to the UK. If departure options are available but you cannot afford the travel costs and have exhausted all other options for getting funds, you may be eligible to apply for an emergency loan from the government. This is a last resort option and you would need to repay the loan when you are back in the UK. For more information, you should contact Corporate Travel Management (CTM). CTM are a commercial partner of the FCO and are authorised to administer such loans on behalf of the FCO.
Arrival in the UK
