Coronavirus travel health
Check the latest information on risk from COVID-19 for Italy on the TravelHealthPro website
See the TravelHealthPro website for further advice on travel abroad and reducing spread of respiratory viruses during the COVID-19 pandemic.
Entry and borders
See Entry requirements to find out what you will need to do when you arrive in Italy.
Return to the UK
When you return, you must follow the rules for entering the UK.
You are responsible for organising your own COVID-19 test, in line with UK government testing requirements. You should ensure that the certificate is released in English, French or Spanish. You should contact local authorities for information on testing facilities.
If you are also taking a test to get a green pass for travel, you should note that the time allowances before travel are different from those for entering the UK. The test for the green pass must be within 48 hours of your flight departure time.
International travel from Italy
You must also follow Italian rules for travellers, including the use of masks in enclosed spaces including public transport and being able to show a ‘green pass’. See paragraphs below on the Green Pass and international travel.
Be prepared for your plans to change
No travel is risk-free during COVID. Countries may further restrict travel or bring in new rules at short notice, for example due to a new COVID-19 variant. Check with your travel company or airline for any transport changes which may delay your journey home.
If you test positive for COVID-19, you may need to stay where you are until you test negative. You may also need to seek treatment there.
Plan ahead and make sure you:
can access money
understand what your insurance will cover
can make arrangements to extend your stay and be away for longer than planned
Travel in Italy
Green Pass
A “green pass”, also known as an EU digital COVID certificate, is required to travel on flights, high speed and intercity trains, ferries and coaches linking more than 2 regions.
Proof of having been vaccinated against, or recovered from, COVID-19 in the UK will be accepted as a green pass as long as it is in the form of a verifiable digital QR code. (See ‘Demonstrating your COVID-19 status’).
If you are not vaccinated, you can obtain a green pass, valid for 48 hours by testing negative to a rapid COVID-19 test readily available from local pharmacies and test centers. The test provider will print your test results and will email you a unique code. You will then need to access the Government website (in Italian) and enter your details. Select the option ‘Utente senza tessera sanitaria’ (‘User without a health card’). You will be prompted to enter the type and number of the ID you showed when you got your test, as well as the code on your test certificate. Click ‘Ricupera certificazione’ (‘Get certificate’) to download your digital test result.
Children under the age of 12 are exempt from presenting a green pass for domestic events and activities.
Anyone falsifying a certificate is liable to face a fine of up to €3000 or a prison sentence.
Travelling within Italy
You must comply with the local travel regulations of the region you are visiting, even if you have only just arrived in Italy. Public transport links may be less frequent and seating limited to comply with social distancing measures. Masks must be worn on board public services.
More information on all these requirements is available from the Ministry of Health or the Agency for National Tourism.
International travel from Italy
To board a flight, including international flights, all travellers aged over 12 must be able to show a green pass. See Green Pass above.
If you are unvaccinated, you can obtain a green pass by testing negative to a rapid COVID-19 test readily available from local pharmacies. You must obtain the green pass no earlier than 48 hours prior to your flight departure. See Green Pass paragraph above.
Italian airport regulations require all travellers to wear a medical mask whilst on board flights to and from Italy. Masks should be replaced every 4 hours if it is not possible to maintain social distancing. You should check on board requirements with your airline.
If you are travelling to the UK, see Return to the UK for additional requirements.
Consult the European Union’s Re-Open EU page for rules on travelling within the EU.
Public spaces and services
Many of the restrictive coronavirus measures have now been eased. The following restrictions remain:
The mandatory use of masks in all outdoor spaces where social distancing is not possible, and whilst indoors. Children under the age of 6 do not need to wear a mask. You should pay close attention to signage when travelling and carry a mask with you at all times. Masks are mandatory at all times in yellow zones
Social distancing of one metre must be observed and gatherings should be avoided
Museums and exhibits should be pre-booked at least one day in advance
Reduced attendance to competitive group sports
A “green pass” (see Green pass above) is required to access many public spaces including indoor seating in bars and restaurants, museums, exhibitions, well-being centres, swimming pools, fairs and large events. A green pass is required to participate in civil or religious ceremonies. Tourists are required to show a green pass if they wish to use the indoor wellness facilities in their hotel including swimming pools, gyms and spas. A green pass is also required to access most forms of transport, see Travel in Italy section. A green pass is required for entering the Vatican City State except for attending liturgical celebrations strictly for the duration of the ceremony only.
Children under the age of 12 are exempt from presenting a green pass for domestic events and activities.
Information on regional classifications, or on regional COVID zones, is available on the Ministry of Health website (in English).
Regional and local authorities in Italy are empowered to adjust these measures where required, which may occur at short notice. You are strongly advised to consult the websites for the regions in which you are travelling for the latest information. You should also pay close attention to local signage.
You can find more information on measures on the Ministry of Health website (in English) and Frequently Asked Questions on the Ministry of Foreign Affairs website (in English).
Healthcare in Italy
COVID-19 testing is widely available at private clinics. Rapid testing is also available in many pharmacies, and, in some regions, drive-in testing is available. You are strongly advised to consult the website for the region from which you are travelling as test facilities vary across regions. See “Where to find a COVID-19 test” for the list of COVID-19 test providers held by the British Embassy.
Developing symptoms of COVID-19 while in Italy
If you think you have symptoms, including a fever or respiratory difficulties such as shortness of breath or a cough, you should stay in your accommodation and call your regional hotline. Most of the regional hotlines listed have English speaking staff. You can also call your local ASL (Azienda Sanitaria Locale).
If you are staying in a hotel or resort, your accommodation provider may have a list of private doctors that they can call to assess your symptoms and conduct a COVID-19 test.
If you have arranged your own accommodation you can find details of English speaking doctors on our list of healthcare providers.
Remember that an EHIC or GHIC covers state healthcare only, not private treatment. You will be responsible for the cost of any treatment provided by a private doctor or private clinic.
Testing positive for COVID-19 while in Italy
If you are tested and the result is positive, you must self-isolate in your accommodation and call your regional hotline as set out above.
If you have tested positive for the Beta variant of Covid, you will be required to quarantine in Italy for at least 10 days and take a negative molecular (PCR) test before you can leave. If you have had Covid symptoms, you also need to have been symptom-free for at least 3 days.
If you have tested positive for a NON-Beta variant of Covid, you will be required to quarantine in Italy for at least 10 days and take a negative molecular (PCR) or rapid antigen test before you can leave. If you have had Covid symptoms, you also need to have been symptom-free for at least 3 days. If you continue to test positive, you can still end quarantine after 21 days (of which at least 7 need to be symptom free).
You may be able to remain in your existing accommodation for quarantine, or be required to transfer into a state hospital or other government-provided accommodation. You may be required to fund accommodation.
Depending on local arrangements, travellers in groups may be required to stay in separate accommodation (e.g. if a sufficient number of rooms is not available in one venue, your group may be spread across different accommodation locations).
You should follow the advice of the local authorities at all times.
Quarantine hotels
If you test positive for COVID-19 you may have to enter a quarantine hotel. This may or may not be funded by the Italian government, depending on facilities available.
The UK government will not cover mandatory quarantine costs for British nationals. EHIC or GHIC cards therefore cannot be used to cover the cost of staying in a quarantine hotel if payment is required. Make sure you have access to funds to cover the costs or take out insurance, checking the policy has adequate cover.
If you have or are entitled to an EHIC or GHIC and you need state healthcare treatment while staying at a quarantine hotel, the UK government will fund treatment as usual through the EHIC/GHIC scheme.
Remember that an EHIC or GHIC does not cover private treatment. You will be responsible for the cost of any treatment provided by a private doctor or hospital.
In some Italian regions, you may be required to take a coronavirus test if you spend 48 hours or two consecutive nights in a hospital for any reason. If you test positive, you will be required to quarantine, as outlined above.
In the case of an emergency you should call Italy’s 112 emergency number. English speaking operators are available.
For contact details for English speaking doctors, visit our list of healthcare providers. Find out more from the NHS website about EHIC and GHIC healthcare cover abroad. For information regarding access to healthcare in Italy see healthcare for UK nationals visiting the EU. Your emotional and mental wellbeing is important.

COVID-19 vaccines if you live in Italy
Wherever possible British nationals should aim to be vaccinated in the country where they live. We will update this page when the Government of Italy announces new information on the national vaccination programme. You can sign up to get email notifications when this page is updated.
The Italian national vaccination programme started in December 2020 and is using the AstraZeneca, Moderna and Pfizer-BioNTech vaccines. British nationals resident in Italy are eligible for vaccination. The Italian Medicines Agency (AIFA) has issued comprehensive information, on the vaccine and the documentation required to book an appointment.
Many regional authorities have launched on-line booking platforms and opened call centres for bookings. Regional requirements vary, with booking platforms requiring you to enter the details of your tessera sanitaria (Italian health card), a codice fiscale or STP card. Some regions are now offering a dedicated vaccination service to those not registered with the Italian health system. You should consult the regional health pages where you live.
An interactive map (in Italian) details a list of vaccine administration points by region.
Find out more, including about vaccines that are authorised in the UK or approved by the World Health Organisation, on the COVID-19 vaccines if you live abroad.
If you’re a British national living in Italy, you should seek medical advice from your local healthcare provider. Information about COVID-19 vaccines used in the national programme where you live, including regulatory status, should be available from local authorities.
If you receive your COVID-19 vaccination in Italy, you can get an EU Digital COVID Certificate from the national authorities. The Certificate proves that you have been vaccinated against COVID-19, received a negative test result, or recovered from COVID-19. It will help facilitate your travel within the EU and, in some countries, you can use it to demonstrate your COVID-19 status to businesses and other organisations. For further information visit the European Commission’s EU Digital COVID Certificate page.
