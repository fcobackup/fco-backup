The Foreign, Commonwealth & Development Office (FCDO) advises against all non-essential travel to Italy, based on the current assessment of COVID-19 risks in the country.
The FCDO is not advising those already travelling in Italy to leave at this time. Travellers should follow the advice of the local authorities on how best to protect themselves and others, including any measures that they bring in to control the virus. You should contact your tour operator or airline if you have any questions about your return journey.
If you are returning to the UK from Italy on or after 4am on 18 October, you will need to self-isolate on your return (unless you are exempt). Check the latest guidance for England, Northern Ireland, Scotland and Wales.
Travel to Italy is subject to entry restrictions
When you arrive in Italy from the UK, you must show evidence that you tested negative for COVID within the 72 hours before your travel. Do not use the NHS testing service for a test to travel to Italy. You should arrange to take a private test.
Alternatively, you can get a free test on arrival at some airports, or at a testing facility in Italy shortly after you arrive. If you test positive in Italy, you will be required to quarantine. Your quarantine may last from 10 days to 3 weeks, so you should be prepared in case you test positive.
If you have stayed in or transited through a small number of listed countries in the 14 days before you enter Italy, you’ll also need to self-isolate for 14 days on entering Italy. If you cannot do that for any reason, you may be refused entry to Italy.
You should download and complete a self-declaration from the Ministry of Interior before you travel to Italy and inform local authorities of your presence.
See Entry requirements for more information before you plan to travel.
