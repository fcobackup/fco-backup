If you’re in Laos and intend to leave, you should do so as soon as possible. It is currently still possible to leave Laos by some international air routes and the land borders with Cambodia and China, but there is no guarantee this will continue. The number of international flights out of Laos is reducing rapidly as a result of travel restrictions.
If you’re planning to visit or transit other countries in the region, you should check the latest travel advice of your destinations for the latest information on entry restrictions in response to coronavirus.
The British Embassy Vientiane is issuing updates on the UKinLaos Facebook page with the latest available information on departure options for British nationals wishing to leave Laos.
