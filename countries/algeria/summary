30km of the borders with Libya, Mauritania, Mali and Niger

Terrorists are very likely to try to carry out attacks in Algeria, including kidnappings. Terrorist attacks have focussed on the Algerian state, but attacks could be indiscriminate and include foreigners. There’s also a risk that lone actors could target foreigners. You should be vigilant at all times and take additional security precautions, especially in: towns and cities; the southern, Libyan and Tunisian border areas; rural and mountainous areas in the north; and the Sahara.
The threat from terrorism is higher in some parts of the country:
the southern border (where the kidnap risk is concentrated)
the Libyan and Tunisian borders
rural, and particularly mountainous, areas in the north and between Tunisia and Algiers
the Sahara
We’re aware of reports of a number of cholera cases in the provinces of Algiers, Blida, Bouira, Tipaza, Medea and Ain Defla. See information on cholera for precautions to take against contracting the disease. See Health.
The Algerian authorities devote considerable resources to the safety of foreign visitors. In cities there’s a clear security presence, which can feel intrusive. Authorities will want to know your travel plans when travelling outside major cities and may assign police or gendarmes to protect you.
If you’re travelling independently you should notify the Ministry of Foreign Affairs or local authorities of your plans. Your hotel should be able to help you with contacting local authorities. This doesn’t apply if you have dual Algerian nationality. You should accept any security escort you’re offered and co-operate with authorities. See Terrorism.
When moving around Algiers and the other main cities, you should avoid areas that you don’t know, especially after dark. Travelling in rural areas and at night is particularly risky and it’s always advisable to travel with a reputable guide or companion in these areas. Avoid travel by road at night outside the major cities and motorways. See Crime and Local travel
