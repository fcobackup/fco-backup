The FCDO advise against all travel to Transnistria
There are multiple reports of widespread military activity in Ukraine. Since January 2022, the build-up of Russian forces on Ukraine’s borders has increased the threat of military action. Transnistria is outside the control of the Moldovan authorities. Our ability to offer consular support within this region is extremely limited, and in the event of military action on/near the border with Ukraine, would be further reduced. See Safety and security
