Be prepared for your plans to change
No travel is risk-free during COVID-19. Countries may further restrict travel or bring in new rules at short notice, for example due to a new COVID-19 variant. Check with your travel company or airline for any transport changes which may delay your journey home.
If you test positive for COVID-19, you may need to stay where you are until you test negative. You may also need to seek treatment there.
Plan ahead and make sure you:
can access money
understand what your insurance will cover
can make arrangements to extend your stay and be away for longer than planned
Travel in Nigeria
Passengers will be asked to follow a number of additional health procedures, including the following:
you must wear a mask or face covering
all passengers’ temperature will be taken on arrival at the airport
you are required to observe social distancing measures
you will be asked to use hand washing facilities installed outside the airports

Most states in Nigeria have introduced their own restrictions on movement. All travellers and residents in Nigeria are encouraged to monitor announcements by the Nigerian authorities on further restrictions, which may be introduced at short notice.
The Federal Government has relaxed the lockdown restrictions in place in Abuja and Lagos and replaced them with new requirements, including a nationwide daily night time curfew between midnight and 4am and the mandatory use of face masks in public.
Public spaces and services
Gatherings of over 50 people outside of work places are prohibited, including all weddings, conferences and sporting events. Places of worship are permitted to hold services, subject to limitations set by state authorities.
Visits to public institutions, including government buildings, have been limited.
Additional measures include a mandatory requirement to wear face masks in public spaces. Check the Nigerian Centre for Disease Control website for updates on further guidance on the implications of the lockdown restrictions.
Healthcare in Nigeria
Pharmacies are classified as an essential service, and will remain open. Most medicines that require a prescription from a doctor in the UK will require one in Nigeria. If necessary, you should get an electronic prescription from your medical practitioner to enable a local doctor to write one.
Unlike in the UK, you will need to go to a pharmacy or chemist to obtain most over-the-counter medicines. Only a very limited selection are available at supermarkets or other stores. Pharmacies are widely available. They will accept prescriptions from the UK.
For contact details for English speaking doctors visit our list of healthcare providers.

Help and support
If you need urgent consular assistance, contact your nearest British embassy, high commission or consulate. All telephone numbers are available 24/7.
