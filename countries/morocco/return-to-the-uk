There are currently no regularly scheduled commercial options available to return to the UK from Morocco.
If you cannot leave Morocco at this time, see advice on staying in Morocco during coronavirus.
Flights
The British Embassy repatriation flight operation ended on 26 June and no further flights are planned to the UK.
If you are a British national wishing to return to the UK send your full details, including name as it appears on your UK passport, nationality(s), location, email and contact telephone number to Morocco.BritishSupport@fco.gov.uk . The British Embassy will add your name to a waiting list and offer you an option to fly to a EU destination if there are available spaces on flights being organised by other Embassies.
The Embassy cannot provide flight assistance/consular support to other countries’ nationals, even if they have been living legally in the UK. Non-UK passport holders should seek flight assistance/consular support from the Embassy, High Commission, or Government of their nationality.
Ferries
If you are a British national travelling in a vehicle (eg camper van) wishing to cross in to mainland Europe send your full details, including name as it appears on your UK passport, vehicle details, location, email and contact telephone number to Morocco.BritishSupport@fco.gov.uk. The British Embassy will pass your details to the embassies of France and Spain in Rabat asking if you can be allocated a reservation if there are any spaces on ferries from Tangier Med to those countries. Please note however that these embassies are prioritising their own nationals, of which there are many thousands trying to return home.
Future options
This travel advice will be updated with information on departure options that become available. Sign up for email alerts and follow the British Embassy Rabat on Twitter and Facebook.
You will need to pay for your return travel to the UK. If departure options are available but you cannot afford the travel costs and have exhausted all other options for getting funds, you may be eligible to apply for an emergency loan from the government. This is a last resort option and you would need to repay the loan when you are back in the UK. See the Finance Section below.
Your journey home: re-entering the UK
When you return, you must follow the rules for entering the UK. You:
need to provide your journey and contact details up to 48 hours before you’re due to arrive in the UK
are not allowed to leave the place you’re staying for the first 14 days you’re in the UK except in very limited situations (known as ‘self-isolating’)
See also the list of people who are exempt from the border rules.
The National Travel Health Network and Centre (NaTHNaC) also provides advice on how to stay safe as you travel by air.
