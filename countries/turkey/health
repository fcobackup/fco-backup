At least 8 weeks before your trip, check the latest country-specific health advice from the National Travel Health Network and Centre (NaTHNaC) on the TravelHealthPro website. Each country-specific page has information on vaccine recommendations, any current health risks or outbreaks, and factsheets with information on staying healthy abroad. Guidance is also available from NHS (Scotland) on the FitForTravel website.
General information on travel vaccinations and a travel health checklist is available on the NHS website. You may then wish to contact your health adviser or pharmacy for advice on other preventive measures and managing any pre-existing medical conditions while you’re abroad.
The use or possession of some common prescription and over-the-counter medicines is controlled in Turkey. For more information on controlled medicines and the relevant documentation required, contact the nearest Turkish Embassy or Consulate before you travel. See this guidance from NaTHNaC on best practice when travelling with medicines.
While travel can be enjoyable, it can sometimes be challenging. There are clear links between mental and physical health, so looking after yourself during travel and when abroad is important. Information on travelling with mental health conditions is available in our guidance page. Further information is also available from the National Travel Health Network and Centre (NaTHNaC)
Coronavirus
There is an ongoing outbreak of coronavirus (COVID-19) in China, some other countries in the region and elsewhere. There has been one confirmed case of infection in Turkey to date.
The Turkish authorities have introduced a number of precautionary measures. All international passengers are being screened with a thermal camera. Those displaying signs of a temperature will then be referred to a medical adviser. You should comply with any additional screening measures put in place by the authorities.
The entry or transit via Turkey of any passenger who has been to China, South Korea, Iran, Iraq and Italy in the last fourteen days, will not be permitted. The Turkish Ministry of Health have confirmed that passengers with a residency permit will be allowed to enter Turkey but they will be tested on arrival for COVID-19. A positive test will lead to the passenger going straight to the quarantine facility. A negative test will lead to mobility restrictions – either self-isolation or full quarantine for 14 days. You should carry additional supplies of necessary medication in carry-on luggage.
All passenger flights to and from Nakhchivan, Italy, Iraq, South Korea, Iran and China from Turkey have been cancelled due to coronavirus outbreaks in those countries. Land crossings with Iran and Iraq have also been closed.
Keep up to date with information from your tour operator, transport or accommodation provider on the impact on any existing travel plans. Delays at airports are possible.
Further information on coronavirus, including advice on preparing for foreign travel and helping reduce the spread of the virus, is available from Public Health England and on the TravelHealthPro website.
Medical treatment
If you need emergency medical assistance during your trip, dial 112 and ask for an ambulance. You should contact your insurance/medical assistance company promptly if you are referred to a medical facility for treatment.
The European Health Insurance Card (EHIC), is not valid in Turkey. Make sure you have adequate travel health insurance and accessible funds to cover the cost of any medical treatment abroad and repatriation.
