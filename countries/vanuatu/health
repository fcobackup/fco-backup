Healthcare in Vanuatu
Medical facilities in Vanuatu are basic and limited in range and availability. There are medical clinics in Port Vila, some with Australian-trained GPs, which offer primary care. More serious cases will require evacuation to Australia or New Zealand. Make sure you have adequate travel health insurance and accessible funds to cover the cost of any medical treatment abroad, medical evacuation and repatriation.
