Entry and borders
International flights have been suspended until 9 May. International rail travel is suspended until further notice. Borders are closed to most non-Polish nationals. These measures may be extended.
If you are a non-Polish national you cannot enter Poland unless you are a:
Spouse, child or individual under the permanent care of a Polish national; or
Holder of a Pole’s Card; or
Holder of the right to permanent or temporary stay in Poland or a work permit holder; or

Diplomat, consular staff member, representative of an international organisation or a member of their family transiting Poland, leaving a maximum of 24 hours after entry.
You will be required to self-isolate on arrival in Poland for 14 days (unless you are a commercial driver entering Poland for a limited time for the sole purpose of transporting goods). You will be required to download a special “Home Quarantine” app on a smartphone that allows the local authorities to provide information and stay in regular touch during your self-isolation and check you are abiding by the strict quarantine rules. You will also be required to provide information on arrival about your place of stay or address and a telephone number with which you can be contacted regularly during your self-isolation.
Local measures
Hotels and short term accommodation establishments have been closed to new guests since 2 April but will be allowed to re-open subject to strict sanitary rules from 4 May.
You must cover your nose and mouth when outside (with a mask or scarf).
When outside, you should keep a 2 metre distance from others, unless you are a parent with a child under 13 or the carer of a disabled person. Minors under the age of 13 are only allowed to leave home if accompanied by an adult. A limited number of people at any one time are allowed to attend religious services.
Beaches, zoos, playgrounds, cinemas, operas and theatres are currently closed. Museums, libraries and cultural venues will start to open from 4 May with limitations. If you plan to visit a cultural venue from 4 May we recommend first consulting their website for information about opening. Many have information in English as well as Polish. National Forests and parks are open, though the nose and mouth covering and social distancing rules above apply if you visit them.
Grocery shops, pharmacies and banks remain open. The number of customers at any one time has been restricted and you may have to queue outside until others have finished their shopping. You will be required to wear gloves in shops for sanitary reasons. Shopping centres will re-open on 4 May with limits on how many customers can be present at any one time and food courts remain closed. Restaurants, pubs, clubs and casinos are closed but home delivery services are permitted.
Public transport use is limited to 50% of available seating to maintain appropriate distance between passengers. You can still use taxis.
There are fines between £1000 - £6000 (5000 – 30000 PLN) if you are found breaking these rules.
All schools and universities are closed until 24 May although nurseries and kindergartens will be allowed to reopen, subject to strict sanitary rules, from 6 May.
The above measures may be extended further, in scope and time, at short notice.
UK nationals living in Poland should note that the Office for Foreigners has put limitations on in-person appointments.
