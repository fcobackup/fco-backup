Mozambique is regularly affected by natural disasters, including floods, drought and cyclones. Cyclones and floods are particularly common during the rainy season (November-April).
Floods and landslides are likely in affected areas. Monitor local reports and international weather updates from the World Meteorological Organisation, check your routes before travelling around the country and follow the advice of the local authorities.
Tropical cyclone Gombe made landfall in Nampula Province in northern Mozambique on 11 March with flooding and high winds causing wide spread damage to infrastructure in the region.
You should monitor the National Meterological Institute website (in portuguese) for the latest information and follow instructions from the local authorities.
See our Tropical cyclones page for advice about how to prepare effectively and what to do if youâ€™re likely to be affected by a tropical cyclone.
