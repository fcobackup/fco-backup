This page gives you guidance on how to stay safely in Georgia as a visitor, if you are unable to return to the UK.
Everyone should comply with the measures put in place in Georgia to limit the spread of coronavirus (COVID-19).
Moving around in Georgia
For information on entering Georgia, see Entry Requirements
Most coronavirus restrictions have now been lifted. Shops, restaurants and public transport have now re-opened. Railways and certified hotels will re-open from 15 June. Educational establishments remain closed and working from home is encouraged. There remains a ban on gatherings of more than 10 people. The limit on only 3 people in cars, with passengers restricted to the rear seats, remains in place for taxis only. Those over 70 should only leave home to go the nearest grocery, pharmacy or medical centre. It is mandatory to wear masks in enclosed spaces such as shops and on public transport. Failing to do so can result in a 20 lari (approx. £5) fine for an individual or 500 lari (approx. £130) for a legal entity. In areas where there is an unexplained case of coronavirus, lockdown measures may be introduced without warning.
Health
A number of medical facilities have already been prepared specifically for coronavirus patients, with further facilities in reserve. If you think you might have the symptoms of coronavirus you should call the Georgian Emergency number 112. There are also Hotlines for the Health Ministry on 1505 and the Centre for Disease Control on 116 001.

Finance
There is a range of financial support from the government that you can access while you are unable to return due to coronavirus restrictions.
If you’re in Georgia, and have exhausted all other options to cover essential living costs while you wait to return home, you could apply for an emergency loan for your living costs from the UK government. You can only apply if you normally live in the UK and you cannot return home. This last-resort option is for those most in need, and you would need to repay the loan when you are back in the UK. Apply for an emergency loan.
