Returning to the UK
Travelling from and returning to the UK
If you plan to pass through another country to return to the UK, check the travel advice for the country you’re transiting. If you will pass through a red list country, book your hotel quarantine package before travelling to the UK.
When you return, you must follow the rules for entering the UK.
You are responsible for organising your own COVID-19 test, in line with UK government testing requirements.
Be prepared for your plans to change
No travel is risk-free during COVID. Countries may further restrict travel or bring in new rules at short notice, for example due to a new COVID-19 variant. Check with your travel company or airline for any transport changes which may delay your journey home.
If you test positive for COVID-19, you may need to stay where you are until you test negative. You may also need to seek treatment there.
Plan ahead and make sure you:
can access money
understand what your insurance will cover
can make arrangements to extend your stay and be away for longer than planned

From 4 March the Government of Gibraltar commenced a phased COVID-19 Exit Strategy Plan. On 4 March almost all lockdown restrictions in Gibraltar were lifted. There is no longer a requirement to wear masks, including on public transport. The only locations where the wearing of masks remain mandatory are in Gibraltar Health Authority, Elderly Residential Services and other medical and health service settings (including private providers).
