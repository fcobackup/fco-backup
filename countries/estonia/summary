The Foreign, Commonwealth & Development Office (FCDO) advises against all but essential travel to:
The whole of Estonia based on the current assessment of COVID-19 risks.
If you are returning to the UK from Estonia on or after 4am on 28 November you will need to self-isolate on your return (unless you are exempt). Check the latest guidance for England, Northern Ireland, Scotland and Wales.
The FCDO is not advising those already travelling in Estonia to leave at this time. Travellers should follow the advice of the local authorities on how best to protect themselves and others, including any measures that they bring in to control the virus. You should contact your tour operator or airline if you have any questions about your return journey.
Check our advice on things to consider, and be prepared to stay overseas longer than planned.
