Before you travel check that:
your destination can provide the healthcare you may need
you have appropriate travel insurance for local treatment or unexpected medical evacuation
This is particularly important if you have a health condition or are pregnant.

Medication
The legal status and regulation of some medicines prescribed or bought in the UK can be different in other countries.
Read best practice when travelling with medicines on TravelHealthPro.
UK prescriptions are not recognised in Portugal. Carry enough medication for your visit.
If you need a repeat prescription, go to the nearest health centre or hospital A&E. You may have to pay for your medication.
You will need to go to a pharmacy to get most medicines, though some non-prescription medication is sold at health stores in supermarkets and shopping centres. Find a pharmacy on the Pharmacy Association website.
Healthcare in Portugal
FCDO has a list of medical providers in Portugal, where some staff will speak English.
Health insurance cards
To get medically necessary state healthcare in Portugal, you need a Global Health Insurance Card (GHIC) or a European Health Insurance Card (EHIC).   
The NHS’s getting healthcare abroad has details about:
how to apply for a GHIC
how to get temporary cover if you lose your card or it does not arrive in time
who qualifies for a new EHIC instead of a GHIC
what treatment counts as medically necessary
A GHIC or EHIC is not an alternative to travel insurance. You may have costs your GHIC or EHIC does not cover, including:
changes to travel and accommodation bookings
additional standard costs for treatment
medical repatriation to the UK
treatment that is ruled non-urgent
private healthcare
private clinics
There is also guidance on healthcare if you’re living in Portugal.
Travel and mental health
Read FCDO guidance on travel and mental health and mental health support for UK nationals in Portugal.
