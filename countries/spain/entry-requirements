The information on this page covers the most common types of travel and reflects the UK government’s understanding of the rules currently in place. Unless otherwise stated, this information is for travellers using a full ‘British Citizen’ passport.
The authorities in the country or territory you’re travelling to are responsible for setting and enforcing the rules for entry. If you’re unclear about any aspect of the entry requirements, or you need further reassurance, you’ll need to contact the embassy, high commission or consulate of the country or territory you’re travelling to.
You should also consider checking with your transport provider or travel company to make sure your passport and other travel documents meet their requirements.
Entry rules in response to coronavirus (COVID-19)
Entry to Spain
From 24 May, entry restrictions and testing requirements for arrivals from the UK to Spain no longer apply. However, travellers from the UK should be prepared to present evidence of a negative test if they have travelled to a country on Spain’s list of ‘risk countries’ in the 14 days prior to travel. In some parts of Spain, a negative test is required when checking into tourist accommodation. See Testing requirements for arrivals from the UK for further information.
All passengers entering Spain will still be required to complete a pre-travel declaration form. Quarantine and testing on return to the UK continues to apply. See Returning to the UK.
Entry restrictions and testing requirements continue to apply for travel to Spain from ‘risk countries’. If you are travelling from a listed country, you should refer to the Spanish Embassy or Consulate in the country you are in for further advice.
Some travel restrictions and testing requirements are in place for international transit through Spanish airports by passengers on flights departing from the UK. See Transiting Spain.
Since 23 November 2020, pre-travel COVID-19 testing requirements have been in place for those travelling by air and sea from ‘risk’ countries (as determined by the European Centre for Disease Prevention & Control). From 00:00 on 24 May, arrivals from the UK are no longer subject to this requirement (unless they are subject to the exceptions listed in ‘Testing requirements for arrivals from the UK’) but will have to complete a pre-travel declaration form.
If you are resident in Spain, you should carry your residence document (the green paper EU residence certificate or the new TIE), as well as your valid passport when you travel. If you are not in possession of a residence document, see Requirements for UK Nationals resident in Spain for further information.
Travellers should follow the advice of the local authorities on how best to protect themselves and others, including any measures that they bring in to control the virus. See the Coronavirus section for further information.
Mandatory pre-travel declaration form for all passengers
Before travel to Spain, all passengers travelling by air or sea must complete and sign an online Health Control Form no more than 48 hours prior to travel declaring any known history of exposure to COVID-19 and giving contact details.
Anyone who has not completed this form electronically via the Spain Travel Health website or app, may submit it in paper format prior to boarding.
Testing requirements for arrivals from the UK
From 00:00 on 24 May, arrivals from the UK are no longer subject to testing requirements unless they have travelled to a country on Spain’s list of ‘risk’ countries in the 14 days prior to travel to Spain.
In some parts of Spain, a negative COVID-19 may be required when checking in to tourist accommodation. This currently applies in the Canary Islands. You should check with your accommodation provider prior to travel.
All arrivals are obliged to present a pre-travel declaration and undergo health checks at the point of entry. See ‘Preparing for arrival’.
Testing requirements if travelling from a ‘risk country’
All passengers (excluding children under the age of 6 years old) travelling to Spanish airports and ports from ‘risk’ countries (as determined by the European Centre for Disease Prevention & Control), or who have travelled to a risk country within 14 days of travelling to Spain, are required to present a negative PCR, TMA (Transcription-Mediated Amplification) or a LAMP (Loop-Mediated Isothermal Amplification) swab test taken within no more than 72 hours prior to arrival. A minimum fine of €3000 may be issued to anyone who fails to meet this requirement.
A minimum fine of €3000 may be issued to anyone who arrives in Spanish airports or ports from ‘risk’ countries without adequate evidence of a negative PCR, TMA or LAMP test.
Testing requirements for overland travellers
All overland travellers (excluding children under the age of 6 years old) who wish to enter Spain by road or rail from France, are required to present a negative PCR, TMA or LAMP test taken within 72 hours prior to entry. The following groups are exempt from this requirement:
Haulage workers
Frontier workers
Residents of border regions within a radius of 30 km
While these testing requirements don’t apply to overland travellers from Portugal, Andorra and Gibraltar, travel into Spain from all locations is limited. See Permitted reasons to enter Spain.
Preparing for arrival
On arrival into Spanish ports and airports, you may be subject to the following requirements at the point of entry:
Present the QR code (hardcopy or digital) issued on completion of the online Health Control Form prior to travel. See Mandatory pre-travel declaration form for all passengers

See Testing requirements
If travelling from a country where Spain has issued a travel ban, be prepared to show evidence of your residency. Due to current travel restrictions, be aware that you may be questioned on arrival by Spanish border authorities to ensure you meet the legal entry requirements. Spanish border authorities will only grant entry if they are satisfied that you meet the entry requirements and reserve the right to deny passage.
Anyone who presents symptoms or fails to meet one of the above requirements will be required to undergo a test on arrival and will be obliged to observe the COVID-19 protocols in place as determined by the local authorities of your destination in Spain.
Passengers may also be contacted and required to undertake a PCR, TMA or LAMP test at any point up to 48 hours after their arrival in Spain.
Requirements for UK nationals resident in Spain
The Spanish Government has published a list of documentation that UK nationals who were legally residing in Spain before 1 January 2021, and as such are beneficiaries of the Withdrawal Agreement, can use to prove their residence status when entering Spain while entry restrictions remain in place. You will be required to present any one of the following documents to prove your residence status:
Residence card issued under Article 18.4 of the Withdrawal Agreement (the TIE) – ‘la tarjeta de identidad de extranjero (TIE)’
Temporary or permanent EU residence certificate (green certificate) – ‘el certificado de registro de ciudadano de la Unión’ (tarjeta verde)
Residence card as a family member of an EU citizen – ‘la tarjeta de familiar de ciudadano de la Unión’
Receipt of application to exchange an EU residence certificate (green certificate) or residence card as a family member of an EU citizen for the new TIE (residence card issued under Article 18.4 of the Withdrawal Agreement) – ‘el resguardo de expedición de la tarjeta de identidad de extranjero (TIE) o de la tarjeta de familiar de ciudadano de la Unión’
Confirmation of the positive outcome of your residence application from the Immigration Office – ‘la resolución favorable de reconocimiento como beneficiario del Acuerdo de Retirada emitida por la Oficina de Extranjería competente’
The above list of documentation has also been communicated to airlines and other operators.
If you are arriving from a country with entry restrictions, Spanish border authorities will only grant entry if they are satisfied that you are returning to Spain to your habitual place of residence or can demonstrate an essential reason to enter (see ‘Permitted reasons to enter Spain’ above), and reserve the right to deny passage. You must also show a valid passport when you travel and comply with the other documentation requirements, as set out in this travel advice. See Pre-travel declaration form and Testing requirements for arrivals from ‘risk countries’.
Overland transit
Spain’s land borders are open, however travel restrictions, border controls and testing requirements may be in place depending on the country you are travelling from.
All overland travellers (by road or rail) from France are required to present a negative PCR, TMA or LAMP test taken within 72 hours prior to entering Spain. See Testing requirements for further information and exemptions. While these testing requirements don’t apply to overland travellers from Portugal, Andorra and Gibraltar, travel into Spain from all locations is limited. See Permitted reasons to enter Spain.
Border controls at the Portugal land border with Spain have been lifted. See FCDO travel advice for Portugal.
If you are travelling to Spain via Gibraltar, check the latest entry requirements and FCDO travel advice for Gibraltar. Entry requirements and testing requirements are currently in force for travel into Spain, see Permitted reasons to enter Spain and Testing requirements.
Inter-regional travel is permitted, providing your point of origin and destination do not fall within a confined area where entry and exit restrictions are in place. Transiting confined areas to reach your final destination is permitted, however you should be prepared to show evidence of your onward journey such as train or flight tickets to your final destination.

Regular entry requirements
Visas
The rules for travelling or working in European countries changed on 1 January 2021:
you can travel to countries in the Schengen area for up to 90 days in any 180-day period without a visa. This applies if you travel as a tourist, to visit family or friends, to attend business meetings, cultural or sports events, or for short-term studies or training
if you are travelling to Spain and other Schengen countries without a visa, make sure your whole visit is within the 90-day limit. Visits to Schengen countries within the previous 180 days before you travel count towards your 90 days
to stay longer, to work or study, for business travel or for other reasons, you will need to meet the Spanish government’s entry requirements. You should check with the Spanish consulate in the UK prior to travel regarding what type of visa and/or work permit you may need. If you are unable to return to the UK before the expiry of your visa/permit or visa-free limit due to C-19 restrictions, you should contact your local immigration office (Extranjería) for advice. You can also call 060 from a Spanish phone line. If you are visiting Spain and need to extend your visa-free stay for exceptional reasons, such as a medical emergency, you must apply to the immigration authorities (Extranjería) to do so.
if you stay in Spain with a visa or permit, this does not count towards the 90-day visa-free limit
Any time you spent in Spain or other Schengen countries before 1 January 2021 does not count towards your 90-day visa-free limit.
At Spanish border control, you may need to use separate lanes from EU, EEA and Swiss citizens when queueing. Your passport may be stamped on entry and exit. You may also need to:
show a return or onward ticket
show you have enough money for your stay
show proof of accommodation for your stay, for example, a hotel booking confirmation, proof of address if visiting your own property (e.g. second home), or an invitation from your host or proof of their address if staying with a third party, friends or family. The Spanish Government has clarified that the “carta de invitation” is one of the options available to prove that you have accommodation if staying with friends or family. More information is available from the Spanish Ministry of Interior.
There are separate requirements for those who are resident in Spain. If you are resident in Spain, you should carry proof of residence as well as your valid passport when you travel. For further information see Requirements for UK nationals resident in Spain.
Passport validity
Check your passport is valid for travel before you book your trip, and renew your passport if you do not have enough time left on it.
You must have at least 6 months left on an adult or child passport to travel to most countries in Europe (not including Ireland). This applies to the whole of Spain, including the Canary Islands and the Balearic Islands (Majorca, Menorca, Ibiza and Formentera).
If you renewed your current passport before the previous one expired, extra months may have been added to its expiry date. Any extra months on your passport over 10 years may not count towards the 6 months needed.
UK Emergency Travel Documents
UK ETDs are accepted for entry, airside transit and exit from Spain.
Travel between Spain and Gibraltar
Spanish border checks can cause delays when crossing between Spain and Gibraltar. If you are travelling to Spain via Gibraltar, check the latest entry requirements and FCDO travel advice for Gibraltar. Entry requirements and testing requirements are currently in force for travel into Spain, see Permitted reasons to enter Spain and Testing requirements.
There is no charge to enter or leave Gibraltar. Don’t hand over money if you’re approached by anyone claiming that there is a charge.
