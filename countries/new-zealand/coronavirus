Travel in New Zealand
The New Zealand Government has introduced a four-level national COVID-19 alert system. At 2359 local time on Monday 8 June 2020, New Zealand moved to Alert Level 1 meaning people can gather and return to work, school, sports and domestic travel without restriction.
New Zealand’s border restrictions remain in place and public health measures remain unchanged (wash hands and high-touch surfaces regularly, stay home if sick, and get tested if symptomatic).
Full details on the New Zealand Government’s coronavirus national response alert system and the requirements for each level can be found on the New Zealand Government COVID-19 website.
The State of National Emergency has now been lifted.
