You can spread the virus even if you donâ€™t have symptoms.

Emergency services are ill equipped to cope with a major disaster. Should a hurricane strike Haiti, basic services such as transport and communications are likely to be severely disrupted.
Flash floods and landslides occur regularly.
Hurricanes
The Atlantic hurricane season runs from June to November. During this period, tropical storms can quickly develop into major hurricanes. These severe storms can put you at risk and hamper the provision of essential services. You should monitor local and international weather updates from the National Hurricane Centre and follow the advice of local authorities, including any evacuation orders.
The most recent hurricane to hit Haiti was hurricane Matthew in October 2016.
See our Tropical Cyclones page for further advice on preparing effectively when travelling or living in areas susceptible to hurricanes or tropical cyclones.
Earthquakes
Haiti is located in an active seismic zone. The most significant earthquake in recent years hit Port au Prince in 2010, causing 250,000 deaths and extensive damage to infrastructure in the surrounding area. On 7 October 2018, a magnitude 5.9 earthquake hit north-west of Port de Paix, with more than 500 people injured.
If a major earthquake occurs close to shore, you should follow the instructions of the local authorities, bearing in mind that a tsunami could arrive within minutes.
The US Federal Emergency Management Agency has advice about what to do before during and after an earthquake and tsunami.
