See the TravelHealthPro website for further advice on travel abroad and reducing spread of respiratory viruses during the COVID-19 pandemic.
International travel
The Tunisian government has put into place additional health measures and travel restrictions for travellers from the UK following the emergence of a new strain of COVID-19. On 1 February, all direct flights between the UK and Tunisia (and other countries where the new COVID-19 strain has been detected) were suspended until further notice.
On 21 December, the Tunisian government suspended entry for all travellers coming from or transiting through the UK, or other countries where new strains of COVID-19 have been detected.
If you are travelling from a different country and transiting through an EU country on your way back to the UK, or on the way to Tunisia, you should be aware that on 22 October, the EU removed Tunisia from its ‘white list’ of countries. This means that travel between Tunisia and any of the EU’s 27 member states is no longer advised. This decision is not legally binding and EU countries decide their own border rules. You should consult the EU country’s latest government advice before travelling and check travel advice for countries on your route.

If you think you have COVID-19 symptoms, you should call a doctor or lab. They will ask a series of questions to assess whether it is likely that you have COVID-19. If COVID-19 is suspected, then they may arrange for someone to come to your home or hotel to conduct a test and they will advise you to self-isolate. You can pay for a test, if required for travel purposes, at the Institut Pasteur.
