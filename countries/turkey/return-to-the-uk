There remain extremely limited commercial options to return to the UK from Turkey which are expected to end over the Easter weekend.
If you live in the UK and are currently visiting Turkey, you’re strongly advised to return now by commercial means. Don’t run the risk of getting stranded.
UK special charter flights will only operate for priority countries where commercial flights are not possible. You should not assume that these flights will become available in countries where commercial routes are operating. Please do not contact the contracted travel management company if no flight is advertised here.
What to do
If you cannot leave Turkey at this time, you should:
follow the advice of local authorities, including local measures to help minimise your risk of exposure to coronavirus
find accommodation that’s suitable for your needs
keep in regular contact with family and friends at home, so they know you are safe and well
if you are visiting Turkey and normally resident in the UK, please register with the Embassy through our new registration process (see below)
One commercial flight option is still operating, but this is subject to change and cancellation at short notice. There is no guarantee that this flight will continue to operate after Sunday 12 April.
The British Embassy is issuing regular updates on Twitter and Facebook with the latest available information on flight departure options from Turkey.
As there are limited commercial means of returning to the UK from Turkey, you should contact your travel provider as soon as you can for more information. Note that plans might change at short notice.
Belavia - via Minsk
Operates once daily from Istanbul to Minsk. Flights from Minsk to London operate on Monday, Wednesday, Friday and Sundays. Flights are bookable with Belavia, however you need to book two separate tickets (Istanbul – Minsk / Minsk – London) and travel with cabin baggage only. On Sunday flights it may be possible to book on one ticket which would allow passengers to take hold baggage. You should check this with the airline when making a reservation. Please be aware that these routes may require extended waiting periods in a third country airport transit location in which you cannot clear immigration without being subject to mandatory quarantine, and/or include restrictions on baggage. You must check with the airlines before making any flight reservations. There is no guarantee that this flight will continue to operate after Sunday 12 April.
British nationals travelling between cities in order to return to the UK must get permission from the Turkish authorities to travel. To do so, submit your request here. You should make sure it is clear in the subject box that you are enquiring about a permit to travel, and have proof of your onward journey out of Turkey.
Anyone holding a Turkish residence permit entering Turkey will need to go through a medical evaluation on arrival and, depending on the outcome, may be subject to enforced quarantine at a government run quarantine facility, or be required to self-isolate at home.
Land crossings with Greece, Bulgaria, Georgia, Iran and Iraq have also been closed.
If you’re abroad and you need emergency help from the UK government, contact the nearest British embassy, consulate or high commission.
Future travel options
The UK government is working closely with airlines, the Turkish authorities and other governments to make sure options are available for you to return to the UK as soon as possible.
This travel advice will be updated when departure options become available. Sign up for travel advice email alerts and follow the British Embassy on Twitter and Facebook.
