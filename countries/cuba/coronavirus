Coronavirus travel health
Check the latest information on risk from COVID-19 for Cuba on the TravelHealthPro website
See the TravelHealthPro website for further advice on travel abroad and reducing spread of respiratory viruses during the COVID-19 pandemic.
If coming to Cuba, you should pack sanitary hand gel, handkerchiefs and other essential items that may prevent transmission, as these items are not always available in Cuba.
You may face a long queue to shop in a pharmacy. Over-the-counter medicines and pharmacy products are not always available. You should bring anything you might need with you.
You should also bring your prescription medicines with you and think about bringing extra in case you have to stay longer than planned.
International travel
All airports in Cuba are open again for commercial and charter flights. Havana Airport re-opened on 15 November 2020. You should contact airlines directly to know if and when they will have scheduled flights to and from Cuba.
At present, there are no direct flights between UK and Cuba. Airlines may insist you have a ticket for your onward connection to return to the UK to board the plane in Havana. You should check the FCDO Travel Advice for any country you have to transit on your journey to/from Cuba, to keep up to date with current entry and transit rules.
See Entry requirements and check with the airline or your travel company for the latest information.
Entry and borders
See Entry requirements to find out what you will need to do when you arrive in Cuba.
Visa extensions and departure
During the period of Cuban government coronavirus measures, visa extension requirements were suspended while immigration offices have had limited services. If you were unable to renew your visa until now, all types of visas that expired during Coronavirus measures will remain valid for 90 days after the suspension on commercial flights is lifted, i.e. 90 days from 15 November 2020.
If you have dual British and Cuban nationality, you are subject to Cuban measures. From 1 April 2020, dual nationals required permission (from Cuban Immigration offices) to leave Cuba on the special repatriation and humanitarian flights. That is no longer a requirement but could be re-introduced if the Cuban authorities implement any new measures.
Travel in Cuba
Travel and transport within each Province varies according to the measures in place. The suspension of inter-provincial transport was lifted on 19 October 2020. The current exceptions are to/from Sancti Spiritus and Pinar del Rio. Any change in the situation in a province or municipality may mean inter-provincial or municipal transport links also change.
Face masks must be worn at all times when travelling on buses, in taxis, and private hire vehicles.
Visitors are allowed to hire cars (see important information in Road Travel section) but should check with the hire companies if they are open and have cars available before making plans. Vehicles cannot enter/leave Ciego de Avila, Spriritus, or Pinar del Rio.
Visitors who fly directly in Jardines del Rey Airport (for holidays in Cayo Coco, Cayo Cruz or Cayo Guillermo) may rent cars, but cannot leave the Cayos.
Check with your tour operator and seek local advice if you have questions about excursions to other parts of Cuba.
Accommodation
Hotels and guest houses are open for Cubans and foreign residents of Cuba (known as ‘national tourism’) and for international tourists but may be to a limited occupancy. Guests may have to wear face masks in some hotel areas and facilities.
Campsites are open also to a limited capacity.
Medical teams in hotels will check on health of guests, including taking their temperature, and will be available to guests who feel unwell in between those visits. Local medical representatives will visit campsites and “casas particulares”. Anyone with respiratory symptoms may be moved to a clinic or isolation centre and will have to pay for the medical services by credit card.
Hotels may limit the numbers of people using facilities at any one time, especially swimming pools and elevators.
Public spaces and services
Wearing a face mask in public is compulsory as is social distancing of a minimum of 1.5 metres.
Shops in all Provinces can open but must limit the number of customers within the shop. This means there are queues to enter shops.
Cafés, bars and restaurants are allowed to open but must limit the opening hours, the number of customers and separate tables by 1.5 metres. Bars and discos are still closed.
The re-opening measures below apply to all of Cuba:
Public parks will be open.

Swimming pools can open to a limited capacity and to restricted visit times, to allow cleaning for the next opening times.

Churches are also able to re-open for services.
Provinces can start to re-open theatres and cinemas (with capacity restrictions) and hold some sporting events.
Healthcare in Cuba
If you think you have COVID-19 symptoms, you should contact a local clinic straight away. If you are staying in a hotel, the hotel reception will be able to contact them for you.
If you need to stay in hospital, you must pay the bill by credit card when being discharged, or arrange payment directly by your travel insurance company. You may not have internet access in hospital. Your mobile phone roaming may not work in Cuba.
If you are staying in private home or a hotel, you are likely to receive regular home checks by medical representatives (known as “pesquisia”).
