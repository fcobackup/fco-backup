There have been sporadic marches and protests in Lomé and around the country since August 2017, over demands to restore the 1992 constitution. The government has banned protests, but it is possible that opposition groups may schedule further protests. This possibility is likely to increase ahead of legislative elections scheduled for 20 December 2018 respectively. You should remain vigilant during this period, avoid crowds and demonstrations, monitor local media and follow advice of local authorities. See Political situation
Tensions remain heightened and further marches and protests, by supporters of the government and opposition are likely.
Terrorist attacks in Togo can’t be ruled out. Attacks could be indiscriminate. You should be vigilant, especially in places visited by foreigners. See Terrorism.
