How a region is rated is determined by three criteria:
The number of cases per 100,000 over the previous 14 days.
The number of hospitalised patients.
The number of patients in Intensive Care Units.
The government currently ranks all of Slovenia’s twelve statistical regions as RED.
Public transport (buses and trains) is running. However, from 24 October a limited schedule will be introduced, with 1/3 of regular public transport in operation. You are required to wear a protective mask, sanitise your hands with the supplied hand sanitiser and maintain a safety distance of at least 1.5m.
Wherever possible, tickets should be bought in advance (online, ticket machines and at sales counters). Taxi services continue to be available.
