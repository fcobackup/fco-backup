Cases of coronavirus (COVID-19) have been confirmed in Guatemala. A number of restrictions were implemented by the Guatemalan Government in response to the coronavirus outbreak, starting initially from 17 March until 31 March 2020.
On 12 April, Guatemalan authorities announced the extension of the prohibition of all international and domestic flights until 30 April 2020; with the exception of humanitarian, official, military and ambulance flights that have been authorised by the President through the Ministry of Foreign Affairs.
On 12 April 2020, the Guatemalan Government announced new restrictions to prevent the spread of coronavirus. People are now required to comply with social distancing of at least 1.5 metres and to use masks in all public spaces. This includes walking in the streets. People that have recuperated from COVID-19 and those under quarantine must use masks inside their houses. Those not complying with these measures could face fines, and may potentially face civil and criminal charges. Fines range from £700 to £15,000. These measures will be in place from 13 April 2020 until further notice. All previous restrictions remain in place.
Restrictions on movement around the country introduced on Sunday 5 April will now continue until at least, 4am on 27 April 2020. People will continue to be unable to move between departments. However, it was announced on 19 April 2020 that this measure will be applicable only to people from the departments of Guatemala, Chimaltenango, Sacatepequez and El Progreso starting on 20 April until 4am on 27 April 2020. These measures aim to ease overcrowding in popular beauty spots, thereby preventing the spread of coronavirus. The existing curfew and other restrictions remain in place.
The Guatemalan Government also announced that land, air and maritime borders will remain closed. Only Guatemalan nationals, resident foreigners and diplomats are allowed to enter Guatemala. They will be subject to a 15-day quarantine on arrival. Foreigners can continue to leave Guatemala. Some have been able to leave Guatemala via the Mexican El Carmen border crossing. Visit the portal of the Mexican Embassy in Guatemala for information on immigration requirements.

A curfew has been in place for the whole country since Sunday 22 March 2020, from 4pm to 4am each day until 4am 20 April 2020. However, on 19 April 2020 the Guatemalan Government announced that as from 20 April 2020 to 27 April 2020, the curfew hours would be from 6pm to 4am each day. Everyone should remain indoors while the curfew is in effect, unless you have special permission from the Ministry of Economy to operate during the curfew.

Entry and borders
There have been reports of disruptions and tensions at the Mexico-Guatemala border. Periodic closures are possible and you are advised to check with local authorities before attempting to cross the land border. Many states, and local communities, are imposing additional measures, including movement restrictions in response to the coronavirus (COVID-19) pandemic. Roadblocks have been reported more frequently, particularly in the states of Chiapas and Oaxaca (Mexico). If you’re driving in these states, travel during daylight hours and use toll roads where possible, although you may still encounter disruptions. Where possible we recommend you travel by air.
