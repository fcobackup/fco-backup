Coronavirus guidance is being updated.
Read the Prime Minister’s statement for the latest information.

On 22 June 2020, the Saudi authorities announced that due to the Covid-19 pandemic, pilgrims from outside the Kingdom will not be permitted to enter Saudi Arabia to perform Hajj this year. Hajj rites will only be performed by a very limited number of pilgrims who already reside in the Kingdom. A ban on Umrah also remains in place.
British citizens living in Saudi Arabia wishing to perform Hajj this year should follow announcements on FCO official social media channels @ukinsaudiarabia and guidance from local authorities. The opportunity to perform Hajj will be restricted to a small number of individuals this year.
People with disabilities
You should be prepared for different standards of accessibility and accommodation to those in the UK. For more information about facilities for people with disabilities see the Ministry of Hajj website.
Between ritual sites
The Saudi government imposes strict timetables on Hajj groups for all travel (bus, light rail and foot) between the ritual sites.
Pilgrims should follow advice from the local authorities when using light rail train services, and take care in case of any overcrowding. Timetables will be subject to change.
There’s been an increase in the number of reported cases of pick pocketing and other forms of theft in Makkah, particularly in the region of the Grand Mosque and in Medina. Take extra care of your passport, tickets and other valuables while visiting these areas. Keep a copy of your passport and residency or visa in a safe place.
Saudi authorities forbid taking photographs (still or video, including those taken with your phone) at the Holy Mosque at Makkah or at the Prophet’s Mosque at Medina. Any violation of official instructions could to lead to the confiscation of your device.
