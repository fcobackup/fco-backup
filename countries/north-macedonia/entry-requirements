The information on this page covers the most common types of travel and reflects the UK government’s understanding of the rules currently in place. Unless otherwise stated, this information is for travellers using a full ‘British Citizen’ passport.
The authorities in the country or territory you’re travelling to are responsible for setting and enforcing the rules for entry. If you’re unclear about any aspect of the entry requirements, or you need further reassurance, you’ll need to contact the embassy, high commission or consulate of the country or territory you’re travelling to.
You should also consider checking with your transport provider or travel company to make sure your passport and other travel documents meet their requirements.
Restrictions in response to coronavirus
All border crossings in North Macedonia are closed for foreign nationals except for freight vehicles, diplomatic corps, foreigners with long-term stay permit and their family members, and others with special permission from the Ministry of Interior (MoI).
On 22 May, the Government of North Macedonia announced that all persons entering the Republic of North Macedonia will need to present a negative PCR test for COVID-19 taken within 72 hours before arrival. Anyone entering North Macedonia who can present this negative PCR test will then be subject to mandatory self-isolation for at least 14 days (or 21 days if coming from high-risk countries, which currently includes the United Kingdom).
Anyone entering North Macedonia without a PCR test will be sent to a mandatory state quarantine facility where a PCR test for COVID-19 will be done. Depending on the results, those persons will later be sent to mandatory self-isolation.

If you plan to stay for longer than 3 months, contact the Embassy of North Macedonia in London.
Unaccompanied minors (children under 18) must have a letter of consent from their parents or guardian. Failure to do so may result into refusal of entry and deportation.

You should retain the registration document as proof of registration until your departure from North Macedonia.
If you don’t register you may receive a fine of between 600 and 1,000 Euros, and be detained or face a court appearance (which may include a restriction on your ability to return to North Macedonia).

Foreign nationals, including those from the United Kingdom, have sometimes been denied entry into the Republic of Serbia from North Macedonia if they hold entry/exit stamps from Kosovo.
