This advice reflects the UK government’s understanding of current rules for people travelling on a full ‘British citizen’ passport from the UK, for the most common types of travel.
The authorities in Bosnia and Herzegovina set and enforce entry rules. If you’re not sure how these requirements apply to you, contact Bosnia and Herzegovina’s embassy or consulate in the UK.
COVID-19 rules
Countries may restrict travel or bring in rules at short notice. Check with your travel provider for changes.
If you test positive for COVID-19, you may need to stay where you are until you test negative. You may also need to get treatment there.
Read TravelHealthPro’s general COVID-19 advice for travellers.
Mask wearing and social distancing are only required in medical facilities.
Passport validity requirements
Your passport should be in good condition (with no damage to the data page) and valid for a minimum period of 3 months (90 days) from the date of your exit from Bosnia and Herzegovina.
Passport stamping
Make sure your passport is stamped when you enter the country. If you do not receive a stamp, the Border Police may fine you when you leave.
Visa requirements
British nationals do not need a visa to visit Bosnia and Herzegovina for less than 90 days within a period of 6 months following their first entry. For all other types of travel, contact the Embassy of Bosnia and Herzegovina in London.
Staying longer than 90 days
British nationals who wish to remain in Bosnia and Herzegovina longer than 90 days must apply to the Border Police for a residency permit. For more information read Bosnia and Herzegovina’s Service for Foreigners’ Affairs page.
If you apply for residence, the Bosnian Border Police also require a British Police document showing that you have no criminal record in the United Kingdom. The British Embassy is not able to issue such a document. Contact your local police authority in the United Kingdom before you travel.
If your visa or residence permit has expired, you should contact the nearest field office of the Service for Foreigners’ Affairs.
Vaccination requirements (other than COVID-19)
At least 8 weeks before your trip, check the vaccinations and certificates you need in TravelHealthPro’s Bosnia and Herzegovina’s guide.
Registering your stay
All foreign nationals should register with the police within 72 hours of arrival, at a local police station. Hotels and some hostels will usually register their guests. If your accommodation is not arranging this, you need to register at the nearest Service for Foreigners’ Affairs field office.
Travelling with children
Children aged 17 and under who are not Bosnian nationals and who are travelling unaccompanied or accompanied by an adult other than their parents, must carry a notarised letter from their parents or guardians giving permission for the child to travel. The name of the accompanying adult must be clearly stated.
If the child is accompanied by one parent, particularly if the parent has a different surname to the child’s, the accompanying parent should carry a notarised letter from the other parent giving permission to travel. For further information contact the Embassy of Bosnia and Herzegovina in London.
Customs rules
There are rules about goods that can be brought into and taken out of Bosnia and Herzegovina. You must declare anything that may be prohibited or subject to tax or duty.
