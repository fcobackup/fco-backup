The Swedish COVID-19 vaccination programme began in January 2021. The Swedish authorities have issued guidance on the vaccine in Sweden (please choose your region for local information). Vaccination is voluntary and free of charge.
The Medicines and Healthcare Products Regulatory Agency (MHRA) is the UK authority responsible for assessing the safety, quality and efficacy of vaccines. It has authorised the Pfizer/BioNTech, Oxford/AstraZeneca and Moderna vaccines for temporary supply and use in the UK. Find out more about MHRA approval for these vaccines.
British nationals living overseas should seek medical advice from their local healthcare provider in the country where they reside.
