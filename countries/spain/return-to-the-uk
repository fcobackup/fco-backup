British travellers who are currently in Spain and who wish to return to the UK are advised to make travel plans to do so as soon as possible.
At present, air and maritime borders remain open, but many airlines and ferry companies are operating revised or reduced services.
Travel to airports to leave Spain is still permitted, but travellers may be asked to provide evidence that they are departing Spain (i.e. plane ticket).
Travel via France
The land borders remain open for those leaving Spain. British nationals can still drive through France to return to the UK, but they will need to complete an ‘attestation’ (declaration) specifying the reason for being outside.
If you’re planning to use this route, check the latest FCO travel advice for France ahead of your journey.
