This advice reflects the UK government’s understanding of current rules for people travelling on a full ‘British citizen’ passport from the UK, for the most common types of travel.
The authorities in Cyprus set and enforce entry rules. If you’re not sure how these requirements apply to you, contact the Cyprus High Commission in the UK.
COVID-19 rules
There are no COVID-19 testing or vaccination requirements for travellers entering Cyprus.
Passport validity requirements
To travel to Cyprus, you must follow the Schengen area passport requirements. 
To enter Cyprus your passport must: 
have a ‘date of issue’ less than 10 years before the date you arrive. Passports issued after 1 October 2018 are now valid for only 10 years, but for passports issued before 1 October 2018, extra months may have been added if you renewed a passport early 
have an ‘expiry date’ at least 3 months after the day you plan to leave 
Check with your travel provider that your passport and other travel documents meet requirements. Renew your passport if you need to.  
You will be denied entry if you do not have a valid travel document or try to use a passport that has been reported lost or stolen.
Visa requirements
You can travel without a visa to Cyprus for up to 90 days. This applies if you travel: 
as a tourist 
to visit family or friends 
to attend business meetings, cultural or sports events 
for short-term studies or training
To stay longer (to work or study, for business travel or for other reasons), check what you need from the Cyprus High Commission.
There is separate guidance on visas and permits to work in Cyprus.
The Republic of Cyprus authorities will count time in the north of Cyprus towards the 90-day visa-free total. For information about the north of Cyprus, see Regional risks.
Do not overstay your visa. You could be:
questioned by immigration at the airport on exit
put on a ‘stop list’ and refused entry for up to 5 years
Schengen area
Cyprus is not part of the Schengen area, so:
visits to Cyprus do not count towards your 90-day visa-free limit in the Schengen area
visits to other EU or Schengen countries do not count towards your 90-day visa-free limit in Cyprus
Check at the border
As a visitor, your passport will be stamped when you enter and exit Cyprus. Border guards will use the passport stamps to check you’re complying with the 90-day visa-free limit for short stays.
If you enter or exit the Schengen area through Cyprus as a visitor, check that your passport is stamped. This will show border guards that you are complying with the 90-day visa-free limit for Cyprus and the separate 90-day visa-free limit for the Schengen area.
If the relevant entry or exit stamp is not in your passport, border guards will presume you have overstayed your visa-free limit. If you show evidence such as transport tickets to prove when you entered or exited Cyprus, border guards should add the entry or exit date and location in your passport.
You may also need to:
show a return or onward ticket
prove you have enough money for your stay
If you have a Withdrawal Agreement residency document for another country, your passport might still be stamped if you are a visitor to Cyprus.
Residents should carry residency documents issued by the Republic of Cyprus when entering and exiting Cyprus.
If you are a resident, read the Living in Cyprus guide.

Travel within Cyprus
You can use any crossing point to move between the north and south of the island. The crossing point at Ledra Palace and Ledra and Lokmaci Street can only be used by pedestrians.
See a list of the crossing points from the Cyprus Ministry of Finance.
Entry into the Republic of Cyprus through the north of Cyprus
If you enter the Republic of Cyprus through the north (such as through Ercan Airport), authorities will consider you to have entered illegally. You could be:
fined for illegal entry
refused entry to or exit from the Republic of Cyprus
prevented from crossing back into the north of Cyprus
Vaccination requirements (other than COVID-19)
At least 8 weeks before your trip, check the vaccinations and certificates you need in TravelHealthPro’s Cyprus guide.
Customs rules
There are strict rules about goods that can be brought into and taken out of Cyprus. You must declare anything that may be prohibited or subject to tax or duty.
Taking food into Cyprus
You cannot take meat, milk or products containing them into EU countries. There are some exceptions such as powdered baby milk, baby food and special foods or pet feed required for medical reasons.
Customs rules within Cyprus
There are controls on quantities and types of goods that can be bought in the north of Cyprus and taken to the south of the island, including from the bicommunal village of Pyla in the buffer zone. Goods can be confiscated at the checkpoint and you could be fined. The Republic of Cyprus enforces a 40-cigarette per person limit on crossing the Green Line from the north of Cyprus.
