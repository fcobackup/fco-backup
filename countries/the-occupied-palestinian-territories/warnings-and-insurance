Conflict with Lebanese Hizballah
Following the recent conflict between Israel and Lebanese Hizballah (LH), a ceasefire was agreed on 27 November, with a 60-day implementation period.
There remains a risk that hostilities could reignite, and with little warning. Check Home Front Command for the latest guidance. Restrictions may be put in place at short notice.
Conflict in Israel and the OPTs
On 7 October 2023 there was a large-scale terrorist attack by Hamas in southern Israel. The frequency of rocket attacks has significantly decreased in Israel. 
There is an increased risk of political tension which can cause demonstrations and clashes around anniversaries and significant events.
If you are in Israel and the OPTs
If you are in Israel and the OPTs, keep up to date through local media and follow the instructions of Israeli Home Front Command. To find these:
visit the Israeli Home Front Command website (available in Israel only)

The Israeli government declared a state of emergency across the whole country on 7 October and this remains in place. International borders (air and land) in Israel and the OPTs could close at short notice. Check with border officials before you travel for the latest information. Check the travel advice for any neighbouring country that you are planning to travel to or through.
Before travelling within Israel or the OPTs, check the local measures in place, that roads are open and, where appropriate, that scheduled train and bus services are operating.
