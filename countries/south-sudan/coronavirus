The first case of coronavirus (COVID-19) was confirmed in South Sudan on 5 April. Cases have also been confirmed in all of South Sudan’s neighbouring countries.
The South Sudan authorities had already introduced a number of precautionary measures in response to the coronavirus pandemic. The likelihood of further, more restrictive measures in the coming days is high.
