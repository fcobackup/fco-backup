Direct commercial flights between the UK and Greece (in both directions) are currently suspended until 23.59 Greek time on 15 May. At present, it is possible to travel indirectly between Greece and the UK (and vice versa). Options include travelling via Paris, Brussels, Zurich and Doha, though some itineraries are likely to require an overnight stay between flights or between flights and Eurostar connections. You should check travel advice for any country you plan to transit through. You should contact airlines or travel operators directly for more information. Contact the British Embassy in Athens if you need assistance.
Travel between the UK and Greece by road, rail or ferry is likely to be difficult at this time. Countries neighbouring Greece (Albania, Bulgaria, Italy, North Macedonia, Turkey) have also introduced restrictions, including closing land borders and suspending of rail and ferry links. Check FCO Travel Advice pages for details if you are planning to travel via these countries, and speak to your travel operator in case of disruption.
You will need to pay for your return travel to the UK. If departure options are available but you cannot afford the travel costs and have exhausted all other options for getting funds, you may be eligible to apply for an emergency loan from the government. This is a last resort option and you would need to repay the loan when you are back in the UK. For more information, you should contact Corporate Travel Management (CTM). CTM are a commercial partner of the FCO and are authorised to administer such loans on behalf of the FCO.
