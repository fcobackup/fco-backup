Cases of coronavirus (COVID-19) have been confirmed in Afghanistan. The Afghan authorities have introduced a number of measures to limit the spread of the virus.
Entry and borders
The National Security Council of Afghanistan has announced that all travel to and from Iran has been temporarily banned.
Point of entry screening has been introduced at 3 international airports and 11 international crossings. Not everyone is being screened, but those who are and who show a temperature of more than 38ºC may be sent direct to one of 2 national hospitals (Kabul Infectious Disease and Afghan-Japan Communicable Disease Hospital in Kabul) or 5 provincial hospitals for isolation. These hospitals are outside of the Enhanced Security Zone.
Departing Afghanistan
If you’re visiting or living and working in Afghanistan and wish to leave, you should contact your airline or travel company and your insurance provider as soon as you are able, and keep up to date with the latest developments. International travel has become significantly more difficult.
If you are transiting through another destination or airport on your return to the UK, check with your airline and consult the latest FCO travel advice for all countries you are transiting. Any country or area may restrict travel without notice in response to the COVID-19 pandemic.
