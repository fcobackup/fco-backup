Most visits to Moldova are trouble free. You should be alert to the possibility of protests and demonstrations. While these are generally peaceful, the situation could quickly change. If you’re in Moldova, keep up to date with developments and take extra care. You should avoid large crowds, remain vigilant and follow the advice of local authorities.
If you visit Transnistria you should be aware that the region is outside of the control of the Moldovan authorities, and the consular assistance the British Embassy can provide may be severely limited. See Safety and security
The Moldovan authorities strictly enforce penalties (including deportation) against those who overstay. See Entry requirements
You should be vigilant to petty crime, particularly in Chisinau. Leave your passport, travel documents and other valuable items in a safe place, and carry a photocopy of your passport for identification purposes. See Crime
There are strong penalties for possession or use of drugs. Avoid taking photographs of military or government installations. See Local laws and customs
Although there’s no recent history of terrorism in Moldova, attacks can’t be ruled out. See Terrorism
The situation in Ukraine and other areas outside Donetsk and Luhansk is generally calm, including in the Odessa Oblast which borders Transnistria. However, events in Ukraine are fast moving and you are strongly advised to check the Ukraine travel advice
If you’re abroad and you need emergency help from the UK government, contact the nearest British embassy, consulate or high commission.
Take out comprehensive travel and medical insurance before you travel.
