Warning
FCDO advises against all travel to parts of Burkina Faso.

Terrorism
There is a high threat of terrorist attack globally affecting UK interests and British nationals, including from groups and individuals who view the UK and British nationals as targets. Stay aware of your surroundings at all times.
UK Counter Terrorism Policing has information and advice on staying safe abroad and what to do in the event of a terrorist attack. Find out how to reduce your risk from terrorism while abroad.
Terrorism in Burkina Faso
Terrorists are very likely to try to carry out attacks in Burkina Faso.  
There is a high threat from terrorism throughout the country, including in the capital, Ouagadougou. The main threat is from Al-Qaida affiliated and other regional Islamist groups. These include Jamaat Nusrat al-Islam wal Muslimeen (JNIM) and Islamic State Greater Sahara (ISGS), who operate throughout Mali, Niger and Burkina Faso.
Terrorist attacks could be indiscriminate, including in places frequented by foreign nationals, such as:
diplomatic premises
conference centres
tourist sites
sporting and cultural events including music festivals
shopping centres
transport hubs
religious sites and places of worship, particularly churches
national parks and nature reserves
foreign, national or local government buildings
large crowds
Stay aware of your surroundings, keep up to date with local media reports and follow the advice of the local authorities. Be more alert during election periods, festivals, and religious and public holiday periods.
Security is limited outside the capital, Ouagadougou. There have been regular terrorist attacks on police, military personnel and civilians, particularly close to the borders with Mali, Niger and Côte d’Ivoire and in the eastern region.
Previous significant attacks include:
in 2022, over 100 people were killed in a terrorist attack in Seno Province, close to the border with Niger
in 2021, over 160 people were killed in an attack on the village of Solhan in north-eastern Burkina Faso
in 2021, one Irish national and 2 Spanish nationals were killed in an ambush on the PK 60 road between Fada-N’Gourma and Pama
in 2020, around 50 people were killed in 3 separate attacks in the eastern Kompienga region, and in the northern provinces of Sanmatenga and Loroum – one where an unidentified gunmen opened fire at a cattle market
in 2019, 42 people were killed following a terrorist attack at a military outpost in northern Soum province, close to the border with Mali
in 2019, at least 14 people were killed after gunmen opened fire inside a church in Hantoukoura, eastern Burkina Faso
in 2019, 37 civilians were killed and 60 injured following an attack on a convoy carrying workers to a Canadian gold mine near Boungou, in eastern Burkina Faso
Terrorist kidnap 
There’s a very high threat of terrorist kidnap in Burkina Faso.
British nationals are seen as legitimate targets, including tourists, humanitarian aid workers, journalists and business travellers. If you are kidnapped, the reason for your presence is unlikely to protect you or secure your safe release.  
Westerners have been kidnapped and killed in Burkina Faso and remote areas of neighbouring countries.
Recent kidnap incidents include:
in 2022, a Polish national was kidnapped in north-eastern Burkina Faso and released 2 months later
in 2022, a US national was kidnapped in Yalgo in north-eastern Burkina Faso and later released
in 2019, a Canadian citizen was kidnapped near Gayeri in the Est region and found dead near the Niger border 2 days later
The long-standing policy of the British government is not to make substantive concessions to hostage takers. The British government considers that paying ransoms and releasing prisoners builds the capability of terrorist groups and finances their activities. This can, in turn, increase the risk of further hostage-taking. The Terrorism Act (2000) makes payments to terrorists illegal.  
Political situation
The security situation in Burkina Faso has deteriorated significantly in recent years and remains volatile.  
A transitional government took control in Burkina Faso following a coup in 2022. The political situation remains unstable, and further coups are possible.
The government has declared a state of emergency in the regions of:
Centre-Est
Est
Centre Nord
Nord
Boucle du Mouhoun
Sahel
Hauts-Bassins
Cascades
The measure gives security forces extra powers to conduct searches, restrict freedom of movement and detain persons of interest. Some civil rights may be suspended, including the right to protest and to hold large meetings. The military takeover in neighbouring Niger in 2023 may lead to unrest or protests in Ouagadougou.
Protests are common in Burkina Faso. Avoid political rallies, gatherings and demonstrations. Crowds can gather quickly and may become violent. Foreign, national and local government facilities have been targeted and damaged in previous demonstrations.
Monitor the local news to help you avoid such gatherings. If you become aware of a crowd gathering, leave the area immediately.
Crime
Vehicle crime
There is an increasing number of vehicle hold-ups on roads outside Ouagadougou. Drivers that refuse to stop when flagged down have been shot at.
Armed groups have also stopped drivers to rob passengers and their vehicles. Criminals have stopped public buses to assault and rob passengers, particularly at night.
Street crime
Street crime is a serious risk for foreign visitors. Most incidents are opportunist snatches of purses, wallets, jewellery and other valuables. Thieves are particularly active near the UN Circle and the former Central Market in Ouagadougou, and are often armed. Do not carry valuables in public places or walk alone at night.
Laws and cultural differences
Personal ID
Always carry your passport or residence permit.
Ramadan
Ramadan is a holy month for Muslims. The dates vary by year and country. In 2024, Ramadan is expected to take place in Burkina Faso from 10 March to 9 April. During this time, do not:
eat, drink, smoke or chew gum in public in the daytime, including in your car
play loud music or dance
swear in public
Get more advice when you arrive from your tour guide, hotel or business contacts.
Illegal drugs and prison sentences
Do not get involved in drugs of any kind. If you’re convicted of possessing or distributing any illegal drug, you can expect heavy fines and long jail sentences. Local prison conditions are harsh.
Using cameras and filmmaking
Do not take pictures of military or other government installations.  
LGBT+ travellers
Same-sex sexual activity is legal in Burkina Faso, though social attitudes towards LGBT+ people can be discriminatory.
Read more advice for LGBT+ travellers.
Souvenirs
There are strict customs regulations about taking cultural objects like masks, religious materials and antiquities out of Burkina Faso. If you’re unsure about buying any souvenirs you find for sale, contact the Ministry of Culture.
Money
A few of the larger hotels and restaurants in Ouagadougou accept credit cards. You’re unlikely to be able to use them anywhere outside the capital. There are a few ATMs in Ouagadougou, but they only accept Visa cards.
The best option is to bring US dollars in cash to exchange.
Transport risks
Road travel
If you’re planning to drive in Burkina Faso, see information on driving abroad.
Get security advice about travelling by road anywhere outside Ouagadougou.
You can use a UK photocard driving licence to drive in Burkina Faso. If you still have a paper driving licence, you may need to update it to a photocard licence or get the 1949 version of the international driving permit (IDP).
Roads, even if they are paved, are in a poor state of repair. Road conditions off the main roads are often difficult, especially in the rainy season from June to October. Vehicles are often in poor condition.
Avoid travelling at night, even if using a local driver. Roads have very limited lighting, and vehicles often have no headlights. Livestock, pedestrians and motorbikes on the roads are additional hazards.
Using secure vehicles
If you decide to travel outside the capital against FCDO advice, get professional security advice. There is danger of armed attacks on all roads, but especially:
from Ouagadougou to Bobo-Dioulasso
from Bobo-Dioulasso to Côte d’Ivoire
from Fada to Benin and Togo
to Benin, Bogandée and Gayeri
to Niger
Stay on clearly marked roads or tracks and avoid minor roads unless travelling in convoy. There is limited access to phone networks, so consider taking a satellite phone in case you break down or have another emergency. Always carry drinking water with you.
Extreme weather and natural disasters
The rainy season normally runs from June to October. Torrential rains can cause floods and landslides. Monitor local weather reports and expect difficulties when travelling to affected areas during this season.
Find out what you can do to prepare for and respond to extreme weather and natural hazards.
