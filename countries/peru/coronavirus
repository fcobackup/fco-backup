Travel in Peru
On 15 March, Peru announced a national State of Emergency, which has now been extended until 31 July. The regulations are:
nationwide curfew between the hours of 10pm to 4am, except for Arequipa, Ica, Junin, Huanuco, San Martin, Madre de Dios and Ancash regions, where the curfew will be from 8pm to 4am
in Arequipa, Ica, Junin, Huanuco, San Martin, Madre de Dios and Ancash regions, lockdown remains
on Sundays no one will be allowed out in Arequipa, Ica, Junin, Huanuco, San Martin, Madre de Dios and Ancash regions
special measures will be put in place for those under 14 and over 65, and people at risk
everyone must wear face masks outside of homes
Future changes to curfew rules will be announced by the President.
These restrictions may not apply if you have a travel permit (salvo-conducto) from the Peruvian authorities. These are mainly issued for those with confirmed bookings to leave Peru, but there may be exceptions if you do not have a flight yet, but want to travel within Peru from one region to another.
If this applies to you, contact the British Embassy who will make a request to the Peruvian authorities. Depending on your destination region, you may have to spend some time (possibly two weeks) on quarantine immediately after arrival. The exact location of the quarantine will be decided by the regional government upon arrival.
Please note before being able to move from one region of Peru to another, the local government may first require you to submit a medical certificate, following a rapid COVID-19 test, stating that you are free from infection.
Please note that after 10 July the Peruvian government will only issue internal travel permits (salvo-conductos) to those who are travelling from or via regions still under lockdown and only for repatriation purposes.
Relaxing of restrictions
The Peruvian government has approved a four-phase Economic Reactivation Plan, between May and August which involves relaxing some restrictions and reopening some industry sectors such as Industry and Mining, Construction, Trade and Tourism and Services. For Tourism and Services, the plan involves reopening or restarting the following:
first phase (May): Restaurants (via delivery), hotels and storage
second phase (June): Inter-provincial transport and flights, restaurants (restricted service); some malls and commercial centres are due to open by 30 June
third phase (July): International flights, restaurants and hotels operating normally
fourth phase (August): Leisure activities, conventions, meetings, gatherings
This planned relaxation of industry restrictions remains under review and may change at short notice.
