Terrorists are very likely to try to carry out attacks in Niger, including in Niamey, in retaliation to Niger’s participation in the French-led intervention in Mali and the country’s involvement in the regional fight to counter Boko Haram.
UK Counter Terrorism Policing has information and advice on staying safe abroad and what to do in the event of a terrorist attack. Find out more about the global threat from terrorism.
Attacks could be indiscriminate. You should be especially vigilant in places frequented by Westerners such as hotels, restaurants, airports and other transport hubs, places of worship (particularly churches) and businesses with Western interests. Foreign or local government facilities and large crowds may also be a target. You should monitor developments, be alert to announcements and remain vigilant at all times. Take particular care during religious holiday periods.
The government declared a state of emergency on 3 March 2017 in Diffa region, in Ouallam, Ayorou, Bankilare, Abala and Banibongou (Tillabéri region) and Tassara and Tillia (Tahoua region). This was in response to an escalation in terrorist attacks, especially in the Tillabéri region.
There have been multiple recent attacks in Niger, particularly in the Diffa and Tillabéri regions. Notable recent attacks include:
on 9 January 2020, terrorists killed 89 Nigerien soldiers at their base in Chinegodrar, Tillabéri
on 10 December 2019, terrorists killed 71 Nigerien soldiers at their base in Inates
on 1 July 2019, terrorists killed at least 18 Nigerien soldiers at an army base in Tillabéri
on 19 June 2019, gunmen killed 2 police officers at the north Niamey Gates
on 16 May 2019, terrorists killed 28 Nigerien soldiers in Tillabéri
on 27 March 2019, suicide bombers and gunmen killed 12 people in Diffa
There is also a risk of terrorist attacks in the Parc du W, which is tri-national and shares an open border with Benin and Burkina Faso. Terrorist activity is increasing in south-eastern Burkina Faso, including confirmed terrorist attacks in the Parc. The Foreign and Commonwealth Office (FCO) therefore advise against all travel to the Parc plus the contiguous Dosso and Tamou hunting zones.
There’s a heightened threat of terrorist attack globally against UK interests and British nationals from groups or individuals motivated by the conflict in Iraq and Syria.
Kidnap
There are a number of terrorist groups active in the region. These include Jamaat Nusrat al-Islam wal Muslimeen (JNIM), Islamic State West Africa (ISWA), Islamic State Greater Sahara (ISGS), Al Qaeda in the Islamic Maghreb (AQIM), Al Murabitoun, Ansar Dine and Boko Haram. These groups are capable of carrying out attacks and kidnaps over long distances. Kidnapping for ransom is the primary source of finance for Jamaat Nusrat al-Islam wal Muslimeen (JNIM). Criminal gangs also carry out kidnapping for terrorist groups in return for financial rewards. Read more about the threat from terrorism in the Sahel region.
Westerners have been kidnapped in Niger and the wider Sahel region, including in Niamey and the north and west of Niger. In September 2018, a Catholic priest was kidnapped in Makolondi, 125 km southwest of Niamey. An aid worker was kidnapped in the Tillaberi region of Niger in April 2018. In October 2016, an aid worker was kidnapped in Abalak, 350 km northeast of Niamey.
Those engaged in humanitarian aid work, journalism or business sectors are viewed as legitimate targets. If you’re kidnapped, the reason for your presence is unlikely to serve as a protection or secure your safe release.
If you’re working or travelling in Niger, you should be aware of the risk of terrorist kidnapping. You should maintain a high level of vigilance at all times, including when travelling, in crowded public places, including camps for displaced people, religious gatherings and insecure spaces like places of worship, markets, shopping malls, hotels, bars, restaurants and transport hubs. You should make sure you have carefully considered the threat and have reasonable, proportionate mitigation measures in place.
The long-standing policy of the British government is not to make substantive concessions to hostage takers. The British government considers that paying ransoms and releasing prisoners builds the capability of terrorist groups and finances their activities. This can, in turn, increase the risk of further hostage taking. The Terrorism Act (2000) also makes payments to terrorists illegal.
