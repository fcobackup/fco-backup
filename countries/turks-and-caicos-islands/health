Before you travel check that:
your destination can provide the healthcare you may need
you have appropriate travel insurance for local treatment or unexpected medical evacuation
This is particularly important if you have a health condition or are pregnant.
Emergency medical number
Call 911 and ask for an ambulance.
Contact your insurance company quickly if you’re referred to a medical facility for treatment.
Vaccine recommendations and health risks
At least 8 weeks before your trip:
check the latest vaccine recommendations for the Turks and Caicos Islands
see where to get vaccines and whether you have to pay on the NHS travel vaccinations page
See what health risks you’ll face in the Turks and Caicos Islands, including:
Zika virus
dengue
chikungunya
Medication
Pharmacies on all islands are usually well stocked. However, less common medication may only be available from the hospital or pharmacies on Providenciales.
If you need more prescribed medicine, you need to go to a registered physician, who will either countersign your UK prescription or give you a new one. You will usually have to pay up front, then claim for reimbursement through your insurance.
The legal status and regulation of some medicines prescribed or bought in the UK can be different in other countries.

Healthcare in the Turks and Caicos Islands
There are hospitals on Providenciales and Grand Turk. They provide a range of services including diagnostic services, primary care and outpatient speciality clinics, emergency services and inpatient care. If the local hospitals cannot treat a patient, they can make a medical referral. The referral is usually regional, but could be to South America or the USA. Make sure your insurance is comprehensive and covers medical evacuation.
