The information on this page covers the most common types of travel and reflects the UK government’s understanding of the rules currently in place. Unless otherwise stated, this information is for travellers using a full ‘British Citizen’ passport.
The authorities in the country or territory you’re travelling to are responsible for setting and enforcing the rules for entry. If you’re unclear about any aspect of the entry requirements, or you need further reassurance, you’ll need to contact the embassy, high commission or consulate of the country or territory you’re travelling to.
You should also consider checking with your transport provider or travel company to make sure your passport and other travel documents meet their requirements.
Restrictions in response to coronavirus
Entry and borders
Upon arrival, all non-exempt foreign nationals are required to provide proof of health insurance that covers COVID-19 observation and treatment for the duration of their stay. Insurance must be purchased from a company registered in Ukraine or a foreign company that has a representative office or an insurance partner in Ukraine.
From 5 August 2021, new rules are in place. All non-exempt foreign nationals, in addition to their health insurance policy, must have: a document confirming receipt of a full course of Covid-19 vaccination with WHO-approved vaccines – which Ukraine lists as Pfizer, AstraZeneca (Vaxzevria, Covishield and SKBio), Janssen, Moderna, Sinopharm and CoronaVac, or one of: a negative Rapid Antigen Test taken no more than 72 hours before entry; or a negative PCR test taken no more than 72 hours before entry. The requirement for proof of vaccination or a negative test does not apply to children under 12. (See ‘Demonstrating your COVID-19 vaccination status’)
Non-exempt foreign nationals without proof of a full course of vaccination (ie both doses) will be required to install the “Vdoma” app and self-isolate, 72 hours after arrival at the address registered on the app. During that time, you can take a PCR or Rapid Antigen test to end your self-isolation, or leave the country (with no further tests required). If you do not take a test or leave the country, a further 10-day period of self-isolation begins, which can also be ended by receiving a negative PCR or Rapid Antigen test. The State Border Service will refuse entry to anyone who is unable to, or refuses to install the “Vdoma” app. See the official Visit Ukraine site and click “more details” for further information.
Anyone arriving from Russia or India (with certain exceptions) or who have been in Russia or India for 7 or more days of the preceding 14 will have to undergo a mandatory 14-day self-isolation with no possibility to end it early.
In addition to these requirements, non-resident foreign nationals arriving from countries that Ukraine has classified as having a high rate of the Delta variant (currently the UK, India, Portugal and Russia), or who have spent 7 or more days of the previous 14 days in those countries, must take an express test at the border crossing, and receive a negative result, before being allowed to enter Ukraine.
Resident foreign nationals and Ukrainian citizens (including dual nationals) returning from the UK, India, Portugal or Russia, or having spent 7 or more days of the previous 14 days in those countries, must also take an express test at the border crossing. If they receive a positive result, they will be allowed to enter Ukraine, but will be required to undergo further medical observation at the discretion of the Ukrainian authorities.
According to the resolution 1236 (9 December 2020) of the Ukrainian Government (Cabinet of Ministers), as updated on 28 July 2021 by resolution 787, certain categories of foreign nationals are exempt from the insurance, PCR/RAT/express testing or vaccination requirements, and do not have to install the “Vdoma” app. These categories include foreign nationals who are: recognised as refugees; accredited diplomats in Ukraine, or members of accredited diplomats’ families; air, sea, and land transport crews; or military personnel from NATO or “Partnership for Peace” countries taking part in exercises with the Ukrainian military. The full list of exemptions is available on Visit Ukraine (click “more details” and scroll to the bottom).
Foreign nationals who are resident in Ukraine are exempt from the insurance and PCR/RAT testing or vaccination requirement, but are subject to express testing on arrival from the UK, India, Portugal or Russia.
The final decision on a person’s eligibility to enter Ukraine rests with the Ukrainian State Border Service. The entry requirement policies of foreign governments are imposed and enforced at their discretion.
If you are a dual Ukrainian-British national, you must either have proof of full vaccination or a Ministry of Health 063-O certificate proving the receipt of your first dose of vaccine. Otherwise, you will need to install the “Vdoma” app and self-isolate for 72 hours after arrival at the address registered on the app. During that time, you can take a PCR or Rapid Antigen test to end your self-isolation. If you do not take a test or leave the country, a further 10-day period of self-isolation begins, which can also be ended by receiving a negative PCR or Rapid Antigen test. More information for those with Ukrainian citizenship is available on the Visit Ukraine website.
Demonstrating your COVID-19 vaccination status
Ukraine has not yet confirmed that it will accept the UK’s proof of COVID-19 recovery and vaccination record. You should follow the entry rules for unvaccinated people. Your NHS appointment card from vaccination centres is not designed to be used as proof of vaccination.
Transiting Ukraine
Foreign nationals transiting Ukraine are required to provide proof of health insurance that covers COVID-19 observation and treatment for the duration of their stay. Insurance must be purchased from a company registered in Ukraine or a foreign company that has a representative office or an insurance partner in Ukraine.
Quarantine requirements
Foreign nationals and Ukrainian citizens with a valid certificate of vaccination that meets Ukrainian requirements will not have to self-isolate on arrival in Ukraine. Those without proof of vaccination will have to self-isolate at an address registered on the “Vdoma” app (until they have fulfilled the post-arrival requirement for a negative PCR/RAT test, see Entry and Borders section above). More information about “Vdoma” is available on the Ukrainian Cabinet of Ministers’ website.
Travellers arriving in Ukraine or crossing the administrative points from non-government-controlled parts of Donetsk and Luhansk oblasts and Crimea will be subject to health monitoring on arrival. You should comply with any additional screening measures put in place by the authorities.
Further information about visiting Ukraine during the quarantine period can be found at the Ukrainian authorities’ Visit Ukraine webpage.
Regular entry requirements
Visas
British Citizen passport holders can enter Ukraine without a visa for visits of up to 90 days within a 180-day period. Ukraine has confirmed that this policy will continue to apply to British citizens until 30 January 2022.
Although there are no penalties for British citizens overstaying under the visa-free regime during quarantine (providing they leave within 30 days of quarantine ending), anyone who has overstayed will not be able to return to Ukraine for 90 days after leaving the country.
If you’re planning to stay in Ukraine for longer than 90 days in a 180 day period, you need to get a visa. For more advice on entry requirements contact the Ukrainian Embassy in London or Consulate General in Edinburgh.
You don’t need to complete an immigration card. Immigration officials may require you to scan your fingerprints as part of biometric data collection at border crossing points. For more details, visit the website of the State Border Guard Service of Ukraine
Proof of financial means
You may be asked to provide evidence that you have sufficient funds to support you during your stay. The Ukrainian authorities accept the following as a proof of sufficient funds: cash, bank cards along with bank statements, accommodation bookings, tourist vouchers, a letter from the person or company you’re visiting stating that they will cover your expenses, a return ticket or onward travel ticket. You can find more information on the websites of the Ukrainian Embassy in the UK and State Border Service of Ukraine.
Passport validity
If you’re travelling without a visa, your passport should be valid for the proposed duration of your stay. No additional period of validity beyond this is required.
If you’re applying for a visa, your passport may need to have an additional period of validity. Check with the Ukrainian Embassy in London for further details.
Borders
It’s illegal under Ukrainian law to enter internationally recognised Ukrainian territory through a border point that isn’t currently controlled by the Ukrainian authorities. If you do so, you risk arrest or a fine, and you may be subject to a travel ban.
International border crossings that aren’t currently under the control of the Ukrainian authorities include all land border crossings into Donetsk oblast, many of the land border crossings into Luhansk oblast, all air and sea ports in Crimea and the Kerch Bridge road and rail crossing into Crimea.
If you intend to visit any of the areas not controlled by the Ukrainian authorities, you should apply to the State Migration Service of Ukraine for a special entry permit. Information on border crossing procedure, entry/exit regulations and checkpoints are provided at the State Border Guard Service of Ukraine website.
Travelling between Ukraine and Belarus
On 2 July, the Belarusian authorities announced the imminent closure of the land border between Ukraine and Belarus. British nationals should check with the Belarusian State Border Committee, or call their 24- hour hotline (+375 17 365 26 12), for the latest information on the situation at the land crossings, before planning any overland travel. Air travel is currently also not permitted. If you have any existing train, flight or tour tickets, you should contact the travel operator seeking advice.
UK Emergency Travel Documents
UK Emergency Travel Documents are accepted for entry, airside transit and exit from Ukraine.
Customs regulations
