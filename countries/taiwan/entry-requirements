The information on this page covers the most common types of travel and reflects the UK government’s understanding of the rules currently in place. Unless otherwise stated, this information is for travellers using a full ‘British Citizen’ passport.
The authorities in the country or territory you’re travelling to are responsible for setting and enforcing the rules for entry. If you’re unclear about any aspect of the entry requirements, or you need further reassurance, you’ll need to contact the embassy, high commission or consulate of the country or territory you’re travelling to.
You should also consider checking with your transport provider or travel company to make sure your passport and other travel documents meet their requirements.
Entry rules in response to coronavirus (COVID-19)
Entry to Taiwan
Foreign nationals are permitted to enter Taiwan provided they are not entering for tourism or to visit friends. There are currently no visa waivers for visitors to Taiwan. Before you travel you should apply for a visa to enter Taiwan. This can be done at the Taipei Representative Office (TRO) in the country from which you plan to travel.
Foreign nationals entering Taiwan must provide a negative COVID-19 test report completed within three working days prior to boarding their entry flight.
The type of test required is a RT-PCR test. The certificate with the test result should be in English. In the UK, provision of COVID-19 testing on the NHS is restricted according to eligibility criteria. If you are not eligible for an NHS test in the UK, you will need to identify a private provider to obtain your test. You should confirm that the test you intend to take, and the certificate you will receive, meets the requirements set by the authorities in Taiwan.
If you already hold a valid Alien Resident Certificate (ARC) or Alien Permanent Resident Certificate (APRC), you do not require a visa to enter Taiwan. The requirement to provide a negative COVID-19 test report does not apply to returning ARC and APRC holders. For more information, you should visit the website of the Taiwan Centers for Disease Control (CDC). If you are in Taiwan you can also contact the ‘Information For Foreigners In Taiwan’ helpline on 0800-024-111.
If you are unsure if you are permitted to enter Taiwan, or you have further questions about entry restrictions and conditions, you should contact your local Taipei Representative Office (TRO) or airline before you attempt to travel. Entry procedures are being regularly reviewed, so may change at short notice.
Quarantine requirements
All airline passengers entering Taiwan are required to fill in a health declaration which includes travel history for the preceding 14 days.
On arrival in Taiwan you are legally required to self-isolate for 14 days. Local authorities monitor those self-isolating, and there are financial penalties for anyone breaching the law.
In addition to completing a health declaration on arrival, you may be asked to install a local SIM card if you do not already have one. Mobile phone location monitoring will be used as part of the quarantine management process by local authorities.
You will be required to provide temperature and health status updates to local authorities during self-isolation.
Travellers from countries and territories that are designated as low risk by the local authorities may be permitted to self-isolate for a period less than 14 days. You should check the current regulations before you travel with the Taipei Representative Office (TRO) in the country you plan to travel from. Travellers from the United Kingdom are required to complete the 14-day quarantine period.
Transiting Taiwan
New rules allowing transits are in place. Foreign passengers, including people from Hong Kong and Macau, are allowed to transit through Taoyuan International Airport. Holders of People’s Republic of China (PRC) passports are not be permitted to transit in Taiwan.
Those transiting will need to board connecting flights of the same airline company they fly in on. Transits must last less than 8 hours. Transit passengers, who need to wait for more than one hour, will remain separate from other passengers and stay in a separate area.
Rules and procedures may change at short notice. Not all airlines are permitted to transit through Taiwan. For further information, you should contact your airline or travel provider.
Regular entry requirements
Visas
These visa rules do not apply at present, please refer to entry rules in response to COVID-19 for the latest information.
You may spend up to 90 days in Taiwan without a visa. You can then extend this by a further 90 days once you have entered Taiwan. If you plan to stay in Taiwan for longer than 180 days you must have a visa before you arrive.
Specific rules exist for naturalised British Citizens born in the People’s Republic of China and holders of British National (Overseas) passports wishing to enter under the visa waiver scheme.
For further information on entry requirements, contact the Taipei Representative Office in London, 50 Grosvenor Gardens, London, SW1W 0EB, telephone: 020 7881 2650 or in Edinburgh, 1 Melville Street, Edinburgh EH3 7PE, telephone: 01312 206886.
Passport validity
Your passport should be valid for a minimum period of six months from the date of entry into Taiwan.
UK Emergency Travel Documents
UK Emergency Travel Documents are accepted for entry, airside transit and exit from Taiwan. If you’re entering Taiwan using an Emergency Travel Document (ETD), you must apply for a visit visa before travelling (unless you’re travelling from mainland China, in which case you can get a visa on arrival).
Customs regulations
You should not enter Taiwan with animal products without prior authorisation as those caught smuggling products may face heavy fines. Due to recent reports of African Swine Fever Virus (ASF) in pork products, particularly from the People’s Republic of China (PRC), local authorities have increased quarantine checks and inspections
Medications
When bringing medications into Taiwan, you should bring a prescription from a hospital, clinic or doctor stating that the medicines are for the use of the individual. The amount brought in must be consistent with the amount on the prescription. See Health
