Travel to the airport
Buses and taxis are not yet permitted to return to normal work in Grenada. If you need a taxi/bus to Maurice Bishop International airport for the repatriation flights 3-5 June, you will need to pre-book one from a provider which has been approved by the police. You will receive information with your booking confirmation about which ones are approved. You will need to wear a face mask and adhere to social distancing while travelling i.e. one passenger per row.
A special UK Government chartered ferry will be available to bring passengers over from Carriacou for the repatriation flights. Exact details will be sent to passengers at the time of booking. Travellers from Carricaou are able to use taxis there without police approval but will need to pre-book a taxi from the approved list for the journey from Grenada port to the airport as above.
Future options
The British High Commission in Barbados is in contact with airlines, the Grenada authorities and other governments to make sure commercial options for returning to the UK are available as soon as possible.
It is possible to book a private charter with Airawak from Grenada to Martinique from where connections to the UK via Paris are available. Please consider if this might be a viable option for you. Anyone considering travelling by this route is responsible for ensuring that they meet all requirements for entry / onward travel of any and all countries and territories. To this end, they should review relevant country pages on FCO Travel Advice.
This travel advice will be updated when further departure options become available.

You will need to pay for your return travel to the UK. If departure options are available but you cannot afford the travel costs and have exhausted all other options for getting funds, you may be eligible to apply for an emergency loan from the government. This is a last resort option and you would need to repay the loan when you are back in the UK. For more information, you should contact Corporate Travel Management (CTM). CTM are a commercial partner of the FCO and are authorised to administer such loans on behalf of the FCO.
