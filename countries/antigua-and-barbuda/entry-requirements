Entry rules in response to coronavirus (COVID-19)
Pre-arrival requirements
No person my enter or transit Antigua and Barbuda if they have spent any of the previous 14 days before arrival/transit in Belgium, Botswana, Hong Kong or South Africa.
Up to and including 14 December all arriving and transiting passengers aged 18 and over, including returning residents and Antigua and Barbuda nationals, must provide evidence of having received at least one dose of a two-dose WHO-approved COVID-19 vaccine or a full dose of a single-dose WHO-approved COVID-19 vaccine. From 15 December onwards all arriving and transiting passengers aged 18 and over, including returning residents and Antigua and Barbuda nationals, must provide evidence of having received both doses of a two-dose WHO-approved COVID-19 vaccine, or a full dose of a single-dose WHO-approved COVID-19 vaccine. All COVID-19 vaccines administered in the UK are WHO-approved. Children aged 17 and younger do not need to have been vaccinated to enter or transit Antigua and Barbuda.
All passengers aged between 5 – 17 years, arriving by air (including those transiting the country), who are not vaccinated or who are partially vaccinated must provide evidence of a negative COVID-19 RT-PCR test taken within 3 days of their flight. Only tests administered by health care professionals are accepted. Home tests and rapid antigen tests are not permitted. Children aged four and under are exempt from pre-arrival COVID testing.
All fully vaccinated arriving passengers must present a negative RT PCR test result of 3 days or fewer from date of testing to be permitted entry into Antigua and Barbuda.
You should not use the NHS testing service to get a test in order to facilitate your travel to another country. You should arrange to take a private test.
Testing / screening on arrival
Further health screening is in place at VC Bird International Airport and the private jet terminal for all international arrivals. Passengers must complete a Health Declaration Form and will be subject to temperature checks by Port Health Authorities. Arriving passengers who are allowed to stay in their private homes or at a government facility will be required to wear a monitoring bracelet according to the Quarantine Authority regulations.
Additional measures are subject to change but may include mandatory temperature, travel history checks, a check on whether your accommodation is on the Government of Antigua and Barbuda’s Approved List, and completion of a Health Declaration Form. You should expect long waiting times on arrival.
Arriving by sea
Passengers aged 5 years old or over arriving by sea must provide evidence of a negative COVID-19 RT-PCR test taken no more than 4 days before their last point of departure and follow the Government of Antigua and Barbuda’s Yachting Health and Safety Guidance and Operational Protocols. All Marine Pleasure Craft and Ferry Services entering the waters of Antigua and Barbuda should contact the Antigua Port Authority, using VHF Channel 16, at least 6 hours prior to arrival. Instructions will be given to guide the crafts to either the Nevis Street Pier or English Harbour Ports or to a holding area where they must follow the screening and quarantine instructions of Port Health.
Quarantine requirements
On arrival, you will be subject to health screening. The Ministry of Health and Wellness of Antigua and Barbuda advise that all arrivals will be monitored for coronavirus for up to 14 days and that ultimately it is the decision of the Quarantine Authority on who must self-isolate or quarantine on arrival.
All tourist and business travellers who are partially vaccinated will be permitted to stay in Government-approved accommodation (see Pre-Arrival Requirements Information above).
Residents of Antigua and Barbuda and visitors staying with family, friends, in private accommodation, in their own place of residence or other location not on the Government of Antigua and Barbuda’s Approved List, may be subject to an interview to determine their travel plans and suitability to leave for their accommodation arrangements. Partially vaccinated returning residents may be required to quarantine as directed by the Quarantine Authorities, which might include paying to stay in government quarantine facilities at a cost of XCD 82.00 per night.
Failure to comply with any order, guideline or direction of the Quarantine Authority or other health authorities is considered an offence carrying a fine of up to XCD 10,000 and/or six months imprisonment.
Demonstrating your COVID-19 status
Antigua or Barbuda will accept the UK’s proof of COVID-19 vaccination record. It does not accept the UK’s proof of COVID-19 recovery letter. Your NHS appointment card from vaccination centres is not designed to be used as proof of vaccination and should not be used to demonstrate your vaccine status.
