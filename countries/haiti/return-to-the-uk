Coronavirus guidance is being updated.
Read the Prime Minister’s statement for the latest information.

Future commercial international flight departures cannot be guaranteed. Infrequent commercial flights have left Haiti for the USA, Canada and France. Such flights are advertised at short notice (48-24 hours before departure). Tickets for these flights can be purchased through the relevant airlines website.
Where possible, and if they become available in the future, the British Embassy in Haiti will share relevant information about departure options on our travel advice and on Twitter @UKinHaiti.
No further flights are currently planned.
Future travel options
The UK government is working closely with airlines, the Haitian authorities and other governments to make sure options are available for you to return to the UK as soon as possible.
This travel advice will be updated when departure options become available. Sign up for travel advice email alerts and follow the British Embassy on Twitter.
You will need to pay for your return travel to the UK. If departure options are available but you cannot afford the travel costs and have exhausted all other options for getting funds, you may be eligible to apply for an emergency loan from the government. This is a last resort option and you would need to repay the loan when you are back in the UK.
For more information, you should contact Corporate Travel Management (CTM). CTM are a commercial partner of the FCO and are authorised to administer such loans on behalf of the FCO.
Your journey home: re-entering the UK
When you return, you must follow the rules for entering the UK. You:
need to provide your journey and contact details up to 48 hours before you’re due to arrive in the UK
are not allowed to leave the place you’re staying for the first 14 days you’re in the UK except in very limited situations (known as ‘self-isolating’)
See also the list of people who are exempt from the border rules.
The National Travel Health Network and Centre (NaTHNaC) also provides advice on how to stay safe as you travel by air.
Help and support
If you need urgent consular assistance, you can contact the British Embassy in Santo Domingo on +1 809 472 7111. Given the current Health State of Emergency in Haiti, the British Embassy in Port au Prince is not currently open for visitors.
The Embassy cannot provide further information or advice about departure options over the phone. This page will be updated when departure options become available. To get the latest information, sign up for travel advice email alerts.
If you cannot leave Haiti
If you cannot leave Haiti at this time, see advice on staying in Haiti during coronavirus.
