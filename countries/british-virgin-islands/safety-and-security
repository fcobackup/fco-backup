Crime
Although most visits to the BVI are trouble-free, serious incidents, including armed robbery, do occur. You should take sensible precautions against petty crime:
avoid walking alone in isolated areas including beaches, particularly after dark
don’t carry large amounts of cash or jewellery
use a hotel safe if possible
never leave anything valuable unattended on the beach.
Take particular care of your passport, as it can’t be renewed or replaced in the BVI.
Don’t offer resistance to an armed robber. If you need help contact the police on one of the following numbers as their 911 and 311 services are currently not functional:
+1 284 468 9001
+1 284 468 9000
+1 284 344 1818
+1 284 344 1822
+1 284 344 1977
+1 284 545 4866
Local travel
Ferry services between Tortola and its sister islands of Virgin Gorda, Anegada and Jost Van Dyke, and also to the US Virgin Islands have now resumed.
Road travel
Temporary driving licences are no longer issued in the BVI. You can drive for up to 30 days on a UK licence and then must apply for a local one at the Vehicle Department. Cars are left-hand drive, and vehicles drive on the left as in the UK.
Take great care when driving, particularly on the mountain roads.
Standard taxi fares exist for most destinations, but it is sensible to clarify the fare with the driver beforehand.
Sea travel
The yacht charter business in BVI has returned to normal since the 2017 hurricanes.
Many visitors to the BVI take part in water sports. The rate of accidents is very low, but they do occur. Many accidents involve the consumption of alcohol. Fear and dehydration exaggerate the effects of alcohol, so take care if you have been drinking.
Virgin Islands Search and Rescue (VISAR) respond to emergencies at sea. VISAR can be contacted by sending a distress call on VHF Channel 16, or dialling 767 (SOS), +1 284 499 0911 (emergency) or +1 284 345 4357 (office).
Emergency assistance
As the British Virgin Islands (BVI) is a British Overseas Territory, there is no formal British diplomatic or consular representation. The local authorities deal with all requests for emergency assistance.
Since Hurricane Irma hit in September 2017, the UK Government continues to provide support with the recovery.
