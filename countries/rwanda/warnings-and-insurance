Areas where FCDO advises against travel
Rubavu District
FCDO advises against all travel to Rubavu District. This includes the town of Gisenyi and the border crossing point at Gisenyi-Goma.
Rwanda-DRC border
Risks associated with increased fighting in Democratic Republic of Congo (DRC) may affect people on the Rwandan side of the border, due to the closeness of the fighting. On 27 January, there were reports of gunfire and artillery fire in Gisenyi. The security situation in DRC near to Rwanda’s border is unstable (see Democratic Republic of the Congo travel advice - GOV.UK for more information). Keep up to date with developments through your tour operator or local media.
The border crossings between Rwanda and DRC at Gisenyi-Goma could close at short notice.
