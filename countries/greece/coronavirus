Cases of coronavirus (COVID-19) have been confirmed in Greece. The Greek authorities have introduced measures to limit the spread of the virus.
If you’re in Greece and wish to leave, contact your travel operator to make arrangements to do so as soon as possible. For information on how to return to the UK from Greece, see Return to the UK
Entry and borders
Direct commercial flights between the UK and Greece (in both directions) are suspended from midnight local time on 23 March until 23.59 Greek time on 15 May. At present, it is possible to travel indirectly between Greece and the UK (and vice versa). Options include travelling via Paris, Brussels, Zurich, and Doha, though some itineraries are likely to require an overnight stay between flights or between flights and Eurostar connections. You should contact airlines or travel operators directly for more information. You should check travel advice for any country you plan to transit through. Please contact the British Embassy in Athens if you need assistance.
The Greek authorities are exploring options to repatriate Greek citizens who wish to return to Greece, including the possibility of repatriation flights. If you are a permanent resident in Greece, and need to return to Greece from the UK, you may be able to travel on any flights organised by the Greek authorities. You will need to provide proof of residency, via a Registration Certificate or Permanent Residence Document. You should contact the Greek Embassy in London for further information.
Travel between the UK and Greece by road, rail or ferry is likely to be difficult at this time. Countries neighbouring Greece (Albania, Bulgaria, Italy, North Macedonia, Turkey) have also introduced restrictions, including the closure of land borders and the suspension of rail and ferry links. Check FCO Travel Advice pages for details if you are planning to travel via these countries, and speak to your travel operator in case of disruption.
From 16 March, everyone arriving in Greece from abroad must go into 14 days’ self-isolation. This is mandatory, and the authorities will enforce it by prosecution and fines. UK nationals are not affected by the European Union’s measures to close EU borders to third country nationals.
Travel to the Greek islands is restricted, starting from 6am local time on 21 March. To purchase a ticket to travel to an island, you will need to provide proof of permanent residence (via a tax certificate) on the island to which you wish to travel. One-way travel from islands to the mainland is not restricted.
All cruise ships and sailboats (including private yachts) are banned from landing in Greek ports. Private sailboat (and yacht) travel between 2 points within Greece is also forbidden. All yachts currently at sea were required to dock by midnight local time on 21 March.
Local measures
The Greek authorities announced significant restrictions on movements outside the home for the foreseeable future. From 6am local time on 23 March, movement outside your home or accommodation is permitted only for a prescribed set of reasons, including to visit the supermarket, pharmacy, doctor; or to go to work. Journeys by car are only permitted for these reasons, and the driver may only have one passenger in their vehicle. When requested by the Greek authorities, you will need to provide paper or digital certification of the purpose of your movement; failure to produce such certification is punishable by a fine of €150. In addition, you should also carry your ID card or passport when leaving your home or accommodation. For full information on these restrictions, including detail on permitted activities and how to certify movements in line with the official requirements, visit the website of the Greek government.
The Greek government has ordered the closure of all cafes, bars and restaurants, as well as shopping centres and malls, theatres and cinemas, children’s playgrounds, beauty salons, libraries, sports centres, museums and archaeological sites as well as beach clubs, ski centres and seasonal accommodation. Take away food services will continue to operate and supermarkets, bakeries and pharmacies remain open.
All schools, nurseries and universities are currently closed. Public gatherings of more than 10 people are forbidden. The government has also banned all large events and conferences for the time being. If you are due to attend an event, you should check with the event organiser before travelling.
The Greek authorities announced on 19 March that most accommodation, including hotels, closed at midnight (local time) on 22 March, to help prevent the spread of coronavirus. At present, AirBnB accommodation remains available.
Most campsites in Greece have closed, however the campsite in Igoumenitsa, at Drepano Beach, is currently open, and local authorities have undertaken to supply facilities to those in Campervans who have nowhere else to stay. We strongly advise that you confirm this with the campsite before travelling.
Changes to what is open or permitted, including international travel options, have been coming frequently and without warning. Keep up to date with the latest information and advice from your travel contact or business partners, as well as the sources in this travel advice.
Healthcare
If you think you have symptoms, including a fever or respiratory difficulties such as shortness of breath or a cough, you should avoid visiting local health facilities, but contact a doctor remotely to see whether a test is recommended. For more information, consult the Greek National Public Health Organisation (NPHO) online or via telephone (dial 1135, or 210 521 2054, from within Greece). The NPHO can provide contact details of a doctor; their telephone line operates 24 hours a day. You should continue to follow this advice if symptoms develop after the conclusion of a 14-day period of self-isolation.
