See the TravelHealthPro website for further advice on travel abroad and reducing spread of respiratory viruses during the COVID-19 pandemic.
International travel
Direct and indirect lights between the UK and Tunisia are in operation. Contact your travel agent for details.
Travellers from all countries into Tunisia must take a PCR test less than 72 hours before travel and carry dated evidence of a negative result. This does not apply to children under 12 years old.
From 25 August, if you are not fully vaccinated you are required to enter mandatory quarantine in a government-approved hotel for ten days on arrival in Tunisia.
You are exempt from the requirement to enter mandatory quarantine if you can present official evidence to prove you have been fully vaccinated, but it is recommended that you self-isolate at home for ten days.
Children under the age of 18 who are unaccompanied or who are travelling with vaccinated adults are permitted to self-isolate at home, rather than in mandatory quarantine.
You are exempt from the requirement to self-isolate if you are travelling on an inclusive holiday with a tour operator.
See Entry requirements for full details.
Entry and borders
See Entry requirements to find out what you will need to do when you arrive in Tunisia.
Returning to the UK
When you return, you must follow the rules for entering the UK.
Tunisia is on the red list for entering England. From 4am on Monday 11 October, Tunisia will no longer be on the red list for entering England. Check what you must do to travel abroad and return to England, Scotland, Wales or Northern Ireland.
No testing is available at the airport or sea ports. Passengers travelling from Tunisia, who require a test for the country they are travelling to, should arrange a private test.
You should contact local authorities for information on testing facilities. A test can be organised on the Ministry of Health webpage (available in French only).
There have been some reports of travellers from Tunisia being denied entry to a third country, on suspicion of carrying fake PCR test results. This may affect you if you are transiting in one country before onward travel to the UK.
For verification, travellers are advised to carry the original copy of their negative PCR test result, and ensure this has been signed and stamped by the laboratory, before travelling. A QR code on digital test results, if provided by the laboratory, can also be presented to verify the result.
Be prepared for your plans to change
No travel is risk-free during COVID. Countries may further restrict travel or bring in new rules at short notice, for example due to a new COVID-19 variant. Check with your travel company or airline for any transport changes which may delay your journey home.
If you test positive for COVID-19, you may need to stay where you are until you test negative. You may also need to seek treatment there.
Plan ahead and make sure you:
can access money
understand what your insurance will cover
can make arrangements to extend your stay and be away for longer than planned

If you think you have COVID-19 symptoms, you should call a doctor or lab. They will ask a series of questions to assess whether it is likely that you have COVID-19. If COVID-19 is suspected, then they may arrange for someone to come to your home or hotel to conduct a test and they will advise you to self-isolate. You can pay for a test, if required for travel purposes, at the Institut Pasteur.
