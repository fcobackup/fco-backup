There is a reciprocal healthcare agreement for British nationals, which entitles you to free emergency treatment in Macedonia. You will need to present your passport and an European Health Insurance Card as proof of entitlement. The health system in all parts of Macedonia is suffering from widespread shortage of medicines and other essentials and you may need to pay some of the initial costs (usually between 50 and 100 Euros). If the treatment is not deemed an emergency then you will have to pay the full cost yourself. Make sure you have adequate travel and medical insurance.
Mosquito-borne diseases including West Nile virus are present in Macedonia.
