The Nicaraguan government has reportedly closed its borders until further notice. A Cayman Airways flight due to repatriate Nicaraguan nationals on 18 April was denied permission to land. There are currently no commercial options available to return to the UK from Nicaragua. Aeromexico have recently cancelled a number of flights. Their last flight to leave Nicaragua was on 9 April.
What to do
To enable us to respond quickly to those trying to get home or who are affected by COVID-19, use our Embassy’s email address (based in Costa Rica): Consular.CostaRica@fco.gov.uk. When doing so, you should provide your full name, contact details, location and description of the situation. A member of our consular team will reach out to you.
If you cannot leave Nicaragua at this time, you should:
follow the advice of local authorities, including local measures to help minimise your risk of exposure to coronavirus
find accommodation that’s suitable for your needs.
keep in regular contact with family and friends at home, so they know you are safe and well
contact your airline, tour operator and travel insurance to see what help they can provide.

Local Travel
The domestic airline La Costeña continues to offer services. Public transport is functioning as normal.
Travel via Costa Rica or Honduras
Leaving Nicaragua by land via a neighboring country is no longer possible as both Costa Rica and Honduras have imposed entry restrictions.
Future travel options
There are currently no further commercial options available to return to the UK from Nicaragua. This travel advice will be updated when departure options become available.
You will need to pay for your return travel to the UK. If departure options are available but you cannot afford the travel costs and have exhausted all other options for getting funds, you may be eligible to apply for an emergency loan from the government. This is a last resort option and you would need to repay the loan when you are back in the UK. For more information, you should contact Corporate Travel Management (CTM). CTM are a commercial partner of the FCO and are authorised to administer such loans on behalf of the FCO.
Sign up for travel advice email alerts and follow the British Embassy on Facebook and Twitter.
