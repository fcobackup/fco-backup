Coronavirus cases across India have risen sharply over the last few weeks. The healthcare system has come under significant strain as the number of COVID-19 cases increase across India. Critical care capacity is severely limited including shortages of equipment, oxygen, and bed spaces for both COVID-19 and non-COVID-19 emergencies. RT-PCR testing has become more difficult to arrange and results may take longer than expected, including for those who need negative RT-PCR tests to return to the UK. More information and detailed guidance is available on the website of Ministry of Health.
A limited number of flights between India and the UK continue to operate. To book tickets and to see important guidance prior to travel you should check airline websites. The British High Commission cannot assist with ticketing. The aviation sector remains unpredictable and is subject to change with short notice. To get the latest information sign up for travel advice email alerts. If you need emergency help from the UK government, contact the nearest British Embassy, Consulate or High Commission.
