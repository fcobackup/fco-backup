Earthquakes and tsunamis
As Japan is in a major earthquake zone you should familiarise yourself with safety procedures in the event of an earthquake or tsunami, and take note of instructions in hotel rooms, at train stations and on your local prefectural website. Information on earthquakes and any impact on towns and cities in Japan, including tsunami warnings, are published by the Japan Meteorological Agency. There are many smartphone apps available with information on how to stay safe in a natural disaster in Japan.
You should make yourself familiar with local procedures and preparations for natural disasters. You can also stay up to date with our travel advice for Japan by subscribing to our email alert service to be notified of future updates, and by following our Twitter and Facebook channels.
As part of your own contingency plans, you should make sure you have easy access to your passport and other important documents such as nationality documents and birth and marriage certificates, as well as any essential medication. You can read our crisis overseas page for further information and advice, including sections on what you can do to prepare effectively, what you should do in the event of a crisis abroad, and how we can help you.
To learn more about what to do before, during and after an earthquake, see the website of the US Federal Emergency Management Agency.
Volcanoes
There are several active volcanoes in Japan. You should monitor local media reports and follow the advice of local authorities. Check latest volcano warnings on the website of the Japanese Meteorological Agency.
Tropical cyclones
The tropical cyclone (typhoon) season runs from June to December with most activity between July and September. Southern parts of the country are particularly at risk. You should monitor the progress of approaching storms on the website of the Japan Meteorological Agency and via NHK news. Follow the advice of the local authorities and emergency services, including any evacuation orders.
Typhoons that hit Japan are often accompanied by damaging high tides. People living in coastal areas are particularly at risk. Landslides and flooding can occur anywhere. The dangers increase when an earthquake occurs shortly after a typhoon has saturated an area.
See our tropical cyclones page for information and advice about what to do if youâ€™re caught up in a storm.
