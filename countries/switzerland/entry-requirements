Coronavirus guidance is being updated.
Read the Prime Minister’s statement for the latest information.

The information on this page covers the most common types of travel and reflects the UK government’s understanding of the rules currently in place. Unless otherwise stated, this information is for travellers using a full ‘British Citizen’ passport.
The authorities in the country or territory you’re travelling to are responsible for setting and enforcing the rules for entry. If you’re unclear about any aspect of the entry requirements, or you need further reassurance, you’ll need to contact the embassy, high commission or consulate of the country or territory you’re travelling to.
You will require a valid passport or other travel document to enter Switzerland.

Travellers from the UK who do not have UK/EU/EFTA nationality will not be permitted to enter except for:
Swiss resident permit holders
