FCDO advises against all travel to Russia.
This advice reflects the UK government’s understanding of current rules for people travelling on a full ‘British citizen’ passport from the UK, for the most common types of travel.
The authorities in Russia set and enforce entry rules. If you’re not sure how these requirements apply to you, contact Russia’s embassy or consulate in the UK.
COVID-19 rules
There are no COVID-19 testing or vaccination requirements for travellers entering Russia.
Testing at airports
For passengers leaving Russia who require a test for their next destination, express COVID-19 tests can be carried out at some airports. In Moscow, express COVID-19 tests are available in Sheremetyevo, Domodedovo and Vnukovo airports. They may need to be booked in advance and pre-paid. In St Petersburg, express COVID-19 tests can be carried out at Pulkovo airport.
Passport validity requirements
Your passport should be valid for at least 6 months after your visa expires.
You cannot enter Russia using a visa in an expired passport, even if you’re also carrying a new, valid passport. You will need to apply for a new visa or visa transfer.
Sign your passport before you travel if it was issued after January 2017. Some British nationals have been denied entry for not signing their passports.
Dual nationals and passports
If you have dual British-Russian nationality and travel to Russia to renew your Russian passport, it may take up to 4 months to get your new passport. You will not be able to leave Russia on your British passport if you entered Russia on your Russian passport. You will have to stay in Russia until your new Russian passport is issued.
Children born overseas, outside of Russia, and added to their parents’ Russian passports may need their own passport to leave Russia. Check with the Russian Embassy in the UK before you travel.
Visa requirements
You must get a visa before you travel. See the Russia Visa Centre for further information on how to apply for a visa, including processing time and fast track services.
If you live in the UK and are aged 12 years or over, you must go to a visa application centre in London, Manchester or Edinburgh to submit biometric data (fingerprints).
If you’re a British national with a Russian national in your immediate family, you can apply for a multi-entry private visa for up to one year. Check what you need for your stay with the Russian Embassy in the UK.
The Russian authorities strictly enforce visa and immigration laws. Before you travel, check:
your visa details are correct
the terms and conditions of your visa
Overstaying your visa
If you overstay your visa, you may face fines, court hearings, deportation or a ban from re-entry.
Immigration cards
You must sign an immigration card at passport control every time you enter Russia.
Immigration officials keep one half. They return the other half to you. You must keep it and show it at passport control when you leave Russia or your departure could be delayed.
You will need to show your immigration card when exchanging money or when checking into you accommodation.
Questioning on arrival in Russia
There have been intensive security checks on foreign nationals at the Russian border. Some British nationals have been stopped and questioned and had fingerprints and DNA swabs taken. Security staff sometimes ask for access to data on phones and other electronic devices.
Some visitors have been held for up to 4 hours for identity checks, but are then usually allowed to continue their journeys. You should:
tell family, friends or colleagues about your travel plans and explain that the arrival process might take longer than usual
stay calm and avoid confrontation if you are stopped
Registering accommodation
You must register with the local authorities if you’re staying anywhere for more than 7 working days. Your hotel will do this automatically. If you’re staying with someone, check that they’re doing this. You must show evidence of your registration at passport control when you leave Russia. Police also carry out routine checks. If you cannot show your registration and passport, you may be fined.
Travelling between Russia and Belarus
By air
You will need to go through immigration control if you fly to Russia from Belarus or from Belarus to Russia. Contact the nearest Russian embassy or consulate to check if you need a transit visa.
By road
There are no immigration checks on the land border between Russia and Belarus. This means you will not be able to have your passport stamped and will therefore be entering the country illegally. If you’re planning to drive to Russia, you will need to drive through a different country.
By rail
Contact your train or tour operator before booking your travel to make sure you enter Russia through an immigration checkpoint. Contact your nearest Russian embassy or consulate for advice on rail travel.
Vaccination requirements (other than COVID-19)
At least 8 weeks before your trip, check the vaccinations and certificates you need in TravelHealthPro’s Russia guide.
Customs rules
There are strict rules about goods that can be brought into and taken out of Russia. You must declare anything that may be prohibited or subject to tax or duty.
Money or goods
You can import and export foreign currency up to 10,000 US dollars (or equivalent) without declaring it.
You cannot export foreign currency over 10,000 US dollars (or equivalent), even if you declare it.
You must complete a customs declaration form if you import over 10,000 US dollars (or equivalent) or certain types of goods, including:
electrical items
jewellery
antiques
valuable musical instruments
Electronic items
You must get a licence before you travel if you want to import certain electronic items, such as GPS instruments. Check with the Russian Embassy in the UK before your travel.
Antiques and art
There are strict regulations on the export and import of antiques, artworks and historical items. You must get an export permit from the Ministry of Culture and declare each item when you leave. It is illegal to import or export items without a permit.
Customs declaration forms
Make sure your customs declaration form is stamped by a customs official when you enter. If not, your money or items may be confiscated when you leave or you could be fined.
Keep receipts of any purchases in case you need to show them when you leave Russia.
Accessing money in Russia
The Russian economy is unstable. This could make access to goods and services difficult.
Mastercard and Visa are not operating in Russia. Mastercard and Visa cards issued outside Russia will not work at Russian shops or ATMs. Cards issued inside Russia will work in, but not outside, Russia. You may not be able to access your money through Russian banks or make payments to Russian businesses with non-Russian credit or debit cards.
For all other credit or debit cards, let your provider know you’re travelling to Russia to avoid your card being blocked for anti-fraud reasons.
Make sure that you have enough money to cover your stay.
Buying Russian roubles
It is illegal to pay directly for general transactions in Russia using foreign currency. It is difficult to get Russian roubles in high street banks in the UK. If you want to buy roubles in Russia, you must take US dollars or euros to exchange.
Only change money at banks, hotels and exchange bureaus. It is illegal to change money from street traders.
The British government has sanctioned several major Russian banks. This means British nationals are banned from making funds available to these banks. See more information about Russian sanctions and what this means for British nationals.
