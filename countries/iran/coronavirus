Cases of coronavirus (COVID-19) have been confirmed in Iran. The Iranian authorities have introduced a number of measures in parts of the country to limit the spread of the virus, which may affect your ability to travel inside the country.
Entry and borders
Some airlines are no longer flying in and out of Iran and many neighbouring countries have closed their borders or started monitoring travellers from Iran.
There may be further measures introduced at short notice. You should comply with any additional screening measures put in place by the authorities, and keep up to date with information from your tour operator, transport or accommodation provider on the impact on any existing travel plans.
Local measures
Some health measures have been put in place in parts of Iran, including temporary closures of schools, universities and public events.
There are reports of imposed travel restrictions in several provinces, including to important tourism and pilgrimage areas.
Further information
Further information on coronavirus, including advice on preparing for foreign travel and helping reduce the spread of respiratory diseases, is available from Public Health England and on the TravelHealthPro website.
