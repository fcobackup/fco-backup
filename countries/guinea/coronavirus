Coronavirus
Cases of coronavirus (COVID-19) have been confirmed in Guinea. The government of Guinea has introduced a number of measures to limit the spread of the virus.
Any passenger flights to or from Conakry are likely to be cancelled or suspended. The Government of Guinea has announced that all flights from countries with more than 30 cases of coronavirus will be suspended for 30 days from 21 March, expect for cargo and humanitarian flights.
Travellers who arrive will have their temperature checked on arrival at the airport, and those showing symptoms of coronavirus will be required to submit to the health services. This may involve compulsory quarantine in a government isolation centre.
Travellers from countries considered high risk by the Guinean authorities, which currently includes the UK, will be asked to submit their passports for a 14-day monitoring period, during which time they will need to record their temperature daily.
You should ensure you have a thermometer to enable you to check your temperature during the monitoring period. You should comply with any additional screening measures put in place by the authorities.
Keep up to date with information from your tour operator, transport or accommodation provider on the impact on any existing travel plans. If you need further information about entry requirements, contact the local immigration authorities or the nearest Guinean Embassy. You should also check with your airline or travel company for the latest information.
If you have any health concerns relating to coronavirus, call the local government helpline l’Agence Nationale de Securité Santé (ANSS) 629 995 656 / 626 069 797.
