Coronavirus travel health
Check the latest information on risk from COVID-19 for Thailand on the TravelHealthPro website
See the TravelHealthPro website for further advice on travel abroad and reducing spread of respiratory viruses during the COVID-19 pandemic.
You can find the latest information on COVID-19 case numbers in Thailand on the Department of Disease Control website.
You should contact Thailand’s Ministry of Public Health for information on testing facilities.
You should also ask your airline if they have any additional rules or requirements before you travel.
Entry and borders
See Entry requirements to find out what you will need to do when you arrive in Thailand.
Travelling from and returning to the UK
Check what you must do to travel abroad and return to England, Scotland, Wales or Northern Ireland.
If you plan to pass through another country to return to the UK, check the travel advice for the country you’re transiting.
Be prepared for your plans to change
No travel is risk-free during COVID-19. Countries may further restrict travel or bring in new rules at short notice, for example due to a new COVID-19 variant. Check with your travel company or airline for any transport changes which may delay your journey home.
If you test positive for COVID-19, you may need to stay where you are until you test negative. You may also need to seek treatment there.
Plan ahead and make sure you:
can access money
understand what your insurance will cover
can make arrangements to extend your stay and be away for longer than planned
International Travel
If you were vaccinated in Thailand and received a complete dose of an approved vaccine you may be able to use a vaccine certificate to prove your vaccination status. To check if you qualify see the list of approved vaccines and the list of countries and territories with approved COVID-19 proof of vaccination for travel.
Our Living in Thailand guidance on GOV.UK gives details on how to obtain proof of vaccination in Thailand.
Travel in Thailand
Domestic travel options within Thailand are available but remain subject to disease control measures.
If you are taking an internal flight in Thailand, you may be asked to download an app or complete additional travel documentation.
From 23 June, mask wearing is a voluntary practice. However, the Ministry of Public Health continues to recommend that you wear a mask in a crowded or badly ventilated place such as public transportation. You should wear a mask if you have COVID-19 symptoms or you are in a high risk group. Inside public buildings, you will need to wear a mask unless you are by yourself or are doing activities in which a mask cannot be worn. More information can be found on the PR Thai Government page.
COVID-related restrictions in Thailand
An emergency decree is currently in place. This includes instructions that you must not:
enter high risk areas
hoard essential goods
attend public gatherings
propagate false information
Measures change frequently. You should check the current situation with local authorities and the Thai government’s Facebook page and PR website.
Accommodation
Hotel and private rental accommodation is available throughout Thailand. However, some hotels remain closed so we advise you to contact hotels directly when booking.
The majority of hotels will ask to take your temperature on arrival and ask you to provide information on your recent travel history and any symptoms you may have related to COVID-19. You may also need to follow other disease control measures.
Some services and facilities in hotels may not be available e.g. leisure facilities.
Health
If you think you have COVID-19 symptoms, you should call the Thai COVID-19 Hotline on 1422.
If you need a COVID-19 test, Thailand’s Ministry of Public Health has compiled a list of private and government-managed testing facilities. These will provide you with a test and normally contact you afterwards with the result. Authorities may also contact you as part of their tracing process.
Policies on what happens when you test positive vary significantly and can include mandatory quarantine in a hospital for long periods. You should ensure that you understand your health care provider’s policies before you take a test as these will include where you quarantine and receive medical care if you test positive.
If you test positive for COVID-19 and have mild symptoms or are asymptomatic, Thai authorities recommend that you self-isolate at home. Decisions on your quarantine period and further medical care should be made by the doctor who is attending you. This also applies to school age children. The National Health Security Office (NHSO) provides medical support and services for home isolation. To register, you can call the 1330 hotline. More information can be found on the PR Thai Government Facebook page.
If you have more severe symptoms Thai public health regulations require that you quarantine at either a hospital, a repurposed hotel with medical capabilities or field hospital.
If you test positive for the Omicron variant your case should be handled in the same way as other forms of COVID-19, but there may be significant variation in treatment in different hospitals and care providers.
You may be separated from your children if they test positive for COVID-19. If this happens and you need help, you can call the Embassy on +66 (0)2 305 8333.
There may also be specific measures in place that impact on maternity services in some hospitals. You should ensure you understand your health care provider’s policies so you can make the choices that work best for you. The WHO has useful guidance on COVID and maternity/post-natal care.
Your emotional and mental wellbeing is important. Read guidance on how to look after your mental wellbeing and mental health.
