There are currently limited commercial options available to return to the UK from the Central African Republic (CAR).
Travel options
If you wish to leave CAR, register your interest by emailing the British Embassy in Kinshasa at Kinshasa.Consular@fco.gov.uk
This travel advice will be updated when departure options become available. Sign up for travel advice email alerts and follow the British Embassy Kinshasa on Twitter and Facebook.
You will need to pay for your return travel to the UK. If departure options are available but you cannot afford the travel costs and have exhausted all other options for getting funds, you may be eligible to apply for an emergency loan from the government. This is a last resort option and you would need to repay the loan when you are back in the UK. For more information, you should contact Corporate Travel Management (CTM). CTM are a commercial partner of the FCO and are authorised to administer such loans on behalf of the FCO.
Your journey home
The National Travel Health Network and Centre (NaTHNaC) provides advice on how to stay safe as you travel by air.
