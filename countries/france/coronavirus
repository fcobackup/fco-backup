Coronavirus travel health
Check the latest information on risk from COVID-19 for France on the TravelHealthPro website
See the TravelHealthPro website for further advice on travel abroad and reducing spread of respiratory viruses during the COVID-19 pandemic.
Some travel operators such as airlines may specify types of masks to be worn on board e.g. surgical masks, and may encourage you to take spares for long journeys. Please check with your travel operator before travelling.
From 7 July, PCR and rapid antigen tests will no longer be free for international travellers visiting France. The cost of these tests will be €49 for PCR tests and €29 for rapid antigen tests. If you have a prescription from a French medical practitioner or are identified as having been in contact with someone who has a confirmed COVID-19 diagnosis, these tests remain free so long as you present a valid UK European Health Insurance Card (EHIC) or the new UK Global Health Insurance Card (GHIC). The process for accessing these tests in France remains the same with a list of places available via the French government site.
Entry and borders
See Entry requirements to find out what you will need to do when you arrive in France and for details on France’s current entry requirements and restrictions.
Returning to the UK
When you return, you must follow the rules for entering the UK.
France is on the amber list for entering England. From 19 July anyone arriving from France (including those transiting through France) to England must continue to quarantine for 10 days at home or in other accommodation, even if they are fully vaccinated against COVID-19. Check what you must do to enter England, Scotland, Wales or Northern Ireland.
You are responsible for organising your own COVID-19 test, in line with UK government testing requirements. You should contact local authorities for information on testing facilities.
Be prepared for your plans to change
No travel is risk-free during COVID. Countries may further restrict travel or bring in new rules at short notice, for example due to a new COVID-19 variant. Check with your travel company or airline for any transport changes which may delay your journey home.
If you test positive for COVID-19, you may need to stay where you are until you test negative. You may also need to seek treatment there.
Plan ahead and make sure you:
can access money
understand what your insurance will cover
can make arrangements to extend your stay and be away for longer than planned
Travel in France
Face masks are required in all enclosed public spaces. It is no longer a requirement to wear a mask in all outdoor public spaces, with some exceptions, including gatherings, queues, markets, and stadiums. Wearing masks on public transport is compulsory for all users aged 11 and over, with fines for those who are not compliant. Masks are also compulsory in taxis and private hire vehicles without a plexiglass screen.
Some travel operators such as airlines may specify types of masks to be worn on board e.g. surgical masks, and may encourage you to take spares for long journeys. Please check with your travel operator before travelling.
From 1 August, certain forms of transport, such as cross country trains, will require passengers to demonstrate their COVID-19 status through the “pass sanitaire”. For further details on what this involves see the ‘public spaces and services’ section below. Since 20 June, there has been no curfew in place across the French territory and there are no internal travel restrictions. You should visit the French Interior Ministry website or use the ‘Tous anti-Covid’ digital app for further information.
These measures may change at short notice either at national or at local level. You should check local guidance for further information.
Full information about restrictions in France can be found here.
Public spaces and services
From 21 July, people attending events and cultural spaces with over 50 people will be asked to demonstrate their COVID-19 status through the “pass sanitaire”. This can be acquired by fulfilling one of the following three criteria:
A vaccination certificate, illustrating that you are fully vaccinated with a vaccine authorised by the European Medical Authority. This means:
7 days after a second dose of Oxford/AstraZeneca, Pfizer/BioNTech, Moderna.
28 days after a single dose of Johnson & Johnson
7 days after a single injection for those able to demonstrate they have already been infected (this only applies to those vaccinated in France)
A negative PCR or antigen test result from the last 48 hours
A document (dated more than 11 days ago and less than six months ago) proving you have recently recovered from COVID
From 1 August, you will need this to access a range of leisure facilities (bars, restaurants, museums, cinemas), hospitals, retirement homes and modes of transport such as long distance train and bus journeys and planes. Those aged 12 to 17 will only be subject to this requirement from 30 September.
You can find more information on how to access the “pass sanitaire” from the French government. For those wishing to attend events at which the “pass sanitaire” is required after being vaccinated in England, you can now demonstrate that you are fully vaccinated by downloading the French government’s “TousAntiCovid” app and clicking on the option “Scan a QR code” to scan the QR code from your digital NHS England vaccination certification. This will save your vaccination data in the “wallets” section of the TousAntiCovid app. We will provide further information on the use of paper certification as soon as it is available. Find out more about how to demonstrate your COVID-19 status.
It is compulsory to wear facemasks in enclosed public spaces. This applies to those aged 11 and over. From 17 June 2021, it is no longer required to wear a facemask in all outdoor public spaces, with some exceptions, including gatherings, queues, markets, and stadiums. Failure to comply with these restrictions may result in a fine. Please refer to local guidance for more information.

COVID-19 Vaccines if you live in France
Wherever possible British nationals should aim to be vaccinated in the country where they live. As further information is available about the national vaccination programme, this page will be updated. Sign up to get email notifications.
The French authorities have issued guidance on how to get a vaccination in France including details of how to book an appointment (only available in French) and which groups are currently being offered the vaccine. The French Government have said that residents of France, regardless of their nationality, will have access to the vaccine in France. Further information on COVID-19 vaccinations in France can be found on French Government’s coronavirus information website and on their frequently asked questions page.
The Medicines and Healthcare Products Regulatory Agency (MHRA) is the UK authority responsible for assessing the safety, quality and efficacy of vaccines. It has authorised the Pfizer/BioNTech, Oxford/AstraZeneca and Moderna vaccines for temporary supply and use in the UK. Find out more about MHRA approval for these vaccines.
British nationals living overseas should seek medical advice from their local healthcare provider in the country where they reside. Information about vaccines used in other national programmes, including regulatory status, should be available from the local authorities. This list of Stringent Regulatory Authorities recognised by the World Health Organisation may also be a useful source of additional information. Find out more information about the COVID-19 vaccines on the World Health Organization COVID-19 vaccines page.
If you receive your COVID-19 vaccination in France, you can get an EU Digital COVID Certificate from the national authorities. The Certificate proves that you have been vaccinated against COVID-19, received a negative test result, or recovered from COVID-19. It will help facilitate your travel within the EU and, in some countries, you can use it to demonstrate your COVID-19 status to businesses and other organisations. For further information visit the European Commission’s EU Digital COVID Certificate page.
