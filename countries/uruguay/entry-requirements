The information on this page covers the most common types of travel and reflects the UK government’s understanding of the rules currently in place. Unless otherwise stated, this information is for travellers using a full ‘British Citizen’ passport.
The authorities in the country or territory you’re travelling to are responsible for setting and enforcing the rules for entry. If you’re unclear about any aspect of the entry requirements, or you need further reassurance, you’ll need to contact the embassy, high commission or consulate of the country or territory you’re travelling to.
You should also consider checking with your transport provider or travel company to make sure your passport and other travel documents meet their requirements.
Restrictions in response to coronavirus
Entry to Uruguay
Only Uruguayan nationals and legal residents are allowed to enter Uruguay.
Some foreigners who need to enter the country under exceptional circumstances will require pre-authorisation from the National Immigration Department.
You will not be allowed to board your originating flight without a negative PCR test which should be done no more than 72 hours before boarding. The Uruguayan Embassy in London has suggested the following laboratories where you can order home tests:
CityDoc
Blue Horizon Blood Tests
The Independent General Practice
You should not use the NHS testing service to get a test in order to facilitate your travel to another country. You should arrange to take a private test.
You should also ensure you have valid health insurance that covers coronavirus and travel insurance for the duration of your stay.
The Uruguayan Government strongly recommend you download the Coronavirus App and activate blue tooth in order to be contacted using their track and trace approach.
Demonstrating your COVID-19 vaccination status
Upon arrival in Uruguay, if you have received 2 doses of COVID-19 vaccines you must:
arrive with a negative PCR test
take a new PCR test 7 days from when you did your previous one
If you comply with the above, you do not need to quarantine unless you do not wish to take the second PCR test. If this is the case you must comply with mandatory quarantine for 14 days upon arrival.
If you have not received any COVID-19 vaccinations then you will need to have a negative PCR test result no more than 72 hours before your flight and upon arrival, you will have to comply with mandatory quarantine for 14 days.
In both cases you will need to complete pre-authorisation from the National Immigration Department and once authorisation is granted you will receive an email with a link to complete the health declaration (declaración jurada de salud). Without these you will not be allowed to board your flight. Foreigners entering Uruguay must have proof of health insurance that covers suspected or actual coronavirus.
Demonstrating your vaccination status from the UK is not formalised for entry into Uruguay, so you should follow alternative advice for entry. Your NHS appointment card from vaccination centres is not designed to be used as proof of vaccination and should not be used to demonstrate your vaccine status.
Ferry service between Uruguay and Argentina
There is a limited ferry service between Uruguay and Argentina via Buquebus. You will be required to comply with the exit requirements from Argentina and entry requirements to Uruguay.
If you need further information about entry requirements, contact the local immigration authorities or the nearest Uruguayan embassy. You should also check with your airline or travel company for the latest information.
Regular entry requirements
Visas   
British passport holders visiting for up to 90 days don’t need a visa. For information on how to extend your stay or take up residency in Uruguay visit Dirección Nacional de Migración (in Spanish). For other information on entry regulations and living in Uruguay contact the nearest Uruguayan Embassy.
Passport validity
Your passport should be valid for at least the proposed duration of your stay. No additional period of validity beyond this is required.
UK Emergency Travel Documents
UK Emergency Travel Documents are accepted for entry, airside transit and exit from Uruguay. The validity requirements are the same as for full validity British passports. If you plan to travel to Argentina or the US you will need a visa in your ETD. You must contact the nearest Embassies of those countries in order to apply.
Customs controls
Strict customs controls prohibit visitors from importing animal and dairy products, fruit and vegetables. All baggage is x-rayed on arrival and may be searched.
Travelling with children
There are various requirements for travelling out of Uruguay with British or dual national children under the age of 18 who live in Uruguay. The Ministry of Interior’s website has more information, or you can contact a law firm with expertise in this subject.
