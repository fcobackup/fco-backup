Returning to the UK
Travelling from and returning to the UK
If you plan to pass through another country to return to the UK, check the travel advice for the country you’re transiting.
Be prepared for your plans to change
No travel is risk-free during COVID. Countries may further restrict travel or bring in new rules at short notice, for example due to a new COVID-19 variant. Check with your travel company or airline for any transport changes which may delay your journey home.
If you test positive for COVID-19 in Finland, you will receive instructions from the Finnish authorities and will be asked to self-isolate. You may also need to seek treatment there.
Plan ahead and make sure you:
can access money
understand what your insurance will cover (including COVID-19 related costs if you have to stay longer than planned)
can make arrangements to extend your stay and be away for longer than planned. There have been several incidences where people have had to quarantine for up to 10 days in Finland at their own cost
Public spaces and services
The Finnish authorities have lifted the general recommendation on the use of face masks. Wearing a mask is still recommended in public indoor spaces and on public transport if you are seeking treatment or a test due to a suspected COVID-19 infection, have symptoms of a respiratory infection, or if you know you have been exposed to coronavirus.

COVID-19 Vaccines if you live in Finland
Wherever possible British nationals should aim to be vaccinated in the country/territory where they live. We will update this page when the Finnish authorities announce new information on their vaccination programme. You can sign up to get email notifications when this page is updated.
The Finnish national vaccination programme started in December 2020 and uses the Pfizer-BioNTech, Moderna and AstraZeneca vaccines. The programme is open to all residents, including British nationals, aged 12 years or older. The vaccine is voluntary and free of charge. The Finnish authorities have issued guidance on how to access COVID-19 vaccines in Finland.
Find out more, including about vaccines that are authorised in the UK or approved by the World Health Organisation, on the COVID-19 vaccines if you live abroad page.
If you’re a British national living in Finland, you should seek medical advice from your local healthcare provider. Information about COVID-19 vaccines used in the national programme where you live, including regulatory status, should be available from local authorities.
