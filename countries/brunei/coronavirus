Be prepared for your plans to change
No travel is risk-free during COVID. Countries may further restrict travel or bring in new rules at short notice, for example due to a new COVID-19 variant. Check with your travel company or airline for any transport changes which may delay your journey home.
If you test positive for COVID-19, you may need to stay where you are until you test negative. You may also need to seek treatment there.
Plan ahead and make sure you:
can access money
understand what your insurance will cover
can make arrangements to extend your stay and be away for longer than planned
Coronavirus lockdown
As part of Brunei’s National COVID-19 Recovery Framework, Brunei ended its “early endemic phase” on 31 May 2022. Business premises, including restaurants, fitness facilities, markets and cinemas are open. Since 1 June 2022, there is no longer a limitation on the capacity of mass gatherings (at home or in public). All sporting activities are allowed without limitations.
All child care centres, kindergartens, primary and secondary schools, colleges and sixth form centres are open for in person classes Students must take an Antigen Rapid Test (ART)three times a week.
All individuals, regardless of vaccination status are now allowed to enter public premises and government offices and attend private and public events.
Brunei will accept the UK’s proof of COVID-19 recovery and vaccination record. Your NHS appointment card from vaccination centres is not designed to be used as proof of vaccination and should not be used to demonstrate your vaccine status.
From 15 June, temperature check and scanning your BruHealth app before entering premises will no longer be required but private businesses may still require you to do so.
Masks are mandatory for everyone over 2 years old when in public places indoors, but may be removed when you are drinking or eating. There are financial penalties for not adhering to mask guidelines. Masks are not mandatory outdoors but are recommended in crowded areas.
British people travelling should check the Brunei Ministry of Health and the Prime Ministers Office websites for up to date guidance, policy on travel to/from Brunei and details on how to download and use the BruHealth app.

Individuals aged 12 and above can receive a booster shot on a walk-in basis, 3 months after their second COVID-19 vaccination. Brunei began vaccinating children aged 5 -11 on 2 April with the Pfizer paediatric vaccine and will give a second dose from three weeks after the first. Vaccination appointments can be made through the BruHealth App and on a walk-in basis. The Vaccination of children aged 5 -11 is voluntary and it is not mandatory for children to be vaccinated in order to attend school or to enter any premises.
