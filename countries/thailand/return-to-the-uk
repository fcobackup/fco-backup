If you wish to leave Thailand you should make a plan to leave now and contact your airline or tour operator. We are aware that many airlines are suspending or reducing flights, both direct and indirect, to the United Kingdom. All British Airways flights are suspended from 29th March. We anticipate that you will find it increasingly difficult to return to the UK. This disruption is likely to last for many months.
You should also familiarise yourself with your airlineâ€™s policies towards coronavirus, including whether special requirements are in place such as providing a medical health certificate during the check-in procedure. You should also familiarise yourself with the coronavirus policies of your travel or health insurance provider.
