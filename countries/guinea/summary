Given the rapidly changing situation in Guinea we have temporarily withdrawn a limited number of UK staff and their dependents from the British Embassy. The Embassy will continue to carry out essential work including providing 24/7 consular assistance and support to British people in Guinea.
There have been regular demonstrations in Guinea since October 2019 leading to significant travel disruption and a number of violent incidents including deaths. Protests in Middle Guinea in January led to several public buildings being ransacked and set on fire and increased criminal activity. The National Front for the Defence of the Constitution (FNDC) have continued to call for demonstrations. Demonstrations may be spontaneous and unpredictable, with routes blocked. There has been damage to vehicles passing through or around demonstrations as well as an increase in criminality. Serious violence occurred around the legislative elections and referendum which were held on 22 March 2020. Demonstrations are likely to continue. You should exercise caution and be vigilant, staying clear of demonstrations and monitor local media. “Villes mortes” (general strikes) happen intermittently. See Political situation
Terrorist attacks can’t be ruled out. Attacks could be indiscriminate. You should be vigilant, especially in places visited by foreigners. See Terrorism
