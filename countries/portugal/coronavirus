Travel in Portugal
The state of emergency declared on 18 March in response to the coronavirus outbreak ended on 2 May. Portugal has now entered a new phase of its de-escalation strategy implementing regional states of alert which will be reviewed every two weeks.
Confinement is mandatory if you are:
suffering from or infected with coronavirus (COVID-19), or
being actively monitored by the health authorities for COVID-19 symptoms
You must observe the rules on social distancing and hygiene:
Social distancing of 2 metres
Obligatory use of face masks in enclosed spaces
Good hand hygiene
Observance of the rules on maximum capacity
Local and inter-regional travel is permitted in Portugal.
If you use public transport, avoid travelling at peak times and ensure you disinfect your hands before and after your journey. Buy your ticket in advance online or from a vending machine at the station. Maintain your distance from other passengers as much as possible.
Taxis are operating. Use the back seat, open the window, if possible, and respect the rules on maximum capacity. Avoid paying in cash, where possible. Facemasks are mandatory for everyone over the age of 10 on all forms of public transport and private hire.
You can be fined up to €500 if you breach the regulations

Except for the Greater Lisbon Metropolitan Area, mainland Portugal is in a state of alert. Subject to the rules on social distancing and hygiene, most shops and services, restaurants, cultural venues, leisure parks and sports facilities are open.
Beaches are subject to measures on capacity and social distancing. Check these measures and beach occupancy levels on the Portuguese Environment Agency website or download the “Info Praia” app.

Madeira and the Azores
The regional governments of Madeira and the Azores have implemented similar de-escalation measures. You can consult full details (in Portuguese) of the regional governments’ de-escalation plans on the Government of the Azores and Government of Madeira websites.
The use of a face mask is obligatory in enclosed spaces, such as the airport, shops, supermarkets, restaurants and on public transport.
On the islands of Madeira and Porto Santo, face masks must also be worn in both enclosed public spaces and while outdoors. This applies to everyone over the age of 10. You will not be required to use a face mask when exercising or while on the beach.
The Azores
The regional government has extended its regional states of alert until 1 September. The islands of Santa Maria, São Miguel, Terceira, Pico and Faial are in a state of calamity. The islands of Graciosa, São Jorge, Flores and Corvo are in a state of alert.
On the island of São Miguel, tighter restrictions are in place until 1 September due to localised outbreaks of COVID-19:
Nightclubs are closed;
Bars and pubs close at 10pm;
Service stations can remain open after 10pm but only for the purpose of selling petrol.
Accommodation
Most hotels, holiday apartments, private villas and campsites have reopened. If you are booking accommodation, check it meets the required hygiene and cleaning standards and look out for the Portuguese Tourist Board’s “clean and safe” certification.
