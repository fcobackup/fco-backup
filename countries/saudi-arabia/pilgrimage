The system for British nationals wishing to apply for Hajj from outside Saudi Arabia has changed. British nationals now need to apply directly to the Saudi authorities. On 10 June, the Saudi authorities launched a portal on the Motawif website for Hajj 2022 applications. This portal stopped accepting applications on 13 June. On 21 June, the Motawif site issued an update, which confirmed that they were aware of problems related to payment completion and booking confirmations, in a number of cases. We are aware that not all problems have been resolved and continue to seek information from the Saudi authorities. On 22 June, the Motawif site issued an update reminding successful applicants to complete their Hajj Visa applications through this form. Motawif will issue a further update for outstanding applications. The contact email address for all queries on Hajj packages is: care@motawif.com.sa.
The Saudi authorities have not confirmed the process for Hajj 2023.
British nationals in Saudi Arabia can apply to perform Umrah through the official Ministry of Hajj app ‘Eatmarna’ and also ‘Tawakkalna’. Details of the process can be found on the official Ministry of Hajj Twitter page. Umrah can be performed on a tourist visa.
British nationals visiting from abroad should also be aware that vaccinated visitors (except those in exempted categories) must complete a Registration Immunisation Information Form before traveling to the Kingdom through the Muqeem Portal.
British citizens wishing to perform Umrah or Hajj should follow announcements on FCDO official social media channels @ukinsaudiarabia and guidance from local authorities. @Motawif_SA provides information on the new system for British nationals wishing to perform Hajj from outside the Kingdom.
Before you travel for pilgrimage, you should carefully consider the information and advice on the website of the Saudi Arabia Embassy in London, and in the National Travel Health Network and Centre’s (NaTHNaC) factsheet.
