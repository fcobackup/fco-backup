Travel in Chile
The Chilean government provides coronavirus-related information on the Official COVID-19 Government website. Travellers arriving in Chile should be aware that local authorities frequently move municipalities (comunas) back and forth through the government “Stages Plan” (Paso a Paso) according to the level of COVID-19 restrictions in place. You should review the Chilean Government Paso a Paso website to check which stage your ‘comuna’ is in and if there are restrictions that might affect your travel plans.
Mobility Pass for interregional travel
The Chilean government allows Chileans, foreigner residents and foreigner visitors who have been vaccinated overseas to register for Chile’s Mobility Pass scheme (‘Pase de Movilidad’). Travellers (including children aged 12 and above) are required to hold a valid Mobility Pass for inter-regional travel. Children under the age of 12 must travel with an adult who must have a valid mobility pass.
In order to obtain a Mobility Pass, you must fulfil the eligibility criteria on the Chile Government’s MeVacuno website, where you will find more details on accepted vaccines and the process to apply for the Mobility Pass.
Chilean nationals and foreign residents need to enter the website with their clave unica/Chilean C.I. Foreign visitors can create an account with an email. After registering your vaccines, and once approved, a mobility pass with a QR code will be issued.
For details about using the Mobility Pass to transfer to a domestic flight after arriving in Chile, see the ‘Entry requirements’ section.
Public places and services
You must wear a facemask in all public places, maintain social distancing at all times and self-isolate immediately if you suspect you have been in contact with a confirmed COVID-19 case.
You will be asked to show your Mobility Pass (‘Pase de Movilidad’) to access public places such as bars, gastro bars, restaurants, cinemas, nightclubs, dance venues, concerts, casinos, bingo halls and leisure activities, as well as sports venues, amusement and theme parks, museums, and fairs.
