Warning
FCDO advises against all travel to parts of Moldova.

This advice reflects the UK government’s understanding of current rules for people travelling on a full ‘British citizen’ passport from the UK, for the most common types of travel.
The authorities in Moldova set and enforce entry rules. If you’re not sure how these requirements apply to you, contact the Moldovan Embassy in the UK.
COVID-19 rules
There are no COVID-19 testing or vaccination requirements for travellers entering Moldova. 
Passport validity requirements
Your passport must have an ‘expiry date’ at least 3 months after the date you plan to leave Moldova, and one blank page.
Check with your travel provider that your passport and other travel documents meet requirements. Renew your passport if you need to.
You will be denied entry if you do not have a valid travel document or try to use a passport that has been reported lost or stolen.
Visa requirements
You do not need a visa to enter Moldova for stays of up to 90 days in a 6-month period. You must be able to show a return or onward flight ticket.
You need a residence or work permit for stays of more than 90 days. See more information on residence and work permits. 
The Moldovan authorities will automatically register your arrival date. They strictly enforce penalties, including fines and expulsion, against foreign visitors who stay in Moldova longer than allowed. Please contact the Moldovan authorities with any additional questions.
Vaccination requirements  
At least 8 weeks before your trip, check the vaccinations and certificates you need in TravelHealthPro’s Moldova guide.
Border crossings
Moldova-Romania border
Check for updates on border crossings with Romania with the Moldovan Border Police.
Entering and leaving Transnistria
FCDO advises against all travel to Transnistria.
There is no official border between Moldova and Transnistria. However, there are border control points established by the de facto Transnistria leadership between Moldova and Transnistria. Passports will be controlled but will not be stamped. When entering Transnistria, you will need to fill in 2 copies of a migration card for the de facto authorities – keep one copy to show them when you leave. The de facto authorities may ask the purpose and length of your visit, and where you will stay. They may also deny you entry. 
All border crossings between Ukraine and Transnistria are temporarily closed. FCDO does not know when they will reopen.     
The train service between Odessa and Chisinau is suspended.
Entering Moldova from Ukraine
Check for updates on border crossings with Ukraine with the Moldovan Border Police.
If you enter Moldova overland from Ukraine, do this at an internationally recognised border crossing point. These are in the north and south of Moldova, excluding the Transnistria region.
If you have travelled to Moldova from Ukraine and need assistance, call (+373) 22 225 902 or contact FCDO online.
If you’re near a Ukraine-Moldova border crossing point and need assistance, call our consular contact centre on +44 1908 516666, selecting option 2: consular services for British nationals.     
Entering Ukraine from Moldova
Check for updates on border crossings with Ukraine with the Moldovan Border Police. This is particularly important around Transnistria, which is outside the control of the Moldovan authorities. Read FCDO’s Ukraine travel advice.
