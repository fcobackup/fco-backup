Conflict in neighbouring Israel and the Occupied Palestinian Territories (OPTs)
FCDO advises against all but essential travel to Lebanon since the outbreak of large-scale conflict between Israel and the Occupied Palestinian Territories on 7 October and ongoing mortar and artillery exchanges in South Lebanon. Tensions are high and events could  escalate with little warning, which could affect or limit exit routes out of Lebanon. You should consider whether your need to remain in Lebanon is essential.
On 13 October, a series of protests were staged throughout Lebanon in response to events in Israel and Gaza. This included a minor protest near the British Embassy. Order was maintained and no altercations took place.  British Nationals should exercise caution and avoid areas where demonstrations may be held.

Help and support in Lebanon
You can contact the emergency services by calling 112.
If you need urgent help (for example, you’ve been attacked, arrested or someone has died), call +961 (0)1 960 800.
If you’re in Lebanon and you need advice which is not covered by reading our travel advice, you can contact FCDO online.
While 24-hour consular assistance is available by phone or online, in-person consular support is severely limited in parts of Lebanon where we advise against all travel and limited where we advise against all but essential travel.  
In the event of deterioration in the political or security situation, the British Embassy may be increasingly limited in the assistance that it can provide. Do not rely on FCDO being able to evacuate you in an emergency.
If you’re abroad and you need emergency help from the UK government, contact the nearest British embassy, consulate or high commission.
Travel insurance 
If you choose to travel, research your destinations and get appropriate travel insurance. Insurance should cover your itinerary, planned activities and expenses in an emergency.
