Cases of coronavirus (COVID-19) have been confirmed in Albania. The Albanian authorities have introduced a number of measures to limit the spread of the virus.
International travel
All borders are closed (with the exception of freight) to all nationals.
From 23 March with one exception, all flights to and from Tirana International Airport will be suspended until further notice. The only available flights will be to and from Istanbul. British Nationals who wish to leave the country are advised to make arrangements to do so as soon as possible.
Keep up to date with information from your tour operator, transport or accommodation provider on the impact on any existing travel plans. Flight options are reducing. If you need further information about entry requirements, contact the local immigration authorities or the nearest Albanian Embassy/High Commission/Consulate. You should also check with your airline or travel company for the latest information.
People who have travelled to Italy or Greece in the past 14 days must self-isolate. Failure to do so will result in a Euro 5,000 fine. The state and military police are carrying out spot checks on the streets.
Other measures
Public transport in Tirana and Durres has been suspended until further notice.
Private vehicles are forbidden to move around in the cities of Tirana, Shkoder, Lezha, Elbasan, Lushnja, Fier and Vlora as well as between Durres and Tirana. Ambulances will be allowed. Certain other exemptions apply e.g. transport linked to food and pharmaceutical supplies or the media. If you have to travel to Tirana International Airport from Tirana or Durres, you can call a local taxi and provide a photocopy of your flight ticket to the taxi driver in case they are stopped by the state or military police on the way/from the airport.
From 6am on Sunday 15 March, private vehicles and inter-urban transport will be forbidden for the following national roads: Fier-Vlorë, Vlorë-Lushnjë, Shkodër-Lezhë and Elbasan-Korcë.
There is a ban of movement for pedestrians throughout the country from 6pm on Mon 16 March until a further notice. There is also a ban on sitting in parks or public areas. A penalty fee will apply for non-compliance.
All shops (except food shops and pharmacies) and dental clinics have been closed. Bars and restaurants in Tirana and Durres are also closed. A €16,000 penalty fine is in place for non-compliance.
All schools will be closed until 23 March.
Retired elders should be assisted for food and pharmaceutical needs by their children or relatives. If the latter are not in the same town with their retired parents then the respective Albanian Municipalities and local Government structures will liaise to assist elders in their houses.
If you’re in Albania, you should adhere to these instructions and follow the advice of the local authorities.
