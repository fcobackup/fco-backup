Cases of coronavirus (COVID-19) have been confirmed in Kosovo. The authorities in Kosovo have introduced a number of strict measures to limit the spread of the virus.
Entry and borders
Land borders are closed to entry by non-Kosovo citizens. It is possible to leave the country by land, but a number of border crossings with neighbouring countries are closed for passenger traffic, and neighbouring countries have also placed restrictions on international travel. You should check FCO travel advice for the relevant country before attempting to cross a border.
Local measures
All schools, cafes, bars, restaurants and shopping centres have been closed. Food stores and pharmacies remain open.
Residents are being encouraged to stay in their homes. On 27 March the government took a decision to prohibit movement overnight between the hours of 17:00 and 06:00. Public transport has been restricted.
There are restrictions on public gatherings. A number of events in Kosovo in the coming weeks and months have been cancelled.
Further information
The authorities in Kosovo have set up an online platform with basic information and advice available in English. There is a local Emergency Hotline for people who think they may have coronavirus. The number is 038 200 80 800.
Further information on coronavirus, including advice on preparing for foreign travel and helping reduce the spread of the virus, is available from Public Health England and on the TravelHealthPro website.
