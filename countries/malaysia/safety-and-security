Local travel - Sabah
In February 2013, around 100 armed men from the Sulu archipelago landed on the eastern coast of Sabah and occupied the small village of Kampung Tanduo approximately 100 km east of Lahad Datu. On 1 March 2013 there was an exchange of fire and a number of fatalities. On 3 March 2013 there were reports of further incidents on the coast between Lahad Datu and Semporna. Additional Malaysian security forces were sent to the area on 4 March 2013 and on 5 March 2013 airstrikes and other military action was reported against locations held by the armed group from Sulu around Kampung Tanduo.
The Malaysian authorities have designated the entire eastern portion of Sabah (extending from the town of Kudat in northern Sabah to Tawau district near the border with Indonesia) as the Eastern Sabah Security Zone, and established the Eastern Sabah Security Command (ESSCOM) to co-ordinate security forces’ activity in the area. The Malaysian security forces have strengthened their presence in the area and introduced measures to reduce the risk of unauthorised boat landings.
The local authorities have imposed restrictions on travel by water in some coastal districts of eastern Sabah and in the coastal waters off eastern Sabah, including a night-time curfew. For more information, visit the Sabah Tourism website.
Crime
Take sensible precautions to protect yourself from petty crime. Avoid carrying valuables and take particular care of your passport whilst walking, in aircraft, cafes, airport and railway terminals, and hotel rooms. Do not open your hotel room door to strangers, especially late at night. This applies particularly to women travelling alone. Credit card and ATM fraud is widespread. Take great care when using your card.
Incidents of bag snatching are common, particularly in major cities and including by thieves on motorbikes. Bags with shoulder straps should either be carried with the bag towards the pavement rather than the road, or tucked under the arm. Do not wrap the strap around your arm or shoulder and do not try to hold on to your bag. People have been injured or killed by being pulled to the ground by their bag straps.
Taxi coupon systems are in place at airports. In other areas, taxis should use a meter.
There have been cases of assaults and robbery, particularly around bars and nightlife areas. You should remain vigilant and take sensible precautions.
Be careful if you’re offered a drink by a stranger, even in a reputable bar or restaurant. These approaches can involve spiked drinks, and have resulted in cases of robbery and assault.
If you’re a victim of crime, inform the local police and get a police report.
Road travel
You can drive in Malaysia with an International Driving Permit (IDP) for up to one year from your date of entry into Malaysia. From 1 February 2019, you can only get IDPs over the counter from 2,500 UK Post Offices. You will not be able to buy an IDP outside the UK, so get one before you travel.
After a year, you will need to get a Malaysian driving licence. Further information is available from the Malaysian Road Transport Department.
British nationals already in possession of a Malaysian driving licence can continue to renew their Malaysian driving licence as before.
Road conditions in Peninsular Malaysia are generally good, but less so in East Malaysia. Vehicles (particularly motorcycles) do not always stop at traffic lights or pedestrian crossings. If you are involved in a road accident you’re obliged by law to stay at the scene until the police have arrived. If a crowd gathers, it may be safer to leave the scene and report to the nearest police station.
There have been a number of fatal bus crashes, particularly on overnight journeys. Choose a reputable operator for your journey.
If you rent a motorbike you should take the same safety precautions as in the UK. Malaysian law states that helmets must be worn.
Driving under the influence of alcohol is a serious offence and the traffic police regularly carry out breath tests. Anyone over the legal limit can face a heavy fine and/or a jail sentence and deportation.
Sea and river travel
Piracy in South East Asian waters is an ongoing problem. There have been a number of attacks against ships in and around Malaysian waters, particularly in the Strait of Malacca and the waters between Sabah and the southern Philippines. Be vigilant and take appropriate precautions. Reduce opportunities for theft, establish secure areas on board and report all incidents to the coastal and flag state authorities.
Some passenger boats have sunk due to overloading and/or poor maintenance. Take care at all times when travelling by passenger ferry or speedboat and avoid travelling on vessels that are clearly overloaded or in poor condition. Make sure life jackets are available.
Water sports and scuba diving
If you rent jet skis or any other type of water sports equipment, make sure adequate safety precautions are in place. Only use reputable licensed operators, insist on training before use and make sure you’re insured.
Check dive operators’ credentials carefully and make sure you’re insured. Check that safety equipment is available on the boat, including oxygen. Ask about contingency plans, which should include the ability to call for help while at sea and to evacuate divers to the nearest hyperbaric chamber if necessary.
You should take great care if you’re diving the sites of HMS Repulse and HMS Prince of Wales, which lie in international waters off Kuantan. They have been declared ‘protected places’ under the Protection of Military Remains Act 1986. You should only dive there on a ‘look not touch’ basis. Do not attempt to penetrate the wrecks, which lie in deep water. Make sure any boat operator you use holds a licence for diving at the wreck site.
Political Situation
Police have sometimes used tear gas and water cannons to control public protests. Monitor local and international media and avoid all demonstrations. Under Malaysian law it’s illegal for foreign nationals to take part in demonstrations.
