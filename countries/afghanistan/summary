The Foreign, Commonwealth & Development Office (FCDO) advise against all travel to Afghanistan. You should not travel to Afghanistan.
On 26 August a terrorist attack occurred in the vicinity of Kabul International Airport with explosions taking place outside the Abbey Gate and at a nearby hotel. The security situation in Afghanistan remains extremely volatile. There is an ongoing and high threat of terrorist attack. Do not travel to Kabul Hamid Karzai International Airport. If you are in the area of the airport, move away to a safe location immediately and await further advice.
Commercial flights are not currently operating. If you can leave Afghanistan safely by other means, you should do so immediately.
If you need assistance, you should call +44 1908 516 666 (or 01908 516 666 in the UK) and select the option “Consular services for British nationals”.
We have suspended all non-essential operations at the British Embassy in Kabul in response to the deterioration in the security situation. The Embassy has relocated. The FCDO is only providing consular assistance remotely and is extremely limited.
Travel by road throughout the country is extremely dangerous. There have been allegations of people being mistreated on their way to Kabul International Airport.
