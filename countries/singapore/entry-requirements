Entry rules in response to coronavirus (COVID-19)
Entry to Singapore
Short term visitors from anywhere in the world are not able to enter Singapore without prior permission.
Singapore Citizens and Permanent Residents can enter Singapore without permission. From 24 April, Long-Term Pass holders and short-term visitors are able to enter Singapore if they have pre-travel permission from the Singapore government. A PCR COVID-19 test is required 72 hours before departure from the UK, with a negative resulted needed in order to travel. All arrivals must have three PRC COVID-19 tests after arrival: one upon arrival in Singapore, one after 14 days and one at the end of their 21 day quarantine period. All arrivals in Singapore, from all locations, will be tested for COVID-19 upon arrival.

See further information from the Immigration and Checkpoints Authority.
The Singapore Ministry of Manpower will only allow Singapore work pass holders and/or their dependents to enter or re-enter Singapore if their employers have obtained prior approval from the Ministry and will only allow short-term visitors if they have permission. Further details can be found on the Ministry of Manpower website. You will be refused entry or risk deportation if you do not comply with this requirement. You also risk having your work pass revoked.
Everyone, apart from Singapore citizens and Singapore Permanent Residents, entering Singapore from the UK (and from most other countries) must obtain a negative COVID-19 test (PCR test) within 72 hours of travel.
You should not use the NHS testing service to get a test in order to facilitate your travel to another country. You should arrange to take a private test.
Once you have permission to enter Singapore you must submit an online health declaration in advance of your arrival. Otherwise, it will need to be completed upon entry and may result in delays to immigration clearance. Short term visitors need to have medical insurance of at least S$30,000 from 31 January 2021.
Travellers are advised to check the Singapore Ministry of Health’s (MOH’s) website before travelling. Measures for inbound travellers are summarised in the COVID-19 Appendix.
All work pass holders must comply with all Singapore government regulations or face their passes being revoked and/or fines/jail.
Quarantine requirements
Everyone granted permission to enter Singapore will be tested for COVID-19 upon arrival and arrivals from most destinations will be issued with a Stay at Home Notice (SHN) for at least 14 days. The 14 day SHNs must be served in most instances at a government designated hotel and costs S$2,000.
A limited number of countries have been designated as ‘low-risk’ and will be issued with a 7-day SHN, or no SHN. Arrivals from these countries will be also be permitted to carry out quarantine at their residence, if applicable. Full details of exemptions including testing requirements and quarantine information can be found on the Singapore Immigration and Checkpoints Authority (ICA) ‘Arrival in Singapore’ and ‘SafeTravel’ webpages. You should check these websites for updates and review SHN details before travelling.
Everyone aged over 12 who is in home quarantine will need by law to wear an electronic tag for the duration of their quarantine period. The tags are about the size of a watch and are worn on the wrist.
In addition to quarantine fees, all arrivals must pay for a COVID-19 test which will be conducted before the SHN quarantine period ends. While you’re serving quarantine you will not be allowed to leave your room/place of residence. Smoking may not be allowed in government allocated quarantine facilities. The quarantine period cannot be reduced, even if you wish to leave Singapore. Failure to comply carries a fine and a jail term of up to six months. More details can be found on the Singapore government website.
Specific schemes exist for essential business travel to Singapore from certain countries. To use these schemes your travel must be sponsored by your employer. Schemes also exist for long-term pass holders to facilitate limited travel between Malaysia and Singapore.
