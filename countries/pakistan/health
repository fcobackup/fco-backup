At least 8 weeks before your trip, check the latest country-specific health advice from the National Travel Health Network and Centre (NaTHNaC) on the TravelHealthPro website. Each country-specific page has information on vaccine recommendations, any current health risks or outbreaks, and factsheets with information on staying healthy abroad. Guidance is also available from NHS (Scotland) on the FitForTravel website.
General information on travel vaccinations and a travel health checklist is available on the NHS website. You may then wish to contact your health adviser or pharmacy for advice on other preventive measures and managing any pre-existing medical conditions while you’re abroad.
The legal status and regulation of some medicines prescribed or purchased in the UK can be different in other countries. If you’re travelling with prescription or over-the-counter medicine, read this guidance from NaTHNaC on best practice when travelling with medicines. For further information on the legal status of a specific medicine, you’ll need to contact the embassy, high commission or consulate of the country or territory you’re travelling to.
While travel can be enjoyable, it can sometimes be challenging. There are clear links between mental and physical health, so looking after yourself during travel and when abroad is important. Information on travelling with mental health conditions is available in our guidance page. Further information is also available from the National Travel Health Network and Centre (NaTHNaC).
Coronavirus
There is an ongoing outbreak of coronavirus (COVID-19). The virus originated in China, but cases have been confirmed in several other countries, including Pakistan.
The Pakistani authorities have introduced a number of measures to limit the spread of the virus. There are temporary closures of the border with Iran and at the Chaman border crossing with Afghanistan. Medical teams have been deployed to all civil international airports to examine all travellers entering Pakistan for the virus. You should comply with any additional screening measures put in place by the authorities. There are also reports of the temporary closure of schools in some provinces of Pakistan.
The Pakistani authorities have announced a helpline on phone number 1166 for people who have recently travelled to China, Iran or a country where COVID-19 is present and who have symptoms like fever, cough and difficulty breathing. British nationals who are worried about the virus, or suspect they may have contracted it, should contact that number and follow the guidance given by the authorities.
Further information on coronavirus, including advice on preparing for foreign travel and helping reduce the spread of the virus, is available from Public Health England and on the TravelHealthPro website.
You can find more information about cases in Pakistan on the TravelHealthPro website.
Other health risks
There has been an outbreak of Chikungunya virus and Dengue fever also occurs in Pakistan, especially during and just after the monsoon season. Two cases of extensively drug-resistant typhoid have been reported in travellers returning to the USA. You should follow the advice of the National Travel Health Network and Centre.
You should take steps to avoid being bitten by mosquitoes.
Make sure you have adequate travel health insurance and accessible funds to cover the cost of any medical treatment abroad and repatriation.
If you need emergency medical assistance during your trip, dial 15 and ask for an ambulance. You should contact your insurance/medical assistance company promptly if you are referred to a medical facility for treatment.
Take care when purchasing bottled water. A recent government report found a number of bottled water brands to be contaminated.
