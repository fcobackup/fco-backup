The FCDO advises against all but essential travel to:
the whole of Belarus based on the current assessment of COVID-19 risks.
Travel to Belarus is subject to entry restrictions
On 20 December 2020, the government of Belarus introduced additional exit controls at its land borders. No one can leave Belarus by a land border unless they have a valid exemption as set out by the Council of Ministers. Flights continue to operate in and out of Minsk National Airport as normal.
Entering Belarus through the land border is only possible for those BNs who have temporary or permanent residency in Belarus.
All foreign arrivals, above the age of six, must have a medical certificate (PCR) showing a negative coronavirus test result, issued no later than 72 hours before entry. This requirement does not apply to holders of permanent or temporary residency in Belarus.
All arrivals from the UK must self-isolate for 10 days, regardless of whether they show symptoms.
There are different requirements in place for arrivals from other countries. You should check the specific COVID-19 test requirements set by the Belarusian authorities and your airline in advance of your flight. Different airlines have different requirements and may refuse boarding if they are not met.
You must wear a protective face mask in all indoor public spaces, on all Belavia flights and at Minsk National Airport.
There is no need to self-isolate or provide a negative coronavirus test certificate for British nationals who plan to transit Belarus within 24 hours and provide evidence they will exit within this time-frame.
See Entry requirements for more information before you plan to travel.

During the COVID-19 pandemic, it is more important than ever to get travel insurance and check it provides sufficient cover. See the FCDO’s guidance on foreign travel insurance.
You’ll need to have valid medical insurance before travelling to Belarus. You’ll be asked to provide proof of your insurance when you apply for your visa or when you arrive at Minsk airport under the visa-free regime. Contact the Embassy of the Republic of Belarus for full details of what’s required.
Although there is no recent history of terrorism in Belarus, attacks cannot be ruled out. Attacks could happen anywhere and could affect western interests and places visited by foreigners. See Terrorism
Around 14,000 British nationals visit Belarus every year. Most visits are trouble-free.
If you’re abroad and you need emergency help from the UK government, contact the nearest British embassy, consulate or high commission.
