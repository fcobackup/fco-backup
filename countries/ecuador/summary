The national transport strike was called off on 4 October evening. However, some routes may take longer than others to be cleared for full access. Indigenous groups have convened a national march in protest against the new economic measures, estimated to arrive in Quito on Monday 7 October. This could cause some disruption in the Andes and Amazon regions and along the Panamerican Highway. You are advised to keep up to date with developments via local media and to allow extra time to reach to your destinations. You should also avoid any large gatherings as they may turn violent.
Allow extra time to reach your destination and check your routes before leaving. If you’re due to travel from the airport, you should also check the status of your flight before travelling to the airport. For live updates on all flights, monitor the Quito International Airport and Guayaquil International Airport websites (in Spanish). Live updates on public transport disruption are being published on the ECU911 emergency services website and via their Twitter account (in Spanish). For Quito district, check the Municipality Transport Agency.
