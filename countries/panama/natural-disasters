Earthquakes
There is a possibility of earthquakes in Panama. The US Federal Emergency Management Agency website has advice about what to do before, during and after an earthquake or tsunami.
Rainy Season
During the rainy season (April to December) occasional flooding and landslides occur in rural areas and some city streets become impassable due to flooding. October and November normally have the heaviest months of rainfall. Monitor regional weather forecasts and take local advice.
