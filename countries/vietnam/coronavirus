International travel
Commercial flights to and from Vietnam remain limited. A number of airline websites allow online booking from Vietnam. However, check carefully in advance whether these flights are guaranteed to fly and whether they are passenger flights.
Flights and transit arrangements are still prone to changes and cancellation with little notice.

Travelling from and returning to the UK
Check what you must do to travel abroad and return to England, Scotland, Wales or Northern Ireland.
If you plan to pass through another country to return to the UK, check the travel advice for the country you’re transiting.
Be prepared for your plans to change
No travel is risk-free during COVID-19. Countries may further restrict travel or bring in new rules at short notice, for example due to a new COVID-19 variant. Check with your travel company or airline for any transport and/or rule changes which may delay your journey home.
If you test positive for COVID-19, you may need to stay where you are until you test negative. You may also need to seek treatment there.
Plan ahead and make sure you:
can access money
understand what your insurance will cover, including COVID testing and treatment
can make arrangements to extend your stay and be away for longer than planned
Domestic travel
Air Travel
COVID-19 prevention measures vary depending on where you start your journey and your destination. You should check with your travel provider on the status of your flight and prevention measures in place at your destination and/or on return, before travelling.
Public spaces and services
The measures to combat COVID-19 vary from province to province and can change at short notice. Social distancing rules remain in place in many places across Vietnam and you should follow these strictly. Mask wearing is compulsory in public settings. Those not wearing masks may be liable to spot fines.
Healthcare in Vietnam
If you think you have COVID-19 symptoms, you should go immediately to a local doctor or hospital or call 115.
For contact details for English speaking doctors, visit our lists of healthcare providers for Hanoi and northern provinces of Vietnam or Ho Chi Minh City and southern provinces of Vietnam.

Testing and self-isolation/quarantine
If you are asked to undertake testing, you should comply. Failure to comply can be an offence with significant punishments.
Self-isolation periods and testing requirements can change at short notice and may vary between locations.
If you test positive with COVID-19 you will have to self-isolate for 7 days. Most provinces permit self-isolation at your place of residence if it meets the requirements of local authorities, but you may be required to self-isolate in a designated quarantine centre or hotel.
COVID-19 vaccines if you live in Vietnam
We will update this page when the Government of Vietnam announces new information on the national vaccination programme. You can sign up to get email notifications when this page is updated.
The Vietnamese vaccination programme started in March 2021. Currently approved by the Vietnamese Government for use in Vietnam are the AstraZeneca, Pfizer-BioNTech, Moderna, Janssen (Johnson & Johnson), Sinopharm, Sputnik V, Hayat-Vax and Abdala vaccines.
Depending on vaccine availability Vietnam has approved the combination of vaccines:
First dose Second dose Third dose
AstraZeneca AstraZeneca / Pfizer / Moderna AstraZeneca / Pfizer / Moderna
Pfizer Pfizer / Moderna Pfizer / Moderna
Moderna Moderna / Pfizer Pfizer / Moderna
Sinopharm Sinopharm Sinopharm / Pfizer / Moderna / AstraZeneca
Sputnik V Sputnik V Sputnik V / Pfizer / Moderna
The Vietnamese authorities have confirmed that foreign residents will be offered vaccines as part of the national vaccination programme, in line with Vietnam’s priority groups, if they choose to join the programme. You should also check if your employer has their own vaccination programme and check our social media for updates on vaccination availability.
If you are over 18, you can register for vaccination in Vietnam (website in English and Vietnamese) on the Vietnamese National Vaccine Registration Portal or download the e-health app (in Vietnamese only), after which you will receive instructions on how to register for vaccination. Additionally, you can register offline through your local residence group (Tổ dân phố) who will be involved in organising local vaccinations. Please talk to your landlord, local ward authorities, or local residence group for details, as these may differ according to your ward.
If you are aged above 65 or with underlying health conditions, you may be required to be vaccinated in hospital rather than a non-hospital setting.
Find out more, including about vaccines that are authorised in the UK or approved by the World Health Organisation, on the Gov.UK website COVID-19 vaccines if you live abroad.
If you are a British national living in Vietnam, you should seek medical advice from your local healthcare provider. For information about vaccine eligibility when entering the UK please see information on GOV.UK about testing and quarantine rules.
