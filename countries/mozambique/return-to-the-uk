There are currently no commercial options available to return to the UK from Mozambique. The Mozambican authorities have suspended all international commercial passenger flights to and from Mozambique until 31 May. You should urgently contact your airline if you are due to travel to or from Mozambique.
Registering with the British High Commission
You can contact the British High Commission via ReturnFromMozambique@fco.gov.uk. You can use this to share:
your full name
date of birth
passport number
location in Mozambique
contact details like your email address and phone number.
We will use this information to understand what assistance British visitors to Mozambique might need to help them return to the UK. We may not be able to respond to every email to this account, but we will keep our social media accounts and Travel Advice up to date with changes to flights and border options as we become aware of them.
Sign up for travel advice email alerts and follow the British High Commission on Twitter and Facebook.
You will need to pay for return travel to the UK. If departure options become available but you cannot afford the travel costs and have exhausted all other options for getting funds, you may be eligible to apply for an emergency loan from the government. This is a last resort option and you would need to repay the loan when you are back in the UK. For more information see the guidance on financial assistance while you are abroad.
