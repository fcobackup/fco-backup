The information on this page covers the most common types of travel and reflects the UK government’s understanding of the rules currently in place. Unless otherwise stated, this information is for travellers using a full ‘British Citizen’ passport.
The authorities in the country or territory you’re travelling to are responsible for setting and enforcing the rules for entry. If you’re unclear about any aspect of the entry requirements, or you need further reassurance, you’ll need to contact the embassy, high commission or consulate of the country or territory you’re travelling to.
You should also consider checking with your transport provider or travel company to make sure your passport and other travel documents meet their requirements.
Entry rules in response to coronavirus (COVID-19)
British nationals that are not resident in Belgium or another EU or Schengen country will only be permitted entry to Belgium for essential reasons. Those travelling will need to carry evidence of their essential reason for travel.
In exceptional circumstances, the Embassy of Belgium in the UK may be able to issue an Essential Travel Certificate (ETC) as documentation for those who have difficulties obtaining proof that their journey is essential.
British nationals resident in Belgium will need to show valid proof of residence when entering Belgium.
Travellers arriving in Belgium whose journeys originate in the UK by air, sea, rail or bus must complete the Belgian Passenger Locator Form (PLF)before travel and carry proof of the completed PLF throughout their journey and for the following 48 hours. Travellers entering Belgium by road or rail car through from a neighbouring EU country will also need to fill in the PLF if staying in Belgium for more than 48 hours or if they are returning to Belgium after a stay abroad of more than 48 hours Travellers who have not completed the form before travelling may be refused entry and/or face a fine. Further details are on the Belgian Government’s website. If you are travelling for professional reasons you should also ask your Belgian employer or Belgian client to complete the Business Travel Abroad form before you travel, and you will be asked to provide details of this on the PLF.
All non-residents aged six years and over will need to provide evidence of a negative COVID-19 PCR test upon entry. This PCR test is to be taken no more than 72 hours prior to arrival in Belgium. Transiting passengers are advised to check the Belgian guidance for requirements. There are some limited exemptions to the requirement to present a negative test, including for those arriving by car and staying less than 48 hours, transport workers and frontier workers. These are set out on the Exemptions page of the Belgian Government website.
All travellers from the UK (including those resident in Belgium) must quarantine for 10 days on arrival and take a test on the first and seventh day of their quarantine. There are some limited exemptions to the requirement to quarantine, including for transport workers and frontier workers. Further information is set out on the Exemptions page of the Belgian Government website.
Belgium operates a traffic light system identifying high, medium and low risk regions. Those travelling from other countries may also be required to quarantine for at least seven days on arrival and take a test on the first and seventh day. You should check the Belgian Government’s website (in English) for the latest information on affected regions.
Further information on how to quarantine is available on the Belgian Government’s website, together with further details on how and when to get tested
If you are travelling through France, you should also check the France Travel Advice.

Regular entry requirements
Visas
The rules for travelling or working in European countries changed on 1 January 2021:
you can travel to countries in the Schengen area for up to 90 days in any 180-day period without a visa. This applies if you travel as a tourist, to visit family or friends, to attend business meetings, cultural or sports events, or for short-term studies or training
if you are travelling to Belgium and other Schengen countries without a visa, make sure your whole visit is within the 90-day limit. Visits to Schengen countries within the previous 180 days before you travel count towards your 90 days
to stay longer, to work or study, for business or for other reasons, you will need to meet the Belgian government’s entry requirements. Check with the Belgian Embassy what type of visa and/or work permit, you may need
if you stay in Belgium with a visa or permit, this does not count towards your 90-day visa-free limit
Any time you spent in Belgium or other Schengen countries before 1 January 2021 does not count towards your 90-day visa-free limit.
At Belgian border control, you may need to use separate lanes from EU, EEA and Swiss citizens when queueing. Your passport may be stamped on entry and exit. You may also need to:
show a return or onward ticket
show you have enough money for your stay
There are separate requirements for those who are resident in Belgium. If you are resident in Belgium, you should carry proof of residence as well as your valid passport when you travel. For further information on these requirements, see our Living in Belgium guide.
Passport validity
Check your passport is valid for travel before you book your trip, and renew your passport if you do not have enough time left on it.
You must have at least 6 months left on an adult or child passport to travel to most countries in Europe (not including Ireland).
If you renewed your current passport before the previous one expired, extra months may have been added to its expiry date. Any extra months on your passport over 10 years may not count towards the 6 months needed.
UK Emergency Travel Documents
UK Emergency Travel Documents (ETDs) are accepted for entry, airside transit and exit from Belgium.
