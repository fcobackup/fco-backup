Warning
FCDO advises against all travel to Syria.

Terrorism
There is a high threat of terrorist attack globally affecting UK interests and British nationals, including from groups and individuals who view the UK and British nationals as targets. Stay aware of your surroundings at all times. 
UK Counter Terrorism Policing has information and advice on staying safe abroad and what to do in the event of a terrorist attack. Find out how to reduce your risk from terrorism while abroad.
Terrorism in Syria                
Terrorists are very likely to try to carry out attacks in Syria.
There have been many terrorist attacks across Syria including in major cities, resulting in large numbers of casualties.
There are a number of terrorist groups operating in Syria. Daesh, formerly known as ISIL/ISIS, continues to carry out regular attacks, especially in north-east Syria.
Terrorism attacks could be indiscriminate, including in places frequented by foreign nationals, such as:
public transport and transport hubs, such as airports
border crossings
public squares and other crowded places
religious sites and ceremonies, and places of worship
hotels, cafes and restaurants
commercial venues, including markets and stores
residential buildings and compounds
sports venues and stadiums
Attacks could also target:
military sites, security forces and institutions
oil facilities
government buildings and embassies
political offices and events
police stations
maritime facilities
hospitals, schools and universities
Terrorist groups continue to pose a significant threat to civilians living in Syria and have shown they can carry out co-ordinated attacks against military and security targets, and civilians. Types of attack include shootings, large-scale co-ordinated bombings designed to cause mass casualties, suicide bombs, vehicle bombs, rockets and mortars.
Take particular care during periods of national or religious significance and on public holidays.
Prosecution in the UK
If you travel to Syria to fight, and your activities amount to offences against UK terrorism legislation, you could be prosecuted when you return to the UK.
Terrorist kidnap
There is a very high threat of kidnapping from terrorists throughout Syria. Kidnappings can be for financial or political gain. There have been a number of kidnappings, including of British nationals and other westerners. Some hostages have been killed.
Terrorist groups operating in Syria routinely use kidnapping as a tactic. This includes British nationals who are seen as legitimate targets, including tourists, humanitarian aid workers, journalists and business travellers. If you are kidnapped, the reason for your presence is unlikely to protect you or secure your safe release. 
The long-standing policy of the British government is not to make substantive concessions to hostage takers. The British government considers that paying ransoms and releasing prisoners builds the capability of terrorist groups and finances their activities. This can, in turn, increase the risk of further hostage-taking. The Terrorism Act (2000) makes payments to terrorists illegal.
Security situation
The situation in Syria remains volatile and dangerous after over a decade of conflict and insecurity.
Hay’at Tahrir al Sham, formerly known as Jabhat Fatah al Sham and Al Nusrah Front, has taken control of the majority of Syria. The former Bashar al-Assad regime has ended.
Fighting and violence continues and is highly unpredictable. It includes artillery and airstrikes.
Fighting has at various times led to the temporary suspension of commercial flights, road closures, and the closure of some border crossings. Major motorways (M4 and M5) may be affected. Curfews have been imposed across the country.
Journalists in Syria
Journalists and other foreigners may be vulnerable to:
mistreatment by armed groups
death or injury from abandoned unexploded weapons, improvised explosive devices or bombardment of the area
detainment by  armed groups
confiscation of phones, cameras and video cameras by security forces
Political activity
The current political situation in Syria is fast moving. There may be risks to your safety, including detention, if you take part in  political activity in Syria. Under the former Bashar al-Assad regime thousands of people were detained, and in many cases tortured and executed, because of actual or perceived involvement in political activity.
Bashar al-Assad regime authorities detained and deported several British nationals for unauthorised activity. Activity in Syria may continue to  attract attention. If you are deported by local authorities, it is unlikely you will be able to return to Syria.
Basic services
There is a humanitarian crisis in Syria. Public infrastructure and services have been seriously affected by the conflict including lack of water, sanitation and health services. Electricity, internet and cellular services are intermittent in many parts of the country. Food supplies are extremely limited and what’s available is often prohibitively expensive. It is often difficult to get or pay for basic goods and services, including food and fuel.
Sanctions
The UK has sanctions in place on Syria. Sanctions started in 2011 as part of an EU initiative. See the Office of Financial Sanctions Implementation, HM Treasury and UK sanctions on Syria for more information.
Regional escalation
Ongoing hostilities in the region and between Israel and Lebanon could escalate quickly and pose risks for the wider region.
On 1 October, Iran launched around 200 ballistic missiles at Israel. On 26 October Israel carried out military action against Iran.

Read FCDO advice if you’re affected by a crisis abroad.
Crime
The conflict has led to a rise in crime in most areas in the country, including extortion at checkpoints, violent robbery, carjacking and kidnapping.
Criminal kidnapping
There has been an increased number of kidnaps for ransom. There is an increased threat to westerners in Syria. Foreign nationals are high-value hostages.
Laws and cultural differences
Religion
Syria is a multi-faith country. Alongside the majority Sunni population, there are large practising Shia, Christian, Druze and Alawite communities, as well as other smaller sects and religions. As the conflict continues, divisions along sectarian lines have increased. Communities have been displaced and levels of religious tolerance can vary considerably. There are restrictions on unlicensed political and religious activity, particularly political Islam.
Personal ID
You must carry copies of your passport photo page and visa for identification.
Illegal drugs penalties
There are severe penalties for drug offences in Syria. The penalty for drug possession is life imprisonment, and the death penalty applies for drug trafficking.
Money
As a result of the ongoing conflict there are restrictions on financial transactions in Syria. Prices for certain items may be listed in US dollars. The former Bashar al-Assad authorities warned against carrying or using currencies other than the Syrian pound, with severe penalties.
Transport risks
Road travel
Road travel is very dangerous in many parts of the country due to fighting, the fragile security situation and unexploded weapons.
Driving standards and traffic systems are poor, and the accident rate is high. Driving at night is particularly dangerous.
If you are driving a car and are involved in an accident with a pedestrian, it is likely you’ll be held legally responsible.
Road networks may be blocked without warning. There are security force checkpoints on major road routes.
Air travel
Fighting near airports can cause flights to be suspended.
Extreme weather and natural disasters
Find out what you can do to prepare for and respond to extreme weather and natural hazards.
Earthquakes
Earthquakes are a risk in Syria. These can be high magnitude, cause damage to infrastructure and put lives at risk. The US Federal Emergency Management Agency website has advice about what to do before, during and after an earthquake.
