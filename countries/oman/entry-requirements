Entry rules in response to coronavirus
Entry to Oman
Residents who wish to return to Oman from the UK should contact Oman Air’s UK office on: +44 2038297442 or +442038297448 or email UK.Res@omanair.com. Alternatively, their sponsors can email the Omani Ministry of Foreign Affairs at consular@mofa.gov.om. All permissions to return to Oman are subject to the Government of Oman’s approval.
In exceptional circumstances, British nationals with residency status in Oman can enter through the land border from UAE but must have prior permission from the Omani authorities (Royal Oman Police immigration) and meet UAE covid-testing exit criteria. British nationals can also cross the land border from Oman into the UAE but they must have prior permission from the Emirati immigration authorities and meet UAE covid-testing entry criteria. For more details check the Federal Authority for Identity and Citizenship website and our Travel Advice for the UAE.
Screening on arrival
On arrival in Oman you will have your temperature checked. If you show symptoms of coronavirus you may be sent to a testing centre and/or a quarantine facility.
All foreign nationals must have valid health insurance.
Quarantine requirements
Anyone entering Oman must quarantine for 14 days. Foreign nationals with resident status can do so either at their home in Oman or other in other accommodation (eg hotels) with proof of their ability to cover living costs during that period.
Data collection
Prior to travelling, you should download the Tarassud+ track and trace application. On arrival, you may be asked to pay OMR5 for a tracking bracelet.
Testing on departure
On departure you will have your temperature checked. If you show symptoms of coronavirus, you may be prevented from travelling.
Regular entry requirements
Visas
It is not possible to apply for a visa for Oman at present.
Passport validity
Your passport should have at least 6 months’ validity remaining on your date of entry to Oman.
Oman doesn’t recognise dual nationality. If you hold both British and Oman nationalities and this becomes known to the Omani authorities, they may confiscate your Omani or British passport.
Yellow fever certificate requirements
Check whether you need a yellow fever certificate by visiting the National Travel Health Network and Centre’s TravelHealthPro website.
UK Emergency Travel Documents
UK Emergency Travel Documents (ETDs) are valid for entry, exit and transit in Oman however they must have at least 6 months’ remaining validity. Residents and tourists will need to get an exit stamp before leaving. This can cause delays and may prevent you from leaving on your booked flight. Check your passport carefully to make sure it’s legal and valid so that you don’t need an ETD.
Travelling with medication
Some prescribed and over the counter medicines available in the UK are banned substances in Oman. If you’re travelling to Oman with prescription drugs, carry a copy of the prescription. For further information, check with Oman’s Ministry of Health well in advance of travel.
