This page gives you guidance on how to stay safely in Argentina as a visitor, if you are unable to return to the UK.
Everyone should comply with the measures put in place in Argentina to limit the spread of coronavirus (COVID-19).
Moving around in Argentina
Argentina is under a nationwide quarantine until midnight on 7 June. The general rule is that you must stay in your accommodation, although there are some exceptions. Anyone outside their accommodation without justification may be charged with committing a public health crime.
Exceptions are applied at both a national and a local level. Exceptions applied nationally mean you are allowed to travel to an airport if you have a flight booked. You are also allowed to make single person journeys to buy necessities, such as medicines or foodstuffs, in your local area. You are required to cover your nose and mouth with a facemask or other garment in most parts of Argentina, including Buenos Aires, whenever you go out in public.
Exceptions applied locally vary. In the city of Buenos Aires, some local businesses (such as bookshops, flower shops and home appliance stores) have started reopening from 12 May, allowing people to go out to make non-essential purchases based on the last digit of their ID card or passport. Those ending in even numbers are allowed to go out on even numbered dates and those ending in odd numbers are allowed to go out on odd numbered dates, Monday to Friday. We are also aware that, in some parts of the country (but not Buenos Aires city) you are allowed to go out for up to one hour each day provided that: you remain within 500 meters of your accommodation; you do not use public transport; and you comply with social distancing. This allows people to go for a walk but not to go for a run. You should check with local authorities what measures have been introduced wherever you are.
Apart from local exceptions to the quarantine, there may also be additional local restrictions. For example, the government of the City of Buenos Aires has urged those over the age of 70 not to leave their homes at all during the quarantine. Again, you should check what measures have been introduced in your location. You could be subject to a financial penalty if you do not abide by local regulations.
Visas
The 90-day permission for tourists to stay in Argentina is being extended each month by 30 days, if your original 90 days expired after 17 March. The latest extension was announced on 15 May.

Finance
There is a range of financial support from the government that you can access while you are unable to return due to coronavirus restrictions.
If you’re in Argentina, and have exhausted all other options to cover essential living costs while you wait to return home, you could apply for an emergency loan for your living costs from the UK government. You can only apply if you normally live in the UK and you cannot return home. This last-resort option is for those most in need, and you would need to repay the loan when you are back in the UK. Apply for an emergency loan.
