At least 8 weeks before your trip, check the latest country-specific health advice from the National Travel Health Network and Centre (NaTHNaC) on the TravelHealthPro website. Each country-specific page has information on vaccine recommendations, any current health risks or outbreaks, and factsheets with information on staying healthy abroad. Guidance is also available from NHS (Scotland) on the FitForTravel website.
General information on travel vaccinations and a travel health checklist is available on the NHS website. You may then wish to contact your health adviser or pharmacy for advice on other preventive measures and managing any pre-existing medical conditions while you’re abroad.
The legal status and regulation of some medicines prescribed or purchased in the UK can be different in other countries. If you’re travelling with prescription or over-the-counter medicine, read this guidance from NaTHNaC on best practice when travelling with medicines. For further information on the legal status of a specific medicine, you’ll need to contact the embassy, high commission or consulate of the country or territory you’re travelling to.
While travel can be enjoyable, it can sometimes be challenging. There are clear links between mental and physical health, so looking after yourself during travel and when abroad is important. Information on travelling with mental health conditions is available in our guidance page. Further information is also available from the National Travel Health Network and Centre (NaTHNaC).
Coronavirus - COVID-19
There is an ongoing outbreak of coronavirus. The virus originated in Wuhan City, Hubei Province in China, but cases have been confirmed in other parts of China and in other countries, including the Philippines.
The Philippine government has announced that until further notice, entry to the country will be refused to foreign nationals who have been in or travelled via mainland China, Hong Kong, or Macao within the previous 14 days. This will not apply to foreign nationals holding Philippines citizenship or permanent residency, foreign spouses and children of Filipinos, and holders of diplomatic visas, who will all be allowed entry into the country subject to the required 14-day quarantine. Some flights from the Philippines to Taiwan, including those operated by Philippine Airlines and Cebu Pacific, have been suspended or cancelled. Check with your travel provider for updates.

The Philippine Department for Health and the Bureau of Immigration are issuing information about the situation on their websites. If you’re unclear about any aspect of the entry requirements, or you need further reassurance, you should contact your airline or nearest Philippine Embassy.
Further advice on coronavirus is available from Public Health England and on the TravelHealthPro website.
Health risks
UK health authorities have classified the Philippines as having a risk of Zika virus transmission. For information and advice about the risks associated with Zika virus, visit the National Travel Health Network and Centre website.
Mosquito-borne illnesses like dengue fever, Japanese encephalitis (JE) and chikungunya virus occur all year round.
There’s a heightened risk of dengue fever during the rainy season (June to October). The Philippines Department of Health declared a national dengue epidemic on 6 August 2019. You should take appropriate precautions to avoid being bitten by mosquitoes.
Medical treatment
If you need emergency medical assistance during your trip, dial 911 and ask for an ambulance. You should contact your insurance/medical assistance company promptly if you are referred to a medical facility for treatment.
The availability of medical care varies across the Philippines, and may not meet the standards of care in the UK. Although adequate in major cities, medical care is limited in more remote areas. Even some of the more popular tourist destinations have limited and basic medical provisions. Many places do not have hospitals nearby or easy access to emergency medical care, which may result in a delay when seeking urgent medical attention in an emergency.
Private hospital treatment and medical transport can be too expensive for many people, eg the daily cost in intensive care units can be more than £1,000. Make sure you have adequate travel health insurance and accessible funds to cover the cost of any medical treatment abroad, medical transport and repatriation.
