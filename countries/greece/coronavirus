Travel in Greece
Travel within Greece is currently restricted, in line with measures outlined above. You should comply with all measures announced by the Greek authorities. The below advice applies to any travel which is permitted within the restrictions currently in place.
You should also note that, as a result of current restrictions on movements, transport services (including flights, intercity buses, trains and ferries) are liable to disruption at the present time.
It is mandatory to wear face masks on public transport (including flights and ferries), at airports and in taxis. Travel in a private car or a taxi is subject to certain restrictions (eg limited to a maximum number ofadult passengers per vehicle) according to local measures outlined above.
If you are travelling via ferry, you will need to complete a health questionnaire and hand it to the ferry operator before boarding. The necessary forms will be provided by the operator: you should contact them directly if you need further information. Temperature checks may also be carried out before boarding; and it is obligatory to wear masks on all ferries, including on open air decks, where capacity is limited to allow for social distancing. No celebrations are allowed on board ferries.
If you are travelling by internal (domestic) flights, you are also required to wear masks throughout the journey. Specific measures relating to check-in, baggage allowances and other details are in place to reduce the spread of coronavirus. You should check with your operator directly for further detail.
Since 1 August, cruise ships can dock at Piraeus, Rhodes, Heraklion, Volos, Corfu and Katakolo. After their first docking, the ships may visit any other Greek port on their itinerary. Rules will be kept under review. If you are travelling to Greece on a cruise ship, you should follow the advice and instructions of the ship’s crew, including with respect to the requirements of the Greek authorities.
Travel by private sailboats (and yachts) is permitted within Greece. If your vessel is arriving in Greece from another country, you must comply with specific requirements upon your first landing in Greece. No passengers are permitted on the vessel, except for the crew. Upon arrival, you must present to harbour authorities, who will require the completion of a health declaration, and mandatory testing (to be paid for by the occupants of each vessel).
Changes to what is open or permitted, including international travel options, are subject to change and may occur at short notice. Keep up to date with the latest information and advice from your travel contact or business partners, as well as the sources in this travel advice.
You can read the Greek authorities’ plans for future changes here (in Greek). These plans remain subject to change, and you should monitor the website regularly for updates.
Accommodation
All hotels are permitted to open, and other types of accommodation, including e.g. AirBnB, private rentals and hostels, are also available. However, you should note that many operators are likely to reduce their offer and close some accommodation during the winter months, particularly in light of measures put in place by the Greek authorities to fight the spread of COVID-19. You should check directly with your accommodation provider in case of related concerns.
Healthcare in Greece
If you think you have symptoms, including a fever or respiratory difficulties such as shortness of breath or a cough, you should avoid visiting local health facilities, but contact a doctor remotely to see whether a test is recommended. There is likely to be a cost associated with this, for call out, examination and testing, which you will have to pay.
If you are staying in a hotel or resort, your accommodation provider will have a list of private doctors that they will call to assess your symptoms and conduct a COVID-19 test.
If you have arranged your own accommodation you can find details of English speaking, private doctors on our list of healthcare providers.
If you are tested and the result is positive, the Greek authorities will ask you to quarantine until advised otherwise. You may be able to remain in your existing accommodation, or be required to transfer into a state hospital or other government-provided accommodation. Costs related to transfer to alternative accommodation and treatment at state healthcare facilities will be covered by the Greek Government.The nature of your accommodation may differ from the specifications of your pre-booked hotel, villa or other place of stay. Depending on local arrangements, travellers in groups may be required to stay in separate accommodation (e.g. if a sufficient number of rooms is not available in one venue, your group may be spread across different accommodation locations).
