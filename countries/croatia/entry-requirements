This page has information on travelling to Croatia. Check what you must do to return to the UK.
This page reflects the UK government’s understanding of current rules for people travelling on a full ‘British Citizen’ passport from the UK, for the most common types of travel.
The authorities in Croatia set and enforce entry rules.
All travellers
All travellers need to complete an online entry form before arriving in Croatia.
If you’re fully vaccinated
If you’ve been fully vaccinated within the last 270 days, you can enter Croatia without needing to test or quarantine.
At least 14 days must have passed since your second dose of a two-dose vaccine course (Pfizer, Moderna, AstraZeneca, Gamaleya, Sinopharm) or since receiving a one-dose vaccine (Janssen, Johnson & Johnson). All vaccines must be approved by the World Health Organization.
Croatia will also accept a certificate showing a booster dose of the vaccine.
Find out if you qualify as fully vaccinated in Croatia on the website of the Croatian Ministry of Interior.
Proof of vaccination status
You must present proof that you have been fully vaccinated to enter Croatia.
Croatia will accept the UK’s proof of COVID-19 recovery and vaccination record and proof of COVID-19 vaccination issued in the Crown Dependencies. Your final vaccine dose must have been administered at least 14 days prior to travel. Your NHS appointment card from vaccination centres is not designed to be used as proof of vaccination and should not be used to demonstrate your vaccine status.
If you’re not fully vaccinated
If you’re not fully vaccinated, you’ll need to show proof of a negative PCR test (taken no more than 72 hours before entry) or a rapid antigen test (taken no more than 24 hours before entry) when entering Croatia. See information on getting a test before entry.
If you are seeking to test on arrival in Croatia, you will need to quarantine until you receive a negative test result. If you cannot take a test on arrival, you will need to quarantine for 7 days.
PCR tests are available at most Croatian airports. You should check this with the specific airports you are travelling to.
See more information about testing centres in Croatia. Tests cost approximately 700 Croatian Kuna and results are generally available within 48 hours.
Find out if you qualify as fully vaccinated in Croatia on the website of the Croatian Ministry of Interior.
If you’ve had COVID-19 in the past year
If you’re not fully vaccinated but have tested positive for COVID-19, you can enter Croatia.
You will need to show proof of recovery from COVID-19, older than 11 days before arrival, but no older than 180 days before arrival.
Or you can show proof of recovery alongside proof of a first dose of the vaccine. The single dose of vaccine must have been administered within 8 months of contracting COVID-19, it must have been administered within the last 270 days, and at least 14 days must have passed.
You can use the UK’s proof of COVID-19 recovery record to demonstrate proof of COVID-19 recovery when entering Croatia.
Children and young people
Children under 12 and accompanied by a parent or guardian who has proof of vaccination, a negative test result or proof of recovery, do not need to take a test to enter Croatia.
If you’re transiting through Croatia
Transiting is when you pass through one country on the way to your final destination.
You are exempt from demonstrating your COVID-19 status if you are transiting Croatia. You must leave Croatia within 12 hours from entry.
Further information about transiting through Croatia can be found on the website of the Croatian Ministry of Interior.
Exemptions
Exemptions to the rules may apply. Details of possible exemptions can be found on the website of the Croatian Ministry of Interior.
Check your passport and travel documents before you travel
Passport validity
If you are planning to travel to an EU country (except Ireland), or Switzerland, Norway, Iceland, Liechtenstein, Andorra, Monaco, San Marino or Vatican City, you must meet the Schengen area rules.
Your passport must meet 2 requirements. It must be:
less than 10 years old on the day you enter (check the ‘date of issue’)
valid for at least 3 months after the day you plan to leave (check the ‘expiry date’)
We are asking the European Commission to clarify the 10-year rule. Their guidance for Schengen border guards may not be updated until the spring of 2022. Until then, for some Schengen countries your passport may need to be less than 10 years old during your whole visit, and the 3 months at the end of your visit may need to be within 10 years of your passport’s issue date.
Check both the issue date and the expiry date in your passport. If you renewed your passport early, extra months may have been added to its expiry date. This could affect the requirement for your passport to be less than 10 years old.
Contact your travel provider or embassy of the country you are visiting if you think that your passport does not meet both these requirements. Renew your passport if you need to.
Visas
Croatia is not part of the Schengen area, Visits to Croatia do not count towards your 90-day visa-free limit in the Schengen area.
Visits to other EU or Schengen countries do not count towards your 90-day visa-free limit in Croatia.
You can travel to Croatia for up to 90 days in any 180-day period without a visa. This applies if you travel as a tourist, to visit family or friends, to attend business meetings, cultural or sports events, or for short-term studies or training.
To stay longer, to work or study, for business travel or for other reasons, you will need to meet the Croatian government’s entry requirements. Check with the Croatian Embassy in London as to what type of visa and/or work permit you may need.
If you are travelling to Croatia for work, read the guidance on visas and permits.
If you stay in Croatia with a Croatia residence permit or long-stay visa, this line does not count towards your 90-day visa-free limit for Croatia.
Passport stamping
As a visitor, your passport will be stamped when you enter and exit Croatia. Border guards will use passport stamps to check you’re complying with the 90-day visa-free limit for short stays in Croatia.
If you enter or exit the Schengen area through Croatia as a visitor, check that your passport is stamped. This will show border guards that you are complying with the 90-day visa-free limit for Croatia and the separate 90-day visa-free limit for the Schengen area.
If the relevant entry or exit stamp is not in your passport, border guards will presume that you have overstayed your visa-free limit. If you show evidence eg transport tickets to prove when you entered or exited Croatia, border guards should add this entry or exit date and the location in your passport.
You may also need to:
show a return or onward ticket
show proof of accommodation
show you have enough money for your stay
If you have a Withdrawal Agreement residency document for another country, your passport might still be stamped if you are a visitor to Croatia.
If you are resident in Croatia, read our Living in Croatia guide for passport stamping information.
UK Emergency Travel Documents
UK ETDs are accepted for entry, transit and exit from Croatia.
