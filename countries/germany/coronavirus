The German authorities have introduced a number of precautionary measures in response to the coronavirus (COVID-19) pandemic. You should comply with any additional screening measures put in place by the authorities.
The German Health Minister has advised that all people in Germany who have been in a risk area in the last 14 days should self-isolate for two weeks, as well as those who have been close contact with a person who has been tested positive for COVID-19. The high risk areas are listed on the Robert Koch Institute website (in German).
All regions in Germany are introducing restrictions on peopleâ€™s movement and on certain activities. Across Germany this includes school closures, closure of public spaces such as nightclubs, museums, cinemas, bookmakers, sports clubs and non-essential shops. Further restrictions vary by region but include limits on the size of public gatherings, an expansion of the closure of shops and bars, and limiting restaurants to takeaway services only. Visits to hospitals and care homes may also be restricted. As there is some variation between the federal states, please follow the latest local guidance, much of which is available in English.
Germany imposed temporary border checks on its land borders with France, Austria, Switzerland, Luxembourg and Denmark on Monday 16 March. Those without a good reason for travelling will not be permitted entry. Frontier workers and goods traffic are not currently affected.
