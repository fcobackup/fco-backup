The Government of Australia has announced that from 9pm Australia Eastern Standard Time on 20 March, entry to the country will only be permitted to Australian citizens or permanent residents. This follows a similar announcement by New Zealand from 19 March. As many flight connections to and from Fiji connect in Australia and New Zealand, options to depart Fiji are likely to reduce. If you’re currently a visitor in Fiji, you’re advised to prepare to leave as soon as possible. If you’re resident in Fiji, you should be aware of the potential impact of the border closures and flight restrictions on future travel plans.
To transit through Australia before 1200 AEDT on 24 March you need to have applied for exemption. You can find out more information on this and apply on the Australian Department of Home Affairs website.
The New Zealand government has announced, with strict health and onward flight criteria, the ability for travellers from Pacific Island Countries to transit New Zealand; this ability to transit may change at short notice and is only available for a short period.
