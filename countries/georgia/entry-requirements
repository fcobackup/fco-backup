This page reflects the UK government’s understanding of current rules for people travelling on a full ‘British Citizen’ passport, for the most common types of travel.
The authorities in Georgia set and enforce entry rules. For further information contact the embassy, high commission or consulate of the country or territory you’re travelling to. You should also consider checking with your transport provider or travel company to make sure your passport and other travel documents meet their requirements.
Entry rules in response to coronavirus (COVID-19)
Entry to Georgia
Foreign citizens are now allowed to enter Georgia under the following conditions:
(1) Unrestricted entry by air for citizens of any country, including the UK, who have documentary proof of having either received a full course of COVID-19 vaccination, or of having been infected with COVID within the previous 100 days and having had the first jab in a two-dose vaccination process. If you arrive by land or sea, you will also need to present a negative PCR test taken within the previous 72 hours.
(2) Other UK citizens can enter Georgia provided your travel to Georgia originates in the UK or one of the other countries listed on the Ministry of Foreign Affairs website. You must travel by air and submit a travel history in advance, present on arrival a negative PCR test taken within the previous 72 hours and take a further PCR test at your own expense on your third day in Georgia.
Mandatory 14-day quarantine, followed by a PCR test is imposed on anyone who has been in South Africa, Botswana, Zimbabwe, Namibia, Lesotho, Eswatini, Mozambique or Malawi in the previous 14-day period.
Children under 10 are exempted from PCR tests.
Demonstrating your COVID-19 status
Georgia will accept the UK’s proof of COVID-19 recovery and vaccination record and proof of COVID-19 vaccination issued in the Crown Dependencies. Your NHS appointment card from vaccination centres is not designed to be used as proof of vaccination and should not be used to demonstrate your vaccine status.
Entry permits and extensions
The entry permit extensions granted because of COVID-19 ended on 1 July 2021 and will not be renewed. If your visitor permit has expired you should arrange to leave Georgia, or apply for resident status.
If you are working or studying in Georgia and meet the requirements for a Georgian Residence Permit, you should apply for this through Public Service Hall. You should not remain on a visitor’s entry permit indefinitely.
If you are in Georgia for more than 183 days and take up any form of paid employment, you are automatically liable for income tax and must inform the Revenue Service of your employment, whether you are on a visitor’s permit or officially resident. Non-compliance will be fined.
UK passports
The agreement by the Georgian Government to recognise as valid for residence and visa purposes UK passports of British residents in Georgia that expired after 6 January 2020 or had less than six months’ validity when presented, has now expired.
If you are in Georgia, and your passport has expired, you should apply for a new full validity UK passport. Please use this guidance to complete the application form and submit it at the Visa Application Centre in Tbilisi.
If your passport has expired and you need to travel urgently you may be eligible for an Emergency Travel Document. Please follow the passport guidance linked above for more information.
Regular entry requirements
Visas
British nationals do not need a visa to enter Georgia for visits of up to one year. If you wish to stay for longer, you would need to apply for a longer term visa category. Contact the Embassy of Georgia in London or visit the Georgian Ministry of Foreign Affairs website for more details on entry requirements.
Passport validity
Your passport should be valid for the proposed duration of your stay. No additional period of validity beyond this is required.
Travel insurance
Make sure you have a valid travel insurance policy as you may be asked to provide evidence of this by your airline at check-in or by the immigration authorities upon arrival in Georgia. You may face difficulties if you cannot provide evidence of valid travel insurance.
Travelling with medicines
Georgia has a very strict anti-drugs policy, which can also cover prescription and non-prescription drugs or medicines, otherwise commonly available in the UK and the European Union. For example, non-prescription medicines containing codeine are illegal in Georgia. This can cause serious problems for travellers and in some cases lead to administrative and criminal proceedings. For further information on the legal status of a specific medicine, please contact your nearest Embassy of Georgia.
If you intend to travel with prescription medicine, you must carry a doctor’s prescription and ideally the original packaging. See Health
UK Emergency Travel Documents
UK Emergency Travel Documents are accepted for entry, airside transit and exit from Georgia.
