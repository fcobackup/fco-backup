The Falkland Island pound is fixed at a rate of one pound Sterling. Bank of England coins and notes are accepted in the Islands at full value. However, some travellers have experienced difficulties exchanging Falkland Islandsâ€™ notes at their bank on return to the UK. You should therefore limit the amount of Falkland Islands currency you carry on departure.
In Stanley, many of the main shops, hotels and restaurants will accept MasterCard or Visa. A small number of places accept debit cards. Credit and debit cards are not widely accepted outside Stanley. Check when making bookings and bring some cash in pounds Sterling (or US Dollars). There is one ATM machine on the Islands, but if this is out of service a cash advance facility is available at the bank in Stanley using Visa or Mastercard.
