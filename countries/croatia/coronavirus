Coronavirus travel health
Check the latest information on risk from COVID-19 for Croatia on the TravelHealthPro website.
See the TravelHealthPro website for further advice on travel abroad and reducing spread of respiratory viruses during the COVID-19 pandemic.
If you test positive for COVID-19 whilst you are in Croatia you should follow advice from the local authorities and get in touch with the local epidemiologist. Call 113 (from a Croatian number) for general advice about COVID-19. Arrangements for self-isolation and the associated costs may vary, but you should be prepared to make your own arrangements for self-isolation and bear any related costs. If you test positive for COVID-19, do not attempt to check in for your flight, as you may be subject to a fine from the Croatian Police.
International travel
You should follow the advice of the local authorities in the most appropriate way to protect yourself and others, including any measures brought in to control the virus. These measures may change at short notice either at national or at local level. You should check local guidance for further information and details about restrictions in Croatia.
Returning to the UK
Travelling from and returning to the UK
Check what you must do to travel abroad and return to England, Scotland, Wales or Northern Ireland.
If you plan to pass through another country to return to the UK, check the travel advice for the country you’re transiting.
Information on testing facilities throughout Croatia can be found on the government website. You should check that the test result can be provided in the correct format and language.
Be prepared for your plans to change
No travel is risk-free during COVID. Countries may further restrict travel or bring in new rules at short notice, for example due to a new COVID-19 variant. Check with your travel company or airline for any transport changes, which may delay your journey home.
If you test positive for COVID-19, you may need to stay where you are until you test negative. You may also need to seek treatment there.
Plan ahead and make sure you:
can access money
understand what your insurance will cover
can make arrangements to extend your stay and be away for longer than planned
Travel in Croatia
There are no restrictions on regional travel within Croatia.
Face masks
Whilst it is no longer a requirement to wear a mask in indoor settings, authorities still recommend doing so for large gatherings. You should follow the guidance of your airline or transport provider as some may still require you to wear a mask.
Public places and services
You should exercise caution and follow social distancing rules when attending busy venues.
If you need to demonstrate vaccination status whilst in Croatia, the UK’s proof of COVID-19 recovery and vaccination record and proof of COVID-19 vaccination issued in the Crown Dependencies are recognised. Your final vaccine dose must have been administered at least 14 days previously. Your NHS appointment card from vaccination centres is not designed to be used as proof of vaccination and should not be used to demonstrate your vaccine status.
Health
If you feel that you have symptoms of coronavirus, you should contact the Croatian government’s COVID19 hotline on telephone number 113. Alternatively, you should contact the nearest specialist clinic – the contact details according to county, can be found here

COVID-19 vaccines if you live in Croatia
Wherever possible British nationals should aim to be vaccinated in the country where they live.
The Croatian national vaccination programme uses the AstraZeneca, Janssen (Johnson and Johnson), Pfizer-BioNTech and Moderna vaccines. British nationals resident in Croatia are eligible for vaccination. The Croatian authorities have issued guidance regarding how to get a COVID-19 vaccine in Croatia (this is only available in Croatian). The guidance includes information on how you can register your interest for a vaccine via your General Practitioner if you live in Croatia. You can register your interest for a vaccine through a dedicated vaccination website.
Find out more, including about vaccines that are authorised in the UK or approved by the World Health Organisation, on the COVID-19 vaccines if you live abroad.
If you’re a British national living in Croatia, you should seek medical advice from your local healthcare provider. Information about COVID-19 vaccines used in the national programme where you live, including regulatory status, should be available from local authorities.
If you receive your COVID-19 vaccination in Croatia, you can get an EU Digital COVID Certificate from the national authorities. The Certificate proves that you have been vaccinated against COVID-19, received a negative test result, or recovered from COVID-19. It will help facilitate your travel within the EU and, in some countries, you can use it to demonstrate your COVID-19 status to businesses and other organisations. For further information, visit the European Commission’s EU Digital COVID Certificate page.
