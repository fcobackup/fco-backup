Entry rules in response to coronavirus
Kuwait will allow non-Kuwaitis into the country, and direct flights from UK, after 21 February.
Commercial flights to and from Kuwait are operating at a reduced capacity of 35 passengers per flight.
After 21 February, if you are entering Kuwait from UK, or any of the other countries Kuwait considers high risk for COVID-19, you will need valid residency, a negative PCR test conducted in the previous 72 hours, and you will have to quarantine in a designated hotel at your expense for 14 days, and undergo 2 PCR tests during this period. This list of countries is regularly updated: you should follow @Kuwait_dgca on Twitter for the latest countries on the list. If you are entering Kuwait from any country not on this list, you will need to undergo self-funded quarantine for 7 days in a designated hotel, 2 negative PCR tests and then a further 7 days of home isolation. Passengers must register on www.kuwaitmosafer.com before check in.
Visit visas are not issued on arrival or at Embassies outside Kuwait, until further notice
Regular entry requirements
The information on this page covers the most common types of travel and reflects the UK government’s understanding of the rules currently in place. Unless otherwise stated, this information is for travellers using a full ‘British Citizen’ passport.
The authorities in the country or territory you’re travelling to are responsible for setting and enforcing the rules for entry. If you’re unclear about any aspect of the entry requirements, or you need further reassurance, you’ll need to contact the embassy, high commission or consulate of the country or territory you’re travelling to.
You should also consider checking with your transport provider or travel company to make sure your passport and other travel documents meet their requirements.
Visas
The Kuwaiti Government automatically extended visit visas and residency visas that expired after 1 March 2020 until 30 November 2020. A small number were subsequently extended for a further three months. This only applies to visa holders already in Kuwait. If you hold valid Kuwaiti residency and are outside Kuwait, your residency is now valid until its expiry date, and does not automatically expire after 6 months outside Kuwait.
The Kuwaiti Government has suspended the visa on arrival and e-visa service. You should get a visa in advance from the Kuwaiti Embassy in London when this service reopens. On arrival in Kuwait, the immigration authorities may ask to see evidence of return or onward travel, a sponsor’s letter and hotel confirmation. For further information, contact the Embassy of Kuwait, 2 Albert Gate, London, SW1X 7JU (telephone 020 7590 3400).
Passport validity
For visit visas, obtained on arrival or in advance, your passport should be valid for a minimum period of 6 months from the date of entry into Kuwait.
For residency visas, your passport should be valid for a minimum of 2 years.
UK Emergency Travel Documents
UK Emergency Travel Documents (ETDs) are not valid for entry into Kuwait. However, ETDs are accepted for airside transit and exit from Kuwait. Residents and tourists will need to get an exit stamp before leaving. Kuwait residency permits are cancelled when an ETD is issued.
Previous travel to Israel
If you have an Israeli stamp in your passport you may be refused a visa and/or entry into Kuwait.
Living and working in Kuwait
For work or residency visas, apply to the Kuwaiti Embassy in London.
If you intend to use UK documents like academic records, marriage certificates, or your driving licence in your application, you should have all such documents authenticated by the FCDO in the UK or by the Ministry of Foreign Affairs of the country in which they were awarded and the nearest Kuwaiti Embassy. The same procedure is necessary for children’s birth certificates.
Your employers should not retain your passport.
