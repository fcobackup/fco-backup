Medication
Some prescribed and over the counter medicines available in the UK are considered controlled substances in Singapore. Check to see whether you need approval from the Health Sciences Authority to bring in medication from the UK.
Not all medicines from the UK are available in Singapore. Make sure you have a prescription from your GP, then take it to a doctor in Singapore who may be able to issue a prescription for a local equivalent. See the HCI Directory for a listing of licensed healthcare institutions.
Medical treatment
If you need emergency medical assistance during your trip, dial 995 and ask for an ambulance. You should contact your insurance/medical assistance company promptly if you’re referred to a medical facility for treatment.
Healthcare in Singapore is of a high quality and expensive. You should take enough medication to cover your stay and carry it in your hand baggage.

Make sure you have adequate travel health insurance and accessible funds to cover the cost of any medical treatment abroad and that your travel insurance also covers costs for medical repatriation.
Air quality
From June to October Singapore can experience high levels of pollution (haze) from land clearance fires in Indonesia. The haze can cause disruption to local and regional air travel, and the air pollution may have an impact on public health. Keep up-to-date with local information and seek medical advice on appropriate precautions. You should monitor the Pollutant Standards Index (PSI) updates and health advisories from the Singapore government.
Health risks
Mosquito-borne illnesses like dengue fever and chikungunya virus occur all year round. You should take appropriate precautions to avoid being bitten by mosquitoes.

Hand, Foot and Mouth Disease is common in Singapore with more serious outbreaks from time to time. Young children are particularly at risk.
Monkeypox
If you are assessed to have Monkeypox, or considered a close contact of someone with Monkeypox, you will be quarantined in a Singapore government facility. Those infected with Monkeypox are required to remain in a government quarantine facility until such time that they are assessed to no longer be infectious, whereas for close contacts of Monkeypox cases, quarantine will be for 14 days from the point of contact with an infected person, followed by 7 days of monitoring via regular check-ups by phone. The cost of quarantine will be covered by the Singapore government. If you think you might have Monkeypox symptoms or may have been a close contact of a Monkeypox case you should seek medical advice immediately.
