Travellers arriving from other parts of China, South Korea, all of Iran, and Heinsberg District in North-Rhine Westphilia in Germany will be asked to self-isolate for 14 days on arrival.
Travellers arriving from the UK are required to fill in a form to self-certify that they are infection-free. Infringements on these procedures are being pursued with fines of up to €4000.

closed all schools in the country until at least 22 March, which may be extended
recommended all universities suspend courses until 31 March

Diplomats, government officials, military employees and utility workers are exempt. Between 06:00 and 22:00 no curfew is in place but the Romanian Government is recommending that people do not venture outside except for the reasons above.
