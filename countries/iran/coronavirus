Be prepared for your plans to change
No travel is risk-free during COVID-19. Countries may further restrict travel or bring in new rules at short notice, for example due to a new COVID-19 variant. Check with your travel company or airline for any transport changes which may delay your journey home.
If you test positive for COVID-19, you may need to stay where you are until you test negative. You may also need to seek treatment there.
Plan ahead and make sure you:
can access money
understand what your insurance will cover
can make arrangements to extend your stay and be away for longer than planned

Healthcare in Iran
In 2022 there were reports of shortages of some basic medicines in Iran. If you travel to Iran against our advice for the purpose of medical or cosmetic treatment, you may not receive adequate care in the case of emergency.
If you travel to Iran against our advice for the purpose of adoption or surrogacy, you should ensure you have sought UK and Iranian legal advice on the process including eligibility for British nationality and the process for obtaining a passport. Please see Adopting a Child from Overseas and Surrogacy Overseas for more information.
You should plan for a lengthy stay in-country to complete complex procedures. His Majesty’s Passport Office (HMPO) currently cannot issue passports to individuals inside Iran.
If you think you have COVID-19 symptoms, you are advised to take a test and to self-isolate at home until you receive the results. If the symptoms are not serious, you should continue to self-isolate at home but if the symptoms persist and/or worsen then you are advised to go to a hospital for treatment. If you are a mono-British national, you should contact your travel insurance provider for advice; if you test positive for COVID-19, you will be referred to a specialist Coronavirus hospital or unit.
