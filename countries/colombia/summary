Given the rapidly changing situation in Colombia, as of 6 July some staff and dependents in the British Embassy are being temporarily withdrawn. The Embassy will continue to carry out essential work including providing 24/7 consular assistance and support to British people in Colombia.

Colombia’s land and sea borders are closed. Airports are closed to international traffic until 1 September, and foreign nationals will not be permitted to enter during this period. See Entry requirements
Nationwide isolation measures came into effect at 11.59pm on 24 March, and will be in place until 11:59pm on 14 July. For more information, see Staying during coronavirus
Terrorists are very likely to try to carry out attacks in Colombia. The security situation can change very quickly in many areas of the country. You should pay close attention to warnings issued by the Colombian authorities. See Terrorism

If you’re abroad and you need emergency help from the UK government, contact the nearest British embassy, consulate or high commission. Consular support is limited in parts of Colombia where we advise against all but essential travel and areas where there is a limited state presence. When consular support is unavailable, the British Embassy will liaise with local authorities to request assistance.
If you need to contact the emergency services, call 123 (in Spanish).
UK health authorities have classified Colombia as having a risk of Zika virus transmission. For more information and advice, visit the website of the National Travel Health Network and Centre website.
