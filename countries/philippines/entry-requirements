From 1 February 2022, fully vaccinated travellers holding a valid visa will be permitted entry. They must provide a negative Reverse Transcription Polymerase Chain Reaction (RT-PCR) test taken within 48 hours prior to departing for the Philippines.

Demonstrating your COVID-19 status
The Philippines will accept the UK’s proof of COVID-19 recovery and vaccination record. You should follow the rules for fully vaccinated travellers depending on the country risk classifications as determined by the Philippine Government.
Your NHS appointment card from vaccination centres is not designed to be used as proof of vaccination.
For travellers fully vaccinated in the Philippines, either your VaxCertPH digital vaccination certificate or Bureau of Quarantine issued International Certificate of Vaccination (ICV) is acceptable as proof of vaccination.
Quarantine requirements for travellers
The Philippines’ Government Resolution 159 explains the current entry rules to the Philippines.
From 1 February 2022, fully vaccinated travellers must provide a negative Reverse Transcription Polymerase Chain Reaction (RT-PCR) test taken within 48 hours prior to departure from the country of origin. Upon arrival, you should self-monitor for any sign or symptom for 7 days with the first day being the date of arrival.
Foreign nationals who were cleared for entry but subsequently found to have presented counterfeit or fraudulent pre-booked accommodation upon validation by the Department of Tourism, or those who violate the testing and quarantine protocols of the Department of Health, are subject to deportation.
Travelling with Children
From 10 February 2022, children below 18 years of age travelling to the Philippines are exempted from the requirement of full vaccination and providing proof of vaccination status prior to boarding.
Emigration Clearance Certificate (ECC)
Holders of Temporary Visitor Visa who have stayed in the Philippines for six months or more or holders of Immigrant and Non-Immigrant visas with valid ACR I-Cards who are leaving the country temporarily must secure an Emigration Clearance Certificate (ECC) at least 72 hours before leaving the country to avoid being denied departure. You should refer to the Bureau of Immigration website for instructions, and call +63 (02) 8465 2400 for advice if you can settle this at the airport before your departure.
All ACR I cardholders generally need to pay for the ECC upon departure. Those with approved visas but who are yet to receive their ACR I cards can show their receipt at the airport. Foreigners with approved visa applications which have not yet been issued can present their valid passport, DOJ endorsement or Certification from the approving office and receipt.
Travel Pass
From 1 March 2021, anyone holding a visa issued by the Department of Justice (DoJ), the Board of Investments (BoI), the Philippine Retirement Authority (PRA) and the Philippine Economic Zone Authority (PEZA) must obtain a travel pass from the Department that issued their visa in order to leave the Philippines. Anyone holding an ECC issued by the Bureau of Immigration is exempt from this requirement.

Visas
From 10 February 2022, UK passport holders will be permitted to enter the Philippines visa free for an initial period of 30 days. Consult the Philippine Embassy before you travel.
You can apply to extend your stay at the offices of the Bureau of Immigration. Overstaying without the proper authority is a serious matter and can lead to detention pending payment of outstanding fees and fines and voluntary deportation at your own expense. The British Embassy is aware of cases where visitors trying to extend their stay in the Philippines by regular renewals of tourist visas have been challenged on arrival by Philippine immigration officials. If you wish to stay long-term in the Philippines, make sure you do so in full accordance with Philippine immigration regulations.

For more information and details of payment, visit the Department of Foreign Affairs’ website
If a minor under the age of 15 is travelling to visit a parent they should carry a copy of their parents’ resident visa.
