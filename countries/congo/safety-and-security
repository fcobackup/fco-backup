Crime
There’s been a steady increase of crime reported in Brazzaville and Pointe Noire. Foreigners in particular may be targeted by criminals. You should take sensible precautions to safeguard yourself and your belongings, particularly in Brazzaville and Pointe Noire. Don’t walk in the streets after dark, or carry large amounts of money or valuables. The chance of being targeted by criminals is higher in rural areas.
Criminals have been known to target the beaches at Pointe Noire. Stay on main beaches, secure valuables, and avoid all beaches at night.
Local travel
There continue to be reports of sporadic rebel group activity and military operations against them, large numbers of displaced people, and continued instances of crime and armed banditry in the Pool region. Don’t attempt to travel through this region by road or rail. Any attempt to travel by night may be prevented, and a permit from the Congolese army plus a military escort may be required for travel by day.
There are no rail services running between Brazzaville and Pointe Noire. When rail services were running there were several instances of criminal gangs targeting trains on this route.
Avoid travelling anywhere around the country at night.
Boat travel
The river crossing/border with Kinshasa is subject to closure without warning. The ferry stops running in late afternoon, and there’s no service on Sundays. Check the situation locally before travelling.
Road travel
Road conditions are generally poor and deteriorate during the wet season (November to May). Overland travel off the main roads requires a four-wheel drive vehicle. Lock vehicle doors and keep windows closed when driving; watch out for armed gangs who may target your car. Don’t drive off the main routes or park in unsupervised areas.
There are frequent vehicle checkpoints throughout the Republic of Congo, which can be poorly marked. If you’re asked to produce documents for inspection at a checkpoint, remain in your vehicle and show them documents through closed windows.
Air travel
All airlines from the Republic of Congo have been refused permission to operate services to the EU because of safety concerns. British Embassy staff aren’t allowed to use any of the airlines operating between Brazzaville and Pointe Noire.
Political situation
Any periods of unrest are likely to be accompanied by an increased police and military presence in Brazzaville. You should maintain a high level of security awareness, avoid political protests and avoid travel after dark.
