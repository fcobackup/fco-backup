Cases of coronavirus (COVID-19) have been confirmed in Ethiopia. The Ethiopian authorities have introduced a number of measures to limit the spread of the virus.
Entry and borders
On 23 March the Government of Ethiopia announced the closure of the country’s land borders. You should check for updates with local authorities before travelling to the border.
Addis Ababa Bole International Airport (and other international ports of arrival) have put in place additional measures to screen passengers arriving, departing or transiting through Ethiopia. Screening may include temperature measurements and checks on recent travel to affected areas.
Those people displaying symptoms linked to coronavirus may be transferred to a nearby isolation facility for up to 24 hours while further tests are carried out. The Ethiopian Public Health Institute advises that anyone who tests positive for the virus but displays only mild symptoms will be required to remain at the isolation facility for a further 14 days, in line with WHO guidance. Anyone with a pre-existing condition that requires regular medicines should bring sufficient amounts to cover a potential unplanned additional 2 week stay. More serious cases will be transferred to hospital.
Quarantine
All passengers arriving into the country will be subject to mandatory 14 day quarantine in hotels designated by the local authorities. The cost of staying at the hotel during quarantine will be borne by passengers. You may need to demonstrate that you can afford the cost of your hotel quarantine before boarding your flight. Contact your airline for more details.
Passengers with an onward ticket are exempt from quarantine. When booking flights that transit through Addis Ababa, you should avoid flights that will require you to stay for more than 48 hours. Where passengers are in possession of a transit visa, you will be taken to a designated hotel for the duration of your transfer. Shorter transfers for passengers who remain within the airport are unaffected.
Local measures
The Government of Ethiopia has announced additional measures including closing schools, bars and nightclubs and banning large gatherings. On 23 March it was announced the security forces would begin enforcing these measures where necessary and on 8 April the Ethiopian government declared a State of Emergency which gives the Federal Government and security forces increased power to impose limitations. The State of Emergency will last for 5 monthsYou should comply with all such limitations and monitor local media for further updates.
Oromia, Amhara, SNNP, Harari and Tigray regional states have banned or restricted public transport to help limit the spread of coronavirus. On 25 March, the Tigray Regional State entered into a state of emergency Gatherings of over five people have been banned. All schools, bars, cultural restaurants, hairdressers and gyms have been closed. Ethiopian airlines are still flying into Mekele, but movement between cities and rural areas in the region is severely curtailed. You should follow the advice of the local authorities.
Healthcare
You can call the Ethiopian COVID-19 helplines on 8335 or 952 for advice or if you are experiencing symptoms while in Ethiopia. Current information is available from the Ethiopian Public Health Institute.
Private healthcare facilities used by the international community with the capability to respond to coronavirus cases exist, but capacity is limited. These facilities are also those most frequently recommended by British travel insurance companies for other illnesses or injuries. You should therefore be aware that the ability to access treatment for other ailments is likely to be limited. You should check with your insurance company which facilities they recommend and phone the healthcare facility before you visit.
Crime
There have been reports of abusive behaviour towards foreigners in relation to coronavirus, including a small number of cases of assault. See Crime for advice on crime in Ethiopia.
Further information
Further information on coronavirus, including advice on preparing for foreign travel and helping reduce the spread of the virus, is available from Public Health England, and the TravelHealthPro website.
