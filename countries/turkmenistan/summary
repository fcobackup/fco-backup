Before you travel, check the ‘Entry requirements’ section for Turkmenistan’s current entry restrictions and requirements. These may change with little warning. Monitor this advice for the latest updates and stay in contact with your travel provider.
If you plan to pass through another country to return to the UK, check the travel advice for the country you’re transiting.
It is more important than ever to get travel insurance and check it provides sufficient cover. See the FCDO’s guidance on foreign travel insurance.
Although there’s no recent history of terrorism in Turkmenistan, attacks can’t be ruled out. See Terrorism.
You should carry identification at all times. The police often carry out checks.
Visa requirements are strict. You should contact the Turkmen Embassy in London well in advance of travel. If you are staying for more than 3 days, you will also need to register with the State Migration Service. Don’t overstay your visa. See Entry requirements.
If you need to contact the emergency services, call 01 (from landline) or 001 (from mobile) for fire, 02 (from landline) 002 (from mobile) for police, and 03 (from landline) 003 (from mobile) for an ambulance.
If you’re abroad and you need emergency help from the UK government, contact the nearest British embassy, consulate or high commission.
