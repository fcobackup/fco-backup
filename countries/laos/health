At least 8 weeks before your trip, check the latest country-specific health advice from the National Travel Health Network and Centre (NaTHNaC) on the TravelHealthPro website. Each country-specific page has information on vaccine recommendations, any current health risks or outbreaks, and factsheets with information on staying healthy abroad. Guidance is also available from NHS (Scotland) on the FitForTravel website.
General information on travel vaccinations and a travel health checklist is available on the NHS website. You may then wish to contact your health adviser or pharmacy for advice on other preventive measures and managing any pre-existing medical conditions while you’re abroad.
The legal status and regulation of some medicines prescribed or purchased in the UK can be different in other countries. If you’re travelling with prescription or over-the-counter medicine, read this guidance from NaTHNaC on best practice when travelling with medicines. For further information on the legal status of a specific medicine, you’ll need to contact the embassy, high commission or consulate of the country or territory you’re travelling to.
While travel can be enjoyable, it can sometimes be challenging. There are clear links between mental and physical health, so looking after yourself during travel and when abroad is important. Information on travelling with mental health conditions is available in our guidance page. Further information is also available from the National Travel Health Network and Centre (NaTHNaC).
Coronavirus
There is an ongoing outbreak of coronavirus (Covid-19). The virus originated in China, but cases have been confirmed in other countries. You should comply with any additional screening measures put in place by the authorities.
If you’re returning to the UK from Laos, consult the latest advice from the Department of Health and Social Care on actions to take.
Further information on coronavirus, including advice on preparing for foreign travel and helping reduce the spread of the virus, is available on the TravelHealthPro website.
You can find more information about on the TravelHealthPro country page.
Travelers to Laos should be aware that there may be enhanced health screening at border crossings and at departure airports before boarding. You should allow additional time to include this possibility and check with your airline if travelling by air.
Laos Government officials advise “If you have a travel history to an outbreak area and develop symptoms after entering Laos, please call +856 20 5406 677 to speak to a duty officer in Laos or English, at any time of the day or night. For more information, call the free hotline number 166 at any time.”
The Golden Triangle Special Economic Zone in Bokeo Province which borders China currently has restrictions on entry until 10 March 2019. Persons exiting will be subject to health screening and will not be able to re-enter until the deadline has passed. You should confirm with local authorities the current situation before you attempt to travel through the zone.
Health risks
UK health authorities have classified Laos as having a risk of Zika virus transmission. For information and advice about the risks associated with Zika virus, visit the National Travel Health Network and Centre website
Dengue and malaria are endemic and visitors should take steps to avoid being bitten by mosquitos through the use of deterrents and mosquito nets, whilst anti-malarial treatments are recommended in some areas.
Water borne, food borne and other infectious diseases are common and serious outbreaks occur from time to time.
There have been outbreaks of avian influenza (also known as bird flu) in poultry in Laos. The risk to humans is very low, but as a precaution you should avoid contact with domestic, caged or wild birds and make sure poultry and egg dishes are thoroughly cooked.
Air quality
Regional air pollution, up to unhealthy levels, can affect areas of Laos, and may aggravate heart, lung or respiratory conditions. Children, the elderly and those with pre-existing medical conditions may be especially affected. You can find advice on air quality and possible mitigation on the World Health Organization (WHO) website. You can check air quality levels for some cities in Laos in real time on the World Air Quality Index website.
Medical treatment
Medical care in Vientiane is extremely basic and outside the capital there are no reliable facilities to deal with medical emergencies. Medical evacuation is difficult to organise and very expensive. Make sure you have adequate travel health insurance and accessible funds to cover the cost of any medical treatment abroad and repatriation.
There are no proper mental health services or care facilities in Laos. Professional treatment including medication is difficult and expensive to obtain. Emergency mental health treatment is likely to require transfer to a country offering appropriate facilities. Always make sure your travel insurance policy covers any pre-existing mental health conditions.
If you need emergency medical assistance during your trip, dial 1195 or 030 5257239 and ask for an ambulance. You should contact your insurance/medical assistance company promptly if you are referred to a medical facility for treatment. You may be asked to pay for the use of an ambulance and any treatment you may require in advance. Usually you will get a receipt that can be used to claim on your insurance.
Voluntary ambulance services also operate in Vientiane free of charge:
Vientiane Rescue (telephone: 1623 or (0)20 5666 8825)
Lao Red Cross Rescue (telephone: +856 (0)20 5996 6111 or (0)20 2200 5563.
Note that these phone lines and emergency services telephone numbers are not staffed by English speakers. Make sure anyone attending an accident is wearing a uniform identifying themselves as ‘Vientiane Rescue’ or ‘Lao Red Cross’. There have been reports of bogus companies who aren’t trained in first aid charging for attending accidents.
