Cases of coronavirus (COVID-19) have been confirmed in French Polynesia. The authorities have introduced a number of measures to limit the spread of the virus.
From 9 March 2020, all passengers, regardless of nationality or travel history, need to present a medical certificate, issued less than 5 days before departure for French Polynesia, certifying their current state of health.
In the absence of a certificate, the airline will be asked to refuse boarding to the passenger. During the flight all passengers will be handed a Sanitary Control questionnaire by the airline to be handed in by the passenger on arrival to the medical team at the airport. All passengers arriving in French Polynesia on an international flight will undergo temperature control via a thermal camera.
Further information on coronavirus, including advice on preparing for foreign travel and helping reduce the spread of the virus, is available from Public Health England and on the TravelHealthPro website
Local public health information is available from the Direction de la Santé of French Polynesia.
