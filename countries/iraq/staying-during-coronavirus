This page gives you guidance on how to stay safely in Iraq as a visitor, if you are unable to return to the UK.
Everyone should comply with the measures put in place in Iraq to limit the spread of coronavirus (COVID-19).
Moving around in Iraq
A lockdown across federal Iraq (except for the Kurdistan Region of Iraq) will be in force from 30 July to 9 August 2020 to slow the spread of Coronavirus.
The Kurdistan Region of Iraq is subject to strict travel restrictions between provinces which are often introduced at short notice. These are published through local media and on www.moi.gov.krd.
You should keep up to date with information from your sponsor or employer in Iraq and/or with your airline on the impact of any existing travel plans. If you need further information about entry requirements, contact the local immigration authorities or the nearest Iraqi Embassy.
