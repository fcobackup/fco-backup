This page has information on travelling to Belarus.
This page reflects the UK government’s understanding of current rules for people travelling on a full ‘British Citizen’ passport from the UK, for the most common types of travel.
The authorities in Belarus set and enforce entry rules. If you’re unsure how Belarus’s entry requirements apply to you, contact its UK embassy, high commission or consulate.
Travel from / to Ukraine
The UK is advising against all travel to Ukraine. If you have travelled into Belarus from Ukraine and are in need of assistance you should contact +375 17 229 8200 or, send an enquiry via the web contact form.
Travel from / to Russia
The UK is advising against all travel to Russia. If you have travelled into Belarus from Russia and are in need of assistance you should contact +375 17 229 8200.
The Russian government has informed the UK government that there are no legal grounds for foreigners (including British nationals) to cross the Russia-Belarus state border. If you’re planning on entering Russia by road, you’ll need to take an alternative route through a different country.
If you’re planning on travelling by rail, you should contact your train or tour operator to seek their advice. You should also consider contacting your nearest Russian Embassy for advice on the latest situation for rail travellers.
The UK Government isn’t aware of any difficulties for British nationals when travelling by air between the 2 countries, however, you should ensure that you receive an exit stamp in your passport when you leave the Republic of Belarus. If you don’t you will be denied entry on your next visit. Make sure you have all the necessary visas for the duration of your travel to Russia. You can find more information on the Russian Embassy website. Events involving Russia are fast moving and you are strongly advised to check the Russia travel advice, which advises against all travel to Russia.
All travellers
There are no COVID-19 related travel restrictions for Belarus.
There are no restrictions for British passport holders to enter and leave Belarus, including through a land border, with exception of the Russia /Belarus state border (see above). Please note, if you are travelling from Belarus to Poland by bus, you may be refused boarding, because of bus companies’ internal policies, which refer to entry restrictions introduced by the Polish authorities for third country nationals. If you plan to enter or exit Belarus by land, check the travel advice of the relevant neighbouring country, as coronavirus-related restrictions may be put in place at short notice.
Some flights continue to operate out of Minsk and regional airports, although at present there are no direct flights to destinations in western Europe. See the ‘Safety and security’ page for the latest flight information, including the suspension of the operating permit of Belarusian airline Belavia to fly between the UK and Belarus, meaning there are no longer any direct flights from Belarus to the UK.
You’ll need to have valid medical insurance before travelling to Belarus. You’ll be asked to provide proof of your insurance when you apply for your visa or on arrival at Minsk, Brest, Vitebsk, Gomel, Grodno and Mogilev airports under the 30 day visa-free regime. Contact the Embassy of the Republic of Belarus for full details of what’s required.
COVID-19
All COVID restrictions for international travellers entering Belarus have been lifted. There is no longer a mandatory requirement to provide proof of vaccination or a negative PCR test result to enter the country, regardless of your COVID-19 vaccination status.
Check your passport and travel documents before you travel
Check with your travel provider to make sure your passport and other travel documents meet their requirements.
Passport validity
If you are visiting Belarus, your passport should be valid for 3 months from the date you arrive.
Visas
All British national passport holders (except those entering on a diplomatic or official passport) arriving by air can enter Belarus for a maximum of 30 days without a visa (the day you arrive counts as day one, regardless of arrival time).
In October 2021, entry and exit under the 30-day visa free regime was extended to allow British nationals to arrive and depart from Brest, Vitebsk, Gomel, Grodno and Mogilev airports in addition to Minsk National Airport. On arrival, you’ll need to show documentary evidence of medical insurance to the value of 10,000 euros and funds equivalent to 25 euros per day. This can be in the form of cash, credit card or travellers cheques in any currency.
You should be aware that if you are travelling immediately from or to Russia this visa-free arrangement doesn’t apply and you’ll need a visa. You can find more information at the website of the Belarus embassy.
If you wish to stay longer than 30 days, or plan to enter on a diplomatic or official passport, you’ll need a visa.
You don’t need a visa to transit Belarus by air, but the maximum period you can transit and remain airside is 24 hours. You must get a transit visa in all other circumstances including if you are travelling by train on any regional rail routes, should these be open for travel.
If you attempt to transit Belarus in other circumstances without a visa, the border authorities will send you to Minsk to obtain the appropriate visa. You may also have to pay a fine of up to $300 and face deportation. The Belarus Embassy in London may offer more information.
Since January 2018, it’s possible to visit the areas of Avgustov Canal, Belovezhskaya Pushcha, Brest or Grodno and some other areas in Brest and Grodno regions for short periods without a visa. More information can be found on the Grodno website. This must be done through a registered tour operator and through assigned border checkpoints. The areas can’t be visited on an independent basis and you aren’t permitted to leave these zones and travel to other cities or regions. Failure to follow these rules could result in a fine and you could face deportation.
The rules and requirements connected to the 30-day visa free regime via Minsk National Airport and the regional airports listed are separate from the 15-day visa free regime in Grodno and Brest. Make sure you check with the nearest Embassy of Belarus before you travel.
If you intend to work as a journalist in Belarus, it is vital you receive accreditation from the Ministry of Foreign Affairs of Belarus before you travel.
UK Emergency Travel Documents
UK Emergency Travel Documents (ETDs) are valid for exiting, entering and transiting through Belarus. If you travelled into Belarus with a valid Belarusian visa and are leaving on an ETD, you will need an Exit Visa. You can get this from the local Immigration Offices (OVIR), and it may take up to 3 working days. However, you do not need an Exit Visa if you are travelling on the visa free regime. If your destination is not the UK, you will need proof of residency for your destination country. An emergency travel document does not grant you entry. You are responsible for checking you have the correct documents to enter the country.
Registration
Anyone staying for more than 10 days in Belarus must register. You can register online or with the local police office (OVIR) in the district in which you’re staying. Registration will normally be arranged by your hotel. If you’re not staying in a hotel, registration must be organised by your host. There are fines for not registering in time. If you arrive at the weekend, the earliest you will be able to register is Monday (but offices are only open until 1pm).
Declaration of currency or goods
If you are carrying more than $10,000 in cash or travellers cheques you must complete a currency and goods declaration form on entering and exiting Belarus. This must be stamped by a Customs Officer. Upon exit from Belarus you will not be allowed to take out more currency than you originally declared on the currency declaration form upon entry. You should keep these forms for the duration of your visit. When leaving Belarus you will have to complete a new form, but you should also have the original form to hand. If you do not, your journey may be delayed and you may be fined.
Travelling with children
Children under 16, whose parent or parents hold a Belarusian passport and who aren’t themselves Belarusian passport holders, must have a Belarusian Embassy or Consulate issued travel certificate to travel to Belarus. This is regardless of where they were born or any other nationality they may have. Parents of children entering on this document should liaise with the Belarusian authorities to ensure their children also have the relevant documentation to exit Belarus.
