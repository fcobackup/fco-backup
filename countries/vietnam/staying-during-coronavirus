Coronavirus guidance is being updated.
Read the Prime Minister’s statement for the latest information.

This page gives you guidance on how to stay safely in Vietnam as a visitor, if you are unable to return to the UK.
Everyone should comply with the measures put in place in Vietnam to limit the spread of coronavirus (COVID-19).
Moving around in Vietnam
Local measures
Life has returned to normal in Vietnam albeit with enhanced public awareness on hygiene to combat the spread of illnesses. The wearing of masks is no longer compulsory in all public settings. They are required / expected in some hospitals and on public transport.
You should be alert to local variations in implementation of social distancing, take a precautionary approach and be ready to comply with local authorities.
Quarantine and testing
Widespread quarantine requirements are in place for anyone allowed to enter the country and anyone in country who may have come in to contact with coronavirus. Vietnamese quarantine centres are basic. Most do not meet Public Health England standards.
In principle there are provisions for people who are exceptionally allowed to enter the country for work to be allowed to undertake quarantine in a hotel approved by the Ministry of Health. However this is not guaranteed, is time consuming and must be arranged by your employer in Vietnam before you enter Vietnam.
The Vietnamese government has confirmed that it will cover quarantine costs in government centres. You will be responsible for paying for any coronavirus hospital treatment costs, and hotel costs from periods of self-isolation.
Vietnam’s quarantine requirements are mandated by the Vietnamese Ministry of Health. The British Embassy and Consulate General are unable to intervene in having these requirements waived, shortened or changed or assist in the reservation of, or transfer to, hotels used for quarantine. Violations carry strict penalties. Should you have any reservations about undertaking quarantine in Vietnam, if required for health or other reasons, you are strongly advised to return to the UK as soon as possible.
Quarantine lasts a minimum of 14 days and could be longer if you test positive at any point. If you test positive, you will be treated in a Vietnamese hospital. Following discharge you will be expected to undertake a period of self-isolation. You should expect to be tested at least 5 times prior to release, and will be required to produce 3 consecutive negative tests during quarantine and a further two consecutive negative tests during self-isolation.
Once you have completed quarantine and self-isolation you should receive a document specifying this. You should keep this, as you may need to present it customs/airport officials when you leave Vietnam.
Vietnam uses community testing as a means to provide assurance that COVID-19 is not being transmitted undetected. Should you be asked to undertake testing, you should comply. Failure to comply can be an offence with significant punishments.

Finance
There is a range of financial support from the government that you can access while you are unable to return due to coronavirus restrictions.
If you’re in Vietnam, and have exhausted all other options to cover essential living costs while you wait to return home, you could apply for an emergency loan for your living costs from the UK government. You can only apply if you normally live in the UK and you cannot return home. This last-resort option is for those most in need, and you would need to repay the loan when you are back in the UK. Apply for an emergency loan.

If you need urgent consular assistance, contact your nearest British embassy, high commission or consulate. All telephone numbers are available 24/7.
