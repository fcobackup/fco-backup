Flights in and out of the country have been suspended, and land and sea borders are closed. The Government of Jordan has confirmed that these measures will remain in place until 14 June, and there are strong indications that the flight suspension and border closures will continue beyond this date.
Future travel options
All airports in Jordan remain closed for scheduled international flights. However, there is a repatriation flight, operated by Royal Jordanian, to collect Jordanian nationals from Qatar that has seats available on the outward leg. This flight, from Amman to Doha, departs on Thursday 11 June at 1330. Passengers wishing to take these flights should contact Royal Jordanian directly to book their flight to Doha and then book onward travel from Doha to the UK with Qatar Airways direct. Onward travel must be arranged prior to departure to Doha. These flights are operated on a commercial basis.
Passengers will need to make their own arrangements for transfer to Queen Alia International Airport. If stopped at checkpoints they should show their passport and flight tickets.

If you cannot leave Jordan at this time, see advice on staying in Jordan during coronavirus.
You will need to pay for your return travel to the UK. If departure options are available but you cannot afford the travel costs and have exhausted all other options for getting funds, you may be eligible to apply for an emergency loan from the government. This is a last resort option and you would need to repay the loan when you are back in the UK.
Your journey home: re-entering the UK
When you return, you must follow the rules for entering the UK. You:
need to provide your journey and contact details up to 48 hours before you’re due to arrive in the UK
are not allowed to leave the place you’re staying for the first 14 days you’re in the UK except in very limited situations (known as ‘self-isolating’)
See also the list of people who are exempt from the border rules.
The National Travel Health Network and Centre (NaTHNaC) also provides advice on how to stay safe as you travel by air.
