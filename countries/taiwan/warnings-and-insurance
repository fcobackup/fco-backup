The Foreign, Commonwealth & Development Office (FCDO) provides advice about risks of travel to help British nationals make informed decisions. Find out more about FCDO travel advice.
The UK does not recognise Taiwan as a state and has no diplomatic relations with Taiwan, so limited consular services are available to British nationals. Please refer to the British Office in Taipei for further information.
3 April earthquake
A magnitude 7.2 earthquake struck Eastern Taiwan with shocks felt all across the island including Taipei. Hualien County has been most affected, but train services have been fully restored and roads have partially re-opened. Transportation links elsewhere in Taiwan were less affected by the earthquake. Some hiking routes in Hualien and Yilan counties remain closed and on 8 April the Forestry and Nature Conservation agency  again cautioned against travel to affected mountainous areas.
See the Taroko Gorge National Park website for updates on the latest road conditions around Hualien and the Taiwan Forest Recreation website on hiking routes closures. Contact the Highway Bureau for further enquiries about road conditions, and consult the Taiwan Railway website to see the operational status of train lines. Aftershocks continue to occur and you should expect travel disruption. You should consult the Central Weather Administration website and other official sources for more information.
