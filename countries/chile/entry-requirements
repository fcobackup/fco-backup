This page has information on travelling to Chile. Check what you must do to return to the UK.
This page reflects the UK government’s understanding of current rules for people travelling on a full ‘British Citizen’ passport from the UK, for the most common types of travel.
The authorities in Chile set and enforce entry rules. The British Embassy cannot intervene on Chilean entry rules.
All travellers
All travellers should familiarise themselves with the entry rules for Chile before travel.
If you are a British passport holder visiting Chile for less than 90 days, you do not need a visa. Your passport should be valid for the proposed duration of your stay. No additional period of validity beyond this is required.
Review the entry requirements into Chile very carefully. These change depending on the COVID ‘Alert Level’ in Chile, at the time of your entry. Chile is currently in Alert Level 1.
A pre-departure test is recommended for all travellers arriving in Alert Level 1, but is not mandatory only in this alert level.
At Alert Levels 2 and 3, all travellers are required to have a negative pre-departure PCR test SARS-COV-2 (rapid and antigen tests are not accepted), taken no more than 72 hours before boarding the final flight into Santiago. Children under 2 years old do not need to meet this requirement.
Non-resident foreigners are recommended to have a valid Mobility Pass (‘Pase de movilidad’). This is only optional in the lowest alert level (Alert Level 1) but is mandatory for entry in Alert levels 2 and 3.You must validate your vaccination in order to obtain a validMobility Pass with Chilean authorities. To apply for a Mobility Pass visit ‘MeVacuno website’. Foreign visitors can create an account with an email address to access the site. You should allow at least 30 days for your Mobility Pass application to be processed. After registering your vaccines, and once approved, a mobility pass document with a QR code will be issued. A Mobility Pass will be requested by Chilean authorities or travel companies when travelling between regions in trips of more than 200 kilometres. An alternative to this requirement for interregional trips will be a negative PCR test result taken in Chile no more than 48 hours before the interregional trip. This alternative will only apply to people that do not have a Mobility Pass and will not apply to people who have had their Mobility Pass disabled. Children under 6 years old who have not been able to access a vaccination program do not need to meet this requirement
Non-resident foreigners need to hold proof of travel insurance covering a minimum of $30,000 USD for COVID-related issues for the entire duration of your stay
All travellers need to complete an affidavit (Declaración Jurada) up to 48 hours before boarding. This will generate a QR-code document (sent by e-mail), which you must show to the airline when checking-in and during the health screening process on arrival in Chile.. The health authorities will provide the detail of this process by email following the health screening.
Upon arrival, you should follow the instructions of airport authorities regarding testing requirements. You might need to undergo an antigen or PCR test SARS-COV-2, either in the airport or at an external laboratory outside the airport. If the latter, you will need to do this within 24 hours of arrival. If you undergo an antigen test, you will need to wait for the results in the airport. If the result is positive, non-resident foreigners will be denied entry into the country.
Non-resident foreign nationals with two vaccinations will be entitled to a Mobility Pass valid for 30 days and those with a booster shot will be entitled to 90 days.
Please bear in mind that you will be required to show your Mobility Pass to enter many private and public places in Chile.
More information about what you need to do when you enter Chile can be found here, selecting ‘Plan Fronteras Protegidas’.
Proof of vaccination status
Chile will accept the UK’s proof of COVID-19 recovery and vaccination record and proof of COVID-19 vaccination issued in the Crown Dependencies.Your NHS appointment card from vaccination centres is not designed to be used as proof of vaccination and should not be used to demonstrate your vaccine status.
The UK’s proof of COVID-19 recovery and vaccination record will not suffice to demonstrate your vaccination status when entering Chile.
You must validate your vaccination status with Chilean authorities to receive a Mobility Pass. To apply for a Mobility Pass visit ‘MeVacuno website’. Foreign visitors can create an account with an email to access the site.
If you’ve had COVID-19 in the past month
If you test positive for COVID-19 a month preceding your boarding to Chile, and if 72 hours prior to boarding, you continue to test positive, you can replace the negative PCR result by showing Chilean authorities the two positive PCR test results. One of the positive PCR tests must have been taken up to 72 hours prior to boarding, the other positive PCR test must have been taken more than 10 days prior to the date of boarding but less than one month before boarding.
Children and young people
If you travel with children under 18 years old you must review the documents you will need to show upon entry on the Chilean Ministry of Foreign Affairs website.
Children under 6 years old
All children under 6 years old (including non-resident foreigners) are allowed to enter Chile without a mobility pass carrying:
a negative PCR test SARS-COV-2 (rapid and antigen tests are not acceptable), taken no more than 72 hours before boarding the final flight into Santiago. Children under 2 years old do not need to meet this requirement
complete an affidavit (Declaración Jurada) up to 48 hours before boarding. This will generate a QR-code document (sent by e-mail), which you must show to the airline in check-in and during the health screening process on arrival in Chile. Health authorities at Santiago Airport will request all travellers complete a daily ‘self-report’ – for 7 days – via an online form or ‘C19 AutoReporte’ application. The health authorities will provide the detail of this process by email following the health screening.
If you’re transiting through Chile
Transiting through Chile on your way to another country without exiting the airport premises and without transiting to a domestic flight is permitted. Nevertheless, if you wish to exit the airport or if your transit comprises flying to another city within Chile, Chilean authorities will require you to meet all the current entry requirements.
A Mobility Pass will be requested by Chilean authorities or travel companies when travelling between regions in trips of more than 200 kilometres. An alternative to this requirement for interregional trips will be a negative PCR test result taken in Chile no more than 48 hours before the trip. This alternative will only apply to people that do not have a Mobility Pass and will not apply to people who have had their Mobility Pass disabled.
Check your passport and travel documents before you travel
Passport validity
Your passport should be valid for the proposed duration of your stay. No additional period of validity beyond this is required.

Visas

On arrival in Chile the immigration authorities will issue you with a ‘Tarjeta de Turismo - Tourist Card’, an A5 sized white form. You must keep this document on a safe place and present it to immigration when you leave the country. If you lose it, you should request a copy of the Tourist card on the PDI website choosing the option ‘Duplicado de Tarjeta de Turismo’, at the nearest PDI office or at the office at Santiago airport.
Please note that the official website for digital procedures for Chilean immigration is in the process of being changed as a result of the approval of the Regulation of Law No. 21.325 (‘El portal oficial de trámites digitales del Servicio de Migraciones se encuentra en proceso de cambio producto de la aprobación del Reglamento de la Ley N° 21.325’.) This change is likely to affect any visa extension or ‘Prorroga de Turismo’.
