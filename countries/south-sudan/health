Warning
FCDO advises against all travel to South Sudan.

Before you travel check that:
your destination can provide the healthcare you may need
you have appropriate travel insurance for local treatment or unexpected medical evacuation
This is particularly important if you have a health condition or are pregnant.
Emergency medical number
South Sudan does not have an emergency medical public phone number. There are limited private ambulance services, but you will have to register with a private clinic first.        
Contact your insurance company quickly if you’re referred to a medical facility for treatment.
Vaccine recommendations and health risks
At least 8 weeks before your trip:
check the latest vaccination recommendations for South Sudan
see where to get vaccines and whether you have to pay on the NHS travel vaccinations page
See what health risks you’ll face in South Sudan, including:
cholera
yellow fever
Altitude sickness is a risk in Eastern Equatoria near the border with Uganda, where there are mountains of over 3,000 metres. Read more about altitude sickness on TravelHealthPro.
Medication
The legal status and regulation of some medicines prescribed or bought in the UK can be different in other countries.
Read best practice when travelling with medicines on TravelHealthPro.
Healthcare in South Sudan
Health facilities are extremely limited throughout South Sudan. Many medical issues require medical evacuation to neighbouring hubs (Nairobi, Kenya, and Kampala, Uganda, are the most common). During the rainy season, flights are often forced to remain on the ground for hours. Make sure you have adequate travel health insurance and accessible funds to cover the cost of any treatment abroad, medical evacuation and repatriation.
FCDO has a list of medical providers in South Sudan where some staff will speak English.
