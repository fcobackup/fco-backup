Warning
FCDO advises against all travel to parts of Venezuela.

Before you travel check that:
your destination can provide the healthcare you may need
you have appropriate travel insurance for local treatment or unexpected medical evacuation
This is particularly important if you have a pre-existing health condition or are pregnant.
Emergency medical number
Call 911 and ask for an ambulance.
Nationwide ambulance services like AeroAm (in Spanish) can help you get back to Caracas or other major cities if you’re in an accident.
Contact your insurance company quickly if you’re referred to a medical facility for treatment.

At least 8 weeks before your trip:

Healthcare facilities in Venezuela
Medical facilities in Venezuela vary widely in quality. In large cities, private clinics provide acceptable care for routine treatments but are vulnerable to acute shortages of medical supplies and medicines. More complex treatments may require evacuation. Make sure you have adequate travel health insurance and accessible funds to cover the cost of any medical treatment abroad and repatriation.
Public health facilities are poor, with frequent shortages of medicines and funding. Ambulance services in remote areas are unreliable and hospitals often lack adequate medical supplies and equipment.
