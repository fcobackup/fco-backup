Cases of coronavirus (COVID-19) have been confirmed in The Bahamas. The Bahamian authorities have introduced a number of measures to limit the spread of the virus, including entry restrictions.
On 17 March 2020, the Governor General declared a state of public emergency in The Bahamas. On 23 March 2020, the Prime Minister of the Bahamas announced further emergency measures to combat the spread of COVID-19 see full measures. On 6 April the state of public emergency was extended until 30 April. A 24 hour curfew limiting movement and shopping is in place every day with a total lockdown (with all stores closed and no travel allowed) over the Easter weekend from 8 – 14 April; and lock downs every weekend in April (17-20 and 24-27 April). The last commercial flight to Europe was on 22 March; an end to all commercial departures seems imminent; and future flights are not guaranteed. See Return to the UK
Local measures
Emergency measures are in place including a national 24 hour curfew from Monday to Friday until 30 April. Many businesses have closed, but those that provide essential services (including grocery stores) continue with restricted hours and a rota system on New Providence for who is allowed to shop on which day. Additionally there are periods of total lock down at weekends during April (with all stores closed and a ban on movement for non-essential personnel) with extended lock down to cover the Easter weekend - 9pm on 8 April until 5am on 14 April. Doctor’s offices, hospitals and medical facilities remain open. Many hotels have closed.
The Bahamas have closed all airports and ports to incoming flights and vessels (including domestic inter-island travel). Outbound flights are allowed but are severely disrupted. No direct flights to Europe have been possible since 22 March due to previously announced restrictions. Several airlines and hotels have announced they will not operate throughout April. The last commercial international flight departures are expected imminently and future flights are not guaranteed. These restrictions also extend to maritime traffic; private vessels; and cruise ships which are not allowed to disembark passengers or crew. They will also not be allowed to restock or refuel during lock down periods.
Travellers should contact their airlines, travel agents and tour operators. For information on how to return to the UK from The Bahamas, see Return to the UK.
