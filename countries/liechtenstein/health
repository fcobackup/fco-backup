Visit your health professional at least 4 to 6 weeks before your trip to check whether you need any vaccinations or other preventive measures. Country specific information and advice is published by the National Travel Health Network and Centre on the TravelHealthPro website and by NHS (Scotland) on the fitfortravel website. Useful information and advice about healthcare abroad is also available on the NHS Choices website.
If you’re visiting Liechtenstein you should get a free European Health Insurance Card (EHIC) before leaving the UK. The EHIC isn’t a substitute for medical and travel insurance, but it entitles you to state provided medical treatment that may become necessary during your trip. Any treatment provided is on the same terms as Liechtenstein nationals. If you don’t have your EHIC with you or you’ve lost it, you can call the Department of Health Overseas Healthcare Team (+44 191 218 1999) to get a Provisional Replacement Certificate. The EHIC won’t cover medical repatriation, ongoing medical treatment or non-urgent treatment, so you should make sure you have adequate travel insurance and accessible funds to cover the cost of any medical treatment and repatriation.
An agreement between the EU and Liechtenstein came into force on 1 June 2002. If you are a national of the UK or any other EU country, a Liechtenstein national, a stateless person or refugee and you live in the UK, you can use the EHIC to get reduced cost immediately necessary healthcare when visiting Liechtenstein. Your dependent family members and survivors are also covered, regardless of their nationality.
If you claim treatment under the EHIC scheme in Liechtenstein you should only be charged the proportion of your healthcare costs for which you remain responsible. Liechtenstein has one hospital, the Liechtensteinisches Landesspital, in Vaduz. The Amt fur Gesundheit (National Office of Health) generally needs to approve your admission, except for emergency treatment. For more serious conditions, patients may need to be referred to a nearby hospital in Switzerland.
