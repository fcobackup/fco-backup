Most visits to Guyana are trouble-free.
Crime levels are high. You should take sensible precautions to protect yourself and your belongings.
Following elections on 2 March 2020, sporadic outbreaks of violence have occurred across the capital and eastern parts of Guyana. The political situation remains uncertain and you are advised to be careful when travelling around the country and avoid large crowds and demonstrations.
If possible, avoid travel to and from Georgetown Cheddi Jagan international airport late at night and before dawn.

Always drive with windows closed and doors locked. See Crime
