Warning
FCDO advises against all but essential travel to parts of Mexico.

This guide also has safety advice for regions of Mexico.
Terrorism
There is a high threat of terrorist attack globally affecting UK interests and British nationals, including from groups and individuals who view the UK and British nationals as targets. Stay aware of your surroundings at all times.  
UK Counter Terrorism Policing has information and advice on staying safe abroad and what to do in the event of a terrorist attack. Find out how to reduce your risk from terrorism while abroad.
Terrorism in Mexico
Terrorist attacks in Mexico cannot be ruled out.
Political situation
Political demonstrations are common in Mexico City and can happen across the country. Demonstrations can be tense, confrontational and potentially violent. Onlookers can be quickly drawn in.
It is illegal for foreign nationals to participate in political activities in Mexico. If you join demonstrations, the Mexican authorities may detain and deport you.
Monitor local media and avoid all demonstrations. If you come across protests, move away from the area.
Crime
Crime is a risk to foreign nationals in Mexico, particularly in major cities and tourist resort areas. Street crime is a serious issue in these places.
Many Mexican and foreign businesses choose to hire private security. You should:
research your destination thoroughly
only travel during daylight hours when possible
monitor local media
tell trusted contacts your travel plans
If you want to report a crime, do so immediately at the nearest branch of the state prosecutor’s office (‘Agencia del Ministerio Público’). A criminal investigation is not possible without a formal complaint to the Mexican authorities. You must make a complaint in person before you leave Mexico.
The Mexico City Command and Control Centre (‘Centro de Atención a Emergencias y Protección Ciudadana de la Ciudad de México’) has information and advice on safety in Mexico City in Spanish.
Using ATMs
Take care withdrawing money from ATMs or using exchange offices (bureau de change). Criminals have targeted people using these services. It’s generally safer to use ATMs during daylight hours inside shops or malls. Avoid withdrawing large amounts and watch who is around you while you are at an ATM.
Protecting your belongings
Pickpocketing and theft are common, including on public transport. You should:
avoid wearing expensive-looking clothing, jewellery or watches
limit the amount of cash or credit and debit cards you carry
watch your luggage, even in apparently secure places like the lobby of your hotel
Scams
Be wary of criminals posing as police officers and trying to fine or arrest you for no reason. They have targeted travellers driving rental cars.
Some genuine police officers have extorted money from tourists for alleged minor offences or traffic violations. If this happens:
do not hand over money or your passport
ask for a copy of the fine, which is payable later
ask for ID
try to note the officer’s name, badge number and patrol car number
Criminals may try to get your friends or relatives to transfer money to Mexico. This can happen if your phone is stolen or hacked. Before you travel, agree how you will contact friends or relatives and how you would arrange to transfer money.
A common phone scam involves criminals posing as a kidnapped family member or employee and demanding money for their release. They may also claim a relative is being detained. If you are threatened over the phone, hang up and check on your family member or employee’s safety.
Drink and food spiking
Do not leave food and drinks unattended in bars and restaurants. Criminals have robbed or assaulted travellers after drugging them.
Tainted alcohol
Tainted alcohol has caused illness or blackouts. If you have any concerns, get advice from your tour operator or the local authorities.
Sexual assault
Sexual offences have been reported in tourist areas. Take care even in areas close to hotels, and especially after dark.
Kidnapping
Kidnapping is more common in some areas of Mexico than others. See Regional risks for areas of higher risk. While tourists are not usually targeted, you should always remain aware of your surroundings.
Short-term opportunistic kidnapping (called ‘express kidnapping’) can happen, particularly in urban areas. Kidnappers force victims to withdraw money at an ATM to secure their release.
Longer-term kidnapping for financial gain also happens, and there have been allegations of police involvement. You should always remain alert and avoid travelling in higher risk areas, especially at night. Be discreet about discussing your financial or business affairs in places where others may overhear you.
Violence
Drug-related violence in Mexico has increased over recent years. Do not become involved with drugs of any kind.      
Some areas of Mexico have a high crime rate due to fighting between rival organised crime gangs. In these areas, there is a risk of being caught in the crossfire or of being mistaken for a gang member. While risks are lower in tourist areas, you should:
take advice from local authorities or your hotel
be aware of your surroundings at all times
use reputable tourism or transport companies
travel during the daytime where possible
Vehicle crime
Stay away from isolated roads and use toll roads (‘cuotas’) whenever possible. Keep car doors locked and windows closed, especially at traffic lights.
Violent carjackings and robberies happen along the Pacific Highway. If you suspect someone is following or watching you, drive to a police station or another safe place. Criminals have targeted large camper vans and sports utility vehicles (SUVs).
Criminals can deliberately cause traffic accidents to make insurance claims or get cash from the other party. They sometimes threaten violence or intimidation. Contact the authorities for support if necessary.
If you are involved in a carjacking, stay calm and surrender your valuables and your vehicle if asked. Resisting demands for your belongings can put you at significant risk of harm.
Roadblocks
In remote areas, you may come across unofficial roadblocks, including on main roads. Local groups seeking money for an unofficial toll control these roadblocks. They can become violent and deny entry.
Unlicensed taxis
Unlicensed taxi drivers have robbed and assaulted passengers, including in Mexico City. Use the better regulated ‘sitio’ taxis from authorised taxi ranks or ask your hotel to order you a taxi. At airports, only use authorised pre-paid airport taxi services.
Licensed taxi drivers protesting about Uber have blocked roads near Cancun’s hotels. The protesters have pulled tourists from Uber taxis. Tourists have also missed flights due to roadblocks. Protests can happen without notice. Look for local announcements and follow your hotel’s advice on how to avoid protests.
Public transport
Be alert on public transport, at airports and in bus stations. Theft on buses is common, so keep your belongings safe.
There is a risk of bus hijacking. Try to travel on first-class buses using toll roads, which have a lower rate of incidents than second and third-class buses travelling on the less secure free (‘libre’) roads. Most first-class bus companies perform security checks when passengers board the bus.
Women travelling alone on public transport have been harassed, robbed and sexually assaulted.
Cancun and other tourist destinations
The Mexican government makes efforts to protect major tourist destinations, including:
Cancun
Tulum
Cozumel
Los Cabos
Nuevo Vallarta
Playa del Carmen
Puerto Vallarta
Criminals have physically and sexually assaulted British travellers in these locations. In some cases, hotel employees, taxi drivers and security personnel were involved. Hotel staff have sometimes been unhelpful and tried to convince victims not to contact police.
Rival criminal gangs have clashed in popular Cancun tourist destinations and surrounding areas. Gangs have not targeted tourists, but violent incidents could affect anyone nearby. Since 2021, several shootings have affected tourists.
Be very cautious after dark in downtown areas of Cancun, Tulum and Playa del Carmen. Stay in well-lit pedestrian streets and tourist zones. Follow advice from the local authorities and your tour operator.
Laws and cultural differences
For information on procedures, local laws or social services, you can contact Mexico City’s public telephone service LOCATEL on 5658 1111 (English-speaking staff available).
Personal ID
The Mexican authorities can ask to see your passport and entry stamp to prove your entrance and stay. They do not accept copies or photos. To prove your visa status, you can get a digital registry of your entry documents from the Portal de Servicios INM (in Spanish). If you cannot show the correct documents, immigration officers may question and detain you while they check your immigration status. Depending on the outcome, they can deport you.
If you are a resident, the police may ask to see your Mexican residency card. They have detained British people for not having the correct documents.
Smoking and e-cigarette bans
It is illegal to bring e-cigarettes, vaping devices and solutions into Mexico or to buy and sell them. Customs officials will confiscate these items; and they could fine or detain you.
If you smoke or vape in a public place, you can get a fine of up to 3,000 Mexican pesos (about £150).
Illegal drugs and prison sentences
Do not become involved with drugs of any kind. Penalties for drug offences are severe and convictions carry sentences of up to 25 years.
LGBT+ travellers
Same-sex relations in Mexico are generally tolerated, rather than accepted. Civil unions between same-sex partners are legal in Mexico. People may frown on same-sex couples showing affection in public. Read more advice for LGBT+ travellers.
Surrogacy in Mexico
Only some Mexican states legally recognise assisted human reproduction, including surrogacy. Before you consider a surrogacy arrangement in Mexico, make sure you:
learn and follow the relevant laws and regulations
meet all legal requirements to take the child out of Mexico
get independent legal advice
For more information, see surrogacy overseas.
Hotel balconies
In some hotels, balcony railings are low and there is a risk of falling.
Outdoor activities and adventure tourism
Adventure sports
If you take part in adventure sports, including paragliding, skydiving, scuba diving and jet-skiing, be aware equipment may not meet UK safety and insurance standards. British nationals participating in these activities have been injured and, in some cases, killed. Check your travel insurance covers you for all your planned activities.
Make sure the company you use:
is reputable
takes safety precautions
uses up-to-date equipment
is fully licensed and insured
Swimming safety
Sea conditions can be unpredictable, and some beaches are unpatrolled. Follow coastguard and local authority guidance on whether it is safe to swim.
See water safety on holiday from the Royal Life Saving Society. 
Sharks and crocodiles
Shark attacks are rare in Mexico, but you should take care, particularly when surfing. Research the area and follow local advice.
Crocodiles normally live in lagoons and coastal areas in Mexico, including Cancun and Pacific coast resorts. Respect warning signs around lagoons in these areas and do not walk close to the water. Crocodiles have attacked and seriously injured tourists in the past.
Transport risks
Road travel
If you are planning to drive in Mexico, see information on driving abroad.
You can use a UK photocard driving licence to drive in Mexico. If you still have a paper driving licence, you may need to update it to a photocard licence or get the 1926 version of the international driving permit (IDP) as well.
Driving standards
Driving standards are very different from the UK. Roads can have potholes, and conditions can be unpredictable. Be prepared to stop unexpectedly and beware of vehicles moving slowly, changing lane without indicating and going through red lights. Many drivers do not have car insurance.
Driving restrictions
To reduce pollution, the authorities ban cars entering parts of Mexico City and other places on some days of the week, based on their number plates. For details, check the Hoy no Circula programme (in Spanish).
The authorities strictly enforce these regulations. Offenders face heavy fines and temporary confiscation of their vehicle. Check with your car hire company to see if these rules apply to you.
In Mexico City, vehicles without registration plates from the State of Mexico (‘Estado de Mexico’) or Mexico City are not allowed to enter Mexico City from:
Monday to Friday, 5am to 11am
Saturday, 5am to 10pm
There may be further driving restrictions if air pollution is high, generally from February to June.
Extreme weather and natural disasters
Find out what you can do to prepare for and respond to extreme weather and natural hazards.
Hurricanes
The hurricane season in Mexico normally runs from June to November and can affect the Pacific and Atlantic coasts. Tropical storms and hurricanes cause floods, landslides and disruption to local services, including transport networks. After a hurricane there can still be continued flooding, high winds and rainfall.
Monitor local and international weather updates from the US National Hurricane Center and follow the advice of local authorities and your tour operator, including evacuation orders.
In 2023, Hurricane Otis hit the south coast near Acapulco. This Category 5 hurricane seriously damaged infrastructure along the coast, in Acapulco and between Zihuatenejo and Punta Maldonado. Reconstruction efforts continue to disrupt tourism, and the security situation is unpredictable. FCDO advises against all but essential travel to the city of Acapulco.
Earthquakes
There is a risk of earthquakes in most parts of Mexico. Tremors happen regularly, particularly in the states of Oaxaca and Guerrero.
The US Federal Emergency Management Agency has advice about what to do before, during and after an earthquake or tsunami. There is also advice from the Mexican Ministry of Civil Protection (PDF) (in Spanish).
If you’re in Mexico City, you can download the 911 CDMX app on iOS or Android (accessible only by local phone numbers), which can warn you 60 seconds before earthquake movement starts. Although useful, this app cannot warn you about all types of earthquake.
Volcanic eruptions
The volcanoes Popocatépetl and Colima are active and closed to the public. The danger zones around both volcanoes change depending on the current level of activity.
There is currently a 7-mile (12km) exclusion zone around Popocatépetl and the alert level is level 2 of the amber tier.
Ash fall from Popocatépetl has previously disrupted air travel and caused flight cancellations at Benito Juarez International Airport in Mexico City. Check your flight status with your airline or operator. You can also follow Benito Juárez airport on Twitter.
Falling volcanic ash and toxic fumes can affect your health, especially if you suffer from a respiratory condition.
The Mexican Disaster Prevention Centre has updates on Popocatepetl, Colima and other volcanoes. There is also Mexican government information on Twitter.
