This page gives you guidance on how to stay safely in Greece as a visitor, if you are unable to return to the UK.
Everyone should comply with the measures put in place in Greece to limit the spread of coronavirus (COVID-19).
You can read the Greek authorities’ plans for future changes here (in Greek). These plans remain subject to change, and you should monitor the website regularly for updates.
Shops, bars and restaurants are open, as are other service providers like driving schools and private tuition centres (‘frontisteria’). Relevant public health regulations apply when visiting shops, bars, restaurants and other public spaces, including limits on the number of customers per square metre. You should comply with these requirements, and all other advice of the Greek authorities.
Universities are closed; but schools and nurseries are open.
Moving around in Greece
For information on entering Greece, see Entry Requirements
It is mandatory to wear facemasks on public transport (including flights and ferries), at airports, in taxis, in all medical facilities and in lifts. The use of facemasks is strongly recommended in other closed spaces.
Travel in a private car or a taxi is limited to a maximum of 2 adult passengers per vehicle, in addition to the driver. Any children in the vehicle do not count towards this limit. When travelling in a taxi, all passengers must wear facemasks.
Travel to and from islands
You may travel throughout Greece, including to the islands.
If you are travelling via ferry, you will need to complete a health questionnaire and hand it to the ferry operator before boarding. The necessary forms will be provided by the operator: you should contact them directly if you need further information. Temperature checks may also be carried out before boarding; and it is obligatory to wear masks on all ferries, whose capacity is limited to allow for social distancing.
If you are travelling by internal (domestic) flights, you are also required to wear masks throughout the journey. Specific measures relating to check-in, baggage allowances and other details are in place to reduce the spread of coronavirus. You should check with your operator directly for further detail.
Cruise ships and ferries coming from other countries are banned from landing in Greek ports.
Travel by private sailboats (and yachts) is now permitted within Greece. If your vessel is arriving in Greece from another country, you must comply with specific requirements upon your first landing in Greece. No passengers are permitted on the vessel, except for the crew. Upon arrival, you must present to harbour authorities, who will require the completion of a health declaration, and mandatory testing (to be paid for by the occupants of each vessel).
Changes to what is open or permitted, including international travel options, are subject to change and may occur at short notice. Keep up to date with the latest information and advice from your travel contact or business partners, as well as the sources in this travel advice.
Accommodation
All hotels are permitted to open. AirBnB accommodation is also available.
Health
If you think you have symptoms, including a fever or respiratory difficulties such as shortness of breath or a cough, you should avoid visiting local health facilities, but contact a doctor remotely to see whether a test is recommended.
For more information, consult the Greek National Public Health Organisation (NPHO) online or via telephone (dial 1135, or 210 521 2054, from within Greece). The NPHO can provide contact details of a doctor; their telephone line operates 24 hours a day. You should continue to follow this advice if symptoms develop after the conclusion of a 14-day period of self-isolation.

Finance
There is a range of financial support from the government that you can access while you are unable to return due to coronavirus restrictions.
If you’re in Greece, and have exhausted all other options to cover essential living costs while you wait to return home, you could apply for an emergency loan for your living costs from the UK government. You can only apply if you normally live in the UK and you cannot return home. This last-resort option is for those most in need, and you would need to repay the loan when you are back in the UK. Apply for an emergency loan.

Help and support
If you need urgent consular assistance, contact your nearest British embassy, high commission or consulate. All telephone numbers are available 24/7.
