The information on this page covers the most common types of travel and reflects the UK government’s understanding of the rules currently in place. Unless otherwise stated, this information is for travellers using a full ‘British Citizen’ passport.
The authorities in the country or territory you’re travelling to are responsible for setting and enforcing the rules for entry. If you’re unclear about any aspect of the entry requirements, or you need further reassurance, you’ll need to contact the embassy, high commission or consulate of the country or territory you’re travelling to.
You should also consider checking with your transport provider or travel company to make sure your passport and other travel documents meet their requirements.
Visas
All visitors need a tourist card to enter the Dominican Republic. You can get a tourist card before travel from the Embassy of the Dominican Republic in London, or on arrival at the airport at a cost of US$10 or equivalent. The Dominican Republic Embassy website has more information.
Tourist cards are initially valid for a 30-day stay but can be extended by paying for an extension when you leave the country. If you overstay this initial 30-day period, you’ll have to pay a surcharge when you leave the country. If you’re planning to stay for longer than 30 days, seek advice from a local lawyer or contact the local Immigration authorities.
There have been reports in February 2017 of immigration authorities making random checks on foreign visitors to establish the validity of their stay in the country. The Dominican Republic immigration rules haven’t changed, all tourists should have a valid tourist card for a 30 day stay or pay for an extension on departure if staying beyond 30 days. Make sure you’re able to provide a photocopy of your identification (such as a passport), and proof of onward or return travel if you’re asked to do so by the authorities.
Proof of onward or return travel
You may be refused entry if you don’t have proof of onward or return travel.
Passport validity
If you’re entering as a tourist your passport must be valid up to at least the date of your proposed departure from the Dominican Republic. If you’re entering the Dominican Republic for any other purpose your passport should have at least six months’ validity.
Departure tax
Departure tax is US$20.  Scheduled airlines often include this charge in the price of the ticket. Check with your tour operator or travel provider.
Travelling with children
According to the Dominican Republic authorities, visitors under 18 travelling to the Dominican Republic don’t need written authorisation from their parents as long as they enter and leave with the same person or people. If visitors between the ages of 13 and 18 are travelling alone, or in a group with no one over 18, then parental authorisation is not required as long as the group remains the same on entry and exit.
Otherwise, a visitor under the age of 18 must carry a sworn affidavit drawn up by a solicitor and signed by the child’s parents or legal guardian(s) authorising their travel. The affidavit will need to be legalised by the  Foreign and Commonwealth Office (FCO) and the Dominican Republic Embassy   
UK Emergency travel documents
UK Emergency travel documents (ETDs) are accepted for entry, transit and exit from the Dominican Republic.
