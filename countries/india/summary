Before you travel, check the ‘Entry requirements’ section for India’s current entry restrictions and requirements. These may change with little warning. Monitor this advice for the latest updates and stay in contact with your travel provider.
If you plan to pass through another country to return to the UK, check the travel advice for the country you’re transiting.
It is more important than ever to get travel insurance and check it provides sufficient cover. See the FCDO guidance on foreign travel insurance.
If you’re planning travel to India, find out what you need to know about the COVID-19 situation there in the Coronavirus section.
Typically, over one million British nationals visited India every year. Most visits are trouble-free.
Severe air pollution is a major hazard to public health, especially during the winter months (October to February). North Indian cities are most affected by extremely high levels of pollution. See Air pollution
Travel in India during the monsoon season (June to October) can be hazardous. See Monsoons.
Terrorists are very likely to carry out attacks in India. Recent attacks have targeted public places including those visited by foreigners. Media reports suggest Daesh (formerly referred to as ISIL) and other groups have an interest in attacking targets in India. There may be an increased threat to places visited by British nationals such as religious sites, markets, festival venues and beaches. You should be vigilant at this time, monitor local media and take all precautions for your safety. See Terrorism
Maoist (or Naxalite) insurgents specifically target police officers, paramilitary forces and government officials in parts of India, causing several deaths and injuries in 2019/20. The government of India has identified some districts as the worst affected. See Local travel

The Indian Ministry of Tourism has a 24 hour multi-lingual telephone helpline on toll free number 1800 111 363 providing visitors to India with information about travel and tourism.
