Maldives has very strong anti-drugs laws. Importing or possessing drugs can carry severe penalties, including life imprisonment.
Local laws reflect the fact that Maldives is an Islamic country. Serious violations of local laws may lead to a prison sentence. Public observance of any religion other than Islam is prohibited. You should respect local traditions, customs, laws and religions at all times and be aware of your actions to ensure that they don’t offend, especially during the holy month of Ramadan or if you intend to visit religious areas.

Same-sex relations are illegal and convicted offenders could face lengthy prison sentences and fines. See our information and advice page for the LGBT community before you travel.

Alcoholic drinks are only available on resort islands. Don’t take any alcohol away from a resort.
The export of tortoise shell and coral is forbidden.
Dress is generally informal but you should be sensitive to local dress standards when visiting non-resort islands. Nudism and topless sunbathing are not allowed anywhere, including on resort islands.
