Terrorism
There is a high threat of terrorist attack globally affecting UK interests and British nationals, including from groups and individuals who view the UK and British nationals as targets. Stay aware of your surroundings at all times.
UK Counter Terrorism Policing has information and advice on staying safe abroad and what to do in the event of a terrorist attack. Find out how to reduce your risk from terrorism while abroad.
Terrorism in South Korea
Although there’s no recent history of terrorism in South Korea, attacks cannot be ruled out.
Political situation
The level of tension and the security situation on the Korean Peninsula can change with little notice. Tensions can rise after missile tests by North Korea and during the regular South Korean-US military exercises, which take place throughout the year. Follow the advice of local authorities and keep up to date with developments, which will be reported on news broadcasts.
The demilitarised zone (DMZ) separates North Korea and South Korea. Peace has been maintained under an armistice agreement, but no formal peace treaty has ever been signed. If you’re in the area of the DMZ, you should exercise caution and follow the advice of the local authorities.
National service
If you are a British male of Korean origin whose name appears on the Korean family register, you may be liable for military service even if you are travelling on your British passport.
Demonstrations
Public demonstrations in South Korea are common. These gatherings are mostly peaceful and well-policed. Be aware that under Korean law, it is illegal for foreign nationals to take part in political activities when in the country.
Civil emergency exercises and advice
South Korean authorities sometimes hold civil emergency exercises. You’ll hear sirens to mark the start of the exercise. All vehicles must stop and sometimes people will have to descend into designated metro stations or basements. You do not need to participate but do follow any instructions from officials during these exercises.
Contingency planning
The government’s Emergency Ready App, available on iOS and Android, explains the possible civil emergency alerts which would be pushed to your mobile in an emergency.
As part of your own contingency planning, make sure you have easy access to your passport and other important documents such as nationality documents and birth and marriage certificates, as well as any essential medication. Consider saving the contact details for the embassy so that you can access them quickly if needed. Make sure to share your contact details with your family and friends.
Crime
Crime against foreigners is rare but there are occasional thefts. Take extra care of passports, credit cards and money in crowded areas and in areas visited by foreigners, such as Itaewon.
While most reported crimes are thefts, there have been cases of assault, including sexual assault, particularly around bars and nightlife areas. Take care when travelling alone at night and only use legitimate taxis or public transport.
Laws and cultural differences
Personal ID
It is a legal requirement to carry some form of identification, but people are rarely asked to show it.
Illegal drugs and prison sentences
If you’re convicted of possession, use or trafficking of illegal drugs you can face a long jail sentence and heavy fines. This applies even to personal use of small amounts of marijuana. British nationals have been detained solely on the basis of drug tests.
Transport risks
Road travel
If you are planning to drive in South Korea, see information on driving abroad and read the Korea Tourism Organization’s driving in Korea guidance. The guide lists driving regulations and other legal requirements you need to be aware of.
You’ll need to have both the 1949 international driving permit (IDP) and your UK driving licence with you in the car when you drive in South Korea. You cannot buy an IDP outside the UK, so get one before you travel.
The police take the position that car and motorbike drivers are at fault in accidents involving cyclists or pedestrians. If you injure someone in an accident, you are likely to face criminal charges and heavy penalties, even if guilt is not proved.
The legal limit for alcohol in South Korea is less than half the limit in England, and penalties for drink-driving include prison and fines.
Taxis
Taxi drivers tend to speak little or no English. It is helpful to have your destination written in Korean – if possible with a map.
Extreme weather and natural disasters
If there is a natural disaster, or the threat of one, the South Korean government will publish updates in Korean and English to the Natural Disaster Safety Portal.
The government’s Emergency Ready App, available on iOS and Android, explains the possible alerts which would be pushed to your mobile.
Find out what you can do to prepare for and respond to extreme weather and natural hazards.
Typhoons
The typhoon season normally runs from June to November. Monitor the progress of approaching storms with the Korea Meteorological Administration or call 131 in Korea to get an accurate weather forecast in English. Always follow any advice given by the local authorities.   
Flooding and landslides
South Korea has heavy rainfall across the country during the summer rainy season, usually in June and July. Torrential rain may cause flooding near rivers and creeks, including in built-up areas. Flash floods are common in areas downstream from large reservoirs or rivers, even after relatively short periods of intense rainfall. Landslides are possible in hilly and mountainous areas.
Monitor forecasts for heavy rainfall with the Korea Meteorological Administration and follow any advice given by the local authorities.
Earthquakes
Strong earthquakes are unusual in South Korea but do happen. Most earthquakes in South Korea are relatively weak. The Korea Meteorological Administration publishes information on earthquakes.
Read up on the any guidance from local authorities on safety procedures in an earthquake and check the safety tips from the Seoul Metropolitan Government.
