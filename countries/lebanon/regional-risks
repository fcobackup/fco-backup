Warning
FCDO advises against all travel to Lebanon.

This section has safety advice for regions of Lebanon. It only covers regions where FCDO has specific advice.
You should also read FCDO’s overall travel advice and safety and security advice.
The FCDO advises against all travel to Lebanon due to risks associated with the conflict between Israel and the Occupied Palestinian Territories.
The FCDO also advises against travel to the following areas of Lebanon for security reasons:
Palestinian refugee camps
FCDO advises against all travel to the 12 Palestinian refugee camps. See Palestinian refugee camp locations on the UN Relief and Works Agency website.
Palestinian refugee camps are volatile environments where the Lebanese state has limited capacity to impose law and order. There has been a long pattern of violent clashes in particular in Ain el Hilweh camp near Saida in southern Lebanon.
The town of Hermel
FCDO advises against all travel to the town of Hermel and the surrounding towns of Arsal, Ras Baalbek, Qaa, Laboué and Nahlé.
Extremist groups have particularly operated in the city of Tripoli, Palestinian refugee camps, and in areas close to the Syrian border, including around Hermel and Aarsal.
South of the Litani River
FCDO advises against all travel to the area south of the Litani River, which includes the main Naqoura-Tyre-Saida-Beirut highway and areas to the west of it.
There is a UN peacekeeping presence in the area south of the Litani River due to tensions between Lebanon and Israel.   
Syrian border
FCDO advises against all travel within 5km of the border with Syria due to the ongoing conflict in Syria and the fragile security near border areas. 
Akkar district 
FCDO advises against all travel to the Akkar district, including between 5km from the Syrian border and the Aabdeh, Halba and Qoubaiyat highway, due to the unstable security situation.
Area around Ain el Hilweh Palestinian refugee camp in Saida
FCDO advises against all travel within 2km of Ain el Hilweh Palestinian refugee camp in Saida, including:
the Saida section of Highway 51 and the Coastal Highway north of the Gaziyeh Road intersection
the Saida section of the Jezzine-Saida road westward of the Abboud Gas Station
Those travelling south from Beirut towards Saida along Highway 51 should turn east off the main highway at the Awali River junction before the permanent Lebanese Armed Forces (LAF) security checkpoint.
Fighting between armed groups in the Ain el Hilweh camp has intensified following a flare up on 30 July. On 7 September, a number of injuries were reported. There have been reports of rounds reaching as far as Ghaziyeh Town (2km south). As a precaution, the Lebanese Armed Forces have created a roadblock on Highway 51 in the Ghaziyeh area and redirected traffic to alternative routes. Tensions remain high and could escalate without warning. Expect road closures and check travel updates.
Rachaiya, Hasbaiya and Khiam in the Beqaa Valley
FCDO advises against all travel to: 
the towns of Rachaiya, Hasbaiya, and Khiam in the Beqaa Valley
the area between these towns up to 5km from the Syrian border
The Rayak-Baalbek highway 
FCDO advises against all but essential travel:
from the junction at Rayak along the highway to Baalbek
to the areas around the highway and towns along it, including Baalbek
to the area east of the highway up to 5km from the Syrian border and south of Nahlé town
Southern suburbs of Beirut
FCDO advises against all travel to the southern suburbs of Beirut, which includes:
the area south of the sports stadium and the Adnan Al Hakim road (which heads west from the stadium to the Beirut-Saida (Sidon) road), down to the airport
the neighbourhoods of Bir Hassan, Ghobeiry, Chiyah, Haret Hraik, Burj Al Barajneh, Mraije, Er Rouais and Laylake
Tripoli 
FCDO advises against all travel to the city of Tripoli due to the compromised security situation and counter-terrorism operations.
