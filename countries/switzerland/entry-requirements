The information on this page covers the most common types of travel and reflects the UK government’s understanding of the rules currently in place. Unless otherwise stated, this information is for travellers using a full ‘British Citizen’ passport.
The authorities in the country or territory you’re travelling to are responsible for setting and enforcing the rules for entry. If you’re unclear about any aspect of the entry requirements, or you need further reassurance, you’ll need to contact the embassy, high commission or consulate of the country or territory you’re travelling to.
You will require a valid passport or other travel document to enter Switzerland.
Entry rules in response to coronavirus (COVID-19)
Travellers from the UK are not permitted to enter Switzerland, including UK nationals. These restrictions will apply until further notice. However there are some exceptions. Further guidance is available from the State Secretariat for Migration.
Quarantine
Anyone arriving in Switzerland from the United Kingdom since 14 December, regardless of nationality, is required to self-isolate for 10 days from the date of arrival. If you have arrived in Switzerland from 14 December onward, you were required to be in quarantine in your place of residence / accommodation by midnight on 22 December at the latest, and you must notify your local Cantonal Medical Service by 12 noon on 24 December. British citizens currently in quarantine who intend to travel to the airport will need to follow protective measures to remain in quarantine; your local cantonal authorities will be able to advise on this, which may include avoiding public transport.
Travellers entering Switzerland who have visited certain countries within the past 10 days are also required to quarantine for 10 days. The full list of countries which are currently subject to quarantine on entry to Switzerland is available on the website of the Federal Office of Public Health.
Travellers who have transited countries which are subject to quarantine, for less than 24 hours are not required to quarantine on entry to Switzerland. Other exceptions are listed on the website of the Federal Office of Public Health.
Further information is available on the website of the Federal Office of Public Health.
Transit
If you are transiting Switzerland from elsewhere in the world, you are strongly advised to have your onward travel booked in advance and to have confirmed you meet the entry requirements of your destination country. You should also check the travel advice for any country that you will transit on the way back to the UK.
Further information is available on the website of the State Secretariat for Migration.
Entry into Switzerland from third countries (outside the EU/EEA and the UK)
Switzerland has lifted entry restrictions from some third countries. Further information is available on the website of the State Secretariat for Migration.

Regular entry requirements
Visas
If you hold a British Citizen passport, you don’t need a visa to enter Switzerland. If you’re planning to stay longer than 3 months, see our Living in Switzerland guide and contact the Swiss Embassy if you have further questions.
The rules on travel will stay the same until 31 December 2020.
Visas from 1 January 2021
The rules for travelling or working in Europe will change from 1 January 2021, subject to COVID-19 entry requirements:
you will be able to travel to countries in the Schengen area for up to 90 days in any 180-day period without a visa as a tourist, to visit family or friends, to attend business meetings, cultural or sports events, or for short-term studies or training.
if you are travelling to Switzerland and other Schengen countries without a visa, make sure your whole visit is within the limit. Visits to Schengen countries within the previous 180 days before you travel would count towards the 90-day limit
to stay for longer, to work or study, for business travel or for other reasons, you will need to meet the entry requirements set out by Switzerland. This could mean applying for a visa and/or work permit. You should check with the Swiss Embassy what type of visa and/or work permit, if any, you will need
if you are in Switzerland with a visa or permit, your stay will not count towards the 90-day limit
The 90-day limit for visa-free travel will begin on 1 January 2021. Any days you stay in Switzerland or other Schengen countries before 1 January 2021 will not count towards the 90-day limit.
At border control for Switzerland, you may need to:
show a return or onward ticket
show you have enough money for your stay, and
use separate lanes from EU, EEA and Swiss citizens when queueing
Your passport may be stamped on entry and exit.
Passport validity
The rules on travel will stay the same until 31 December 2020.
Your passport should be valid for the proposed duration of your stay; you do not need any additional period of validity on your passport beyond this.
Passport validity from 1 January 2021
From 1 January 2021, you must have at least 6 months left on an adult or child passport to travel to most countries in Europe (not including Ireland).
If you renewed your current passport before the previous one expired, extra months may have been added to its expiry date. Any extra months on your passport over 10 years may not count towards the 6 months needed.
Check your passport is valid for travel before you book your trip. You will need to renew your passport before travelling if you do not have enough time left on your passport.
