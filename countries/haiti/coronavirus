Returning to the UK
Travelling from and returning to the UK
If you plan to pass through another country to return to the UK, check the travel advice for the country you’re transiting. If you will pass through a red list country, book your hotel quarantine package before travelling to the UK.
When you return, you must follow the rules for entering the UK.
Be prepared for your plans to change
No travel is risk-free during COVID. Countries may further restrict travel or bring in new rules at short notice, for example due to a new COVID-19 variant. Check with your travel company or airline for any transport changes which may delay your journey home.
If you test positive for COVID-19, you may need to stay where you are until you test negative. You may also need to seek treatment there.
Plan ahead and make sure you:
can access money
understand what your insurance will cover
can make arrangements to extend your stay and be away for longer than planned
Travel in Haiti
Current measures still in place aimed at tackling the spread of the coronavirus are:
the wearing of face masks in public places is compulsory
frequent handwashing/use of hand sanitiser
social distancing
a 14 day self-isolation period for anyone entering the country with symptoms of COVID-19.
Accommodation
Most hotels have re-opened. Measures regarding social distancing, use of hand sanitiser and the wearing of masks are in place.
Public places and services
Gatherings of more than 10 people are banned. The wearing of masks in public places is compulsory.
Healthcare in Haiti
Medical services throughout the country are extremely limited, easily overwhelmed and offer a poor standard of care. Emergency response is not guaranteed as there are not enough ambulances to provide adequate service. Ambulances may not have the basic required medical supplies on board. Life-threatening emergencies may require evacuation by air ambulance, which can be very expensive, at the patient’s expense.
If you think you have COVID-19 symptoms you should ask your hotel to take you to a private medical clinic.
