Since 22 March, all international flights to and from Uganda have been suspended. Cargo flights are permitted, but crew must observe strict guidelines. Land borders and lake ports are also closed, except for truck drivers.
The US Embassy is working with a travel agent to arrange a flight from Entebbe Airport on Thursday 28 May.

Please note that other travel agents may also be able to book this special flight, the above details are provided for convenience only and are not a recommendation.
Travel to the airport
The Government of Uganda has announced that the current restrictions on private vehicles will be eased on Tuesday 26 May. The British High Commission will therefore not provide assistance to travel to the airport for this Thursday 28 May flight and you will need to make your own way to the airport.
The British High Commission will continue to work with the Government of Uganda, other embassies and airlines on options for helping British nationals who wish to return home. However, no further UK Government-backed special charter flights are currently planned from Uganda.
Your journey home
The National Travel Health Network and Centre (NaTHNaC) provides advice on how to stay safe as you travel by air. When you arrive back in the UK, follow the guidance here.
If youâ€™re returning home before 8 June, follow the guidance for when you return to the UK on steps you should take to protect yourself and others. From 8 June there will be new rules for entering the UK.
Sign up for travel advice email alerts and follow the British Embassy/High Commission on Twitter and Facebook.
Help and support
If you need urgent consular assistance, you can contact the British High Commission Kampala on 0312 312000 or +44 1908 516 666. The High Commission cannot provide further information or advice about departure options over the phone. This page will be updated when departure options become available.

Future travel options
If you wish to leave Uganda, you should also register your interest to leave by email to Returnfrom.Uganda@fco.gov.uk.
You will need to pay for your return travel to the UK. Where departure options are available including the 28 May flight to Addis Abba with onward connection to the UK on 29 May but you cannot afford the travel costs and have exhausted all other options for getting funds, you may be eligible to apply for an emergency loan from the government. This is a last resort option and you would need to repay the loan when you are back in the UK.
If you cannot leave Uganda at this time, see advice on staying in Uganda during coronavirus.
We are issuing regular updates on our Twitter and Facebook pages with the latest available information on possible flights.
