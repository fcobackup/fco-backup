Travel in Portugal
Measures are in place throughout Portugal to control the spread of the virus. You are required to observe the rules on social distancing when in public:
Keep a social distance of 2 metres
Use a face covering in enclosed spaces, and outdoors where a distance of 2m cannot be maintained
Wash your hands regularly
Your temperature can be taken on access to enclosed spaces, as determined by the health authorities.
Public spaces and services
Mainland Portugal
The Portuguese government started to ease lockdown measures on 15 March. Access to public spaces and services and the right to spend time outside and move between municipalities varies according to the COVID-19 incidence rate in each municipality.
Shops and other commercial premises, restaurants and cafés may have shorter trading hours. Leisure and cultural activities may be banned or limited to smaller groups. Check the restrictions in your municipality on the Portuguese government’s website (in Portuguese).
Bars and nightclubs remain closed. It is illegal to drink alcohol outdoors in public places, except for on pavement cafés and restaurants. Alcohol cannot be sold after 9pm unless it is with a meal.
Taxis can only carry up to 2 passengers. Do not use the front seat.
You must wear a mask while walking along promenades and in restaurants and cafés until you are seated. At the beach, follow the one-way entry and exit signs and use a mask until you reach your spot on the sand. Use a mask and footwear while using sanitary facilities. Place your sunshade and towel 3m from the next group and keep a social distance of 1.5m when walking along the sand. Before you set off, check the occupancy levels of the beaches near you and avoid the ones that are marked “red” and “amber”.
You can be fined up to €100 if you breach the regulations.
Madeira and Porto Santo
Measures are in place to limit the spread of the virus.
Check the rules on curfew and access to shops, services, entertainment and cultural facilities on the Madeira Tourist Office website under “other information”.
The Azores
Measures are in place to limit the spread of the virus.
There are 5 levels of risk in the Azores – very low, low, medium, medium high and high. Each level has its own restrictions.
Check these restrictions on the Regional Government’s website.
Inter-island travel in the Azores
There are restrictions in place. Check the requirements on the Regional government’s website (use Google Chrome and change the language to English).
Face coverings
You must wear a face mask in all enclosed spaces. You should wear your face covering when you enter the building and keep it on until you leave. You must also wear a face mask outdoors where it is not possible to maintain a 2m social distance from people outside your family group.
These measures apply to everyone over the age of 10 on mainland Portugal and in the Azores, and over the age of 5 in Madeira and Porto Santo.
You can be fined if you breach the regulations.
Exemptions from wearing a face covering differ in Portugal compared to the UK. You may be exempt from using a face mask both indoors and out on medical grounds. You will have to show a declaration from your doctor as evidence that you have a health condition that prevents you from wearing a face covering. You should observe strict social distancing and limit the time you spend in common areas in enclosed spaces. For further information (in Portuguese) on exemptions, see decree-law 62-A/2020 (Article 3(2).
Accommodation
Check any accommodation you book meets the required hygiene and cleaning standards and look out for the Portuguese Tourist Board’s “clean and safe” certification.

The Portuguese authorities have published their vaccination plan (only available in Portuguese). If you live in mainland Portugal or in the autonomous region of Madeira, visit the Portuguese health authority’s website to check whether there is action you can take now to ensure you get the vaccine at the appropriate time (use Google Chrome to access the page in English).

Returning to the UK
When you return, you must follow the rules for entering the UK.
You are responsible for organising your own COVID-19 test, in line with UK government testing requirements. Check when you book that the testing service can provide the appropriate COVID-19 test.

In Portugal, tests have to be booked in advance and paid for in full. It can take up to 24 hours for the results to be returned. If you test positive, you will have to self-isolate for 14 days. Make sure your travel insurance covers this eventuality.
You can schedule a test at any private testing clinic in Portugal. Find one near you from this list of approved facilities.
If you are staying in the Algarve, look out for information on testing facilities at the airport on arrival, or find a testing clinic near you on the Algarve tourist authority’s website. Your hotel may also be able to help you arrange a test in time for your departure.
If you are travelling to Madeira, you can book your return COVID-19 test after you have uploaded your RT-PCR test for arrival on the Madeira Traveller Registration platform. This test is free of charge and carried out at the hospital in Funchal and health centre in Porto Santo. Alternatively, schedule your own COVID-19 test at one of the clinics listed on the Madeira Tourist Authority website.
If you are travelling to the Azores, book your return COVID-19 test at a private testing centre on the island where you are staying. Ask your hotel or local tourist office for help in finding the centre closest to you.
