The FCO strongly encourages non-resident British nationals in Uruguay to leave and return home as soon as possible to avoid difficulties if flights out of the country and the region are further restricted. This is a rapidly evolving situation and new measures are expected, we advise that you continue to check for further announcements made.
As of Monday 23 March only LATAM will operate flights from Montevideo to São Paulo, Brazil and Santiago de Chile, Chile until 31 March 2020. We do not have confirmation about flights after that date. There is one scheduled flight to Rio de Janeiro, Brazil on Friday 27 March but we do not have confirmation that this flight will operate.
From Brazil, LATAM and British Airways are still flying to the UK.
From Chile, British Airways is still flying to the UK.
This information may change at short notice. You must check flights / connecting flights with your travel agent / insurance before booking.
