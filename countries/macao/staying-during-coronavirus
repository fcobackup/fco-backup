Moving around in Macao
For information on entering Macao, see Entry Requirements
As of 3 May, Macao has introduced a QR three-colour code system, which replaces the previous digital health declaration required at border checkpoints and for entering public administration premises, casinos and other venues. The new code requires its registrants to confirm whether they have been in COVID-19 quarantine at home or in a government-run facility and consists of three colours: red, yellow, green. Visitors receiving red or yellow codes may be subject to testing, hospitalisation or restrictions on their movements.
