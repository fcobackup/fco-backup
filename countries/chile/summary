Since 25 March, the government of Chile has put in place quarantine and curfews within certain communes in Santiago and around the country more generally. See Staying during coronavirus.
On 18 March, Chilean borders were formally closed. This means that only Chilean nationals and residents can enter the country, but it is still possible for foreign nationals to leave Chile. There are currently listed flights from Santiago to the UK via the US, Brazil, and Spain. See Return to the UK.
If you need an Emergency Travel Document, you will need to pre-book an appointment online. We are not able to respond to British Nationals who visit the Embassy without a pre-booked appointment.
October and November 2019 saw large-scale protests and violence across Chile. Major protests were widely expected to return in March 2020, but incidents have been limited owing to the health crisis. Nevertheless, there remains potential for protests and violence, and there have been some cases since April, especially in Santiago and Valparaiso. Some recent protests have seen isolated incidents of the use of small arms by members of the public. Other places with potential for the re-emergence of protests include Viña del Mar, Antofagasta, Concepcion and other major cities.
If protests take place, you should follow the instructions and advice of the local authorities, remain vigilant, monitor local media for updates and avoid protests and demonstrations. Under Chilean law, foreign nationals visiting or living in Chile could be deported for involvement in protests and demonstrations. See Local laws and customs
Public transport is largely running as normal. For updated information about public transport, roads and others, you should monitor Chile Reports.
Opportunistic street crime can be a problem in towns and cities, and in areas popular with tourists including airports, bus stations and ports. Take care of your personal belongings at all times and be aware of your surroundings. Carry a photocopy of your passport and keep the original document in a safe place. See Crime.
Terrorist attacks in Chile can’t be ruled out. See Terrorism
