Cases of coronavirus (COVID-19) have been confirmed in Argentina. The Argentine authorities have introduced a number of measures to limit the spread of the virus.
On 19 March, Argentina introduced a nationwide quarantine to last from midnight on Thursday 19 March to midnight on Tuesday 31 March. Although people are meant to stay in their homes as much as possible during this period, you can break this quarantine to buy necessities, such as medicines or foodstuffs, in your local area, and to travel to an airport if you already have a flight booked. Anyone found outside their home without justification may be charged with committing a public health crime.
British nationals should comply with these new restrictions. However, flights will continue to depart Argentina and British nationals who have already purchased tickets, and who are showing none of the symptoms of coronavirus, will be able to access the airport to catch their flights. Some British nationals may need to travel to Buenos Aires city, or to another province within Argentina, in order to catch an international flight. Although most domestic flights in Argentina, as well as long distance trains and buses, will not resume operations until 1 April, the airline Aerolíneas Argentinas is running some exceptional flights to transport visitors from tourist destinations to Buenos Aires.
Once flights have been purchased, travellers should leave plenty of time to get to the airport. You should make sure you are able to show authorities:
• Proof of a booked flight (a boarding pass if possible);
• Your passport;
• A (printed, if possible) copy of the letter issued by the Ministry of Tourism confirming that foreign nationals are exempt from the quarantine if they are travelling to return to their country of origin. This letter can be found here.
• A (printed, if possible) letter issued from the British Embassy confirming that you should be allowed to travel. This letter can be found here.
If you encounter any resistance when trying to access the airport, you should contact consular assistance immediately on +54 11 4808-2200.
The FCO strongly encourage non-resident British nationals in Argentina to leave as soon as possible to avoid difficulties they will face trying to get home if flights out of the country and the region are further restricted.
The government has closed the country’s borders for all those entering except for Argentine citizens and resident foreign nationals, and most international flights have been suspended.
The last direct flight from Argentina to the UK departed on Monday 16 March. Some airlines continue to fly limited routes back to the UK via third countries. Travellers should regularly check availability with these airlines. Where possible, the British Embassy in Argentina will also be sharing relevant information on their social media accounts.
The last direct flight from Argentina to the UK departed on Monday 16 March. In line with the Argentine government’s classification of higher risk countries, the last scheduled flights to regional countries, including Brazil, will depart on 22 March with many airlines stopping services on 20 March. Brazil currently offers a direct scheduled flight to the UK.
These regulations are subject to change at short notice and you should check with your travel provider before your journey. Further information is also available on the Argentine Ministry of Health website (in Spanish).
