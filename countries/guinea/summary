The Foreign, Commonwealth & Development Office (FCDO) advises against all but essential travel to:
the whole of Guinea based on the current assessment of COVID-19 risks
Travel to Guinea is subject to entry restrictions
All passengers arriving in Conakry must show a COVID-19 certificate with a negative polymerase chain reaction (PCR) result from a test taken within 5 days of arrival and departing passengers within 3 days of leaving. Following the identification of a new strain of COVID-19, travellers from the UK must also take a supplementary PCR test on arrival at the airport. Travellers will remain at the Onomo hotel in Conakry until the test result, which could take between 48 and 72 hours. Food and lodging will be paid by the Government of Guinea until the test result is received. Travellers will only be able to leave the hotel with a negative certificate. Those testing positive will be taken to a government treatment centre.
You may have to follow special requirements set out by your airline.
The state of emergency was extended again on 16 December for a month
See Entry requirements for more information before you plan to travel.

If your return journey to the UK transits another country, you should check whether it is subject to a travel ban or any other additional requirements. If so, contact your travel provider.

On 14 February 2021 the Ministry of Health declared an Ebola epidemic in the Gouecke sub-district of the N’Zerekore region. There are seven suspected Ebola cases, three patients have died, three are in isolation in N’zerekore, and one is in isolation in Conakry. These are the first Ebola cases reported since June 2016. Due to the increase in COVID-19 cases and the re-emergence of Ebola in Guinea, on 25 February the President introduced further health measures including a curfew from 11pm to 4am. Bars and restaurants must close for the curfew. Those travelling out of Conakry to the regions will need to carry a negative PCR test certificate. There is a maximum of 50 people permitted to attend baptism, marriage, funerals and a maximum of 100 people to attend conferences and cultural events. Mask wearing remains mandatory, distance must be maintained and washing hands when entering and leaving government and private establishments.
National and international experts deployed to the N’Zerekore Region require the COVID and Ebola vaccines and a COVID-19 PCR negative Test Certificate taken within 72 hours. Authorities are also administering temperature checks before boarding flights and passengers must complete forms including their contact details.
On 26 February, President Conde extended the state health emergency for 3 months.
