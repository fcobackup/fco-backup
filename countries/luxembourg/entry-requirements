Entry rules in response to coronavirus (COVID-19)
Entry to Luxembourg
The Luxembourg Government has announced that from 1 January 2021 UK nationals will not be permitted entry to Luxembourg for non-essential purposes due to EU-wide COVID-19 restrictions on non-EU and EEA nationals. More information is provided on the Luxembourg government website. Essential travel is still permitted and a list of exemptions for entering Luxembourg can be found here.
From Friday 29 January 2021 the Luxembourg Government requires all airline passengers, from the age of six years old, to be in possession of a negative PCR COVID-19 test result. This test should be taken no more than 72 hours before the flight. Proof of a negative viral antigen (rapid test), taken no more than last 72 hours before the flight, will also be accepted.
If you are travelling to Luxembourg by air, you will also be asked to complete a passenger locator form while on the plane.
Regular entry requirements
Visas
The rules for travelling or working in European countries changed on 1 January 2021:
you can travel to countries in the Schengen area for up to 90 days in any 180-day period without a visa. This applies if you travel as a tourist, to visit family or friends, to attend business meetings, cultural or sports events, or for short-term studies or training
if you are travelling to Luxembourg and other Schengen countries without a visa, make sure your whole visit is within the 90-day limit. Visits to Schengen countries within the previous 180 days before you travel count towards your 90 days
to stay longer, to work or study, for business travel or for other reasons, you will need to meet the Luxembourg government’s entry requirements. Check with the Luxembourg Embassy what type of visa and/or work permit you may need
if you stay in Luxembourg with a visa or permit, this does not count towards your 90-day visa-free limit
Any time you spent in Luxembourg or other Schengen countries before 1 January 2021 does not count towards your 90-day visa-free limit.
At Luxembourg border control, you may need to use separate lanes from EU, EEA and Swiss citizens when queueing. Your passport may be stamped on entry and exit. You may also need to:
show a return or onward ticket
show you have enough money for your stay
There are separate requirements for those who are resident in Luxembourg. If you are resident in Luxembourg, you should carry proof of residence as well as your valid passport when you travel. For further information on these requirements, see our Living in Luxembourg guide.
Passport validity
Check your passport is valid for travel before you book your trip, and renew your passport if you do not have enough time left on it.
You must have at least 6 months left on an adult or child passport to travel to most countries in Europe (not including Ireland).
If you renewed your current passport before the previous one expired, extra months may have been added to its expiry date. Any extra months on your passport over 10 years may not count towards the 6 months needed.
UK Emergency Travel Documents
UK Emergency Travel Documents are accepted for entry and exit from Luxembourg.
