Warning
FCDO advises against all travel to parts of Egypt.

This guide also has safety advice for regions of Egypt. 
Terrorism
There is a high threat of terrorist attack globally affecting UK interests and British nationals, including from groups and individuals who view the UK and British nationals as targets. Stay aware of your surroundings at all times.  
UK Counter Terrorism Policing has information and advice on staying safe abroad and what to do in the event of a terrorist attack. Find out more about the global threat from terrorism.
Terrorism in Egypt
Terrorists are very likely to try to carry out attacks in Egypt. 
Terrorism is a risk across Egypt, particularly in North Sinai. Attacks could be indiscriminate. Targets might include:
Egyptian security forces
religious sites
large public gatherings
places visited by foreign nationals
The authorities in Egypt have a significant security presence across the country, including armed security officers at important sites, critical infrastructure and road checkpoints. Extra measures are in place at tourist sites.
Recent attacks include:
in 2022, an attack to the west of the Suez Canal targeting security forces within the city of Ismailiyah
in 2019, at least 20 people killed by a car bomb in Central Cairo’s Manial district
in 2019, at least 16 people injured after an IED attack on a tourist bus near the Giza pyramids
in 2019, 3 security personnel killed by a suicide bomber in Central Cairo’s Darb al-ahmar district
There are frequent terrorist attacks in North Sinai. Most attacks are in the north-east corner of the governorate between Al-Arish city and the border with Gaza. Most attacks in North Sinai are against the Egyptian government and military installations and personnel. However, terrorists have attacked civilians suspected of working with the authorities and local religious minority groups.
Terrorism during holiday periods
There is a heightened threat of terrorism in and around religious sites and during religious festivals, such as the month of Ramadan and the Christmas period (including Coptic Christmas in January). Terrorists have attacked over local holiday weekends. The Egyptian Presidency website has a list of public holidays.
Follow the advice of Egyptian authorities and be vigilant in crowds and large gatherings.
Regional risks
Following hostilities in the region, a ceasefire between Israel and Iran began on 24 June.
You should:  
stay up to date with events in the region  
check for any transport disruption that may still be occurring  
monitor local and international media for the latest information  
read the FCDO’s advice on if you’re affected by a crisis abroad  
follow the instructions of local authorities
Political situation
The political environment in Egypt is restrictive.
Avoid large gatherings, demonstrations and protests as the situation could change quickly and without warning. The authorities may close public spaces, including parks and beaches, at short notice, particularly around holidays. If you do not follow their instructions, you could be fined or arrested. Security forces have responded forcefully to protests and disturbances.
Foreign nationals involved in any political activity or activities critical of the government may be at risk of detention or other measures.
During periods of heightened political sensitivity, security personnel could check your personal electronic device.
Crime
Take extra care when travelling alone, particularly at night, in taxis and microbuses. The crime rate is generally low, but visitors have reported:
armed robberies
muggings, including in taxis
sexual assaults
break-ins to accommodation and cars
pickpocketing and bag-snatching
To report a crime, phone the tourist police on 126. If you do not report a crime before you leave Egypt, it will be difficult to prosecute later.
Sexual assault and harassment
A number of sexual assaults have been reported to the British Embassy, including cases involving minors.
The majority of cases that have been reported took place in tourist resorts in the Red Sea region, often committed by someone the victim had already met, including hotel workers and excursion staff. There have also been reports of hotel staff discouraging incidents being reported to local police. 
Female travellers should exercise caution when travelling alone, particularly at night, in buses, taxis and microbuses. If you are travelling on public transport including microbuses, avoid being the last passenger left on board.
Take extra precautions:
make sure children and young people are always accompanied by known and trusted people and not left alone with hotel or excursion staff
do not allow hotel staff to enter your room when you are alone – try to ensure a friend or relative is present
avoid travelling in a taxi alone – if this is not possible, apply extra security by sharing the details of your driver and trip with a friend, and using live location on WhatsApp
use reputable providers for any services and excursions, and carry out research beforehand, including by consulting your tour operator where you have one
avoid sharing personal contact or social media details
See advice for women travelling abroad and information for British nationals affected by rape or sexual assault abroad.
If you experience sexual harassment or assault, or if you feel threatened or unsafe, report it to the hotel or local authorities.

Protecting your belongings
Take particular care of your possessions on buses, trains and in crowds. Criminals may ride past on bikes and snatch valuables.
Keep a copy of your passport, visa and flight ticket separately from originals when travelling. Leave copies at home where others can access them and store them electronically so you can access them easily. If your passport is lost or stolen, tell the police immediately and get a police report. You will need a police report to get visa stamps transferred to your replacement passport.     
Scammers and touts at tourist sites
Be cautious in tourist areas, where scammers and touts target foreign nationals.
Touts may confront tourists at popular tourist sites, such as the Giza pyramids, and aggressively ask for money or business. This can even happen when you’re in a car or taxi. If you use a pre-booked guide or take an organised tour to visit the pyramids, you are likely to face fewer difficulties. 
Laws and cultural differences
Egypt is predominantly an Islamic country. Always respect local traditions, customs, laws and religions. Make sure you do not cause offence, especially during Ramadan or when you visit religious areas.
Religion
It is illegal to encourage people to convert to Christianity or any other religion.
Ramadan
Ramadan is a holy month for Muslims. The dates vary by year and country and you should check this before you travel. During this time, do not:
eat, drink, smoke or chew gum in public in the daytime
play loud music or dance
swear in public
Get more advice when you arrive from your tour guide, hotel or business contacts.
You should also:
check opening hours of shops and restaurants
be aware that if hotels and restaurants are providing food or drink in fasting hours, they may separate non-fasting guests, for example with screens
follow local dress codes – clothing that does not meet local dress codes may cause more offence at this time
be aware that driving may be erratic, particularly when people are trying to get home at dusk
be patient and show tolerance
Personal ID
Police check ID regularly and will ask to see your passport. They may detain you if you cannot show it.
Dress code
Dress modestly, especially in rural areas, mosques and souqs (markets).
Behaviour in public
Showing affection in public is frowned upon. Holding hands is generally fine, but there are places in Egypt where this is looked down on. Behaviour accepted in tourist resort areas may not be tolerated elsewhere.
Alcohol laws
Drinking alcohol anywhere other than a licensed restaurant or bar or private homes is illegal and can lead to arrest.
Illegal drugs penalties
Possession, use or trafficking of illegal drugs is a serious offence and can, even for small amounts, lead to life imprisonment or the death penalty. People who get a life sentence on drugs charges normally spend the rest of their lives in prison with no chance of parole or a pardon.
Khat is illegal in Egypt.
Criticising the Egyptian government
Making political or negative comments about the Egyptian government, including about the President or security forces, can cause trouble with the authorities. People have faced prison sentences for making insulting comments on social media.
Photography and filming restrictions
You must get a permit to enter Egypt with professional photography or film equipment. This includes photography umbrellas, artificial outdoor lighting gear and any equipment that occupies or blocks public roads.
It is illegal to take or share photos that could be considered damaging to the country’s image.
Ministry of Tourism regulations on photography say that you must get an Egyptian citizen’s written permission before you take their photo. Taking pictures of children is prohibited. Do not photograph officials without their consent.
It is illegal to take photos of, or near, military property. This includes the Suez Canal.
If you are in any doubt, get permission before taking photos. There are sensitivities about taking photographs of:
embassies
government buildings and infrastructure
churches
religious buildings
Drones
It is illegal to use radio-controlled helicopters or drones to take photos near sensitive sites.     
Do not import, use or produce drones in Egypt unless the Egyptian Ministry of Defence gives you permission beforehand. Anyone who uses or imports drones without permission could get a prison sentence of up to 7 years or a fine of 5,000 to 50,000 Egyptian pounds.
LGBT+ travellers
Same-sex sexual activity is not explicitly criminalised in Egypt. However, the Egyptian authorities have prosecuted LGBT+ people under ‘debauchery’ laws, including people flying rainbow flags at public events.
There is little public acceptance of same-sex relationships in Egypt. Same-sex couples showing affection in public are likely to receive negative attention.
Be cautious about sharing content or having discussions of a sexual nature on social media, especially about sexual acts that are considered illegal. Some travellers have been arrested and imprisoned for this.
You may be denied entry if your gender expression or physical appearance does not match the sex marker in your passport or your passport photograph.
Read more advice for LGBT+ travellers.
Child custody law
Egyptian family law is very different from UK law, particularly around child custody. See International parental child abduction for information and how to get assistance.
Outdoor activities and adventure tourism
Insurance for adventure activities
Make sure your travel insurance, or the tour or dive company, will cover the costs for any air or sea rescue, which can cost more than 4,000 US dollars per hour. The Egyptian authorities will only start rescue operations when they are guaranteed payment. Book excursions for activities at your resort or through approved agents or tour operators.
See Foreign travel insurance for more information.
Hot air balloons
Speak to your tour company before booking a hot air balloon flight. Some UK tour operators have stopped selling balloon flights because they have not been able to verify safety standards.
Watersports and cruises
There have been recent incidents involving British nationals on diving boats/tours in the Red Sea. Some of these have included fatalities. Safety standards of Red Sea resort diving operators and boats vary considerably. Some operators may not provide adequate safety and insurance standards.
The Marine Accident Investigation Branch (an independent investigative unit within the Department for Transport) published guidance about liveaboard vessels on their website in February 2025. They recommend that prospective customers are advised only to book liveaboard dive holidays through reputable vendors who can provide assurance about the safety standards applicable to the dive boat. On arrival on board, customers should request that the crew provide a thorough safety briefing before departure.
You should:
observe safety standards on board and exercise caution
make bookings through your tour representative or reputable operator if possible
check the weather and stay alert to changes
not dive or snorkel without a dive buddy or guide
not dive below your insurance policy’s depth limit – doing so will invalidate your cover
Shark attacks are rare, but there have been attacks on tourists in the Red Sea region. Monitor any updates from local authorities or your tour operator.
See ⁠watersports safety advice from the Royal Society for the Prevention of Accidents (ROSPA).
Quad bikes and desert visits
There have been several serious quad bike accidents involving British nationals in resort areas. Take the same precautions as you would in the UK. Safety standards vary considerably. Always wear a crash helmet.
Transport risks
Road travel
If you are planning to drive in Egypt, see information on driving abroad.
You’ll need to have both the 1949 version of the international driving permit (IDP) and your UK driving licence with you in the car. You cannot buy an IDP outside the UK, so get one before you travel.
You can drive in Egypt using your UK licence and an IDP for up to 6 months. If you plan to stay longer, you must apply for an Egyptian driving licence.
Drivers and front seat passengers must wear seatbelts.
Driving under the influence of alcohol or drugs is a serious offence in Egypt. If you are caught, you may get a fine and possible imprisonment.      
You may not be allowed to import a vehicle into Egypt. If you want to bring in a vehicle temporarily, you must get a ‘carnet de passage’ from the Automobile Association.
Driving conditions
Accidents are common because of poor road conditions, dangerous driving and poor traffic law enforcement. Do not drive outside main cities and resorts at night. Make sure you have appropriate insurance.
Off-road travel
If you’re travelling off road, use a qualified guide and get a permit from the Ministry of Interior.   
Rail and bus travel
Serious bus crashes in recent years have caused many deaths, including tourists.
There have also been fatal train collisions and derailments.
River and sea travel
Overcrowding and poor safety standards have caused accidents on Red Sea ferries and Nile cruises.
