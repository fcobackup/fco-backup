There are still commercial options to return to the UK from Greece, transiting in other countries.
You will need to pay for your return travel to the UK. If departure options are available but you cannot afford the travel costs and have exhausted all other options for getting funds, you may be eligible to apply for an emergency loan from the government. This is a last resort option and you would need to repay the loan when you are back in the UK.
For more information, you should contact Corporate Travel Management (CTM). CTM are a commercial partner of the FCO and are authorised to administer such loans on behalf of the FCO.
Flights
Direct commercial flights between the UK and Greece (in both directions) are currently suspended until 1 June. This suspension may be extended further in future, including at short notice.
It is possible to travel indirectly between Greece and the UK (and vice versa). Options include travelling via Frankfurt, Paris, Brussels, Zurich and Belgrade, though some itineraries are likely to require an overnight stay between flights or between flights and Eurostar connections. Itineraries departing on weekends, Fridays or Mondays tend to involve shorter times between connecting flights, but schedules continue to change at short notice. You should check travel advice for any country you plan to transit through. You should contact airlines or travel operators directly for more information.
If you’re trying to get back to the UK and need financial help, see the FCO’s guide on financial assistance.
Travelling to the airport
Public transport continues to operate in Greece, though services may be reduced or changed. You should avoid using public transport during morning and evening rush hours, when key workers are more likely to travel. You should check with operators in advance of travel.
Taxis are permitted to operate, but may carry only two passengers, except for in cases of an adult accompanying children, or a companion accompanying another passenger for medical reasons. Passengers must wear facemasks.
When travelling in a private car, only two passengers are permitted, in addition to the driver.
If you are travelling via ferry, you will need to complete a health questionnaire and hand it to the ferry operator before boarding. The necessary forms will be provided by the operator: you should contact them directly if you need further information. Temperature checks may also be carried out before boarding; and it is obligatory to wear masks on all ferries, whose capacity is limited to allow for social distancing.
If you are travelling by internal (domestic) flights, you are also required to wear masks throughout the journey. Specific measures relating to check-in, baggage allowances and other details are in place to reduce the spread of coronavirus. You should check with your operator directly for further detail.
Road, rail and ferry travel
Travel between the UK and Greece by road, rail or ferry is likely to be difficult at this time.
Ferry services between Greece and Italy, and Greece and Albania, are currently suspended.
Greece’s borders with neighbouring countries (Bulgaria, Turkey, Albania and N Macedonia) are closed to passenger traffic. Albania, Bulgaria, Italy, North Macedonia, Turkey have also introduced restrictions, including closing land borders and suspending of rail and ferry links. Check FCO Travel Advice pages for details if you are planning to travel via these countries, and speak to your travel operator in case of disruption.
