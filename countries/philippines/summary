The Foreign, Commonwealth & Development Office (FCDO) advises against all travel to:
western and central Mindanao and the Sulu archipelago because of terrorist activity and clashes between the military and insurgent groups.
The FCDO advises against all but essential travel to:
the remainder of Mindanao (excluding Camiguin, Dinagat and Siargao Islands) due to the threat of terrorism. See Local travel and Terrorism.
the remainder of the Philippines based on the current assessment of COVID-19 risks
Travel to the Philippines is subject to entry restrictions
The Philippines has temporarily suspended flights from the UK to the Philippines starting at 12:01am on 24 December until 31 December 2020.
Passengers not arriving directly from the UK who have been in the UK within 14 days prior to arrival to the Philippines, including those just transiting through the Philippines, are prohibited from entering the country during this period.
Entry to the Philippines is currently prohibited except for Philippine nationals and former Philippine nationals, including their spouses and children, members of international organisations already accredited to the Philippines, and foreign nationals holding valid residency permits. Since 1 August 2020, foreign nationals with long-term visas have been allowed to enter the Philippines subject to IATF conditions.
Some airlines need passengers from the Philippines to present a COVID-19 RT-PCR negative-test certification issued by an accredited testing facility before being permitted. Check with your airline or travel company for the latest information.
See Entry requirements for more information before you plan to travel.

The lake Taal volcano 60km south of Manila has been experiencing increased volcanic activity since 12 January 2020. See Natural disasters
Terrorists are very likely to try to carry out attacks in the Philippines. Terrorist groups have the intent and capability to carry out attacks anywhere in the country, including in the capital Manila and in places visited by foreigners, such as airports, shopping malls, public transport, including the metro system, and places of worship. You should remain vigilant at all times and report anything suspicious to the local authorities. See Terrorism
It’s likely that terrorist groups continue to plan kidnap operations against western nationals in the Philippines, both on land and at sea. Risks are particularly acute in Mindanao and the Sulu archipelago. See Kidnapping
Martial law was lifted across Mindanao on 1 January 2020. Monitor media reporting and follow the instructions of local authorities. A ‘state of national emergency on account of lawless violence’ remains in place across the rest of the country.
The Philippines is in an active earthquake zone and has numerous volcanoes. The country is also affected by around 20 typhoons each year, most of which occur between June and December. See Natural disasters
Normally you can enter the Philippines without a visa for an initial period of 30 days. You can also get a tourist visa before you travel, which will allow an initial 59 day stay. However, restrictions are currently in place as part of the Philippines response to the coronavirus outbreak. See Visas and Coronavirus
There’s a high incidence of street crime and robbery throughout the Philippines. You should take sensible precautions. See Crime
Prison sentences in the Philippines are severe. The judicial system can result in long-term detention until a court hearing takes place. Detention facilities are far below UK standards. Do not become involved with drugs of any kind. Penalties for importing and using illegal drugs are particularly severe. See Local laws and customs
The Philippines’ ferry and passenger boat network has a poor record of maritime safety. You should exercise caution when considering travel by inter-island ferries and avoid overcrowded boats. Accidents are more frequent during the rainy season between June and December when storms can develop quickly. See Sea travel
There’s a heightened risk of dengue fever during the rainy season (June to October). See Health
If you’re abroad and you need emergency help from the UK government, contact the nearest British embassy, consulate or high commission. Consular support is severely limited in parts of the Philippines where the FCDO advise against travel, and limited in the areas where the FCDO advise against all but essential travel. Full consular support is available in all other areas.
