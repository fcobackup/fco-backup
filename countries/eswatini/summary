On 19 April 2018, King Mswati III announced that Swaziland had officially changed its name to Eswatini.
Given the rapidly changing situation in Eswatini we are temporarily withdrawing a limited number of UK staff and their dependents from our High Commission. The High Commission will continue to carry out essential work including providing 24/7 consular assistance and support to British people in Eswatini.
British Nationals in Eswatini, particularly those who have been in a coronavirus affected country (including the UK) in the past 20 days, should be aware that it is possible they may not be able to leave Eswatini by road into South Africa after 18 March until South African restrictions are lifted, or amended, or may require a visa to do so. British Nationals will still be able to transit through OR Tambo International Airport in Johannesburg.
Please check the travel Advice for South Africa for the latest information on South African entry requirements.
