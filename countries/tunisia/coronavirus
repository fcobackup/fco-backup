Borders and travel
Commercial flights between Tunisia and all other countries were suspended at 11.59pm on 17 March. All maritime borders are closed. If you are already in Tunisia, and it is not essential that you remain, you should urgently contact your airline or tour operator and arrange to leave as soon as possible.
Local measures
A countrywide curfew is in effect from 6pm to 6am. During Ramadan, from 24 April, the curfew will be in place from 8pm to 6am. All schools and nurseries are closed, as are all cafés and restaurants. All sporting fixtures, conferences, public prayers and events have been cancelled.
An “obligatory confinement period” is in effect between 6am and 8pm during Ramadan. During this time people are only expected to leave their house for essential business such as grocery shopping or medical care. The Tunisian government has also prohibited travel between cities and regions. All visitors arriving in Tunisia must self-quarantine for a period of 14 days.
From 4 May, a gradual lifting of the confinement measures will take place. The confinement measures will become targeted, taking in consideration the spread of the virus in different regions, different age groups and health conditions, and the importance of different economic sectors. The Tunisian government will provide further detail about the new measures at the end of April.
