Air travel
Flights in and out of Bhutan are operating on a severely reduced schedule due to COVID-19 restrictions on tourism.
Druk Air (Royal Bhutan Airlines) is the National Flag carrier in and out of Bhutan. Normally, daily air services between Paro and Bangkok and Paro and Kolkata and weekly services between Paro and Kathmandu are also operated by Tashi Air (Bhutan Airlines), an independent Bhutanese airline. A domestic flight operated by Druk Air flies between Paro, Bumthang, Yongphula and Gelegphug. Flights can be subject to disruption due to weather conditions.
Phuntsholing, Gelephu and Samdrup Jongkhar in eastern Bhutan are the only land border areas normally open for international tourists. You can get more information on the Tourism Council of Bhutan website.
Road travel
Accidents are common, particularly in monsoon season. Observe the speed limit and make sure you have adequate insurance. Special care should be taken on highways, where conditions are often dangerous.
If youâ€™re visiting Bhutan as a tourist, you should request temporary authorisation to drive through your tour agency. For longer stays, visitors can request a Bhutanese driving licence from the Road Safety and Transport Authority of Bhutan upon presentation of a valid UK driving licence.
