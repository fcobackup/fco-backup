Warning
FCDO advises against all travel to Niger.

Niger is a cash based society. Credit cards are rarely accepted even in hotels and restaurants frequented by international clients. There are few ATMs. Banks accept travellersâ€™ cheques. You will have to produce your passport and the receipt for the cheques from the issuing bank.
