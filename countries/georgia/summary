There may be demonstrations outside the Amirani, Galleria, Tbilisi Mall and East Point cinemas in Tbilisi, and possibly the Apollo cinema in Batumi around the film premiere of “And Then We Danced” on 8, 9 and 10 November. These are likely to be policed, but you should check local media and follow the advice of local authorities.
The political situation in Georgia is generally calm, but small-scale demonstrations and opposition rallies are likely, particularly outside Parliament on Rustaveli Avenue in Tbilisi. These could escalate without warning. You should check local media, stay away from any large gatherings and demonstrations and follow the advice of local authorities.
