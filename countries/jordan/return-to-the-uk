Additionally, Qatar Airways will operate a flight from Amman to Doha on 12 July. This flight departs Amman at 7:15pm. Flights with onward connections to London can be booked on the Qatar Airways website. The promotion code TRAVELHOME should be used to access special fares.
All flights are offered on a commercial basis. You should contact the airline directly to make a booking. Please be aware that some airlines require an onward flight booking before it is possible to book the Amman leg. Please check travel advice for travel via third countries and keep up to date with any entry requirements.
You will need to make your own arrangements for transfer to Queen Alia International Airport. If stopped at checkpoints, you should show your passport and flight tickets. Drivers will also require a copy of the flight tickets for the return journey.

You will need to pay for your return travel to the UK. If departure options are available but you cannot afford the travel costs and have exhausted all other options for getting funds, you may be eligible to apply for an emergency loan from the government. This is a last resort option and you would need to repay the loan when you are back in the UK.
Your journey home: re-entering the UK
