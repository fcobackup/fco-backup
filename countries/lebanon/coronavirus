Cases of coronavirus (COVID-19) have been confirmed in Lebanon. The Lebanese authorities have announced a number of measures and restrictions to limit the spread of the virus.
Travel and borders
On 15 March, the Lebanese authorities announced the closure of Lebanon’s borders, including Beirut Rafic Hariri Airport, effective from March 19.
There are some exceptions to the closure, those with Lebanese nationality, Lebanese residency or who are a member of a family of a Lebanese national should contact their nearest Lebanese Embassy.
If you are concerned about your visa expiring please contact General Security on 1717 or +961 (0) 1424668 for advice. General Security are currently extending visas and not issuing fines for visas that have expired since COVID19 restrictions have been introduced.
Public measures
The Lebanese authorities have also announced a lock-down in Lebanon. This has been extended until at least 10 May 2020. This means that:
Individuals must remain at home. Public and private gatherings are banned
Public departments, municipalities, unions, universities, public and private schools, and nurseries are closed, with the exception of core institutions, including security agencies, hospitals, pharmacies and banks (though ATMs and electronic transfers are functioning)
Traffic is banned between 2000 and 0500. Outside of these hours restrictions are in place to limit the number of public and private vehicles on the roads. From 6 April vehicles with license plates ending in 1,3,5,7 or 9 are only permitted to move on Mondays, Wednesdays and Fridays. Vehicles with license plates ending in 0,2,4,6 or 8 are only permitted to move on Tuesdays, Thursdays and Saturdays. No vehicles are permitted to move on Sundays. There are exemptions in place for military and security forces, the International Committee for the Red Cross, diplomatic and specific health and food industry related vehicles.
Outside this, private cars containing more than two people may be stopped and all public transport is suspended. There may be difficulties accessing taxis
All private companies and stores are closed, with the exception of bakeries, supermarkets, and haulage companies.
It is clear the Government of Lebanon is enforcing strictly restrictions on movement, in line with public health measures it has previously introduced. The issuance of fines, and the establishment of roadblocks, is increasingly widespread. We also understand that violators of the Government of Lebanon’s restrictions are liable to be imprisoned for up to three years. You should only leave home in exceptional circumstances – for example going to supermarkets or pharmacies for essential items, or to access medical care. You should comply with all local restrictions introduced by the Lebanese authorities.
Keep up to date with information from your tour operator, transport or accommodation provider on the impact on any existing travel plans. If you need further information about entry requirements, contact the local immigration authorities or the nearest Lebanese embassy.
