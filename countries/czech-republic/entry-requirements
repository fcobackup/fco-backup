Entry rules in response to coronavirus (COVID-19)
Entry to the Czech Republic
There are currently no restrictions in place on entering the Czech Republic if you are travelling from the UK..
If you are travelling from a country not considered to be low risk by the Czech government, you are only allowed to enter the Czech Republic for limited, specific purposes. Details of how countries are classified, and the regulations in place for travellers from those countries, can be found on the website of the Czech Ministry of Interior.
Regular entry requirements
The information on this part of the page covers the most common types of travel and reflects the UK government’s understanding of the rules currently in place. Unless otherwise stated, this information is for travellers using a full ‘British Citizen’ passport.
The authorities in the country or territory you’re travelling to are responsible for setting and enforcing the rules for entry. If you’re unclear about any aspect of the entry requirements, or you need further reassurance, you’ll need to contact the embassy, high commission or consulate of the country or territory you’re travelling to.
You should also consider checking with your transport provider or travel company to make sure your passport and other travel documents meet their requirements.
Visas
If you hold a British Citizen passport, you don’t need a visa to enter Czech Republic. If you’re planning a stay of longer than 3 months, see our Living in Czech Republic guide and contact the Embassy of the Czech Republic if you have further questions.
The rules on travel will stay the same until 31 December 2020.
