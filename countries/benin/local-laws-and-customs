Coronavirus guidance is being updated.
Read the Prime Minister’s statement for the latest information.

Benin is one of the main centres of voodoo practices and that culture remains prevalent. You should research and respect religious and social traditions to avoid offending local sensitivities.
Possession, use or trafficking in illegal drugs is a serious offence and can result in lengthy prison sentences and heavy fines.
Photography near sensitive or government sites, like military installations or the airport, is strictly prohibited.
Homosexuality is legal in Benin, but homosexual relationships are not universally accepted. You should be discreet. See our information and advice page for the LGBT community before you travel.
You should politely and firmly decline requests for ‘gifts’ from officials to facilitate administrative matters.
