Volcanoes
The Nyiragongo volcano in Virunga National Park is active and has only limited access to tourists.
At approximately 6:50pm local time on Saturday 22 May, Mount Nyiragongo volcano, close to the city of Goma, and near the border with Rwanda, began erupting. Lava flow from the initial eruption has now stopped, but aftershocks could continue for some time and there is a risk of further volcanic activity. Goma International Airport and Kavumu Aiport in Bukavu are closed. Risks to health remain so you should take appropriate safety precautions and remain vigilant as the situation could change with little warning. You should follow the advice of the local authorities. British nationals who are concerned should contact the British Embassy in Kinshasa online or by telephone on +243 81 556 6200. We continue to monitor the situation closely.
The eruption of Mount Nyiragongo in 2002 resulted in significant destruction in Goma. Local authorities, the UN and local NGOs continue to monitor the volcanoâ€™s activity.
Earthquakes
Earthquakes occasionally occur. On 7 August 2015 an earthquake of magnitude 5.6 hit eastern DRC, resulting in a small number of reported deaths and injuries in the town of Bukavu.
