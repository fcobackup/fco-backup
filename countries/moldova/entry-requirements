This page has information on travelling to Moldova. Check what you must do to return to the UK.
This page reflects the UK government’s understanding of current rules for people travelling on a full ‘British Citizen’ passport from the UK, for the most common types of travel.
The authorities in Moldova set and enforce entry rules.
In light of the Russian invasion of Ukraine, Moldovan airspace is restricted. From 21 March there are a limited number of passenger flights operating into and out of Romania from Chisinau International Airport. You should check with your airline provider before booking tickets and travelling and be aware that restrictions could be re-introduced at short notice. Outside of Moldova the closest airport from which you can get a plane to London is Iasi (Romania), 150 km from Chisinau.
All travellers
All travellers should familiarise themselves with the entry rules for Moldova before travel.
Entering Moldova from Ukraine

Check your passport and travel documents before you travel
You should check with your transport provider or travel company to make sure your passport and other travel documents meet their requirements.
Passport validity

Visas
Visas are no longer required to enter Moldova if your stay is under 90 days. For all other types of travel, contact the Embassy of the Republic of Moldova in London. See below for information on entry into Moldova.
The Moldovan authorities strictly enforce penalties (including deportation) against foreign visitors who overstay the terms of their visas. As a visitor you are allowed to spend no more than 90 days in any six months period in Moldova. At any official point of entry, your arrival date will be registered automatically. Please see below for details of entry through Transnistria.
Residence and/or work permits are required for stays over 90 days. Immigration, residence, and work permits usually need to be extended annually, but can be issued for up to five years. Alternatively, you must regularise your stay by applying for a residence or work visa.
Border crossings with Ukraine and Romania
You should check for updates on border crossings with Ukraine and Romania on the Moldovan Border Police website.
Entry into Moldova via Transnistria
The FCDO advises against all travel to Transnistria.
On 28 February, all checkpoints between Ukraine and the Transnistria region were temporarily closed. We do not know when they will reopen. All other border crossings into Moldova remain open.
The train service between Odessa and Chisinau is suspended until further notice. If you have recently arrived in Moldova via Transnistria you should regularise your stay at the Bureau for Migration & Asylum in Chisinau (124 Stefan cel Mare Bulevard) within 3 days of your arrival. Alternatively, you should go to the local offices of the Bureau for Migration and Asylum located in: Hîrbovăț in Anenii Noi; Hajumus in Căușeni; Pîrîta in Dubăsari, Criuleni in Criuleni, Rezina in Rezina and Sărătăuac în Florești.
To register your stay you must present the following documents:
your passport
proof of travel (for example a Green Card if you drive a vehicle into Moldova; air/ bus/train ticket)
Failure to register may result in fines and difficulties when leaving Moldova.
Entry into Moldova via Ukraine
If you enter Moldova overland from Ukraine do so at one of the internationally recognised border crossing points between Moldova (excluding the Transnistria segment) and Ukraine in the north and south of the country.
Entry into Transnistria
The FCDO advises against all travel to Transnistria. Checkpoints between Ukraine and the Transnistria region closed on 28 February. We do not know when they will reopen.
There are no ‘immigration controls’ in place on the internal boundary between the Transnistria region and Moldova and entry stamps won’t be placed into passports. But on entering Transnistria you will be required to fill in 2 copies of a migration card, one of which should be retained and produced on exit. You may also be questioned on the aim of your visit, duration and where you will stay.
You should check ahead that the relevant border crossings are open and roads on the Ukrainian side are fully operational. This is particularly important around Transnistria which is outside the control of the Moldovan authorities.
UK Emergency Travel Documents
UK Emergency Travel Documents (ETDs) are accepted for entry, airside transit and exit from Moldova.
