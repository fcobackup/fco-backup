The information on this page covers the most common types of travel and reflects the UK government’s understanding of the rules currently in place. Unless otherwise stated, this information is for travellers using a full ‘British Citizen’ passport.
The authorities in the country or territory you’re travelling to are responsible for setting and enforcing the rules for entry. If you’re unclear about any aspect of the entry requirements, or you need further reassurance, you’ll need to contact the embassy, high commission or consulate of the country or territory you’re travelling to.
You should also consider checking with your transport provider or travel company to make sure your passport and other travel documents meet their requirements.
If you need further information about entry requirements, contact the local immigration authorities or the nearest Latvian embassy/consulate. You should also check with your airline or travel company for the latest information.
Entry rules in response to coronavirus (COVID-19)
Direct commercial flights between Latvia and the United Kingdom have resumed. Details of flights can be found on airlines’ websites.
Quarantine requirements
Travellers arriving from a country (or who have been in a country in the previous 14 days) where the cumulative incidence of COVID-19 cases in 100,000 of population over the previous 14 days is 16 or above are required to self-isolate for 14 days on their arrival in Latvia. These countries are marked in red and yellow in the table of comparative epidemiological data published every Friday on the Latvian Centre for Disease Prevention and Control website.
Further details on self-isolation are on the Latvian Centre for Disease Prevention and Control website and the Latvian Government’s COVID-19 website:
if you are required to self-isolate you must carefully monitor your health for 14 days after your arrival in Latvia including by taking your body temperature twice a day (in the morning and evening)
if you experience mild flu-like (increased body temperature, cough, sore throat) symptoms for at least two days you should call 8303. The dispatcher will then evaluate on a case-by-case basis and refer you to a testing point or send a medical unit to you if you are unable to travel to a testing point
in case of sudden onset of at least one of the following symptoms – dry cough, fever, shortness of breath – restrict contact with people nearby, but in case this is not possible, keep a distance of at least two metres from them, and call 113 immediately (State Emergency Medical Service)
Keep up to date with information from your tour operator, transport or accommodation provider on the impact on any existing travel plans.
