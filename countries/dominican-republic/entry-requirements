Regular entry requirements
Visas
British Citizens travelling to the Dominican Republic for tourism don’t need a visa.
As of April 2018, the tourism entry tax (previously known as a tourist card) is no longer collected upon arrival and should be included in your air fare. Contact your airline or tour operator if you’re unsure whether you have already paid this fee. The Dominican Republic Embassy website has more information.
On arrival you will normally be granted a 30-day stay. This can be extended to 120 days by paying for an extension when you leave the country. This can be done online at the Dominican Directorate General for Migration website or at the airport on departure. If you’re planning to stay for longer, seek advice from a local lawyer or contact the local Immigration authorities.
As a foreign national you will be required to give your fingerprints and have a photograph taken in order to enter the Dominican Republic.
You must carry a photocopy of your identification (such as a passport), a copy of your entry stamp and proof of onward or return travel at all times, so that you can produce them if you’re asked to do so by the authorities.
