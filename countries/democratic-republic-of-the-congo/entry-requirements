The information on this page covers the most common types of travel and reflects the UK government’s understanding of the rules currently in place. Unless otherwise stated, this information is for travellers using a full ‘British Citizen’ passport.
The authorities in the country or territory you’re travelling to are responsible for setting and enforcing the rules for entry. If you’re unclear about any aspect of the entry requirements, or you need further reassurance, you’ll need to contact the embassy, high commission or consulate of the country or territory you’re travelling to.
You should also consider checking with your transport provider or travel company to make sure your passport and other travel documents meet their requirements.
Make sure your immigration status is always in line with local requirements and your personal circumstances.
Visas
All British passport holders need to get a visa before travelling to the DRC. It is no longer possible to buy a short-term pass to enter the country. To get a visa, contact the Embassy of the Democratic Republic of the Congo:
45-47 Great Portland Street London W1W 7LD Telephone: 0207 580 3931
New DRC visa requirements in force since March 2015 mean that some types of visa applications are referred to Kinshasa for a decision. In these cases, a formal letter of invitation from the person or organisation you’re visiting, stamped by the Ministry of Foreign Affairs in Kinshasa and submitted with your application, can help to speed up the visa issuing process.
You should check requirements with the DRC Embassy in London and allow at least 2 to 3 weeks for visa processing.
A Rwandan or Ugandan immigration stamp in your passport should not prevent you from entering the DRC, but you may still experience difficulties on arrival if you do have them.
You should consider getting a long-term visa if you’re planning to stay in the DRC for a considerable period. When applying for or renewing a long term visa, DRC authorities now require a certificate of “Good Conduct” from your country of residence and a “Consular Certificate” as part of the application. The Consular Certificate can be issued at the British Embassy in DRC.
Passport validity
Your passport should be valid for a minimum period of 6 months from the date of entry into the DRC.
UK Emergency Travel Documents
UK Emergency Travel Documents are valid for entry into the Democratic Republic of the Congo with a valid visa.
Departure tax
There is a departure tax of $50 per passenger plus a fee of 5,000 Congolese Francs on international flights and $10 per passenger on domestic flights. These are official fees paid when checking in. Get an official receipt plus a copy for each fee. You should hand the originals on request to immigration and at boarding, and keep the copies.
Satellite phones, GPS receivers or Military clothing
You may have difficulties at immigration if you are travelling with satellite phones, GPS receivers or military clothing.
