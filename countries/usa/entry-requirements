The information on this page covers the most common types of travel and reflects the UK government’s understanding of the rules currently in place. Unless otherwise stated, this information is for travellers using a full ‘British Citizen’ passport.
The authorities in the country or territory you’re travelling to are responsible for setting and enforcing the rules for entry. If you’re unclear about any aspect of the entry requirements, or you need further reassurance, you’ll need to contact the embassy, high commission or consulate of the country or territory you’re travelling to.
You should also consider checking with your transport provider or travel company to make sure your passport and other travel documents meet their requirements.
Travel Restrictions
From 03.59 GMT 17 March, it will not be possible for most British nationals to enter the USA owing to coronavirus (COVID-19) restrictions imposed by the US authorities.
President Trump announced on 14 March that travel restrictions imposed previously on Schengen zone countries would be extended to the UK (and Ireland). This means travellers who have been in the UK (or Ireland) within the previous 14 days before their planned day of arrival in the USA will not be allowed entry unless they fall into one of the exempted categories. US citizens and permanent resident of the USA, their close family members and certain other limited categories of visa holders (such as UN staff and diplomats) are exempt and will still be able to enter the United States, subject to normal entry requirements.
British travellers currently in the USA will be allowed to leave. The new US travel restrictions are likely to affect commercial flight schedules to the UK and we recommend that British travellers who wish to leave by air make appropriate arrangements to ensure their travel plans can be met.
The new restrictions also limit the number of airports to which flights from the UK (and Ireland) can operate. The 13 airports are: JFK (New York), EWR (Newark), IAD (Washington DC), BOS, (Boston), ORD (Chicago), DTW (Detroit), MIA (Miami), ATL (Atlanta), DFW (Dallas), LAX (Los Angeles), SFO (San Francisco), SEA (Seattle) and HML (Honolulu). Long queues have been reported at US airports as a result of the new screening procedures put in place by the US Government. Travellers should comply with these measures and account for the extra time it may take to clear screening when arriving for a flight or on disembarkation.
Those who are permitted entry to the USA from the UK (or Ireland) will be advised to self-isolate, possibly for up to 14 days.
You should comply with any additional screening measures put in place by the US authorities. Keep up to date with information from your airline, tour operator, transport or accommodation provider on the impact to any existing travel plans. If you need further information about entry requirements, contact your airline or travel agent or check the latest guidance of the appropriate US Government Website.
Visas
You’ll need a visa for entry to the USA. The Electronic System for Travel Authorisation (ESTA) visa waiver programme is not currently in operation due to the imposition of new travel restrictions on those travelling from the UK.
Passport validity
Your passport should be valid for the proposed duration of your stay. You don’t need any additional period of validity on your passport beyond this.
Global Entry
The US Customs and Border Protection programme Global Entry gets pre-approved travellers through border control faster at some US airports. If you’re a British citizen you can now register to get a UK background check on GOV.UK. If you pass the background checks, you’ll be invited to apply for Global Entry.
UK Emergency Travel Documents
UK Emergency Travel Documents (ETDs) aren’t valid for entry into the USA or transit through the USA on an ESTA. If you’re planning to enter or transit through the US using an ETD, you must apply for a visa from the nearest US embassy or consulate before you travel, which may take a number of days, or hold a valid lawful permanent resident card (often referred to as a ‘green card’), which you must have with you on arrival.
UK ETDs issued in the USA are valid for exit from the USA.
Bringing medicines into the USA
There are restrictions and prohibitions on the import of certain prescription drugs into the US. The US Department of Homeland Security website contains further information and advice on bringing medicines into the US.
Travelling with children
If a child (under the age of 18) is travelling with only one parent or someone who isn’t a parent or legal guardian, you may be asked to provide certain documents at the border. For further information, see the US Customs and Border Protection website.
Travelling to the USA from Cuba
It’s possible to travel to the USA after you’ve been to Cuba. However, you may wish to take supporting documents about the purpose of your trip to Cuba in case you’re questioned by US immigration officials at the port of entry on arrival in the USA. If you have any further questions or concerns, contact the nearest US Embassy or Consulate.
