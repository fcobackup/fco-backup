From 4 July, Barbados is exempt from the FCDO advice against all non-essential international travel. This is based on the current assessment of COVID-19 risks.
Travel is subject to entry restrictions
You must complete and submit an online immigration/customs form 24 hours prior to travel
To be considered for fast-track processing upon arrival, you’re advised to arrive in Barbados with a COVID-19 negative PCR test result
If you arrive in Barbados without a negative PCR test for COVID-19 that meets Barbados’ entry requirements, you will be subjected to a mandatory test on arrival. You will need to quarantine until the test results are provided. This can take up to 48 hours. If at all possible, you are strongly advised to arrive in Barbados with a COVID-19 negative PCR test. Those who refuse to take this test will have to undergo seven days mandatory quarantine at government approved accommodation.
Anyone who tests positive for COVID-19 will be placed in isolation until they have recovered
Persons may be required to quarantine at any stage of their visit if the Government of Barbados deems that you have come into close contact with a COVID-19 positive individual
From 1 September, a new protocol will came into force: those arriving from the UK are monitored on a daily basis for seven days. Monitoring includes interviews with and calls by public health professionals. Effective 14 September, you will be required to take a A second COVID-19 PCR test. If this second test proves negative, no further monitoring will be required. If you refuse to take the test you will be subject to quarantine for a further seven days. Anyone who tests positive for COVID-19 will be placed in isolation until they have recovered.
