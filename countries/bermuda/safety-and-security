Crime
Bermuda has a moderate crime rate driven in part by the drugs scene. Serious incidents, including use of weapons, do occur. Take precautions to safeguard yourself and your possessions. Common crimes include burglary, mugging, theft of unattended baggage and belongings, and theft of items from rental scooters.
The Bermuda Police Service website provides Tourist Safety Tips. Take particular care after dark.
Stick to well-lit parts of the island and avoid quieter, darker streets. There have been incidents of sexual assault. If you need help, contact the Bermuda Police Service in the first instance. 
Road Travel
Tourists are not allowed to drive cars in Bermuda.
Buses, ferries and taxis are generally safe, frequent and efficient. You canâ€™t hire a car in Bermuda, but 50cc scooters are readily available for public hire. A small number of 2-person minicars are offered as an alternative to motorcycles in some locations. Driving is on the left, as in the UK. Roads are narrow, winding and undulating, and traffic may be heavy. Road accidents involving scooters are relatively common, and have resulted in serious injury or even death. You should take care. The national speed limit is 35kmh (22mph) but is lower in some urban areas.
Outside the major urban areas there are few footpaths or street lighting. Take care when out walking, especially at night.
