The FCDO advises against all but essential travel to:
the whole of Lesotho based on the current assessment of COVID-19 risks.
From 4am on Saturday 9 January, visitors arriving into the UK who have been in or transited through Lesotho in the previous 10 days will not be permitted entry. British and Irish nationals, longer-term visa holders and permanent residents arriving in the UK from Lesotho, need to self-isolate on their return. Check the latest guidance for England, Northern Ireland, Scotland and Wales.
Travel to Lesotho is subject to entry restrictions
Lesotho entered “Orange level” restrictions from 6 January 2021. Under previous “Orange level” restrictions, entry and exit to Lesotho was restricted to emergency cases and transport of essential goods and services. New travel regulations have not yet been published by the government.
Travellers with negative COVID-19 certificates are currently still being allowed to enter and exit Lesotho, but this could change at any point and with little advance warning.
See Entry requirements for more information before you plan to travel.
Visiting Lesotho requires entry to South Africa. See our Travel Advice for South Africa for further information.
