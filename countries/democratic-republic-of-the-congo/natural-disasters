Volcanoes
The Nyiragongo volcano in Virunga National Park is active and has only limited access to tourists.
On 22 May, Mount Nyiragongo volcano, close to the city of Goma, and near the border with Rwanda, began erupting. Aftershocks are continuing and Georisk Africa has noted the seismic activity is still worrying. Risks to health remain so you should take appropriate safety precautions and remain vigilant as the situation could change with little warning. You should follow the advice of the local authorities. Many people have left the affected area. If you are considering leaving the area you should be aware that Goma International Airport and Kavumu Aiport in Bukavu are closed. If you decide to cross into Rwanda from DRC, you will need a PCR test to leave DRC and then be required to take a PCR or rapid test on arrival in Rwanda. For more information on Rwanda’s entry requirements, see FCDO travel advice for Rwanda.
British nationals who are concerned should contact the British Embassy in Kinshasa online or by telephone on +243 81 556 6200. Given the rapidly changing situation in Goma, as of 26 May 2021 staff at the UK Government Office in Goma are being temporarily withdrawn. The British Embassy in Kinshasa will continue to carry out essential work including providing 24/7 consular assistance and support to British people in DRC.
The eruption of Mount Nyiragongo in 2002 resulted in significant destruction in Goma. Local authorities, the UN and local NGOs continue to monitor the volcano’s activity.
Earthquakes
Earthquakes occasionally occur. On 7 August 2015 an earthquake of magnitude 5.6 hit eastern DRC, resulting in a small number of reported deaths and injuries in the town of Bukavu.
