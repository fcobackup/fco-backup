The information on this page covers the most common types of travel and reflects the UK government’s understanding of the rules currently in place. Unless otherwise stated, this information is for travellers using a full ‘British Citizen’ passport.
The authorities in the country or territory you’re travelling to are responsible for setting and enforcing the rules for entry. If you’re unclear about any aspect of the entry requirements, or you need further reassurance, you’ll need to contact the embassy, high commission or consulate of the country or territory you’re travelling to.
You should also consider checking with your transport provider or travel company to make sure your passport and other travel documents meet their requirements.

Visas
You need a visa to enter Rwanda. Thirty-day tourist visas are free and available on arrival for citizens of country members of the Commonwealth, African Union or La Francophonie, including the UK.
You can also choose to get a visa in advance at any Rwandan diplomatic mission or online. Further information about visa requirements is available from the Rwandan High Commission.
If you’re planning to apply for resident/business or missionary multiple entry visas on entry to Rwanda you will need to get UK police clearance before you travel. You can find details of how to do this on the ACRO Criminal Records Office website. This usually takes a minimum of 10 working days to process.
Passport validity
Your passport should be valid for at least 6 months from the date of entry into Rwanda. You’ll need one blank page on your passport for entry stamps.
UK Emergency Travel Documents
UK Emergency Travel Documents (ETDs) are accepted for entry, airside transit and exit from Rwanda. If you’re travelling into Rwanda on an ETD, you’ll be expected to provide Rwandan Immigration with a reason for the use of an ETD, eg proof of residency. If you’re seeking to use a two-way ETD, should clear this with Rwandan Immigration before you travel.
