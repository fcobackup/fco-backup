The Foreign and Commonwealth Office (FCO) is advising British nationals against all non-essential international travel at this time. Existing advice for Kosovo remains in place:
The FCO advise against all but essential travel to:
the municipalities of Zvečan, Zubin Potok and Leposavic
the northern part of the city of Mitrovica. See Northern Kosovo
The authorities in Kosovo have introduced a number of measures in response to the coronavirus (COVID-19) pandemic. See Coronavirus
Following measures taken by the authorities in Kosovo, there are currently no commercial means of leaving Kosovo to return to the UK. See Return to the UK
Protests have the potential to turn violent, you should take care if you see large crowds gathering during heightened political tensions in the city. Check local media, consult hotel receptions for advice and regularly review information on this site for updates.
There have been violent clashes in the north of Kosovo and incidents involving grenades and vehicle explosions in northern Mitrovica. Be cautious and avoid public gatherings, particularly around the Austerlitz Bridge area which separates Mitrovica north and south.
Terrorists are very likely to try to carry out attacks in Kosovo. Attacks could be indiscriminate, including in places visited by foreigners, large public gatherings and cultural events. Terrorists may target religious sites, including churches. See Terrorism
High levels of air pollution can occur in Kosovo. See Health
It’s possible to travel from Serbia into Kosovo, and back again. You’ll probably encounter problems entering Serbia from Kosovo if your passport shows you entered Kosovo directly from anywhere else other than Serbia. If tensions rise in the north it’s better to avoid border crossing Gates 1 and 31 (Leposavic and Zubin Potok). See Northern Kosovo
Residual landmines and other unexploded ordnance remain in Kosovo, although all roads and tracks have been cleared. See Local travel
If you’re abroad and you need emergency help from the UK government, contact the nearest British embassy, consulate or high commission. Consular support is limited in parts of Kosovo where the FCO has existing advice against all but essential travel (see above).
Take out comprehensive travel and medical insurance before you travel.
