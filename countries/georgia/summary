The British government does not recognise the unilateral declarations of independence made by the de facto authorities in the breakaway regions of Abkhazia and South Ossetia. Consular support is not available in parts of Georgia where the FCDO advise against all travel. See Local travel

Tensions surrounding a planned Pride March in Tbilisi on 5 July 2021 continue, with rallies and counter-demonstrations expected in Tbilisi for several days.
