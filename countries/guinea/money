Credit cards are not widely used. ATM facilities accept foreign cards, but should not be relied on as a means of getting money. There are a limited number of ATMs in Conakry, which give only small amounts of currency. International credit cards may be used to draw cash over the counter. Banking outside Conakry can be difficult, with few ATMs available.
Exchanging foreign currency on the street or using unofficial money changers is illegal. Those using money changers, even for small amounts, including at the international airport, have been arrested and detained in military custody. Obtaining hard currency in Guinea is very difficult.
