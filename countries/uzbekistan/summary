On 6 November 2019, it was reported that 17 people were killed in an armed attack on a Tajik security check-point on the Uzbek/Tajik border. Daesh/ISIS claimed responsibility. You should exercise caution and vigilance, particularly if travelling near or across the Uzbek/Tajik border. See Local travel and Terrorism
Take care in areas bordering Tajikistan, Kyrgyzstan and Afghanistan. Uzbekistan’s borders are potential flashpoints and uncontrolled border areas may be land-mined. Borders are subject to closure without notice. See Local travel
Terrorist attacks in Uzbekistan can’t be ruled out. See Terrorism
Air quality in the Karakalpakstan and Khorezm regions has deteriorated as a result of storms over the Aral Sea bringing salt, dust and pollutants into the air. See Health
You can be detained on arrival for the possession of certain medicines, including codeine. You should always carry a doctor’s prescription with you. See Travelling with medicines
If you need to contact the emergency services, call 101 (fire), 102 (police) or 103 (ambulance).
