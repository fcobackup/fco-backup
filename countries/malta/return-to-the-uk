We recommend that British nationals who wish to leave Malta contact their travel operator as soon as possible.
The Maltese authorities have introduced a number of measures in response to the coronavirus (COVID-19) pandemic. You should comply with any additional screening measures put in place by the authorities.
On 13 March Malta introduced a mandatory 14 day self-quarantine period for all arrivals into Malta. This will affect tourists and returning residents. Asymptomatic visitors can choose to either enter mandatory self-quarantine or to return to their country of origin as soon as possible. If you leave Malta you must travel directly from your accommodation to the airport where you will be thermally screened. The Maltese Tourism Authority are offering a free shuttle bus to the airport.
The Maltese Government have a coronavirus advice page and a coronavirus website which gives the latest updates. A helpline is also available on 111.
All flights and ferry links to and from Germany, France, Italy, Spain and Switzerland have been suspended. Check with your travel provider for updates.
