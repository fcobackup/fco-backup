The Italian authorities have introduced measures in response to the coronavirus (COVID-19) pandemic. If you’re in Italy, follow the advice of the Italian authorities.
The Italian authorities have advised against travel for tourism purposes throughout Italy, and that tourists already on holiday in Italy should limit their movements to those necessary to return to the place where they live. People arriving in Italy from abroad are obliged to self-isolate for 14 days, even if they have no symptoms. They should also report promptly to local health authorities.

Train companies are reducing services, for both domestic and international travel. Some cross-border bus companies are also cancelling their services. Ports remain open although we understand that passengers on cruise ships will not be allowed to disembark for tourism purposes. Passenger ferry schedules remain subject to change and cancellations. You should speak to your tour operator or transport provider for the latest information.
Local measures
On 11 March, the Italian government announced new measures closing all non-essential business across Italy with immediate effect. All shops are closed apart from pharmacies and shops selling food and other basic necessities. Essential public services, transport, utilities, banks and postal services will remain active. All public gatherings, including religious ceremonies, funerals and sporting events remain suspended. Restaurants, bars, museums, cultural institutions, childcare facilities, schools and universities are closed, as are ski resorts.
Residents of Italy (including British nationals) must remain at home, or carry a Self-Declaration Form (autodichiarazione) stating their reasons for travel. Additionally, it is recommended to carry proof of residence when transiting thorough airports or other transport hubs.
Tourists in Italy are required to carry their passport and an onward ticket at all times. It is not mandatory to have a Self-Declaration Form (autodichiarazione), but complete one as a precaution.
