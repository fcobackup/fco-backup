From 1 June 2021, Algeria’s borders have been partially open. However, there remain limitations on routes into and out of Algeria. See Entry requirements for further information on rules for entry to Algeria.
A limited commercial flight schedule is operating. Demand for flights remains high, which you should take into account when making travel arrangements.
Airlines can be contacted via their websites or call centres for more information.
If you are travelling using an indirect route, some transit countries may impose updated restrictions of their own on travel to and from the UK or Algeria. Contact your travel operator before making any booking and consult FCDO Travel Advice for the most up to date information.
As indirect routes to the UK can require an overnight stay, you should consult FCDO Travel Advice for further information on entry and transit requirements.
Many airlines continue to show an online schedule of flights which appear bookable but are cancelled at very short notice with replacements at greater cost. We advise that for any flights, individuals who wish to make a booking should contact the airline directly and receive confirmation from them that the schedule will be running.
Some airlines are requiring passengers to present a printed hard copy of their PCR test certificate before allowing individuals to board. Please ensure you bring a printed certificate.

If you plan to pass through another country to return to the UK, check the travel advice for the country you’re transiting.
You should contact local authorities for information on testing facilities (only available in French).
Be prepared for your plans to change
No travel is risk-free during COVID. Countries may further restrict travel or bring in new rules at short notice, for example due to a new COVID-19 variant. Check with your travel company or airline for any transport changes which may delay your journey home.
If you test positive for COVID-19, you may need to stay where you are until you test negative. You may also need to seek treatment there.
Plan ahead and make sure you:
can access money
understand what your insurance will cover
can make arrangements to extend your stay and be away for longer than planned
Travel in Algeria
Travel between provinces is now permitted.
Since 1 July 2020, local authorities nationwide have powers to enact additional measures in cluster areas, with the approval of central authorities. As a result, localised lockdowns are possible, and markets and other areas with a high concentration of shops could be shut down with limited notice for at least 15 days.
All security services and local authorities have been instructed to rigorously monitor and enforce compliance with preventive and other social distancing measures. Penalties include fines up to the equivalent of £600, and 6 months imprisonment.
The wearing of facemasks became mandatory on 24 May 2020 in all public spaces, including when using public transport, and within taxis.
Accommodation
Hotels are open, with compulsory sanitary measures in place; facilities may be restricted.
Public places and services
Recreational areas, beaches, cultural centres, sports facilities, restaurants, fast food outlets, cafes and most markets are open. Weddings, funerals and other large gatherings are allowed within certain rules.
