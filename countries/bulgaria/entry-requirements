Entry rules in response to coronavirus (COVID-19)
Entry to Bulgaria
On 23 December the Bulgarian Government announced that it would lift its ban on air travel between Bulgaria and the UK with immediate effect, but with a new Covid-19 testing requirement in place for all travellers to Bulgaria.
A temporary ban on entry, which will continue to be in force even after direct flights have resumed, has been imposed at all air, road, rail and sea border crossings into Bulgaria on travellers arriving from the UK. Passengers who begin their journey in the UK will not be permitted to enter Bulgaria, except for Bulgarian citizens and British nationals who are able to demonstrate that they have valid residence status in Bulgaria, as well as members of their families. Additionally, a small number of other categories of travellers, including medical professionals; those travelling for humanitarian purposes; some seasonal workers; some travellers undertaking trade and investment activities; and transport staff engaged in international passenger transport and haulage are exempted from the travel ban. The travel ban on arrivals from the UK is currently anticipated to remain in place until 31 January 2021.
Further information on the full range of exemptions is available on the following Bulgarian Government web site (in Bulgarian). If you fall into one of the exempted categories, you should contact your travel operator in advance of travel for further information on how to demonstrate your exemption from the travel ban.
Many land borders crossings in the region are restricted or closed for passenger traffic. Furthermore, neighbouring countries are implementing additional health requirements for entry to or departure from Bulgaria including declarations and COVID-19 tests. You should check the relevant FCDO Travel Advice.
If you need to travel, plan ahead and before you travel check border information published by the Ministry of Interior (English and Bulgarian) before you travel.
Quarantine requirements
All those arriving in Bulgaria from the UK, regardless of nationality, are required to self-isolate for 10 or 14 days from the date of arrival. The measure is currently scheduled to be in place until 31 January 2021.
From 00:01 on 24 December, rapid antigen tests will be performed on all travellers arriving by air from the UK. If the result is negative, you will be subject to a ten-day self-isolation period; if the result is positive you will be required to self-isolate for fourteen-days. If you arrive by road, rail or sea –and are not required to undergo a rapid antigen test upon arrival- you will be required to self-isolate for ten days.
From 00:01 on 01 January 2021, all arrivals to Bulgaria from the UK will be required to provide evidence of a PCR test with a negative result undertaken up-to 72 hours before arrival. You should carry a hard-copy certificate showing your negative PCR test result when you travel. Check the list of UK private providers of Coronavirus testing and make arrangements for your test in good time. It may not be possible to secure a test at short notice. Bulgarian citizens and residents who do not provide evidence of a negative PCR-test will be required to self-isolate for a ten-day period.
A small number of travellers are exempted from the quarantine requirement, and from the need to undertake a rapid antigen test upon arrival or to provide evidence of a negative PCR test. These include people transiting through Bulgaria and hauliers and transport crew members of vessels or aircraft
If you’re travelling to Bulgaria from or via another country, you may still be subject to quarantine measures and/or may need to provide evidence of a negative PCR test undertaken no-longer than 72 hours before arrival. Check the latest information on the Ministry of Interior website (English and Bulgarian).

to stay for longer, to work or study, for business travel or for other reasons, you will need to meet the entry requirements set out by Bulgaria. This could mean applying for a visa and/or work permit. You should check with the Bulgarian Embassy what type of visa and/or work permit, if any, you will need
if you are in Bulgaria with a visa or permit, your stay will not count towards the 90-day limit
The 90-day limit for visa-free travel will begin on 1 January 2021. Any days you stay in Bulgaria before 1 January 2021 will not count towards the 90-day limit.

Your passport should be valid for the proposed duration of your stay; you do not need any additional period of validity on your passport beyond this.
Passport validity from 1 January 2021
From 1 January 2021, you must have at least 6 months left on an adult or child passport to travel to most countries in Europe (not including Ireland).
