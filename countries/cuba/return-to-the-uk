Coronavirus guidance is being updated.
Read the Prime Minister’s statement for the latest information.

There are currently no scheduled commercial flight options available to return to the UK from Cuba. The last scheduled commercial flight to Europe left Cuba on 1 April. From midnight on 1 April, the arrival of all commercial and charter flights was suspended by Cuban authorities. That suspension has been extended until 31 July 2020. It could be extended again. You should be in touch with the commercial airline(s) about their plans for scheduled services when the suspension is lifted.
There have been special commercial repatriation flights available since April. Whenever there is one, the information is shared on the Embassy Facebook page and Embassy Twitter account
Future travel options
The UK government is in touch with airlines, the Cuban authorities and other governments to identify commercial options available for you to return to the UK as soon as possible.
The Embassy Facebook page and Embassy Twitter account will be updated when departure options become available, including the information on how to book flights and where to check terms and conditions.
You will need to pay for your return travel to the UK. If departure options are available but you cannot afford the travel costs and have exhausted all other options for getting funds, you may be eligible to apply for an emergency loan from the government. This is a last resort option and you would need to repay the loan when you are back in the UK.
For more information, contact Corporate Travel Management (CTM). CTM are a commercial partner of the FCO and are authorised to administer such loans on behalf of the FCO.
