Commercial flights are operating at a reduced level. Details of flight operations are updated on our Facebook page for further information.
If you live in the UK and are currently visiting Bulgaria, you are strongly advised to return now by the limited commercial options available. Do not run the risk of getting stranded.
UK special charter flights will only operate for priority countries where commercial flights are not possible. You should not assume that these flights will become available in countries where commercial routes are operating. Please do not contact the contracted travel management company if no flight is advertised here.
Road
Restrictions apply at many European land borders, including with Bulgaria, which affect road and rail travel. You should check the travel advice for any countries through which you are considering travel before you depart.
Future travel options
The UK government is working closely with airlines, the Bulgarian authorities and other governments to make sure options are available for you to return to the UK as soon as possible.

You will need to pay for your return travel to the UK. If departure options are available but you cannot afford the travel costs and have exhausted all other options for getting funds, you may be eligible to apply for an emergency loan from the government. This is a last resort option and you would need to repay the loan when you are back in the UK.
For more information, you should contact Corporate Travel Management (CTM). CTM are a commercial partner of the FCO and are authorised to administer such loans on behalf of the FCO.
Travelling to the airport
On 6 May 2020 the Bulgarian authorities lifted the restrictions on travel between cities. There are no longer any police check points and it is not necessary to present a declaration giving the reason(s) for travelling between cities or to the airport.
