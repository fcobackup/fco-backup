International travel
The Algerian authorities have announced that from 15 September 2022, all exceptional measures regulating the entry and stay of foreigners in Algeria have been lifted. Previous regulations are now back in effect. This means:
If you are residing in Algeria, have benefited from an exceptional extension of your residency and you wish to remain in Algeria, you need to renew your residency status with the competent authorities (the police), providing any necessary supporting documents.
If you are a holder of an Algerian residency card which has expired and you wish to return to Algeria, you should apply for the appropriate visa at your nearest Algerian Consulate.
If you are a holder of an Algerian tourist visa and have benefited from an exceptional visa extension, you need to leave Algeria as soon as possible or apply for a justified extension of your visa.
See Entry requirements for further information on rules for entry to Algeria.
Commercial flights are operating. Demand for flights remains high, which you should take into account when making travel arrangements.
Airlines can be contacted via their websites or call centres for more information.
If you are travelling using an indirect route, some transit countries may impose updated restrictions of their own on travel to and from the UK or Algeria. Contact your travel operator before making any booking and consult FCDO Travel Advice for the most up to date information.
As indirect routes to the UK can require an overnight stay, you should consult FCDO Travel Advice for further information on entry and transit requirements.
Please ensure you bring hard copies of any certificates you may require to travel.
Entry and borders
See Entry requirements to find out what you will need to do when you arrive in Algeria.
You should contact local authorities for information on testing facilities (only available in French).
Be prepared for your plans to change
No travel is risk-free during COVID-19. Countries may further restrict travel or bring in new rules at short notice, for example due to a new COVID-19 variant. Check with your travel company or airline for any transport changes which may delay your journey home.
If you test positive for COVID-19, you may need to stay where you are until you test negative. You may also need to seek treatment there.
Plan ahead and make sure you:
can access money
understand what your insurance will cover
can make arrangements to extend your stay and be away for longer than planned
