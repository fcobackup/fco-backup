The cyclone season in Madagascar normally runs from November to April. Coastal areas are particularly affected, and remote areas throughout the country can become inaccessible and suffer damage and contamination to water supplies. You should monitor local and international weather updates from the World Meteorological Organisation (WMO), Meteo Madagascar (French) or FB Cyclone Indien Ocean (French, Malagasy).
Tropical Cyclone Batsirai is projected to make landfall on the east coast of Madagascar by Saturday 5 February, passing through the country on Saturday and Sunday. High winds and waves along the east coast, and heavy rainfall across the country are likely. Flash floods are possible. Much of the country will be on red alert from Friday 4 February, and schools and government services will be closed. Households in flood risk areas may be evacuated. You are advised to stay home or move to a safe location on 4 and 5 February, and follow alerts and instructions from the local authorities. You should monitor the progress of approaching storms on the METEO Madagascar website.
See our Tropical cyclones page for advice about what to do if youâ€™re caught up in a storm.
