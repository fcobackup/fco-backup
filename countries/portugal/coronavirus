Be prepared for your plans to change
No travel is risk-free during COVID-19. Countries may further restrict travel or bring in new rules at short notice, for example due to a new COVID-19 variant. Check with your travel company or airline for any transport changes which may delay your journey home.
If you test positive for COVID-19, you may need to stay where you are until you test negative. You may also need to seek treatment there.
Plan ahead and make sure you:
can access money
understand what your insurance will cover
can make arrangements to extend your stay and be away for longer than planned

There is no longer a requirement to self-isolate if you test positive for COVID-19 in Portugal.
Onward or return travel from Portugal
If you need a pre-departure test for the country you are travelling to or transiting through, you can get one in Portugal including in Madeira and the Azores, by scheduling an appointment at an approved facility or at test sites at the airports. You will not need a prescription, but you will have to show your passport and confirmed travel bookings. You will also have to pay in full. It can take up to 24 hours to get the results.
Travel in Portugal
You should follow the advice of the Portuguese authorities on how best to protect yourself and others, including any measures that they bring in to control the virus.
Some safety precautions are still in force:

wash your hands frequently
Public spaces and services
Mainland Portugal
Most restrictions have been lifted, but you will still need to use a face mask on entry to medical facilities, retirement and nursing homes. This requirement does not apply to children aged 9 and under.
The Portuguese health authority also recommends that you use a face mask at airports, railway stations and transport hubs, on public transport, including taxis, and when travelling by air.

Most restrictions have been lifted, but you will still need to use a face mask on entry to medical facilities, pharmacies and retirement/ nursing homes, or if you test positive for COVID-19.
These measures apply to everyone aged 6 and over.
The Azores
The archipelago of the Azores is in a state of alert. Most restrictions have been lifted, but you will still need to use a face mask on entry to medical facilities, retirement and nursing homes. This measure does not apply to children aged 10 and under.

Face coverings
You should use your face mask, as appropriate, when you enter buildings and keep it on until you leave.
You can be fined if you breach the regulations.
Exemptions from using a face mask differ in Portugal compared to the UK. You may be exempt from using a face mask both indoors and out on medical grounds. You will have to show a declaration from your doctor as evidence that you have a health condition that prevents you from using a face mask.
