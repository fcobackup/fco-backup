Warning
FCDO advises against all but essential travel to parts of Mexico.

Before you travel check that:
your destination can provide the healthcare you may need
you have appropriate travel insurance for local treatment or unexpected medical evacuation
This is particularly important if you have a health condition or are pregnant.
Emergency medical number
Dial 911 and ask for an ambulance.
In Mexico City, you can use the emergency buttons on CCTV cameras across the city which will immediately connect you to the emergency services.
Contact your insurance or medical assistance company promptly if you’re referred to a medical facility for treatment.
Vaccinations
At least 8 weeks before your trip check:
the latest information on vaccinations and health risks in TravelHealthPro’s Mexico guide
where to get vaccines and whether you have to pay on the NHS travel vaccinations page
Altitude sickness is a risk in parts of Mexico. More information about altitude sickness is available from TravelHealthPro (from the UK’s National Travel Health Network and Centre).
Heath risks
Health risks in Mexico include:
Zika virus
Chikungunya virus
Dengue fever
See the ‘Other risks’ section of the TravelHealthPro Mexico guide for more details.
Drink only boiled or bottled water and avoid ice in drinks.
Cyclospora
There has been reported cases of a food and water bug called Cyclospora. This has affected travellers returning from Mexico, particularly from the Riviera Maya region between the months of May and June. Follow the advice on TravelHealthPro.
Air pollution
The levels of air pollution can be high in Mexico City and may aggravate heart, lung or respiratory conditions. Children, the elderly and those with pre-existing medical conditions may be affected. You can check the pollution index levels for many cities in real time.
Medication and pharmacies
The legal status and regulation of some medicines prescribed or bought in the UK can be different in other countries.
Read best practice when travelling with medicines on TravelHealthPro.
The NHS has information on whether you can take your medicine abroad.
Many pharmacies in large cities provide 24/7 service, as well as home deliveries of medication. Any prescription issued outside of Mexico will require a translation into Spanish. It is up to the individual local pharmacy whether they will accept a foreign prescription or not. However, many pharmacies in Mexico also have an onsite GP who can assess a patient and prescribe medication if needed.
Paying for medical treatment
Not all hospitals will agree to deal directly with medical insurance companies. Be prepared to pay for treatment yourself up front and then get a refund.
