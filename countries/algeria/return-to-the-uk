There are currently no commercial options available to return to the UK from Algeria. As of 19 March, all international flights to and from Algeria were suspended, including flights to the UK. All land borders are now closed and ferry services are suspended.
What to do
If you are resident in Algeria, our current advice is that you should remain at home and follow official guidance.
If you cannot leave Algeria at this time, you should:
follow the advice of local authorities, including local measures to help minimise your risk of exposure to coronavirus.
find accommodation that’s suitable for your needs.
keep in regular contact with family and friends at home, so they know you are safe and well.

Future options
The British Embassy in Algiers is in constant contact with airlines, the Algerian authorities and other governments to make sure commercial options for returning to the UK are available as soon as possible.
The Embassy cannot provide further information or advice about departure options over the phone. This travel advice page will be updated if departure options become available. To get the latest information, Sign up for email alerts for Algeria travel advice and follow the British Embassy on Twitter and Facebook.
You will need to pay for your return travel to the UK. If departure options are available but you cannot afford the travel costs and have exhausted all other options for getting funds, you may be eligible to apply for an emergency loan from the government. This is a last resort option and you would need to repay the loan when you are back in the UK.
