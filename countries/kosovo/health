At least 8 weeks before your trip, check the latest country-specific health advice from the National Travel Health Network and Centre (NaTHNaC) on the TravelHealthPro website. Each country-specific page has information on vaccine recommendations, any current health risks or outbreaks, and factsheets with information on staying healthy abroad. Guidance is also available from NHS (Scotland) on the FitForTravel website.
General information on travel vaccinations and a travel health checklist is available on the NHS website. You may then wish to contact your health adviser or pharmacy for advice on other preventive measures and managing any pre-existing medical conditions while you’re abroad.
The legal status and regulation of some medicines prescribed or purchased in the UK can be different in other countries. If you’re travelling with prescription or over-the-counter medicine, read this guidance from NaTHNaC on best practice when travelling with medicines. For further information on the legal status of a specific medicine, you’ll need to contact the embassy, high commission or consulate of the country or territory you’re travelling to.
While travel can be enjoyable, it can sometimes be challenging. There are clear links between mental and physical health, so looking after yourself during travel and when abroad is important. Information on travelling with mental health conditions is available in our guidance page. Further information is also available from the National Travel Health Network and Centre (NaTHNaC).
High levels of air pollution can occur in Kosovo. You can find further information and advice on air quality on the World Health Organization (WHO) website and check air quality levels on the World Air Quality Index Website.
The health system in Kosovo is poorly funded. Hospitals lack specialist equipment and there is a widespread shortage of medicines and other essentials. Many doctors and nurses lack training in modern techniques and practices. A small payment in cash (currently €4) is required for treatment but you should make sure you have adequate travel health insurance and accessible funds to cover the cost of any medical treatment abroad and repatriation.
If you need emergency medical assistance during your trip, dial 94 from a landline or 194 from a mobile and ask for an ambulance. You should contact your insurance/medical assistance company promptly if you are referred to a medical facility for treatment.
Coronavirus (COVID-19)
There is an ongoing outbreak of coronavirus (COVID-19) in China, some other countries in the region and elsewhere.
The authorities in Kosovo have introduced a number of measures to limit the spread of the virus.
Obligatory medical screening will take place at all points of entry and exit to Kosovo from countries judged to be high or medium risk. This may include the potential for further follow-up health measures and restrictions, including compulsory self-quarantine for visitors arriving. Travel from or via France, Germany, Italy and Switzerland is currently known to be affected. You should comply with any additional screening measures put in place by the local authorities.
Some flights and international coach services to and from Kosovo have been temporarily suspended. Keep up to date with information from your tour operator, transport or accommodation provider on the impact on any existing travel plans.
All schools have been closed until 27 March 2020. There are restrictions on large public gatherings. A number of events in Kosovo in the coming weeks and months have been cancelled.
Further information on coronavirus, including advice on preparing for foreign travel and helping reduce the spread of the virus, is available from Public Health England and on the TravelHealthPro website.
Other Diseases
