Cases of coronavirus (COVID-19) have been confirmed in Japan, including in-country transmission. It may cause more severe symptoms in older people, and those with pre-existing medical conditions.
Entry and borders
All passengers arriving in Japan from the UK, as well as from countries listed below, are required to self-isolate for 14 days on arrival at a designated location (such as a hotel or your own home) and to avoid using public transport. This request will remain in place until at least the end of April. These measures do not apply to passengers who are transiting through the same airport and do not go through immigration. If you are transiting using different airports you will need a transit permit on arrival. To get one you will be required to demonstrate timely onward travel plans and show that you will not use public transport to move between airports. You should comply with any additional screening measures put in place by the authorities. You should also check the latest entry requirements for your destination.

As a preventative measure against the spread of coronavirus, the Government of Japan has announced that, unless there are exceptional circumstances, foreign nationals who have visited the following countries or regions within 14 days of arrival in Japan are not permitted to enter:
China: Hubei or Zhejiang provinces
Republic of Korea: The city of Daegu or the neighbouring county of Cheongo; and the cities of Gyeongsan, Andong, Yeoncheo, and counties of Chilgok, Uiseong, Seongju or Gunwi in North Gyeongsang Province.
Iceland
Iran: Qom Province, Tehran Province, Gilan Province, Alborz Province, Isfahan Province, Qazvin Province, Golestan Province, Semnan Province, Mazandaran Province, Markazi Province, Lorestan Province.
Italy: Veneto, Emilia Romagna, Piemonte, Marche, Lombardy, Valle d’Aosta, Trentino-Alto Alge, Friuli-Venezia Giulia, Liguria
San Marino
Spain: Navarra, Basque Country, Madrid, La Rioja
Switzerland: Ticino, Basel Stadt
In addition, those who hold a Chinese passport issued by Hubei or Zhejiang provinces are not permitted to enter Japan. Passenger flights from China and the Republic of Korea have been asked to land at Narita and Kansai international airports, and passenger ferry services to stop operating. Visas issued by the Japanese authorities in China and Korea for future travel to Japan have been cancelled, and visa exemptions for travellers from the Republic of Korea, Hong Kong and Macao have been stopped.
There are enhanced quarantine procedures at entry points to Japan such as airports and ports. The authorities may carry out extended health checks on arrival including compulsory hospitalisation. You should comply with any additional screening measures by the authorities if asked to go through extra checks.
Visas
Japan has suspended its visa waiver system for anyone travelling on a British Citizen or British National (Overseas) passport until at least the end of April 2020. Japan has also suspended single and multiple entry visas issued by Japanese Embassies and Consulate Generals in the UK and those countries to which self-isolation measures apply (listed in the Health section). Anyone arriving in Japan without a valid visa will not be able to enter.
These measures do not apply to passengers who are transiting through the same airport and do not go through immigration. If you are transiting using different airports you will need a transit permit on arrival. To get one you will be required to demonstrate timely onward travel plans and (if arriving from a country for which Japan has travel restrictions) show that you will not use public transport to move between airports. Those already in Japan can remain until their visa waiver expires. Those who still wish to travel to Japan can apply for a visa, but this is likely to take more time than usual. Please check with your nearest Japanese Embassy or Consulate General for further details.
These measures do not impact on the ‘Status of Residence’ of British nationals already living in Japan. British nationals who are living in Japan and are currently outside of Japan with re-entry permission are able to return, unless they have travelled to any of the countries or regions to which an entry ban applies in the 14 days prior to arrival (listed above).
In addition, all passengers arriving from the UK, as well as from countries listed in the Health section, are requested to self-isolate for 14 days on arrival at a designated location (such as a hotel or your own home) and to avoid using public transport. This request will remain in place until at least the end of April 2020. These measures do not apply to passengers who are transiting and do not go through immigration. You should comply with any additional screening measures put in place by the authorities. You should also check the latest entry requirements for your destination.
You are advised to contact your airline or tour operator before you travel, including for updates in relation to cancelled flights. Those who want to return to the UK soon should take account of the fast moving situation and plan accordingly.
If you are concerned that you may overstay your visa as a result of flight cancellations due to COVID-19 restrictions, you should contact Japan’s Immigration Services Agency on +81 570 013 904 or +81 357 967 112.
Local measures
The majority of primary and secondary schools remain closed until the end of regular spring holidays in early April. Many large-scale cultural and sporting events remain cancelled.
