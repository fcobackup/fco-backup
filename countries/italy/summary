The FCDO advises against all but essential travel to:
the whole of Italy based on the current assessment of COVID-19 risks.
If you are returning to the UK from Italy, you will need to self-isolate on your return (unless you are exempt). Check the latest guidance for England, Northern Ireland, Scotland and Wales.
Travel to Italy is subject to entry restrictions
Until 5 March, entry into Italy is only permitted for those with official residency or those with absolute necessity, which must be declared in writing (by the passenger using the self-declaration)
Until 5 March, those wishing to fly must present the airline with a negative COVID-19 rapid antigenic or molecular swab test taken no more than 72 hours before entry into Italy. You must also take a COVID-19 rapid antigenic or molecular swab test within 48 hours of entering Italy – arrivals by air from the UK will take this test at the airport. Whatever the result of the 2 swab tests, those arriving in Italy from the UK must also report to their local health authorities on arrival and self-isolate for 14 days
You will need to download and complete a self-declaration from the Ministry of Interior before you travel
Consult the Italian Government’s online questionnaire (in English) for more advice on entry requirements and travel to Italy
See Entry requirements for more information before you plan to travel.
Preparing for your return journey to the UK

provide your journey and contact details before you travel
check if you need to test before you travel
check if you need to self-isolate on your return
If your return journey to the UK transits another country, you should check whether it is subject to a travel ban or any other additional requirements. If so, contact your travel provider.
