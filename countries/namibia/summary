Namibia has put measures in place to limit the spread of coronavirus (COVID-19), including the closure of ports and border crossings, suspension of all commercial flights in and out of the country. On 30 April, the President announced that the country will move to Stage 2 lockdown from 5 May to 1 June, which relaxes some of the measures previously put in place.
