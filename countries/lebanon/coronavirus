Travel in Lebanon
Lebanon has declared a state of emergency from 14 January to 8 February 2021 due to the rise in number of COVID-19 cases. A total curfew will be in place from 5am on 14 January until 5am on 8 February. Movement is completely prohibited – you must not leave your accommodation. All hospitality businesses and public institutions will close. There are some exemptions for essential work. Food delivery services will be allowed to operate between 5am and 5pm.
The Lebanese government have introduced an online system where you can request an exemption from the curfew for essential purposes e.g. going to a pharmacy. You can do this via text using this link or online via this link. You will need an Arabic speaker to help you with the guidance for texting. The government are working on an English language option.
Beirut International airport will remain open, but land and sea borders will close, apart from for those transiting Beirut airport who hold tickets for flights on that day. All passengers are required to have their tickets with them when transferring to and from the airport. Some exemptions to COVID-19 restrictions are applied to aid workers. For further clarification, aid workers should contact the United Nations for advice.
When travelling to and from the airport, private cars should have no more than four people in them (including the driver). Wearing masks for all passengers is obligatory. Given the total curfew, you are advised to book taxis to and from the airport ahead of time.
Fabric masks covering the mouth and nose must be worn when outside the home and in vehicles (unless travelling alone).
Lebanese authorities may issue fines, impose road blocks, or imprison those violating these measures for up to three years. You should comply with all measures introduced by the Lebanese authorities and obey the instructions of the security forces. These measures may be changed at short notice.
Keep up to date with information from your tour operator, transport or accommodation provider on the impact on any existing travel plans.
