Cases of coronavirus (COVID-19) have been confirmed in The Bahamas. The Bahamian authorities have introduced a number of measures to limit the spread of the virus, including entry restrictions.
From 19 March 2020 foreign nationals who have travelled within the last 20 days from the UK or other parts of Europe will be prohibited entry until 13 April 2020.
