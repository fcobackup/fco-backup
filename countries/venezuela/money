You can spread the virus even if you don’t have symptoms.

Local banknotes are in short supply. Most people use card payments, local bank transfers (“hay punto”) and US dollars instead. Debit or credit card transactions may take longer to go through than expected, or require several attempts. Guard your PIN number and consider a well-recognised pre-payment card to protect you from fraud and theft.
If you run out of money and discover that your bank cards do not work, you can arrange with friends and family overseas to deposit funds into any Western Union branch, and pick up the deposited funds at any Grupo Zoom branch nationwide.
