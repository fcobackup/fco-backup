The Foreign and Commonwealth Office (FCO) is advising British nationals against all non-essential international travel at this time. Existing advice for Myanmar remains in place:
The FCO advise against all but essential travel to:
Rakhine State, except the southern townships (administrative areas similar to a borough or county) of Munaung, Thandwe (including the tourist resort of Ngapali) and Gwa
Paletwa township in southern Chin State
Shan State (North)
Kachin State (except the towns of Myitkyina, Bhamo and Putao).
For more information on these areas, see Local travel
If you are in Myanmar and able to leave, you should do so. This is due to potential pressures on medical facilities and the risk of air routes out of Myanmar being cancelled. The Myanmar authorities have introduced a number of precautionary measures in response to the coronavirus (COVID-19) pandemic. Coronavirus cases have now been confirmed in Myanmar.
As of 1 April, most staff and dependants in the British Embassy have been withdrawn. Core staff remain to continue critical work including consular assistance. See Coronavirus
The Government of Myanmar has suspended all commercial passenger flights from any of its airports. All land borders are shut. See Return to the UK
Take particular care in the border areas with China, Thailand, Bangladesh, India and Laos. The security situation in border areas is often volatile. Border areas have been particularly affected by military activity, ethnic militias, armed drug smugglers and the presence of landmines. There is ongoing conflict in the north of Shan State, Southern Chin, Kachin, Karen/Kayin and northern and central Rakhine states. In these areas, travellers should be prepared for a high armed, military and police presence including passing through checkpoints. There remains the possibility of violent clashes in other border areas. See Border areas
Political tension and unrest could happen at short notice. You should avoid all demonstrations and large gatherings. Don’t take photographs or videos of the police, demonstrations, military installations or military personnel. See Political situation
Terrorists are likely to try to carry out attacks in Myanmar. You should remain vigilant and follow the advice of local authorities. See Terrorism
UK health authorities have classified Myanmar as having a risk of Zika virus transmission. For information and advice about the risks associated with Zika virus, visit the National Travel Health Network and Centre website.
Urban areas, particularly Yangon and Mandalay, can experience poor air quality. See Health
Credit and debit cards are increasingly accepted in major tourist areas but some cards don’t work. Check in advance that your card will work. See Money
Most visits to Myanmar are trouble-free. The most common types of consular assistance cases are related to lost passports, petty theft and road accidents.
If you need to contact local emergency services, call 199 for police, 192 for medical assistance and 191 for the fire service. You should be aware that phone operators may not speak English. Tourist Police outposts are available in Yangon, Bagan and Mandalay with English speaking officers. You can only visit these posts in person and they are not contactable by phone.
If you’re abroad and you need emergency help from the UK government, contact the nearest British embassy, consulate or high commission. We continue to operate a skeleton consular service. However, the ability of the British Embassy to provide face-to-face assistance within Myanmar is currently limited, and would be even more limited in the event that the situation deteriorates further. In any case, consular support is largely unavailable in parts of Myanmar where embassy officials require travel permission from the Myanmar government. Permission is not guaranteed. The British Embassy’s ability to deliver consular assistance, including in an emergency, may be restricted or delayed in these areas. If you’re arrested or detained, ask police or prison officials to notify the British Embassy immediately.
You should always take out comprehensive travel and medical insurance before you travel to any country, particularly to cover medical evacuation to another country if necessary. You may wish to consult your insurance provider on whether cover for coronavirus (COVID-19) treatment is included.
If you’re resident in Myanmar or planning to stay for a longer period, you can find advice on our Living in Myanmar guide.
The Overseas Business Risk service offers information and advice for British companies operating overseas on how to manage political, economic, and business security-related risks.
