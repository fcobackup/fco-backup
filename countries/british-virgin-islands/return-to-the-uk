There are currently no commercial options available to return to the UK from BVI. Borders are closed to all traffic except freight and cargo until 02 June 2020. Private charters can be arranged but permission should be sought for such an arrangement through the BVI Tourist Board. Airports are open for domestic charter flights only from 6am to 12pm daily. Domestic inter island ferries are running a limited schedule. The BVI Tourist Board will be facilitating an additional ferry crossing to the US Virgin Islands on Tuesday 28 April.
If you cannot leave BVI at this time, you should:
follow the advice of local authorities, including local measures to help minimise your risk of exposure to coronavirus
find accommodation that’s suitable for your needs. The BVI Tourist Board can offer advice on accommodation that is available.
keep in regular contact with family and friends at home, so they know you are safe and well

Anyone in BVI should sign up for travel advice alerts for neighbouring countries (USA, Antigua, Barbados and St Maarten) to keep informed of transport options available to the UK.
You will need to pay for your return travel to the UK. If departure options are available but you cannot afford the travel costs and have exhausted all other options for getting funds, you may be eligible to apply for an emergency loan from the government. This is a last resort option and you would need to repay the loan when you are back in the UK. For more information, you should contact Corporate Travel Management (CTM). CTM are a commercial partner of the FCO and are authorised to administer such loans on behalf of the FCO.
