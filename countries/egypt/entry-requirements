This page has information on travelling to Egypt. Check what you must do to return to the UK.
This page reflects the UK government’s understanding of current rules for people travelling on a full ‘British Citizen’ passport from the UK, for the most common types of travel.
The authorities in Egypt set and enforce entry rules.
All travellers
Passengers from all countries will be required to complete a paper health declaration (issued by your airline or on arrival) with personal details, and may need to provide confirmation of valid health insurance policy to airport authorities.
The Egyptian authorities have advised that all arrivals into Egypt will be subject to health measures. Passengers arriving from countries where C19 variants of concern have been identified may be required to undertake a rapid COVID-19 test (ID NOW) on arrival, which if positive will lead to a subsequent PCR test to determine if isolation at a government hospital is necessary. Temperature checks are in place at airports in Egypt. In addition, travellers are required to wear a face mask at all times in the airport terminal.
COVID-19 entry requirements may change at short notice, you should check the specifics, with your airline before you travel.
If you’re fully vaccinated
If you’re fully vaccinated, you can enter Egypt without needing to test or quarantine.
At least 14 days must have passed since the full course of a vaccine. Vaccines must be approved by the Egyptian Drug Authority or World Health Organization. These currently include either Pfizer, Moderna, AstraZeneca, Sinopharm, Sinovac, Sputnik V, or Janssen (Johnson and Johnson) vaccines.
Passengers arriving from countries where COVID-19 variants of concern have been identified may still be required to undertake a rapid COVID-19 test (ID NOW) on arrival.
Proof of vaccination status
You must present proof that you have been fully vaccinated to enter Egypt.
Egypt will accept the UK’s proof of COVID-19 vaccination record. Your final vaccine dose must have been administered at least 14 prior to travel. Your NHS appointment card from vaccination centres is not designed to be used as proof of vaccination and should not be used to demonstrate your vaccine status.
The Egyptian authorities have advised that COVID-19 vaccination certificates (paper or electronic) must be issued by an accredited laboratory in the country of issue and linked with a verifiable QR code.
If you’re not fully vaccinated
If you’re not fully vaccinated, you’ll need to show proof of a negative PCR test, or either a COVID-19 ID NOW or rapid antigen test (taken no more than 72 hours before arrival in Egypt). Proof of COVID-19 recovery will not be accepted. See information on getting a test before entry.
Passengers arriving from London Heathrow only are permitted to have their PCR test conducted no more than 96 hours prior to arrival in Egypt. All variations of C19 test certificates must be issued by an accredited laboratory in the country of issue, must have the date and time of sample withdrawal, and must be stamped or have a QR code.
Entry to Red Sea (Hurghada and Marsa Alam), South Sinai (Sharm El Sheikh), and Marsa Matrouh if you’re not fully vaccinated
The Egyptian authorities have advised that unvaccinated tourists arriving directly at airports in the coastal governorates of the Red Sea (Hurghada and Marsa Alam), South Sinai (Sharm El Sheikh), and Marsa Matrouh have the option of taking a PCR test on arrival for a fee of USD30. After testing you will be required to self-isolate at your hotel until you receive your test result. The Egyptian authorities will be in touch and will advise whether you need to continue self-isolating. Test results are expected to become available within 12 to 24 hours.
Children and young people
Children under the age of 12 can follow the rules for fully vaccinated travellers to enter.

Check your passport and travel documents before you travel
Passport validity
If you are visiting Egypt your passport should be valid for 6 months from the date you arrive.
Check with your travel provider to make sure your passport and other travel documents meet their requirements.
Visas
British passport holders travelling to Egypt normally need a visa.
You can get a visa before you travel from the official Visa2Egypt portal or your nearest Egyptian consulate. Tourist visas granted using the e-visa system are valid for a maximum of 3 months. It is advisable to get a visa before you travel, particularly if travelling for work or business.
If you wish to get a visa on arrival, you can do so at approved bank kiosks within airport arrival halls, before reaching immigration counters. The visa fee is US$25, payable in US dollars as the preferred currency, although you may also be able to pay in pounds sterling or euros. Visas granted on arrival are valid for a maximum of 30 days. There’s no need to buy a visa from an agent. In many cases agents will charge more than US$25 for a visa. If you’re harassed by an agent, report the incident to the tourist police in the airport terminal.
If you’re travelling to Sharm el Sheikh, Dahab, Nuweiba and Taba resorts for up to 15 days, you will receive a free entry permission stamp upon arrival. If you intend to travel out of these areas or stay longer than 15 days, you must get a visa.
If you have travelled to one of the South Sinai Red Sea resorts, entered without a visa and your plans have changed, you can normally purchase a visa at Sharm el Sheikh airport to allow you to travel elsewhere.
Applications for visa extensions should be made at Egyptian Passport and Immigration Offices. You may have difficulties leaving Egypt with an out of date visa. You will not normally be allowed to leave without paying a fine if your visa is out of date by more than 14 days.
For further information and enquiries, contact the Egyptian Consulate in London.
UK Emergency Travel Documents
UK Emergency Travel Documents (ETDs) are accepted for exit from Egypt, but not accepted for entry or transit. To leave Egypt on an ETD you will need to visit an Egyptian Passport and Immigration Office to complete the exit formalities. Some passport offices outside of Cairo may assist, but in many cases you will have to complete the formalities at the Passport and Immigration Office, 12 Al Seka Al Bayda, Sarayat, Waily, Abbassia, (next to the Abbassia Police Academy), Cairo. Tel: 00227956301. Opening hours for the office are 8am to 2.30pm, Saturday to Thursday. Immigration clearance may take up to 5 working days for tourists and up to 2 weeks for residents. You should adjust your travel plans accordingly.
Yellow fever certificate requirements
Check whether you need a yellow fever certificate by visiting the National Travel Health Network and Centre’s TravelHealthPro website.
Previous travel to Israel
Evidence of a previous visit to Israel like as an Israeli entry/exit stamp in your passport does not normally cause any difficulties when entering Egypt. It is, however, for the Egyptian authorities to determine the right of entry into the country. If you have any concerns, you should contact the Egyptian consulate.
Work permits
Evidence of testing for HIV is required if you are applying for a work permit.
Medication
Some prescribed and over the counter medicines that are available in the UK are considered controlled substances in Egypt and can’t be brought into the country without prior permission from Egypt’s Ministry of Health. If you arrive in Egypt without this permission and the required documentation, the medication will not be allowed into the country and you may be prosecuted under Egyptian law.
If you’re travelling with prescription medication you should carry a medical certificate confirming that the medication has been prescribed for a medical condition. The Egyptian Embassy website states that this should be in the form of an official letter from your GP, specifying details of your condition, the quantity of medication you will be carrying and that the medication is for your personal use only.
For further information and specific queries, contact the Egyptian Medical Office in London on 020 7370 6944.
Customs regulations
There’s a limit of 5,000 Egyptian pounds that you are allowed to bring in or take out of Egypt. There is no limit to the amount of hard currency that you may bring in, but sums that exceed USD 10,000 should be declared on arrival. Certain valuables like electrical equipment, video cameras etc must be declared on arrival. Satellite phones and radio communications equipment brought into Egypt without prior clearance from the Ministry of Telecommunications are likely to be confiscated. Electrical items noted in passports on entry to Egypt must be produced on exit from the country. Failure to do so will result in payment of high rates of customs duty. Contact the Egyptian embassy in your country of residence for further information on customs requirements.
