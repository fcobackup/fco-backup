The information on this page covers the most common types of travel and reflects the UK government’s understanding of the rules currently in place. Unless otherwise stated, this information is for travellers using a full ‘British Citizen’ passport.
The authorities in the country or territory you’re travelling to are responsible for setting and enforcing the rules for entry. If you’re unclear about any aspect of the entry requirements, or you need further reassurance, you’ll need to contact the embassy, high commission or consulate of the country or territory you’re travelling to.
You should also consider checking with your transport provider or travel company to make sure your passport and other travel documents meet their requirements.
Entry rules in response to coronavirus (COVID-19)
Entry to Bangladesh
Bangladesh authorities have said passengers arriving from coronavirus-affected countries, including the UK, should complete Health Declaration Forms and Passenger Locator Forms provided by cabin crew. You may be subjected to additional health screening measures at the airport.
Medical certificate
On arrival in Bangladesh, all foreign nationals need to produce a medical certificate issued within 72 hours of travel indicating the passenger is COVID-19 negative. You should not use the NHS testing service to get a test in order to facilitate your travel to another country. You should arrange to take a private test.
Quarantine requirements
Passengers, regardless of nationality, originating from Argentina, Bahrain, Brazil, Chile, Europe (not the UK), Jordan, Kuwait, Lebanon, Peru, Qatar, South Africa, Turkey and Uruguay will not be permitted to enter Bangladesh. Whilst transiting through these countries is permitted, should you exit the airport at your transit point your COVID-19 negative certificate will become void. You will then be required to complete a period of institutional quarantine on arrival in Bangladesh for a minimum of four days and until you are able to test negative for COVID 19.
Passengers, regardless of nationality, originating from the UK or elsewhere (excluding Argentina, Bahrain, Brazil, Chile, Europe, Jordan, Kuwait, Lebanon, Peru, Qatar, South Africa, Turkey and Uruguay), will be subject to an assessment by health officials at the point of entry to Bangladesh. They will assess whether you are able to self-quarantine for 14 days or need to be taken to a government facility or government approved hotel.
Passengers with a No Visa Required certificate (an arrangement for foreign nationals of Bangladeshi heritage) arriving in Bangladesh without a medical certificate indicating they are COVID-19 negative, or such passengers who display symptoms, will be transferred to a government facility where their quarantine period will be assessed and determined.
Regular entry requirements
Visas
You’ll need a visa to enter Bangladesh. You can get a visa from the Bangladesh High Commission in London. Foreign investors and business people can apply for a visa on arrival on entry to Bangladesh on production of a PCR based COVID-19 negative medical certificate (in or with an English translation) issued within 72 hours of arriving in Bangladesh and the relevant supporting documents for getting an investment/business visa. Visas on arrival for other people remain suspended.
Foreign nationals currently in Bangladesh whose visas have expired have the option to extend their visa. There is a visa extension fee for this service, in addition to a penalty fee for overstaying. Visa extensions are available at the Department of Immigration and Passport of Bangladesh.
If you intend to use Dhaka as a hub to visit other countries in the region, make sure you get a multiple entry visa. If you’re intending to work in Bangladesh make sure you get the correct visa before you travel.
If you have had your passport renewed in Bangladesh, you’ll need a new visa. The Bangladesh Immigration & Passport Department (telephone: 880 2 8159878 / 8123788 / 8123323) is able to issue an ‘exit visa’ or a ‘no visa required’ stamp. Officers there are unlikely to speak English, so you may need an interpreter.
Make sure you have an entry stamp placed in your passport on entry into Bangladesh otherwise you may have problems on departure.
Passport validity
Your passport should be valid for at least 6 months when applying for a visa to visit Bangladesh.
UK Emergency Travel Documents
UK Emergency Travel Documents (ETDs) are accepted for entry, airside transit and exit from Bangladesh. Holders of an ETD must apply for the appropriate Bangladesh visa to enter Bangladesh.
Yellow fever certificate requirements
Check whether you need a yellow fever certificate by visiting the National Travel Health Network and Centre’s TravelHealthPro website.
Working in Bangladesh
Foreign nationals working in Bangladesh must get an Income Tax Clearance Certificate or an Income Tax Exemption Certificate before each departure from Bangladesh. Full details are available on the Bangladesh Board of Revenue website.
