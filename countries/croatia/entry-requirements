Entry rules in response to coronavirus
Entry to Croatia
On 30 November, the Croatian authorities announced new border controls restricting arrivals into Croatia to curb the spread of COVID-19. These came into force from 1 December to 15 December, and have been extended until 15 January 2021.
Croatia currently restricts the entry of foreign nationals to those arriving from the EU, EEA and the United Kingdom. UK nationals travelling to Croatia should present a negative PCR test that is no older than 48 hours on arrival, or isolate until a negative test result has been obtained locally. Those travelling from any country that is marked green on the ECDC ‘Combined Indicator’ Map are exempt from this requirement. Details of eligibility to travel, possible exemptions, and instructions for arrivals are available from the Ministry of Interior.
Tests are not available at Croatia’s airports. Those seeking a test on arrival will need to contact a clinic directly and may temporarily leave their accommodation to attend a test appointment. More information about testing centres in Croatia is available here. Tests cost approximately 700 Croatian Kuna and results are generally available within 48 hours.
Quarantine requirements
UK nationals travelling to Croatia should produce a negative COVID test on arrival in Croatia or to self-isolate for a period of 10 days or until a negative test result has been obtained locally. Travellers are advised to check the latest situation with the Croatian authorities before starting a journey, as health requirements may change. It is mandatory for passengers to wear masks on public transport and taxis and in shops and other commercial premises.
Screening on arrival
The Croatian government has introduced a new online entry form to expedite the entry of foreign visitors. You are advised to carry a copy of your accommodation booking or proof of ownership of holiday homes / boats when arriving in Croatia. If you are travelling to Croatia for business, you are advised to carry evidence of a business invitation or meetings.
Restrictions on travel may change at any time. You should check the latest regulations before travelling on the Croatian government website. British citizens are permitted to leave Croatia and it remains possible to return to the UK by air and road.
