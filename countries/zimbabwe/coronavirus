Travel restrictions
Commercial airlines have reduced or suspended flights in to and out of Zimbabwe. You should consult your airline and travel insurance company immediately to understand what impact this will have for your travel plans. You should ensure you have accommodation for this entire period as some hotels may close at short notice. If you take regular medication, you should ensure you have a sufficient supply.
Local measures
President Mnangagwa announced on 30 March that everybody in Zimbabwe must stay at home, except to buy essential food or medicine. Only certain categories of key workers are exempt. You should comply with this requirement, wherever you are staying in Zimbabwe.
It is compulsory to wear a face mask covering the nose and mouth whenever you are outside of your home.
All gatherings of more than 50 people are prohibited, unless you need to access an essential service in which case you should try to maintain social distance.
The Government of Zimbabwe has said that anyone displaying a symptom associated with coronavirus will be placed in a Government of Zimbabwe facility for testing. Anyone who tests positive will be treated in a Government of Zimbabwe treatment centre. Reports suggest that some foreign nationals are being quarantined for 21 days on arrival at Harare airport despite testing negative for coronavirus (COVID-19).
