Myanmar has suspended all scheduled commercial passenger flights in and out of the country, and sealed off all of its land borders to foreigners. International airports will not re-open to scheduled commercial inbound flights to Myanmar before 30 November.
The UK government continues to work with the Myanmar authorities and other governments to support British nationals to return to the UK.
If you cannot leave Myanmar at this time, see advice on staying in Myanmar during coronavirus.
Flights
There are limited options for British nationals looking to return to the UK.
Myanmar Airways International and Korean Air are operating some relief flights from Yangon to Seoul. You should visit the Myanmar Airways International website and Korean Air website for updated information and requirements and to book tickets. From Seoul connections to the UK are available but there are strict rules on transit passengers and these are subject to change regularly. Please speak to the South Korean Embassy before booking to check the latest details.
Your temperature will be checked on arrival and if high, a COVID test will follow. A positive result will lead to hospitalisation in South Korea.
There may be relief flights organised by other airlines and to other destinations. You should contact airlines for information on flight schedules and any additional requirements. Please contact the embassy, high commission or consulate of the country or territory you’re travelling to before booking to check the latest details, including transit rules.
Your airline may require a negative COVID-19 test result prior to travel as well as a confirmed onward ticket. Check directly with the airline for the most up to date information.
Testing in Myanmar can be provided by the National Health Laboratory in Yangon (telephone: +95 1 371957) or the Public Health Laboratory in Mandalay (telephone 02 39839). There is a cost for this test, and the process can be lengthy and subject to change at short notice. You must register in person for an appointment and be prepared to present your flight ticket and passport. This is so that the Laboratory can confirm you are booked onto a relief flight and registered as a passenger with the Myanmar Ministry of Foreign Affairs. You may wish to confirm with your airline in advance of booking a test that you have been registered with the Ministry of Foreign Affairs. The British Embassy have not been informed by the Government of Myanmar of any requirement for them to provide a letter to support requests for a test by British nationals. If the Laboratory asks for this, you should inform them of your flight booking and registration with the Ministry of Foreign Affairs. Not securing a test may impact your ability to travel to your destination.
Your journey home: re-entering the UK
When you return, you must follow the rules for entering the UK. You:
need to provide your journey and contact details up to 48 hours before you’re due to arrive in the UK
are not allowed to leave the place you’re staying for the first 14 days you’re in the UK except in very limited situations (known as ‘self-isolating’) See also the list of people who are exempt from the border rules.
The National Travel Health Network and Centre (NaTHNaC) also provides advice on how to stay safe as you travel by air.
Help and support
You will need to pay for your return travel to the UK. If departure options are available but you cannot afford the travel costs and have exhausted all other options for getting funds, you may be eligible to apply for an emergency loan from the government. For information on financial support you can access whilst abroad, see our financial assistance guidance.
The Embassy cannot provide further information or advice about departure options over the phone. To get the latest information, sign up for travel advice email alerts.
