Immigration rules regarding parents and adults travelling with children (under 18) to show the child’s full unabridged birth certificate have been partially relaxed. However, as South Africa reserves the right to request a copy of the child’s unabridged birth certificate at the discretion of individual immigration officers before granting entry, we recommend that you are prepared to present the unabridged birth certificate to border officials upon arrival, particularly where one parent’s surname differs from the child’s. There are additional requirements if the child is travelling with only the one parent, with neither biological parent, or unaccompanied. See Entry requirements
There is a very high level of crime including rape and murder in South Africa. The most violent crimes tend to occur in townships, remote and isolated areas and away from the normal tourist destinations. Most visits to South Africa are trouble-free, but you should take sensible precautions to protect your safety. Crime increases in areas where large crowds gather, so be particularly vigilant if you’re attending sporting or other events that attract large numbers. See Safety and security

There are regular protest marches and strike related demonstrations across South Africa, which can turn violent. Such marches and demonstrations can occur anywhere in South Africa, sometimes at short notice.

Don’t attempt to cross protester roadblocks as this could provoke a violent reaction. You should monitor local and social media for updates.
