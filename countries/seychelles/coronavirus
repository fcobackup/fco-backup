If you plan to pass through another country to return to the UK, check the travel advice for the country you’re transiting.
Be prepared for your plans to change
No travel is risk-free during COVID-19. Countries may further restrict travel or bring in new rules at short notice, for example due to a new COVID-19 variant. Check with your travel company or airline for any transport changes which may delay your journey home.
Plan ahead and make sure you:
can access money
understand what your insurance will cover
can make arrangements to extend your stay and be away for longer than planned
If you test positive for COVID-19 before returning to the UK
The Government of Seychelles does not routinely require travellers to take a PCR test before departure. Airlines or final destinations, however, may require it, and you should check the requirements if necessary. Visitors who develop symptoms of a possible respiratory infection will be referred to health services for further assessment and testing. You can expect to be contacted by the authorities in Seychelles if you test positive for COVID-19. If you display severe symptoms, particularly if you are in an at-risk category, then you may be cared for at a government-run facility.
Symptomatic Cases
The Seychelles Department of Foreign Affairs and Tourism has produced a travel advisory which details the standard procedures for visitors who develop symptoms. Visitors who develop symptoms of possible respiratory infection (fever, cough, shortness of breath, or loss of smell/taste) will be referred to the health services for further assessment. If a visitor is found to be infected with COVID-19, the Public Health Authority requires that the person is isolated from the population and other visitors until recovery from infection. Symptomatic cases, especially for those in ‘high-risk’ categories will be cared for in a health-managed isolation facility.
Asymptomatic Cases
Asymptomatic/mildly symptomatic cases must undergo isolation at a certified tourism accommodation establishment at their own cost.
People who are asymptomatic throughout their self-isolation can expect to self-isolate for 10 days, while mildly symptomatic visitors must self-isolate for 14 days. Guests may not change accommodation during a period of self-isolation without the permission of the Public Health Authority.
If parents are required to self-isolate, then minors will be expected to stay with them or with other family members. Unaccompanied minors (i.e. under 18 years of age) will normally be treated as adults.
If you are travelling with children, you should contact the Seychelles Ministry of Health before you travel to confirm you are satisfied with the procedures in place should you be required to self-isolate during your stay.
Travel in Seychelles
Some restrictions within Seychelles are still in effect for unvaccinated travellers. You should follow the advice of the local authorities. See the health and stay conditions for travellers from the Seychelles Foreign Affairs Department for further details.
Accommodation
Visitors are free to stay at any health certified tourism accommodation establishment. If you have made a booking, or are unclear whether your accommodation is considered COVID-19 safe, you should make contact with your tour operator or hotel proprietor before travelling to Seychelles.
Public spaces and services
The Government of Seychelles has lifted most of its COVID-19 restrictions, including the restrictions on movement imposed between 11pm and 4am.
It is now optional to wear a face mask when outdoors. However, wearing face masks remains mandatory on buses and other public transport such as taxis, boats and planes.
Restrictions are enforceable by law and can change at short notice. You should consult the Ministry of Health in Seychelles for further information and monitor local media for the latest developments.
