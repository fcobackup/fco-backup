From 8 May 2021 travellers from the United Kingdom, Ethiopia, Kenya, South Africa, South Sudan, Tanzania, Turkey, the United Arab Emirates and the United States are required to undergo PCR testing at the border at their own expense, including at Entebbe International Airport, unless they have received their full COVID-19 vaccination and show no COVID-19 symptoms. The cost of the PCR test will be up $65. Travellers from the above countries will be taken from the airport to a nearby testing site. Test results will take up to 4 hours. Travellers have the option of waiting at the testing site for their results or checking into a designated hotel at their own expense. Anyone who tests positive (including children) will be taken to a Ministry of Health designated COVID-19 isolation facility. As of 2 May 2021, passengers who have been in India in the previous 14 days will not be permitted entry into Uganda.

Healthcare in Uganda
There are a number of public and private COVID-19 tests centres in Uganda. For further information on the outbreak in Uganda, please see the Ugandan Government COVID-19 Response website.
If a foreign national tests positive for COVID-19 and wishes to be repatriated for treatment outside of Uganda, they will be expected to cover the costs themselves.
For contact details for English speaking doctors, if you are running low on medication or require emergency medical treatment, you should contact one of the medical practitioners on this list. They will be able to discuss your situation over the phone and advise on the best course of action. Some hospitals and pharmacies are able to deliver medication to you. All major pharmacies in Kampala and surrounding towns are able to read and understand prescriptions issued by UK doctors. UK issued prescriptions are accepted but you should be aware that pharmacies in Uganda do not always stock the same range of medication found in UK pharmacies. British nationals are therefore advised to travel with adequate stocks of their medication for the duration of their stay in Uganda.
Your emotional and mental wellbeing is important. Read guidance on how to look after your mental wellbeing and mental health.

COVID-19 vaccines if you live in Uganda
Wherever possible British nationals should aim to be vaccinated in the country where they live. As further information is available about the national vaccination programme, this page will be updated. Sign up to get email notifications.
The Ugandan Ministry of Health’s national COVID19 vaccination programme began on 10 March 2021. If you are resident in Uganda you can access the vaccine in line with the eligibility requirements and order of prioritisation as set out by the Ministry of Health. More information is available at the Ministry of Heath’s COVID-19 vaccination webpage.
You should continue to monitor the Ugandan Ministry of Health website and twitter for further information on how to obtain the vaccine.
The Medicines and Healthcare Products Regulatory Agency (MHRA) is the UK authority responsible for assessing the safety, quality and efficacy of vaccines. It has authorised the Pfizer/BioNTech, Oxford/AstraZeneca and Moderna vaccines for temporary supply and use in the UK. Find out more about MHRA approval for these vaccines.
British nationals living overseas should seek medical advice from their local healthcare provider in the country where they reside. Information about vaccines used in other national programmes, including regulatory status, should be available from the local authorities. This list of Stringent Regulatory Authorities recognised by the World Health Organisation may also be a useful source of additional information. Find out more information about the COVID-19 vaccines on the World Health Organization COVID-19 vaccines page.
