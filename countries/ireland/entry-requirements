This page has information on travelling to Ireland. Check what you must do to return to the UK.
This page reflects the UK government’s understanding of current rules for people travelling on a full ‘British Citizen’ passport from the UK, for the most common types of travel.
The authorities in Ireland set and enforce entry rules.
All travellers
Travellers arriving into Ireland should follow the Irish government guidance.
Passenger Locator Form
All travellers to Ireland must fill out a Passenger Locator Form before departure. Failure to complete this form is an offence. See Irish Government guidance on completing the form online, who is exempt, and penalties for failure to submit an online form. The Passenger Locator Form will be checked by air or sea carriers before departure.
Individuals travelling from Great Britain to Ireland via Northern Ireland should also complete a Passenger Locator Form. Passengers will also be asked for proof of vaccination or recovery, or to present evidence of a negative RT-PCR or antigen test taken within 48 or 72 hours prior to arrival in the country (see below).
Pre-departure Test
From midnight on Sunday 5 December 2021 anyone travelling to Ireland, regardless of vaccination status, has to show a negative COVID-19 test. This includes travellers from Great Britain, but not those whose journey originates in Northern Ireland (see specific guidance for these travellers below).
Post-Arrival Tests
On 9 December the Irish Government announced that it advises travellers arriving from Great Britain to undertake daily antigen tests for 5 consecutive days, beginning with the day of arrival, and to self-isolate immediately and seek a PCR test if they develop symptoms or have a positive antigen test.
If you’re fully vaccinated
If you have proof of vaccination you may show either a negative antigen test which was carried out by an approved professional no more than 48 hours before arrival in Ireland (not self-administered) or a negative PCR test which was carried out no more than 72 hours before arrival. You should visit the Irish government website for more details.
Proof of vaccination status
Fully vaccinated or recovered passengers travelling from Great Britain to Ireland will need to have proof of their full vaccination or recovery record.
For more information on the Irish Government’s definition of fully vaccinated, see the Irish Government website. On 15 November the Irish Government expanded its list of approved vaccinations and vaccine combinations for travel purposes.
Ireland will accept the UK’s proof of COVID-19 recovery and vaccination record. If you are travelling with a printed PDF proof of vaccination status, it must date from 1 November 2021 to ensure that the certificate can be scanned successfully. Your NHS appointment card from vaccination centres is not designed to be used as proof of vaccination and should not be used to demonstrate your vaccine status.
If you’re not fully vaccinated
If you’re not fully vaccinated, you’ll need to show proof of a negative PCR test (taken no more than 72 hours before entry). See information on getting a test before entry.
If you’ve had COVID-19 in the past year
Ireland will accept the UK’s proof of COVID-19 recovery record.
If you have proof of recovery from COVID-19 you may show either a negative antigen test, which was carried out by an approved professional no more than 48 hours before arrival in Ireland (not self-administered), or a negative PCR test, which was carried out no more than 72 hours before arrival.
Children and young people
Children aged 11 and under will not need to take a test prior to travelling to Ireland. Travelling to Ireland from Northern Ireland
Travelling to Ireland from Northern Ireland
If you’re travelling to Ireland from Northern Ireland and have not been outside of Northern Ireland or Ireland in the past 14 days, you do not need a Passenger Locator Form, proof of vaccination, recovery or test results upon arrival into Ireland.
If you have been outside of Northern Ireland or Ireland in the past 14 days, you are subject to the requirements based on your travel history and vaccination or recovery status.
If you’re transiting through the Common Travel Area
If you have visited any countries on the red lists for England, Scotland, Wales or Northern Ireland in the previous 10 days you will need to follow the rules on Mandatory Hotel Quarantine in England, Scotland or Northern Ireland (if this is your first port of entry into the CTA) before you travel to Ireland. There are separate restrictions in place in Wales. Please see rules for travel and transit in England, Scotland, Wales and Northern Ireland.
Travel from scheduled states
The Irish government announced on 26 November additional measures for travellers arriving in Ireland from:
Botswana
Eswatini
Lesotho
Mozambique
Namibia
South Africa
Zimbabwe
If you are travelling from one of these counties (referred to as “scheduled states”) there are different entry and quarantine requirements than for travellers from “non-scheduled” states.
If you are travelling from a “scheduled state” you will need to comply with additional measures. These include restrictions on travelling to Ireland if you have been in these states in the past 14 days with limited exemptions, including for Irish, UK and EU citizens and Irish residents or those with EU freedom of movement rights.
Travellers who are authorised to travel to Ireland are required to provide a pre-departure PCR test taken within 72 hours of arrival, undergo home quarantine for 14 days on arrival regardless of vaccine/recovery/test status, and undertake post-arrival PCR testing during quarantine on days 2 and 8.
Post-arrival quarantine is no longer required upon entry to Ireland for any other category of traveller but there are pre-departure requirements in place.
Exemptions
There are specific exemptions to the requirements above. You should visit the Irish government website for more details.
If you are a British or Irish citizen, find more information on travelling between the UK, Isle of Man, Guernsey, Jersey or Ireland under the Common Travel Area arrangements.
Check your passport and travel documents before you travel
ID
Ireland, along with the UK, is a member of the Common Travel Area. British nationals travelling from the UK don’t need a passport to visit Ireland. However, Irish immigration officers will check the ID of all passengers arriving by air from the UK and may ask for proof of nationality, particularly if you were born outside the UK. You are therefore advised to take your British passport with you.
For more information about the types of ID you might be asked to present, see the Ireland Citizens Information Board website.
Before travelling, check with your carrier about their ID requirements, as most airlines and other transport providers won’t carry passengers to and from Ireland unless they’ve seen satisfactory photographic ID.
Passport validity
If you’re using a passport to enter Ireland, it should be valid and in date. You should also check your air or sea carrier’s terms and conditions of travel. For journeys on the island of Ireland, British and Irish citizens do not require any travel documents when crossing the land border.
UK Emergency Travel Documents
UK Emergency Travel Documents (ETDs) are accepted for entry into, transit through, and exit from Ireland.
Travelling with pets
Read the Irish government’s entry requirements for your pet.
If you wish to travel with a pet to the EU, read our guidance.
If your pet passport was issued in an EU Member State it remains valid for travel to Ireland.
