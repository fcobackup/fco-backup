Regular entry requirements
Visas
If you hold a British Citizen passport, you don’t need a visa to enter Liechtenstein. If you’re planning a stay of longer than 3 months, see the Living in Liechtenstein guide and contact the Swiss Embassy in London if you have further questions.
The rules on travel will stay the same until 31 December 2020.
Visas from 1 January 2021
The rules for travelling or working in Europe will change from 1 January 2021:
you will be able to travel to countries in the Schengen area for up to 90 days in any 180-day period without a visa as a tourist, to visit family or friends, to attend business meetings, cultural or sports events, or for short-term studies or training.
if you are travelling to Liechtenstein and other Schengen countries without a visa, make sure your whole visit is within the limit. Visits to Schengen countries within the previous 180 days before you travel would count towards the 90-day limit
to stay for longer, to work or study, for business travel or for other reasons, you will need to meet the entry requirements set out by Liechtenstein. This could mean applying for a visa and/or work permit. You should check with the Swiss Embassy in London what type of visa and/or work permit, if any, you will need
if you are in Liechtenstein with a visa or permit, your stay will not count towards the 90-day limit
The 90-day limit for visa-free travel will begin on 1 January 2021. Any days you stay in Liechtenstein or other Schengen countries before 1 January 2021 will not count towards the 90-day limit.
At border control for Liechtenstein you may need to:
show a return or onward ticket
show you have enough money for your stay, and
use separate lanes from EU, EEA and Swiss citizens when queueing
Your passport may be stamped on entry and exit.
Passport validity
The rules on travel will stay the same until 31 December 2020.
Your passport should be valid for the proposed duration of your stay; you don’t need any additional period of validity on your passport beyond this.
Passport validity from 1 January 2021
From 1 January 2021, you must have at least 6 months left on an adult or child passport to travel to most countries in Europe (not including Ireland).
If you renewed your current passport before the previous one expired, extra months may have been added to its expiry date. Any extra months on your passport over 10 years may not count towards the 6 months needed.
Check your passport is valid for travel before you book your trip. You will need to renew your passport before travelling if you do not have enough time left on your passport.
UK Emergency Travel Documents (ETDs)
UK ETDs are accepted for entry and exit from Liechtenstein.
Working in Liechtenstein
If you intend to work in Liechtenstein, you should get detailed information on employment regulations from the Migration and Passport Office (in German).
