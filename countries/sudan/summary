Following political developments on 11 April 2019, when Sudan’s President was removed and a Transitional Military Council established, the situation in Khartoum is calm. However, sizeable protests are continuing, focused around a site immediately outside the Military Headquarters to the north of Khartoum airport. These have largely been peaceful, but this could change rapidly. If you’re in Sudan, you should maintain a high level of vigilance, monitor developments closely, avoid all protests and large gatherings, and follow the instructions of the local authorities and security services. See Political situation
During the current extended period of protests, there have been sporadic limitations on access to internet-based communications and social media sites. Virtual Private Networks (VPNs) are not readily available to download in Sudan.
If you intend to travel outside of Khartoum and around the wider country, plan ahead and seek information on the situation in districts you propose travelling to or through before departing. Check regularly with your airline for the latest information on the status of your flight before travelling to Khartoum airport. See Local travel - Khartoum
The ability of the British Embassy to provide consular support to British nationals in Sudan is severely limited. You shouldn’t assume that the FCO will be able to provide assistance to leave the country in the event of serious unrest, a further deterioration in the security situation and/or reduced capacity of commercial flights. See this page for more information about the precautions you should take in the event of a crisis and the help and support the British Embassy can provide.
On a number of occasions since the beginning of 2018, there have been shortages of fuel throughout Sudan including in Khartoum. At times these have led to very long queues (several hours or even overnight) at petrol stations (which regularly run dry) and rationing of the commercial supply. Earlier in the year, the shortages had knock on effects, including availability of services and some basic food items. There have been some violent incidents at petrol stations. If you need to travel by road, consider how you will get fuel during your journey and whether you have sufficient fuel for your return trip.
On 30 December 2017, President Omar Al Bashir announced a state of emergency in the states of Kassala and North Kordofan, which remains in place. States of emergency give the authorities increased powers of arrest in these areas. The border between Sudan and Ethiopia was closed suddenly on 28 April 2019. On 31 January 2019 the border between Sudan and Eritrea was reopened, having been closed since January 2018. A heavy security presence remains in the area.
Terrorists are likely to try to carry out attacks in Sudan. Attacks could be indiscriminate, including in places frequented by expatriates and foreign travellers. See Terrorism
