Terrorism
There is a high threat of terrorist attack globally affecting UK interests and British nationals, including from groups and individuals who view the UK and British nationals as targets. You should remain vigilant at all times.
UK Counter Terrorism Policing has information and advice on staying safe abroad and what to do in the event of a terrorist attack. Find out how to reduce your risk from terrorism while abroad.
Terrorism in Albania
Terrorist attacks in Albania cannot be ruled out.
Attacks could be indiscriminate, including places visited by foreigners. Terrorists may target religious sites, including churches.
Political situation
Political and other demonstrations have been held in central Tirana, with some reported incidents of violence. Demonstrations can cause traffic diversions and other disruption. Demonstrations could happen elsewhere, and may take place outside the capital city.
You should:
check local media for the latest information
avoid any demonstrations, large-scale gatherings or political rallies
follow the advice of the local authorities as there is always a possibility demonstrations could turn violent
Tension between religious groups and expression of extremist views are very rare, and attitudes to western countries are generally very positive.
Crime
Public security is generally good, particularly in Tirana, and Albanians are very hospitable to visitors. Crime and violence does happen in some areas, but reports of crime targeting foreigners are rare. There have been occasional shootings and small explosions related to internal disputes over criminal, business or political interests.
Landmines
When visiting hill towns on the northern border with Kosovo, you should take care, particularly if hiking, and follow the signs warning about unexploded landmines and other unexploded weapons. De-mining operations continue in Kosovo.
Laws and cultural differences
Illegal drugs and prison sentences
Penalties for drug-related crimes are severe.
Being arrested
The Albanian authorities do not always inform the British Embassy when British nationals have been arrested. If you are detained, you may insist on your right to contact a British consular officer.
LGBT+ travellers
Same-sex relationships are legal in Albania. Anti-discrimination and anti hate-crime legislation is in place. Tirana has several gay-friendly bars and a number of LGBT+ support groups.
Read more advice for LGBT+ travellers.
Swimming safety
There are reports that a small number of beaches are polluted because of inadequate sewage disposal and treatment.
Transport risks
Road travel
If you are planning to drive in Albania, see information on driving abroad and read the RAC’s Albania guide.
In addition to your UK driving licence, you may find it useful to have a 1968 international driving permit (IDP) in some situations. The 1949 IDP is not accepted any more. You cannot buy an IDP outside the UK, so get one before you travel. You can buy an IDP in person from some UK post offices – find your nearest post office branch that offers this service.
If you stay longer than one year, or live in Albania, you will need to apply for an Albanian driving licence.
A green card is proof that you have vehicle insurance when driving abroad. You need to carry a green card to drive in Albania.
If you’re planning to hire a car, check with your car hire company for information on their requirements before you travel.
To import a vehicle into Albania, make sure you have all the necessary papers on arrival at the border. Consult the Albanian Embassy in London before you leave. The British Embassy will be unable to help anyone attempting to bring a vehicle into Albania without the correct paperwork.
Dangers of driving in Albania
Driving can be very hazardous. Roads are poor, especially in rural areas. Street lighting in urban areas is subject to power cuts. Elsewhere, even on the major inter-urban arterial routes, there is no street lighting. If you are travelling at night, watch out for unmarked road works, potholes and unlit vehicles. Four-wheel drive vehicles are often more practical on rural and minor roads.
Albanian driving can often be aggressive and erratic. Deaths from road traffic accidents are amongst the highest in Europe. Police have taken some measures to decrease the number of accidents. Minor traffic disputes can quickly escalate, especially as some motorists could be armed. Avoid reacting to provocative behaviour by other road users. If you are involved in a traffic accident, even a minor one, you are supposed to wait until the police arrive. This will usually happen quickly in built-up areas.
Water safety
There are some local press reports that jet skis and boats being rented along the coasts may lack adequate safety precautions and equipment.
Extreme weather and natural disasters
Earthquakes
There is a risk of earthquakes and tremors are common. Serious earthquakes are less frequent but do happen.
The US Federal Emergency Management Agency website has advice about what to do before, during and after an earthquake.
Flooding and snow
From December to February, severe weather may cause flooding, particularly in northern Albania. Heavy snowfall in mountainous areas can lead to disruption to transport and services. Monitor local and international media for the latest information.
