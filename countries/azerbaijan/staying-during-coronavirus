This page gives you guidance on how to stay safely in Azerbaijan as a visitor, if you are unable to return to the UK.
Everyone should comply with the measures put in place in Azerbaijan to limit the spread of coronavirus (COVID-19).
Moving around in Azerbaijan
For information on entering Azerbaijan, see Entry Requirements. Restrictive measures are in place until 15 Jun to combat the spread of COVID 19. Many previously introduced restrictions have been relaxed or lifted, however the wearing of face masks is now mandatory in a number of circumstances and failure to do so could lead to being fined. Some restrictions on internal travel around Azerbaijan remain in place. Information about current restrictions can be found here
The system of using SMS to gain permission to leave the home and the registration of key workers on the government database has been abolished.
Quarantine
The Azerbaijani authorities have informed that as of 25 March all nationals arriving from abroad will be placed in to state-run quarantine facilities for up to14 days. These facilities include Baku based hotels, hospitals or the Olympic Village.
You may be quarantined with someone you do not know, and families could be separated in different rooms. It is unlikely you will have direct access to one another during the period of time you spend in quarantine if this is the case. Similar procedures are also in place for British nationals who show signs of potential COVID-19 infection while staying in Azerbaijan.
If you or a British national you know is quarantined and needs consular assistance, contact the British Embassy. Call: +994 12 437 7878. You may hear a message stating that our offices are closed, however, we are available 24/7 – please stay on the line to select the option for ‘calling about an emergency involving a British national’ to speak to a Consular duty officer.” You can also reach us via Facebook.
Visas
The Azerbaijani authorities have introduced additional visa measures for British nationals. See Visas
If you have extended your stay in Azerbaijan due to restrictions on travel this is now considered to be valid for an indefinite period of time until restrictions on flights to and from Azerbaijan are lifted. Once the restrictions are lifted then you will need to leave the country as soon as possible and apply for a new visa, or the relevant residence permit.

Finance
There is a range of financial support from the government that you can access while you are unable to return due to coronavirus restrictions.
If you’re in Azerbaijan, and have exhausted all other options to cover essential living costs while you wait to return home, you could apply for an emergency loan for your living costs from the UK government. You can only apply if you normally live in the UK and you cannot return home. This last-resort option is for those most in need, and you would need to repay the loan when you are back in the UK. Apply for an emergency loan.

Help and support
If you need urgent consular assistance, contact your nearest British embassy, high commission or consulate. All telephone numbers are available 24/7.
