The information on this page covers the most common types of travel and reflects the UK government’s understanding of the rules currently in place. Unless otherwise stated, this information is for travellers using a full ‘British Citizen’ passport.
The authorities in the country or territory you’re travelling to are responsible for setting and enforcing the rules for entry. If you’re unclear about any aspect of the entry requirements, or you need further reassurance, you’ll need to contact the embassy, high commission or consulate of the country or territory you’re travelling to.
You should also consider checking with your transport provider or travel company to make sure your passport and other travel documents meet their requirements.
Entry rules in response to coronavirus (COVID-19)
Entry to Chad
Airports have re-opened for commercial flights. All passengers travelling from the UK are banned from entering Chad until further notice due to the COVID-19 UK variant. All international travellers need to present a negative COVID-19 PCR test certificate dated no more than 72 hours prior to arrival in Chad.
If you enter Chad (e.g. after a stay in a third country) and are planning to stay in Chad for 7 days or more, you will need to surrender your passport, quarantine at home for 7 days and take a COVID-19 test on the seventh day. Passports will be returned upon presentation of the COVID-19 test receipt. If you’re staying in Chad for less than 7 days you will not need to quarantine.
Leaving Chad
You are likely to be asked to present a negative COVID-19 test (less than 72 hours old) upon departing Chad.

Your passport must be valid for six months from the date of entry into Chad. The Chadian Government has confirmed that it will not penalise those British nationals whose passports have expired while they were unable to leave the country due to coronavirus restrictions.
