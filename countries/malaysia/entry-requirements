Warning
FCDO advises against all but essential travel to parts of Malaysia.

This information is for people travelling on a full ‘British citizen’ passport from the UK. It is based on the UK government’s understanding of Malaysia’s current rules for the most common types of travel.
The authorities in Malaysia set and enforce entry rules. If you’re not sure how these requirements apply to you, contact the Malaysian High Commission in the UK.
COVID-19 rules
There are no COVID-19 vaccination requirements for travellers entering Malaysia.  
Passport validity requirements
To enter Malaysia, your passport must be valid for at least 6 months from the date you arrive. Make sure your passport is undamaged, with no pages missing.
Check with your travel provider that your passport and other travel documents meet requirements. Renew your passport if you need to.  
You will be denied entry if you do not have a valid travel document or try to use a passport that has been reported lost or stolen.
Dual nationals
Malaysia does not recognise dual nationality. You can be refused entry if you’re found with a Malaysian passport and one of a different nationality. If you have dual nationality (not including Malaysian), enter and exit on the same passport.
Visa requirements
British nationals do not need a visa to visit Malaysia. You will normally be allowed to stay for 90 days on arrival. For any longer, or for a non-tourist visit, you will need a visa.
The Malaysian authorities do not tolerate illegal immigration. Do not overstay your visa or violate the terms of entry. Even if you overstay for just a few days, you can be:
fined
detained
deported to the UK at your own cost
blacklisted for future visits to Malaysia
If you are detained, you will find facilities can be poor with limited healthcare services. The British High Commission is unable to help you to remain in Malaysia or issue any document to support your overstay.
Keep a copy of your passport and visa safe in case your passport is lost. It may take time to get a replacement visa. If you cannot show your original visa or entry stamp on exit you may be treated as an overstayer, fined and blacklisted.
Applying for a visa
If you want to stay for longer than 90 days or visit for non-tourist purposes, you must apply for a visa from the nearest Malaysian diplomatic mission before you travel.
Entry to East Malaysia
If you’re travelling between Peninsular Malaysia and East Malaysia (sometimes known as Malaysian Borneo, made up of the states of Sabah and Sarawak) you will need to carry your passport. You will pass through immigration control when entering and exiting East Malaysia from and to Peninsular Malaysia, and must obtain an entry and exit stamp.
Declaration form
You must fill in the Malaysia Digital Arrival Card to enter Malaysia. You should complete this before you travel as it may be requested at check-in. You do not need to complete the arrival form if you are not passing through immigration. See the Malaysian Immigration website for further information, including exemption details.
Vaccine requirements
For details about medical entry requirements and recommended vaccinations, see TravelHealthPro’s Malaysia guide.
Drug screening
You could be asked to take a urine test on arrival in Malaysia if you are suspected of having used drugs before your visit. If you’re found with drugs in your bloodstream, you could be detained, or deported and blacklisted from any further visits to Malaysia. You can be charged with drug consumption even if the drugs were consumed overseas, including if they were consumed  in a country where the use of that particular drug is legal.
Customs rules
There are strict rules about goods you can take into or out of Malaysia. You must declare anything that may be prohibited or subject to tax or duty.
If you are in any doubt about the legality of any items, including medications, you should declare them on entry.
Importing firearms
It’s illegal to import unlicensed firearms and ammunition into Malaysia. This includes spent ammunition and souvenirs from war museums. Do not take any weapons or replica weapons into Malaysia. You may be detained and charged if you do. If you’re convicted of dealing in illegal firearms you can be given the death penalty.
Taking money into Malaysia
You can import or export up to the equivalent of 10,000 US dollars in Malaysian ringgit without prior approval.
On entry to or exit from Malaysia, declare any cash or travellers cheques if the value is 10,000 US dollars or more. If you do not declare it, customs officials can seize your money, and you may get a fine of up to 3 million ringgit and up to 5 years’ imprisonment. Further information can be found on the Royal Malaysian Customs Department website.
