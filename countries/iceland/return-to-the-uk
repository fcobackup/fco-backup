British nationals visiting Iceland should be aware that travel options to and from the country are now very limited due to coronavirus related disruptions. Only Icelandair currently flies to the UK (London Heathrow) on a significantly reduced service.
This situation may change at very short notice. The Foreign and Commonwealth Office (FCO) therefore recommends that British nationals who wish to leave Iceland contact their travel operator or one of the above airlines to make arrangements to do so as soon as possible.
Easyjet, Wizzair and Jet2 have suspended all flights to Iceland until further notice. If you arrived with them, you will need to make alternative arrangements to fly back with BA or Icelandair. You should contact your original airline or your insurance provider regarding refunds.
The ferry to Denmark is also currently not accepting passengers.

You will need to pay for your return travel to the UK. If departure options are available but you cannot afford the travel costs and have exhausted all other options for getting funds, you may be eligible to apply for an emergency loan from the government. This is a last resort option and you would need to repay the loan when you are back in the UK. For more information, you should contact Corporate Travel Management (CTM). CTM are a commercial partner of the FCO and are authorised to administer such loans on behalf of the FCO.
Arrival in the UK
