See the TravelHealthPro website for further advice on travel abroad and reducing spread of respiratory viruses during the COVID-19 pandemic.
Information on local testing facilities is available.
Entry and borders
See Entry requirements to find out what you will need to do when you arrive in Singapore.
Travelling from and returning to the UK
Check what you must do to travel abroad and return to England, Scotland, Wales or Northern Ireland.
If you plan to pass through another country to return to the UK, check the travel advice for the country you’re transiting.
Be prepared for your plans to change
No travel is risk-free during COVID-19. Countries may further restrict travel or bring in new rules at short notice, for example due to a new COVID-19 variant. Check with your travel company or airline for any transport changes which may delay your journey home.
If you test positive for COVID-19, you may need to stay where you are until you test negative. You may also need to seek treatment there.
Plan ahead and make sure you:
can access money
understand what your insurance will cover
can make arrangements to extend your stay and be away for longer than planned
Travel in Singapore
See the Singapore Government website for the latest on the COVID-19 situation and measures in place to curb its spread.
If you do not comply with these measures you could be fined, imprisoned, or both, then deported. Repeat offenders will face further fines and/or prosecution. Be aware that restrictions and penalties are subject to change at short notice.
Public spaces and services
Face masks
Face masks are only compulsory on public transport, in care homes and inside healthcare facilities, including dentists and clinics. Facemasks are also required in the queuing areas to board public transport, such as on train platforms and in bus queues, but are not required inside airports, taxis and privately hired buses. All indoor locations within healthcare facilities, including shops and restaurants contained inside, require masks to be worn at all times, except when eating or drinking. Children under 6 years old do not need to wear masks. You could be fined, imprisoned, or both if you are found not wearing a face mask when it is required.
The Health Sciences Authority’s guide on face masks recommends that masks have at least 2 to 3 layers of fabric.
Vaccination status
Should the Singapore government reinstate vaccination-differentiated measures, you may need to use the TraceTogether app or Token.
You’re considered fully vaccinated 14 days after you’ve completed the required doses of any of these vaccines:
Pfizer
Moderna
AstraZeneca (also known as CoviShield)
Janssen (Johnson and Johnson)
Sinovac
Sinopharm
Covaxin
Novavax
Singapore’s Vaccine Booster Programme includes those 5 years old and above. If you are resident in Singapore, or have stayed in Singapore for over 30 days, and fail to get your first booster shot within 270 days after your final dose of the primary series, you will lose your fully-vaccinated status. See section on booster shots.
Quarantine and home recovery
If you test positive for COVID-19, you will initially be required to isolate at your hotel or residential accommodation. Instructions on what to do next depend on whether you are well or unwell. Details are on Singapore’s Living with COVID-19 page.
Work
Vaccination is required to obtain or renew a long-term pass, work pass or Permanent Residency Employers may require employees to be vaccinated.
Details on workplace matters are under Advisories on COVID-19 on the Ministry of Manpower website.
Healthcare in Singapore
For contact details for English speaking doctors, see our list of healthcare providers. English is almost universally spoken in Singapore, so all hospitals – whether private or public – will have English-speaking medical staff.
For a complete list of healthcare institutions in Singapore, see the HCI directory.
Anyone requiring a COVID-19 polymerase chain reaction (PCR) test can get it from one of the clinics approved by the Ministry of Health. These clinics issue digital test result certificates. You can have these digital certificates notarised before you travel.
If you’d like to do a self-test at home, you can buy Antigen Rapid Tests from retailers and chemists. There’s a list of self-test kits authorised for use in Singapore on the Health Sciences Authority website.
