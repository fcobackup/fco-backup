Although there’s no recent history of terrorism in Cambodia, attacks can’t be ruled out. Attacks could be indiscriminate, including in places visited by expatriates and foreign travellers. There have been a small number of grenade/bomb attacks and shootings. Most have been linked to business, personal and traffic disputes. Four people were injured following a small explosion in Phnom Penh in September 2016.
There’s a heightened threat of terrorist attack globally against UK interests and British nationals, from groups or individuals motivated by the conflict in Iraq and Syria. You should be vigilant at this time.
