Travel restrictions and local measures
Domestic flights are currently operating on a very limited basis.
The border with Pakistan has been closed, but temporarily reopened on 6 April to allow Afghan nationals to cross from Pakistan to Afghanistan
Point of entry screening has been introduced. Not everyone is being screened, but those who are and who show a temperature of more than 38ÂºC may be sent direct to one of 2 national hospitals (Kabul Infectious Disease and Afghan-Japan Communicable Disease Hospital in Kabul) or 5 provincial hospitals for isolation. These hospitals are outside of the Enhanced Security Zone. Currently the Afghan-Japan Communicable Disease Hospital is named by the Afghan Government as the lead hospital.
On 28 March, restrictions came into effect in Kabul limiting movement for three weeks, however they may be extended. These include halting all public buses carrying more than four people, closure of wedding halls and shrines, with only critical services including food shops remaining open. Travel to and from Kabul to other provinces in Afghanistan has also been stopped. You will need to give a valid reason (such as medical, security or caring for someone) for leaving your residence if asked by the authorities.
Medical care
If you are in Afghanistan and displaying symptoms of coronavirus you should seek medical advice while self-isolating. The advice from the Afghan Ministry of Public Health is that if you are displaying symptoms then call 166 and they will guide you on what to do next. Please note the advisors only speak Dari (press option 1) or Pashto (option 2). You should in parallel contact your insurance/medical assistance company.
