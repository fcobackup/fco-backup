Do not handle illegal drugs. Drug trafficking is considered a serious crime in Venezuela. Detection methods are sophisticated and drug traffickers should expect to be arrested. Conviction leads to severe penalties, including up to 2 years on remand before sentencing and then a lengthy prison sentence of between 8 and 15 years. Conditions in Venezuelan jails are harsh and dangerous, and among the worst in the region.
You should carry identification with you at all times. You can carry a photocopy of the relevant pages of your passport and keep the original document in a safe place. You may be asked to show a form of ID at any time by local security forces, particularly at police checkpoints.
Sex with a child (in Venezuela this means under 18 years old) is illegal. Offenders will face long-term jail sentences.
Homosexuality is not considered a crime in Venezuelan law. Public displays of affection, although not illegal, will most likely be frowned upon and may attract unwanted attention from locals and/or security forces, particularly at police checkpoints. Please note that local legislation does not recognise same sex partnerships/relationships in any capacity nor confer any civil rights to same sex partners as next of kin. See our information and advice page for the LGBT community before you travel.
Venezuela is poorly equipped for disabled individuals. Wheelchair ramps are available only at a few upmarket hotels and restaurants, as hardly any office, shop, or bank provides special facilities for disabled people, and wheelchair-accessible toilets are virtually non-existent. Very few disabled parking spaces are available
It is an offence to photograph military or strategic installations including military airports and the Presidential Palace. Avoid plane spotting.
