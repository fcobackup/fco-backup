The information on this page covers the most common types of travel and reflects the UK government’s understanding of the rules currently in place. Unless otherwise stated, this information is for travellers using a full ‘British Citizen’ passport.
The authorities in the country or territory you’re travelling to are responsible for setting and enforcing the rules for entry. If you’re unclear about any aspect of the entry requirements, or you need further reassurance, you’ll need to contact the embassy, high commission or consulate of the country or territory you’re travelling to.
Entry rules in response to coronavirus (COVID-19)
Entry to Pakistan
The Pakistani authorities have closed land borders with Afghanistan, India and Iran. Despite this, there are ongoing limited border openings for repatriation and trade. Those crossing into Pakistan may have to comply with coronavirus testing and quarantine measures. The FCDO currently advises against travel to the most of the Afghanistan and Iran border areas.
Since 9 August, airlines are allowed to operate international flights from all airports in Pakistan. Reinforcement of screening and administrative measures at all sea ports has been announced.
Testing / screening on arrival
From 5 October 2020, all international travellers to Pakistan will be required to present evidence of a negative COVID-19 test taken within 96 hours of the start of travel. However, a list of countries exempted from the mandatory test requirement can be found on the Pakistan government COVID-19 website. The list of exempted countries will be reviewed every two weeks. This UK is not currently exempted from this mandatory test requirement. You should not use the NHS testing service to get a test in order to facilitate your travel to another country. You should arrange to take a private test.
Travellers to Pakistan will also be required to provide their contact information through the Pass Track App or through a web-based form. If necessary you may also be able to fill in a health declaration form on arrival.
Government guidelines, issued 29 September, state that children under the age of 12 and disabled passengers are exempt from the COVID-19 test requirement and Pass Track App requirement. However they will be required to complete a health declaration form upon arrival.
Government guidelines state that all international air passengers travelling to Pakistan are subject to screening for COVID-19 symptoms on arrival, including thermal screening. If you are found to be symptomatic, you will be allowed to proceed to your destination but you will be required to have a COVID-19 test within 48 hours of arrival and submit the results of the test to the authorities. If the test is positive you will have to self-isolate in line with Pakistan’s guidelines.
Government guidelines, issued on 26 September, suggest that all international travellers should self-isolate for 10 days after arrival (including those who are asymptomatic on arrival).
You may also be required to follow special measures before boarding flights to Pakistan and while on board the aircraft, including the wearing of a face mask.
Pakistan government guidance, including links to the Pass Track App and web-based form is available on their COVID-19 website.
Screening on departure
If you are leaving Pakistan, you will be screened at the airport for any symptoms of COVID-19. You will also be subject to thermal screening for high temperatures. If you are free from symptoms you will be allowed to travel. If you are suspected of having symptoms of COVID-19, including fever, cough and breathing difficulty, you will be subject to a secondary screening by a medical professional. After which, you may be allowed to board if it is assessed that you do not have symptoms, have not been at risk of exposure and do not have a fever. If the secondary screening assesses that you may have COVID-19 you may be asked to self-isolate for 14 days before you can travel. You may also be referred to a medical facility.
