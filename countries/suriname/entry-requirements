This information is for people travelling on a full ‘British citizen’ passport from the UK. It is based on the UK government’s understanding of Suriname’s current rules for the most common types of travel.
The authorities in Suriname set and enforce entry rules. If you’re not sure how these requirements apply to you, contact the Surinamese Embassy in Paris, France.  
COVID-19 rules 
There are no COVID-19 testing or vaccination requirements for travellers entering Suriname. 
Passport validity requirements 
To enter Suriname, your passport must have an ‘expiry date’ at least 6 months after the date you arrive. 
Check with your travel provider that your passport and other travel documents meet requirements. Renew your passport if you need to.  
You will be denied entry if you do not have a valid travel document or try to use a passport that has been reported lost or stolen. 
Visa requirements 
You can visit Suriname without a visa for tourism for up to 90 days. You must pay an entry fee of 54 US dollars before you travel. 
To stay longer (to work or study, for business travel or for other reasons), you must get a visa and meet the Suriname government’s entry requirements. 
It’s illegal to overstay the entry period or to work without a work permit. 
Vaccine requirements  
To enter Suriname, you must have a certificate to prove you’ve had a yellow fever vaccination if you’re coming from a country listed as a transmission risk. 
For full details about medical entry requirements and recommended vaccinations, see TravelHealthPro’s Suriname guide.  
Customs rules 
There are strict rules about goods you can take into or out of Suriname. You must declare anything that may be prohibited or subject to tax or duty. 
Taking money into Suriname 
If you’re bringing currency with you, bring US dollars or euros. You cannot exchange British pounds.
