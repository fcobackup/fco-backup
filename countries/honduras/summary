The FCDO advises against all but essential travel to:
the whole of Honduras based on the current assessment of COVID-19 risks.
Travel to Honduras is subject to entry restrictions
Honduras does not permit the entry of travellers who have been in the United Kingdom or South Africa in the 21 days prior to their arrival. This measure came into force on 23 December. This measure is not applicable to Honduran nationals, diplomats or foreign nationals who are legal residents in the country who need to quarantine.
Prior to arrival on an international flight, you are required to pre-register online with Honduran Immigration. You must present a negative COVID-19 test result upon arrival from a test taken in the previous 72 hours.
If you are eligible for entry, you should self-isolate for 14 days after arrival.
See Entry requirements for more information before you plan to travel.
Preparing for your return journey to the UK
If you’re returning to the UK from overseas, you will need to:
provide your journey and contact details before you travel
check if you need to self-isolate on your return

You should monitor local and international weather updates from the US National Hurricane Centre. See Natural disasters and our Tropical Cyclones page for advice. Follow the advice of local authorities, including any evacuation orders.
You should note that airports can close at short notice, so before travelling to and from Honduras, you should contact your airline or travel agent to confirm that the airport is open.

Protests can happen anywhere in Honduras. Although normally peaceful, these can rapidly turn violent and be accompanied by a general break-down in law and order, including looting. The police have frequently responded with tear gas. Deaths and injuries have been reported. Although the protests are normally restricted to the main cities (especially Tegucigalpa, San Pedro Sula and La Ceiba), road blocks can occur anywhere at short notice, and can cause significant travel disruptions. Military police and the army have been deployed across the country to restore law and order.
Travel plans can be impacted at short notice. You should avoid all demonstrations, and do not try to pass through blockades.
Please monitor the situation with your tour operator and with the local authorities (COPECO) and the National Institute of Migration and monitor local and social media for updates.
UK health authorities have classified Honduras as having a risk of Zika virus transmission. For more information and advice visit the National Travel Health Network and Centre website.

Although there is no recent history of terrorism in Honduras, attacks cannot be ruled out. See Terrorism
