Entry to Cyprus
As of 1 August 2020, the UK is in Cyprus’ Category B: this means that tourists are permitted to travel to Cyprus, but they need to provide a negative COVID-19 test result on arrival, obtained within 72 hours before travel. On 31 July 2020, The Republic of Cyprus government announced that test results can be in the form of an email or SMS, but the result itself and/or appointment letter must include the date and time when the test was taken. Children under 12 years old do not require to be tested in order to travel to Cyprus. Please see the Republic of Cyprus Information Office website for further information.
The UK government guide to testing for COVID 19 contains useful links and further information. Internet search of the words ‘COVID testing near me’ will bring up many private and local testing facilities (fees can vary). You may want to check with the relevant Embassy that the test you decide on meets the entry requirements for the country in question.
All travellers to Cyprus must complete a Cyprus Flight Pass before travelling, available on the Cyprus Flight Pass website. You will be responsible for ensuring your PCR test result is uploaded to Cyprus Flight Pass within 24 hours of your departure. If you need to provide your appointment letter you can upload both documents in a single photo. In addition to obtaining the Cyprus Flight Pass, passengers are required to carry with them, in hard copy or electronically, copies of these documents. You will be asked to present your flight pass prior to boarding and on arrival at immigration.
Legal residents of Cyprus and Cypriot ID holders, who are permitted to enter Cyprus on presentation of proof of residence or Cypriot nationality, may be tested on arrival in Cyprus – further details are available on the Cyprus Flight Pass website and from the Republic of Cyprus Information Office.
The Cyprus government has announced the launch of a help desk to assist travellers with queries regarding the use of the Cyprus Flight Pass. This service is accessible by telephone +(357) 2484 1234 and through the Cyprus Flight Pass e-platform. You should continue to track developments through the Republic of Cyprus Information Office.
The authorities in the north of Cyprus are permitting entry to UK nationals travelling from the UK. You will be required to show a negative COVID-19 PCR test result (dated between three and five days prior to the date of the flight) on arrival. You will then be required to isolate at home for 7 days, on the condition that you will not meet anyone, or host visitors, during this period. Failure to follow the rules of self-isolation will result in mandatory quarantine at facilities allocated by the authorities.
All travellers should be aware that if other passengers on your flight subsequently test positive on arrival to Cyprus, you may be subject to further quarantine/self-isolation measures. These will be mandatory and you should comply with the Cypriot authorities’ requirements.
Neighbouring countries have also introduced restrictions which may impact on your travel plans. Check country-specific FCO Travel Advice for details.
