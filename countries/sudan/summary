British Embassy Khartoum are following developments resulting from the political crisis caused by the military coup on 25 October 2021. Regular protests take place across the country. Violence has been used against protesters and a number have been killed. Internet and telephone services may be blocked or suspended at short notice. There is a risk that the situation in Khartoum and elsewhere in Sudan could deteriorate.
You should stay away from areas where demonstrations are planned. If you unexpectedly meet a demonstration, leave the area straight away. Protest plans are usually published in advance, but these are not always accurate. Roads may be blocked, sometimes with little notice, by protestors or security forces. You should monitor media coverage, consider whether travel movements are necessary and follow the advice of the local authorities.
There have been increased reports of opportunistic crime including theft, muggings and demands for payment at checkpoints in Khartoum and elsewhere. See Safety and security section
The Embassy continues to carry out essential work and we continue to offer consular services online and by telephone 24 hours a day, 7 days a week. If you need assistance, call + 249 (0) 156 77 5500 / +44 (0)1908 516666. When calling, you may hear a message stating that our offices are closed. If so, stay on the line and select the option for ‘calling about an emergency involving a British national’ to speak to an officer.
Consular support is severely limited in parts of Sudan where the FCDO has advice against all travel and all but essential travel (as set out above). The British Embassy no longer registers British nationals in Sudan and the capacity of the British Embassy to help in times of crisis may be limited. You should consider your own travel arrangements carefully and make sure you have up-to-date travel documents and visas in case you need to leave at short notice. See the crisis guidance page for more information about the precautions you should take in the event of a crisis and the help and support the British Embassy can provide.
Before you travel, check the ‘Entry requirements’ section for Sudan’s current entry restrictions and requirements. These may change with little warning. Monitor this advice for the latest updates and stay in contact with your travel provider.
If you plan to pass through another country to return to the UK, check the travel advice for the country you’re transiting.
It is more important than ever to get travel insurance and check it provides sufficient cover. See the FCDO’s guidance on foreign travel insurance.
Terrorists are likely to try to carry out attacks in Sudan. Attacks could be indiscriminate, including in places frequented by expatriates and foreign travellers. See Terrorism
You will need a visa to visit Sudan. See Visas
If you’re abroad and you need emergency help from the UK government, contact the nearest British embassy, consulate or high commission.
The Overseas Business Risk service offers information and advice for British companies operating overseas on how to manage political, economic, and business security-related risks.
