The information on this page covers the most common types of travel and reflects the UK government’s understanding of the rules currently in place. Unless otherwise stated, this information is for travellers using a full ‘British Citizen’ passport.
The authorities in the country or territory you’re travelling to are responsible for setting and enforcing the rules for entry. If you’re unclear about any aspect of the entry requirements, or you need further reassurance, you’ll need to contact the embassy, high commission or consulate of the country or territory you’re travelling to.
You should also consider checking with your transport provider or travel company to make sure your passport and other travel documents meet their requirements.
Restrictions in response to coronavirus
Germany has intensified border controls but checks at internal land borders are gradually being relaxed. While travellers still need a valid reason for entering Germany, the scope of valid reasons for entering at its internal land borders has been expanded to include more family and personal reasons for travel (see Federal Interior Ministry FAQs)
The German Interior Ministry has encouraged federal states to revise their quarantine regulations for arriving and returning travellers. Persons entering from other EU countries, the Schengen area and the UK will only have to go into quarantine if they are entering from an area where there is a high rate of infection. Travellers should consult local federal state and health authority guidance for specific arrangements (see Federal Interior Ministry FAQs)
It is possible for British citizens (and all EU/EEA citizens) to transit via Germany in order to go home or to their place of habitual residence.
If you are transiting through an airport in Germany in order to travel to the UK, you will need to have onward travel, and, if necessary, temporary accommodation booked before you will be permitted to enter Germany.
You should also ensure you are aware of your airline’s policy on protective measures on board flights; some carriers have made the wearing of face masks compulsory, for example.
Travellers without German citizenship may only enter if they meet general immigration law requirements and they have an urgent reason which is evidenced by documents, such as:
Work-related grounds: Limited to workers exercising critical occupations such as health professionals and care workers, in line with the extensive list published by the European Commission in its Notification of 30 March 2020.
Family reasons: Accompanying a German spouse or registered partner to their home in Germany; moving to the home in Germany of a spouse or registered partner (German or someone exercising free movement), provided this serves to restore the family living unit; accompanying German children as their parental guardian in moving to Germany, even if the German spouse or registered partner remains abroad.
Medical grounds: Medical treatment where a doctor has confirmed that considerable lasting damage or life-threatening deterioration could occur without the treatment.
Education and study: Continuing training or study where attendance is required (return to place of residency is anyway allowed); first entry limited to health and care sector occupations where evidenced as necessary by the institute.
If your habitual place of residence is Germany you can return as long as you can provide proof of this. Proof of residence might include:
certificate of registration of address (also available online)
payslip (with German address)
free movement certificate (not issued any longer)
other official documents evidencing residence in Germany
You should bear in mind that the situation is changing quickly and that border police in some regions may take a more strict approach.
The Federal Ministry of the Interior has detailed information on its website, including in English, regarding the rules on entry and exit from Germany.
