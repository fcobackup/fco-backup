Entry rules in response to coronavirus
Entry to Croatia
On 30 November 2020, the Croatian authorities announced new border controls restricting arrivals into Croatia to curb the spread of COVID-19. These came into force from 1 December to 15 December, and have been extended until 15 January 2021.
In line with the treatment of non-EU/EEA nationals, from 1 January 2021 UK nationals travelling to Croatia from the UK, or any other non-EU/EEA country, will not be permitted to enter the country for the duration of these COVID-19 restrictions. Limited exemptions will apply for Croatian residents and those travelling for urgent personal, family or business reasons (but are still subject to the requirement to present a negative PCR test result, not older than 48 hours on arrival, or isolate until a negative test result has been obtained locally). See information from the Croatian government for further details.
Croatia currently restricts the entry of foreign nationals to those arriving from the EU, EEA and the United Kingdom. UK nationals travelling to Croatia should present a negative PCR test that is no older than 48 hours on arrival, or isolate until a negative test result has been obtained locally. Those travelling from any country that is marked green on the ECDC ‘Combined Indicator’ Map are exempt from this requirement. Details of eligibility to travel, possible exemptions, and instructions for arrivals are available from the Ministry of Interior.
Tests are not available at Croatia’s airports. Those seeking a test on arrival will need to contact a clinic directly and may temporarily leave their accommodation to attend a test appointment. See more information about testing centres in Croatia. Tests cost approximately 700 Croatian Kuna and results are generally available within 48 hours.
Quarantine requirements
UK nationals travelling to Croatia should produce a negative COVID test on arrival in Croatia or to self-isolate for a period of 10 days or until a negative test result has been obtained locally. Travellers are advised to check the latest situation with the Croatian authorities before starting a journey, as health requirements may change. It is mandatory for passengers to wear masks on public transport and taxis and in shops and other commercial premises.
Screening on arrival
The Croatian government has introduced a new online entry form to expedite the entry of foreign visitors. You are advised to carry a copy of your accommodation booking or proof of ownership of holiday homes / boats when arriving in Croatia. If you are travelling to Croatia for business, you are advised to carry evidence of a business invitation or meetings.
Restrictions on travel may change at any time. You should check the latest regulations before travelling on the Croatian government website. British citizens are permitted to leave Croatia and it remains possible to return to the UK by air and road.
Regular entry requirements
Visas
The rules for travelling or working in European countries changed from 1 January 2021:
you can travel to Croatia for up to 90 days in any 180-day period without a visa. This applies if you travel as a tourist, to visit for family or friends, to attend business meetings, cultural or sports events, or for short-term studies or training
visits to other EU or Schengen countries do not count towards your 90-day limit in Croatia as it is not in the Schengen area. Visits to Croatia do not count towards your 90-day visa-free limit in the Schengen area
to stay longer, to work or study, for business travel or for other reasons, you will need to meet the Croatian government’s entry requirements. Check with the Croatian Embassy what type of visa and/or work permit you may need
if you stay in Croatia with a visa or permit, your stay does not count towards your 90-day visa-free limit
Any time you spent in Croatia before 1 January 2021 does not count towards the 90-day visa-free limit.
At Croatian border control, you may need to use separate lanes from EU, EEA and Swiss citizens when queueing. Your passport may be stamped on entry and exit.
You may also need to:
show a return or onward ticket
show you have enough money for your stay
Passport validity
Check your passport is valid for travel before you book your trip, and renew your passport if you do not have enough time left on it.
You must have at least 6 months left on an adult or child passport to travel to most countries in Europe (not including Ireland).
If you renewed your current passport before the previous one expired, extra months may have been added to its expiry date. Any extra months on your passport over 10 years may not count towards the 6 months needed.
UK Emergency Travel Documents
UK ETDs are accepted for entry, airside transit and exit from Croatia and are a valid ID document in Croatia.
