The first case of coronavirus (COVID-19) was confirmed in South Sudan on 5 April. Cases have also been confirmed in all of South Sudan’s neighbouring countries.
The South Sudan authorities had already introduced a number of precautionary measures in response to the coronavirus (COVID-19) pandemic, including a curfew from 2000 – 0600 every day and restrictions on internal movements. The likelihood of further, more restrictive measures in the coming days is high.
There are currently no commercial flights in to or out of South Sudan. Juba airport has been closed since 24 March for an initial period of 30 days. All land borders are closed. South Sudan has suspended the issue of visas at its Embassies abroad, and the South Sudan Embassy in London is closed.
Local measures
You should comply with any additional screening measures put in place by the authorities.
Keep up to date with information from your tour operator, transport or accommodation provider on the impact on any existing travel plans. If you need further information about entry requirements, contact the nearest South Sudan Embassy. You should also check with your airline or travel company for the latest information.
