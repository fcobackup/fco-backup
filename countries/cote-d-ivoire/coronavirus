Be prepared for your plans to change
No travel is risk-free during COVID. Countries may further restrict travel or bring in new rules at short notice, for example due to a new COVID-19 variant. Check with your travel company or airline for any transport changes which may delay your journey home.
If you test positive for COVID-19, you may need to stay where you are until you test negative. You may also need to seek treatment there.
Plan ahead and make sure you:
can access money
understand what your insurance will cover
can make arrangements to extend your stay and be away for longer than planned
Travel in Côte d’Ivoire
The ban on all movement to and from Abidjan was lifted on 15 July.
Accommodation
Most hotels and other accommodation are now open. Everyone is required to wear face masks in public areas.
Public places and services
Most COVID-19 related restrictions have been lifted; however, you need to wear face masks in public places. There are hand-washing facilities and/or antibacterial gel available before entering most public buildings and restaurants.
Schools, restaurants, bars, nightclubs, cinemas and theatres are open.
Health
If you think you have been in contact with anyone with COVID-19 or you have symptoms yourself, you should self-isolate for 14 days.
COVID-19 testing is available at testing centres in Abidjan and around the country. Results will take at least 24 hours but may take longer.
Unlike in the UK, you will need to go to pharmacy to obtain most over-the-counter medicines as these are not generally available in supermarkets. Many items that would require a prescription in the UK do not require one in Côte d’Ivoire. For items that do require a prescription in Côte d’Ivoire, UK prescriptions will be accepted but the duty doctor at the pharmacy may need to authorise the purchase. Pharmacies are usually identified by a green cross outside and will display a list showing which pharmacies are on duty (‘de garde’) out of hours.
The Government of Côte d’Ivoire is encouraging those seeking any information or who have concerns about coronavirus to call these local free hotline numbers: 143 or 101. You can also send a text message to 1336 to receive information about coronavirus by text.
