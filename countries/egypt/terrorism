Terrorists are very likely to try to carry out attacks in Egypt.
UK Counter Terrorism Policing has information and advice on staying safe abroad and what to do in the event of a terrorist attack. Find out more about the global threat from terrorism.
Although most attacks occur in North Sinai, there was an attack on the 30 December 2022 to the west of the Suez Canal, targeting security forces within the city of Ismailia, and there remains a risk of terrorist attacks across the country. Attacks could be indiscriminate. Targets might include Egyptian security forces, religious sites, large public gatherings and places visited by foreigners. There is a heightened threat of terrorist attacks in or around religious sites and during religious festivals, such as the month of Ramadan and the Christmas period (including Coptic Christmas on 7 January), when terrorist groups have sometimes called for attacks. Terrorist attacks have occurred over local holiday weekends. Terrorists have targeted tourists in Egypt in the past. There is a heightened threat of terrorist attacks targeting Coptic Christians from extremists linked to Daesh-Sinai in Egypt.
You should follow the advice of Egyptian authorities, remaining particularly vigilant and maintaining a high level of security awareness in crowded places and at large gatherings. You can find a list of holidays on the British Embassy Cairo website. The authorities in Egypt maintain a significant security presence across the country, including armed security officers stationed at important sites, critical infrastructure, and road checkpoints. Extra measures are in place at tourist sites.
Recent attacks in Egypt have included:
on 4 August 2019, at least 20 people were killed by a car bomb in Central Cairo’s Manial district
on 19 May 2019, at least 16 people were injured after an IED attack on a tourist bus near the Giza pyramids
on 18 February 2019, 3 security personnel were killed by a suicide bomber in Central Cairo’s Darb al-ahmar district
on 28 December 2018, a roadside blast killed 3 Vietnamese tourists and a local tour guide on a bus near the Giza pyramids. Several others were wounded in the attack
on 2 November 2018, gunmen opened fire on a bus carrying Coptic Christians in Minya province, upper Egypt, killing 7 people. Daesh (formerly referred to as ISIL) claimed responsibility for the attack.
North Sinai
There are frequent reports of terrorist attacks in North Sinai. Most attacks are in the northeast corner of the governorate between Al-Arish city and the border with Gaza, but the whole of the North Sinai governorate is at risk. A state of emergency in North Sinai is in effect and a curfew is in place.
Most attacks in North Sinai are against the Egyptian government and military installations and personnel; however attacks have been carried out against civilians suspected of working with the authorities and local religious minority groups.
Terrorist groups in Egypt
Daesh-Sinai is the most active terrorist group in Egypt. Most Daesh-Sinai attacks have targeted government, security forces and Coptic Christians, but foreigners have also been targeted. Their main area of operations is North Sinai, but the group has claimed responsibility for attacks in other areas including South Sinai, Cairo, the western desert and Nile delta cities.
Al Qaeda aligned groups also maintain a presence in Egypt and in 2017 Ansar al-Islam claimed an attack against Egyptian security forces in the Bahariya Oasis in Egypt’s Western Desert.
Muslim Brotherhood-aligned groups have also undertaken attacks on security forces.
There’s a heightened risk of terrorism against aviation and maritime
Aviation
Terrorists in Egypt likely maintain the intent and capability to target aviation.
The greatest threat is on the North Sinai Peninsula where Daesh operate with greater freedom, but terrorists are active throughout Egypt.
You should co-operate fully with security officials at airports and observe any additional security measures.
Maritime
There is also a threat of maritime terrorism.
Kidnap
There is a threat of kidnapping by groups operating in North Africa, particularly from Libya and groups originating in the Sahel. This includes Al Qaeda and Daesh-affiliated groups, who may travel across the region’s porous border. There is a heightened risk of kidnap in border and remote desert areas of North Africa. Terrorist groups have kidnapped foreigners, government officials and civilians in the region for financial gain and for political leverage. Further kidnaps are likely.
Those engaged in tourism, humanitarian aid work, journalism or business sectors are viewed as legitimate targets. If you’re kidnapped, the reason for your presence is unlikely to serve as a protection or secure your safe release.
The long-standing policy of the British government is not to make substantive concessions to hostage takers. The British government considers that paying ransoms and releasing prisoners increases the risk of further hostage taking. The Terrorism Act (2000) also makes payments to terrorists illegal.
Global threat
There is considered to be a heightened threat of terrorist attack globally against UK interests and British nationals, from groups or individuals motivated by the conflict in Iraq and Syria.
