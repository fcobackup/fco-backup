The information on this page covers the most common types of travel and reflects the UK government’s understanding of the rules currently in place. Unless otherwise stated, this information is for travellers using a full ‘British Citizen’ passport.
The authorities in the country or territory you’re travelling to are responsible for setting and enforcing the rules for entry. If you’re unclear about any aspect of the entry requirements, or you need further reassurance, you’ll need to contact the embassy, high commission or consulate of the country or territory you’re travelling to.
You should also consider checking with your transport provider or travel company to make sure your passport and other travel documents meet their requirements.
Entry rules in response to coronavirus (COVID-19)
Entry to Senegal
The government of Senegal has said airlines are not allowed to carry foreign nationals from countries who have put in place travel restrictions for Senegal unless they are ordinarily resident in Senegal, diplomats, military, health professionals and other specific professional categories. Senegalese authorities have confirmed that British nationals are not subject to these entry restrictions.
Despite this, some airlines are only allowing foreign nationals with proof of residency in Senegal to travel. It is important to note that some airlines only accept a full residency card, and not a ‘récépissé’, although the government of Senegal have confirmed that a ‘récépissé’ is proof of residency. You should check with your airline before travelling.
Several airlines are now requesting a letter of support from the Senegalese Embassy in London (or elsewhere if you are not travelling from the UK) before boarding flights to Senegal. An application form for this purpose can be found on their website here. This completed form needs to be sent to the Senegalese Embassy at senegalembassy@hotmail.co.uk together with a copy of your passport, air ticket and relevant supporting documents. Please note this will take 2 – 3 working days to process. To enter Senegal, you must provide a negative test dated no more than 5 days earlier, issued in the country where you started your trip and authorised by that country or a recognised health organisation.
You should not use the NHS testing service to get a test in order to facilitate your travel to another country. You should arrange to take a private test.
You must also complete and submit a ‘Public Health Passenger Locator’ form on arrival in Senegal. You’ll need to submit this form at border control. You can access the form on the Dakar Airport website.
