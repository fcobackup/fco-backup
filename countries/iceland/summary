The Icelandic Met Office has issued a warning of heavy gas pollution in the area accompanying the flood and have deemed it is unsafe to stop at the river or its source by the glacier’s edge. If you’re in the area and symptoms such as nasal burns or eye irritation occur, you should leave immediately. You should monitor the Icelandic Meteorological Office for updates.
