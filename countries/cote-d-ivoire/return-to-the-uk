Air borders are reopening in Côte d’Ivoire, with domestic flights from 26 June and international flights from 1 July. Air France flights are set to resume from 6 July and other options to return to Europe are due to begin again soon.
If you cannot leave Côte d’Ivoire at this time, see advice on staying in Côte d’Ivoire during coronavirus.
Future options
Departure options with Air France are available from 6 July. Other departure options to Europe will be available soon.
You will need to pay for your return travel to the UK. If departure options are available but you cannot afford the travel costs and have exhausted all other options for getting funds, you may be eligible to apply for an emergency loan from the government. This is a last resort option and you would need to repay the loan when you are back in the UK. For more information, you should contact Corporate Travel Management (CTM). CTM are a commercial partner of the FCO and are authorised to administer such loans on behalf of the FCO.
Your journey home: re-entering the UK
When you return, you must follow the rules for entering the UK. You:
need to provide your journey and contact details up to 48 hours before you’re due to arrive in the UK
are not allowed to leave the place you’re staying for the first 14 days you’re in the UK except in very limited situations (known as ‘self-isolating’)
See also the list of people who are exempt from the border rules.
The National Travel Health Network and Centre (NaTHNaC) also provides advice on how to stay safe as you travel by air.
