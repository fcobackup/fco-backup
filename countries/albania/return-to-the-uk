If you live in the UK and are currently visiting Albania, you’re strongly advised to return now by commercial means. Don’t run the risk of getting stranded.
UK special charter flights will only operate for priority countries where commercial flights are not possible. You should not assume that these flights will become available in countries where commercial routes are operating. Please do not contact the contracted travel management company if no flight is advertised here.
Future travel options
Commercial airlines are operating between the UK and Tirana. WizzAir operate a daily service from London Luton and British Airways are currently flying twice a week from London Heathrow. They plan to increase the number of flights in early August.

If you are worried about overstaying in Albania due to international travel restrictions, you should send a request via e-mail to migracioni.tirane@asp.gov.al and policiakufitare@asp.gov.al and require an extension to your stay in Albania. You should attach your travel document to the e-mail. You should retain the confirmation e-mail as you will need to show it at the police checkpoint when you exit Albania once travel restrictions are removed.
Travelling to the airport
Public transport and taxis are operating as normal.
Your journey home: re-entering the UK
When you return, you must follow the rules for entering the UK. You:
need to provide your journey and contact details up to 48 hours before you’re due to arrive in the UK
are not allowed to leave the place you’re staying for the first 14 days you’re in the UK except in very limited situations (known as ‘self-isolating’)
See also the list of people who are exempt from the border rules.
The National Travel Health Network and Centre (NaTHNaC) also provides advice on how to stay safe as you travel by air.
