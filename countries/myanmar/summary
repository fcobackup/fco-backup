The Foreign, Commonwealth & Development Office (FCDO) advises against all but essential travel to Myanmar, based on recent political events.
COVID-19 entry restrictions for Myanmar
Before you travel, check the ‘Entry requirements’ section for Myanmar’s current entry restrictions and requirements. These may change with little warning. Monitor this advice for the latest updates and stay in contact with your travel provider.
Travelling from and returning to the UK
Check what you must do to travel abroad and return to England, Scotland, Wales or Northern Ireland.
If you plan to pass through another country to return to the UK, check the travel advice for the country you’re transiting. If you will pass through a red list country, book your hotel quarantine package before travelling to the UK.
If you’re planning travel to Myanmar, find out what you need to know about coronavirus there in the Coronavirus section.
During the COVID-19 pandemic, it is more important than ever to get travel insurance and check it provides sufficient cover. See FCDO guidance on foreign travel insurance.

On 1 February 2021, the Myanmar military declared a state of emergency and took over control from the democratically elected government. Following the coup, the security situation in the country has worsened and on 29 April 2021 we advised UK citizens to leave Myanmar. The British Embassy has also drawn down a number of staff and dependents. The Embassy continues to carry out essential work and provide services, including providing 24/7 consular assistance and support to British people in Myanmar. If you are in Myanmar, you should read our Safety and security section.
The security situation in Myanmar is unpredictable and liable to change without notice. There are frequent shootings and targeted explosions. On 7 September 2021 the opposition National Unity Government called for open armed resistance to military rule.
If you decide your presence in Myanmar is essential, you should maintain a low profile and keep up to date with developments, sign up to receive email alerts when this travel advice is updated. Always avoid any protests or gatherings and follow the instructions of the local authorities.
Some areas in Myanmar are under a state of martial law, whilst others have curfews and ‘Stay at Home’ orders in place. You should ensure you are aware of local rules and restrictions.
The FCDO will continue to provide consular support 24/7 through our global network, but due to the increase in COVID-19 cases, and due to the restrictions imposed both by the military coup and the pandemic, the ability of the British Embassy to provide assistance to British nationals is limited.
There is a risk that you could be arbitrarily detained or arrested. The criminal justice process followed in such cases falls below international standards. Myanmar does not recognise dual nationality.
If you’re in Myanmar and you need consular assistance, call one of the following numbers:
+95 (0)1 370863
+95 (0)1 370864
+95 (0)1 370865
+95 (0)1 370867
There may be disruptions to local phone networks. If you are unable to get through to the Embassy on any of these numbers, call +44 020 7008 5000. This is an international number and you may be charged a different rate.
Terrorists are likely to try to carry out attacks in Myanmar. You should remain vigilant and follow the advice of local authorities. See Terrorism
The banking sector has seen widespread disruption with many banks closed and ATMs empty. Electronic payments continue to function within the country but you should ensure you will be able to make payments in advance. See Money
UK health authorities have classified Myanmar as having a risk of Zika virus transmission. For information and advice about the risks associated with Zika virus, visit the National Travel Health Network and Centre website.
Urban areas, particularly Yangon and Mandalay, can experience poor air quality. See Health
If you’re abroad and you need emergency help from the UK government, contact the nearest British embassy, consulate or high commission. You should not assume that the FCDO will be able to provide assistance to leave the country in the event of serious unrest or crisis. If you’re arrested or detained, ask police or prison officials to notify the British Embassy immediately.
The Overseas Business Risk service offers information and advice for British companies operating overseas on how to manage political, economic, and business security-related risks.
