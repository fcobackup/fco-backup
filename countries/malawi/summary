Given the rapidly changing situation in Malawi we have temporarily withdrawn a limited number of UK staff and their dependents from our High Commission. The High Commission will continue to carry out essential work including providing 24/7 consular assistance and support to British people in Malawi.
Most visits to Malawi are trouble-free, but you should take sensible precautions to protect yourself from muggers and bag-snatchers. Most thefts from visitors take place around the main bus stations in Lilongwe and Blantyre. See Crime
The results of Malawi’s May 2019 elections were challenged in the High Court by two political parties. This led to protests in central Lilongwe and elsewhere in Malawi which have at times turned violent, with some reports of looting and damage to property. On 3 February, the High Court nullified the Presidential election and called for fresh elections. An appeal was lodged against this decision, which the Supreme Court dismissed on 8 May. Malawi held Presidential elections on 23 June.
In the period following the election, sporadic localised violence may occur. You should exercise caution and avoid large crowds and demonstrations. Whilst we believe the election period will be mostly peaceful, you may also wish to stock up on petrol, food and essentials, including any medication, in case normal service provision is disrupted in the short term.
