The Falkland Islands authorities have introduced a number of precautionary measures in response to the coronavirus (COVID-19) pandemic.
Cruise vessels will be allowed to call into the Falkland Islands if:
Everyone on board has been on board for a minimum of 10 days
No-one on board is suffering from symptoms which makes them a “suspect case” for Covid-19 (see air travel section).
If you arrive into the Falkland Islands by air you are expected to self-isolate for a period of 14 days if you develop symptoms after arrival which makes you a suspect case. You should call the hospital on 28000 for advice if you need medical help.
A suspect case is a person with a fever and a cough or shortness of breath, if there is no other explanation for those symptoms.
