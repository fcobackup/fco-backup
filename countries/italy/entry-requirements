This page reflects the UK government’s understanding of current rules for people travelling on a full ‘British Citizen’ passport from the UK, for the most common types of travel.
The authorities in Italy set and enforce entry rules. If you’re not sure how Italy’s entry requirements apply to you, contact Italy’s embassy, consulates in the UK.
COVID-19 rules
There are no COVID-19 testing or vaccination requirements for travellers entering Italy.
Public spaces and travel within Italy
If you are visiting a hospital intensive care ward or care home, you must wear a FFP2 mask.
Passport validity requirements
To travel to Italy, you must follow Schengen area passport requirements. 
To enter Italy (and all Schengen countries) your passport must: 
have a ‘date of issue’ less than 10 years before the date you arrive. Passports issued after 1 October 2018 are now valid for only 10 years, but for passports issued before 1 October 2018, extra months may have been added if you renewed a passport early  
have an ‘expiry date’ at least 3 months after the day you plan to leave  
Check with your travel provider that your passport and other travel documents meet requirements. Renew your passport if you need to. 
You will be denied entry if you do not have a valid travel document or try to use a passport that has been reported lost or stolen.
Visa requirements
You can travel to countries in the Schengen area (including Italy) for up to 90 days in any 180-day period without a visa. This applies if you travel:
as a tourist
to visit family or friends
to attend business meetings, cultural or sports events
for short-term studies or training
If you are travelling to Italy and other Schengen countries without a visa, make sure your whole visit is within the 90-day limit. Visits to Schengen countries within the previous 180 days before you travel count towards your 90 days.
To stay longer (to work or study, for business travel or for other reasons), you must meet the Italian government’s entry requirements. Check which type of visa or work permit you may need with the Italian Ministry of Foreign Affairs or Italian Consulates in London, Manchester or Edinburgh before booking an appointment.
If you are travelling to Italy for work, read the guidance on visas and permits.
If you stay in Italy with a residence permit or long-stay visa, this does not count towards your 90-day visa-free limit.
British citizens who cannot return to the UK before the expiry of their visa or permit, or the end of their visa-free limit should contact their local immigration office (‘questura’).
Checks at border control 
Temporary border checks have been introduced at Italy’s border with Slovenia, allow extra time for crossing the land border. Be ready to show your passport or residency card if you are asked to do so by the border police.
Make sure you get your passport stamped.
If you’re a visitor, your passport must be stamped when you enter or leave the Schengen area (which includes Italy). Border guards will use passport stamps to check you have not overstayed the 90-day visa-free limit for stays in the Schengen area. If your passport was not stamped, border guards will presume you have overstayed the visa-free limit.  
If your passport is missing a stamp, show evidence of when and where you entered or left the Schengen area (for example, boarding passes or tickets) and ask the border guards to add the date and location in your passport.  
Read about passport stamping if you live in Italy. 
At Italian border control, you may need to: 
show proof of your accommodation, for example, a hotel booking confirmation or proof of address if visiting your own property (for example, a second home) 
show proof of insurance for your trip – check FCDO’s travel insurance guidance 
show a return or onward ticket 
prove that you have enough money for your stay. The minimum amount required depends on your accommodation 
follow procedures if you are hosting a guest at your property in Italy
Registering with the authorities 
Unless you are staying in a hotel or B&B, if you are entering from a Schengen area country (for example, France) you must declare your presence (‘dichiarazione di presenza’) to the local immigration authority (‘questura’) within 8 days of arriving. The ‘questura’ will provide a form to complete. 
You can find more information on the Ministry of Foreign Affairs or Italian police force websites.
Accommodation and those aged 17 and under
Under Italian law, if you are aged 17 and under you cannot check into hotels or holiday accommodation without an accompanying adult.
Vaccination requirements (other than COVID-19)
At least 8 weeks before your trip, check the vaccinations and vaccination certificates you may need on TravelHealthPro’s Italy guide.
Customs rules
There are strict rules about goods that can be brought into and taken out of Italy. You must declare anything that may be prohibited or subject to tax or duty.
Taking food into Italy
You cannot take meat, milk or products containing them into EU countries. There are some exceptions such as powdered baby milk, baby food, and special food or pet feed required for medical reasons.
