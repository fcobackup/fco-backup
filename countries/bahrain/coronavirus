COVID-19 vaccines if you live in Bahrain
Wherever possible British nationals should aim to be vaccinated in the country where they live. As further information is available about the national vaccination programme, this page will be updated. Sign up to get email notifications.
All residents over the age of 18 years (with a valid CPR card) can register online for an appointment to get the COVID-19 vaccine free of charge. Registration for the vaccination programme is also possible through the BeAware Bahrain smartphone application or by calling 444. You can select the type of vaccine you wish to receive. You will then be contacted to confirm the date and time of your vaccination appointment. The Bahraini vaccination programme also permits residents aged 12-17 to register for a Pfizer/BioNTech vaccination. If you are considering a vaccination for somebody in this age group, you should seek medical advice from their local healthcare provider.
Mobile vaccination units are available for seniors and individuals with special needs.
The Medicines and Healthcare Products Regulatory Agency (MHRA) is the UK authority responsible for assessing the safety, quality and efficacy of vaccines. It has authorised the Pfizer/BioNTech, Oxford/AstraZeneca and Moderna vaccines for temporary supply and use in the UK. Find out more about MHRA approval for these vaccines.
British nationals living overseas should seek medical advice from their local healthcare provider in the country where they reside.
