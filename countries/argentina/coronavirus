Cases of coronavirus (COVID-19) have been confirmed in Argentina. The Argentine authorities have introduced a number of measures to limit the spread of the virus.
On 19 March, Argentina introduced a nationwide quarantine to last from midnight on Thursday 19 March to midnight on Tuesday 31 March. During this period, people will only be able to leave their homes to buy necessities, such as medicines or foodstuffs, in their local area. Anyone found outside their home without justification will be charged with committing a public health crime
British nationals should comply with these new restrictions. However, flights will continue to depart Argentina and the Argentine Ministry of Foreign Affairs and the Civil Aviation Authority have confirmed that British nationals who have already purchased tickets will be able to access the airport to catch their flights. Some British nationals may need to travel to another province within Argentina in order to catch an international flight. Although most domestic flights in Argentina, as well as long distance trains and buses, will not resume operations until 1 April, the airline Aerolíneas Argentinas is running some exceptional flights to transport visitors from tourist destinations to Buenos Aires. Once flights have been purchased, travellers should leave plenty of time to get to the airport. If they encounter any resistance when trying to access the airport, they should contact consular assistance immediately on +54 11 4808-2200.
The FCO strongly encourage non-resident British nationals in Argentina to leave as soon as possible to avoid difficulties they will face trying to get home if flights out of the country and the region are further restricted.
The government has closed the country’s borders for all those entering except for Argentine citizens and resident foreign nationals.
There is a 30-day suspension, from 12 March, of all international flights from the UK (as well as the whole of Europe, the US, China, Japan, South Korea and Iran) to Argentina.
The last direct flight from Argentina to the UK departed on Monday 16 March. In line with the Argentine government’s classification of higher risk countries, the last scheduled flights to regional countries, including Brazil, will depart on 22 March with many airlines stopping services on 20 March. Brazil currently offers a direct scheduled flight to the UK.
These regulations are subject to change at short notice and you should check with your travel provider before your journey. Further information is also available on the Argentine Ministry of Health website (in Spanish).
