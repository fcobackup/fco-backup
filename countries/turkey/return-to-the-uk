There are still commercial options to return to the UK from Turkey.
If you live in the UK and are currently visiting Turkey, you’re strongly advised to return now by commercial means. Don’t risk getting stranded.
UK special charter flights will only operate for priority countries where commercial flights are not possible. You should not assume that these flights will become available in Turkey because commercial routes are operating. Please do not contact the contracted travel management company if no chartered flight is advertised here.
Flights
Pegasus Airlines are operating a flight from Izmir to London Stansted, via Dalaman, on Tuesday 28 April. Tickets are on sale via the Pegasus Airlines website.
This is a commercial flight operated by Pegasus Airlines, and all normal airline policies on baggage allowances will apply.
If you are in Dalaman or Izmir and the surrounding areas, you should consider purchasing a ticket for this flight. If you are in Bodrum or the surrounding area, you should consider purchasing a ticket for this flight from either Izmir or Dalaman.

Belavia flights from Istanbul to London Gatwick (via Minsk) are operating regularly. You should check the Belavia website for the latest details and availability.
The Istanbul to Minsk flight departs early in the morning, which facilitates a same-day connecting flight onward to London, and can be booked on one ticket to allow for an easier journey with hold baggage. This flight is bookable direct with the airline on their website.
Flights may be subject to change at short notice, please check the Belavia website for the latest information.
Travelling to the airport
Turkey has imposed restrictions on all internal travel between cities within Turkey. All travellers will need a travel permit if they are travelling from one city to another. In addition, you will also need a travel permit if you are aged over 65 or under 20 and need to travel within the same city. You will also need a travel permit if you intend to go to the airport during a ‘full nation-wide’ lockdown, which is expected most weekends.
To request a travel permit, please submit your request here. You should make clear in the subject box that you are enquiring about a permit to travel, and have proof of your onward journey out of Turkey.
We are aware that regular bus services to Dalaman and Izmir airports are not currently operating. If you have booked to travel from either of these airports on 28 April and are in need of transport from Bodrum, Fethiye, Marmaris, Didim and surrounding areas, we understand the transport providers below have been able to offer transfer options previously and are operating services according to demand at reasonable prices.

CTM are a commercial partner of the FCO and are authorised to administer such loans on behalf of the FCO.
