Entry and borders
See Entry requirements to find out what you will need to do in order to enter Greece.
Returning to the UK
When you return, you must follow the rules for entering the UK.
You are responsible for organising your own COVID-19 test, in line with UK government testing requirements. You should contact local authorities for information on testing facilities.
Be prepared for your plans to change
No travel is risk-free during COVID. Countries may further restrict travel or bring in new rules at short notice, for example due to a new COVID-19 variant. Check with your travel company or airline for any transport changes which may delay your journey home.
What to do if you test positive while in Greece
What you need to do if you test positive for COVID-19 while in Greece will depend on your vaccination status. If you have been fully vaccinated for at least 14 days, you will need to self-isolate for 7 days. If you are not fully vaccinated, or have not been so for 14 days, you will need to self-isolate for 10 days.
If you are not fully vaccinated and have been in close contact with someone who has tested positive for COVID-19 you will need to self-isolate for 14 days.
Depending on circumstances, you may be able to self-isolate in your current accommodation, or Greek authorities will ask you to self-isolate in a state provided quarantine hotel. The expense of the accommodation in quarantine hotels is covered by the Greek state. Local authorities will be able to offer further advice on self-isolation requirements.
If you do not self-isolate or quarantine when required you may be fined by the Hellenic Police. The fine could be as much as €5000. You should comply with any requirement to self-isolate or quarantine.
Plan ahead and make sure you:
can access money
understand what your insurance will cover
can make arrangements to extend your stay and be away for longer than planned
Quarantine hotels
If you test positive for COVID-19 you may have to enter a quarantine hotel. The UK government will not cover mandatory quarantine costs for British nationals. In Greece, the Greek authorities will pay the cost of your quarantine.
EHIC or GHIC cards can not be used to cover any additional expenses you incur whilst staying in a quarantine hotel. Make sure you have access to funds to cover the costs or take out insurance, checking the policy has adequate cover.
If you have or are entitled to an EHIC or GHIC and you need medical treatment while staying at a quarantine hotel, the UK government will fund treatment as usual through the EHIC/GHIC scheme.
Find out more from the NHS website about EHIC and GHIC healthcare cover abroad.
Wearing a mask
At present, it is mandatory to wear a mask in all indoor public places, in all areas of Greece.
COVID-19 restrictions
All restrictions remain under regular review. In Regional Units (περιφερειακές ενότητες) where the spread of COVID-19 is particularly high and hospital capacity is limited, restrictions may be tighter or re-imposed with limited notice.
A partial lockdown is in force in Chania (Crete) and on the island of Zakynthos (Zante) until at least 18 August, and in Heraklion (Crete) until at least 17 August. Restrictions include a curfew between 1am and 6am, and a ban on playing music at entertainment venues. Check the latest local guidance and follow the advice of local authorities.
Only the most relevant measures to travellers are included below. You should keep up-to-date by checking this page regularly, and following local announcements.
As restrictions may vary, you should check the latest local guidance.
you must use a facemask in all indoor public and communal spaces, including work-places and on public transport;
restricted numbers are in place for churches and religious services;
Unless all passengers are members of the same family, a maximum of 3 persons are permitted to travel in a taxi or other private vehicle with up to 7 seats, or 4 persons in a private vehicle with up to 9 seats;
Cross-regional travel is allowed for mainland Greece and the islands of Lefkada, Evia and Salamina (use of self-tests ahead of travel is strongly recommended but is not mandatory).
Cross-regional travel to the rest of the islands is permitted but only with either:
proof of vaccination and 14 days since second dose (see Demonstrating your COVID-19 vaccination status), or
a negative result from a PCR test carried out up to 72 hours prior to travel; or
a negative result from a rapid test or self-test conducted up to 24 hours before travel; or
a self-test declaration signed less than 24 hours before travel; or
documentary proof of having recovered from Covid-19 (at least 2 months since infection, and no more than 9 months)
Travel in Greece
Travel within Greece between Regional Units is permitted subject to adherence to public health measures as outlined above. You must wear a mask at all times on all public transport.
If you are travelling via ferry, you will need to complete a health questionnaire and hand it to the ferry operator before boarding. The necessary forms will be provided by the operator: you should contact them directly if you need further information. Temperature checks may also be carried out before boarding.
If you are travelling by internal (domestic) flights, specific measures relating to check-in, baggage allowances and other details are in place to reduce the spread of coronavirus. You should check with your operator directly for further detail.
Accommodation
All hotels are permitted to open, and other types of accommodation, including e.g. Airbnb, private rentals and hostels, are also available. However, you should note that many operators are likely to reduce their offer and close some accommodation during the winter months, particularly in light of measures put in place by the Greek authorities to fight the spread of COVID-19. You should check directly with your accommodation provider in case of related concerns.
Healthcare in Greece
If you think you have symptoms, including a fever or respiratory difficulties such as shortness of breath or a cough, you should avoid visiting local health facilities, but contact a doctor remotely to see whether a test is recommended. There is likely to be a cost associated with this, for call out, examination and testing, which you will have to pay.
If you are staying in a hotel or resort, your accommodation provider will have a list of private doctors that they will call to assess your symptoms and conduct a COVID-19 test.
If you have arranged your own accommodation you can find details of English speaking, private doctors on our list of healthcare providers.
If you are tested and the result is positive, the Greek authorities will ask you to quarantine until advised otherwise. You may be able to remain in your existing accommodation, or be required to transfer into a state hospital or other government-provided accommodation. Costs related to transfer to alternative accommodation and treatment at state healthcare facilities will be covered by the Greek Government. The nature of your accommodation may differ from the specifications of your pre-booked hotel, villa or other place of stay. Depending on local arrangements, travellers in groups may be required to stay in separate accommodation (e.g. if a sufficient number of rooms is not available in one venue, your group may be spread across different accommodation locations).
For more information, consult the Greek National Public Health Organisation (NPHO) online or via telephone (dial 1135, or 210 521 2054, from within Greece).
Your emotional and mental wellbeing is important. Read guidance on how to look after your mental wellbeing and mental health.

COVID-19 vaccines if you live in Greece
Wherever possible British nationals should aim to be vaccinated in the country where they live. We will update this page when the Government of Greece announces new information on the national vaccination programme. You can sign up to get email notifications when this page is updated.
The Greek national vaccination programme started in December 2020 and uses the AstraZeneca, Pfizer-BioNTech, Janssen (Johnson & Johnson) and Moderna vaccines. British nationals resident in Greece are eligible for vaccination. You can get more information on the Greek National Vaccination Programme. You can register online through the website or get help registering at any pharmacy in Greece. The Greek authorities are aware of issues registering for those who don’t hold AMKA numbers, and are currently working to implement a solution. You should continue to check the Greek National Vaccination Programme (available in Greek and in English) for the latest information.
Find out more, including about vaccines that are authorised in the UK or approved by the World Health Organisation, on the COVID-19 vaccines if you live abroad.
If you’re a British national living in Greece, you should seek medical advice from your local healthcare provider. Information about COVID-19 vaccines used in the national programme where you live, including regulatory status, should be available from local authorities.
If you receive your COVID-19 vaccination in Greece, you can get an EU Digital COVID Certificate from the national authorities. The Certificate proves that you have been vaccinated against COVID-19, received a negative test result, or recovered from COVID-19. It will help facilitate your travel within the EU and, in some countries, you can use it to demonstrate your COVID-19 status to businesses and other organisations. For further information visit the European Commission’s EU Digital COVID Certificate page.
