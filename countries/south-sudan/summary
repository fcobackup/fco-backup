The Foreign, Commonwealth & Development Office (FCDO) advise against all travel to South Sudan.
If you choose to travel to South Sudan against FCDO advice, exercise caution and vigilance at all times and avoid any travel during the hours of darkness. You should make sure you have comprehensive contingency plans that don’t rely on support from the Embassy, including a stock of essential supplies and up-to-date travel documents and visas. If you’re concerned about your safety, you should contact the FCDO on +44 207 008 5000.
Travel to South Sudan is subject to entry restrictions
To enter South Sudan, you must have a certificate showing you are free from coronavirus, issued no more than 96 hours ahead of your journey, and endorsed by a reputable medical provider.
You will need to self-quarantine for 14 days on arrival.
See Entry requirements for more information before you plan to travel.
Preparing for your return journey to the UK
If you’re returning to the UK from overseas, you will need to:
provide your journey and contact details before you travel
check if you need to self-isolate on your return
If your return journey to the UK transits another country, you should check whether it is subject to a travel ban or any other additional requirements. If so, contact your travel provider.
Check our advice on foreign travel during the coronavirus (COVID-19) pandemic and sign up for email alerts for this travel advice.
If you’re planning travel to South Sudan, find out what you need to know about coronavirus there in the Coronavirus section.
During the COVID-19 pandemic, it is more important than ever to get travel insurance and check it provides sufficient cover. See the FCDO’s guidance on foreign travel insurance.
For information about COVID-19 vaccines, see the Coronavirus page.
There is an official government curfew across South Sudan from 10pm to 6am in an effort to prevent the spread of coronavirus.
Consular support is severely limited in South Sudan. The British Embassy in Juba does not have a consular section. If you are in South Sudan and need urgent help from the UK Government, contact the British High Commission in Nairobi.
You should be vigilant of the local security situation, monitor the local media, and stay in a safe location. Most international organisations in South Sudan employ a security manager to monitor the situation and keep employees safe.
A ceasefire is currently in place, and has largely held since September 2018. However, there are regular reports of intercommunal violence in some areas of the country, as well as sporadic reports of fighting between armed groups. Serious criminality in Juba, and other urban areas, particularly during the hours of darkness, is also a regular concern. A deterioration in the security situation remains possible, and could be prompted by a number of factors including developments in the fragile economy, the ongoing peace process, or a more securitised response to coronavirus (COVID-19).
In the event of a serious deterioration in the security situation, similar to those of July 2016 and December 2013, routes into and out of South Sudan may be blocked, Juba airport may be closed or inaccessible, and flights may be suspended at short notice. Regional developments may also increase the unpredictability of infrastructure and transport, as happened in April 2019 when events in Sudan led to the temporary closure of South Sudan’s airspace.
The main road connecting Juba to Uganda is extremely dangerous, with regular reports of accidents and attacks on vehicles by armed groups. See Safety and Security. The border reopened on 1 October following the lifting of restrictions in place in the region in response to COVID-19. A negative COVID-19 test certificate is required at Uganda’s land borders issued no more than 120 hours prior.
Terrorist attacks in South Sudan can’t be ruled out. See Terrorism
