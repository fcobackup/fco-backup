Following reports of an attempted coup against the President of Gabon on 7 January, sporadic gunfire has been reported in Libreville and there is a visible military presence on the streets. Internet and media access has been reportedly affected. You should remain indoors in a safe location where possible, follow media coverage if you are able to do so, and monitor this travel advice for updates.

During periods of unrest, police checks may increase. Make sure you have all required documentation with you and avoid large gatherings.
