The US National Weather Service has declared the state of Hawaii to be under a hurricane watch due to the approach of Hurricane Lane. If you’re in the area, you should be vigilant, take necessary precautions, monitor local news broadcasts and follow the advice of local authorities. For more information and the latest updates check with the Hawaii Emergency Management Agency and the Central Pacific Hurricane Center.
There are a number of wildfires in several west coast states, including California and Oregon, with states of emergency being declared in some counties. Areas in and around Shasta, Lake, and Mendocino Counties in Northern California, and Orange County in Southern California have been particularly affected. Wildfires can spread swiftly, so if you’re in the area you should remain vigilant, monitor local media reports, and follow the instructions issued by local authorities, including obeying any evacuation orders. Further information can be found at CalFire and the Oregon Wildfires & Forest Fires websites.
If you’ve been affected by the wildfire and need consular assistance, you can call the British Consulate in San Francisco on +1 415 617 1300; if you’re in the UK and worried about a British national visiting the Yosemite region, you can call the FCO on 020 7008 1500. Forest and brush fires (wild fires) are a danger in many dry areas.
High winds can cause fires to spread very rapidly. Areas of high risk are canyons, hills and forests. Monitor local media reports and follow the advice of local law enforcement officials. Exercise caution in areas which have been recently affected by wild fires as they are more susceptible to mudslides during heavy rainfall. For more information visit the National Interagency Fire Centre and US Geospatial Multi-Agency Coordination Group websites. For more detail about wild fires in California, visit the CAL FIRE website.
