Since June 2019, large-scale political demonstrations have taken place throughout the Hong Kong Special Administrative Region (SAR), including in areas popular with tourists. While a number of peaceful activities have taken place, many other protests have led to clashes between police and protesters involving significant violence.
Media reports indicate a number of protests are due to take place throughout Hong Kong in the week of 11 November. There have been clashes around a number of universities, with a particular focus at the Chinese University of Hong Kong in Sha Tin (New Territories).
The situation around protests and public gatherings can change quickly, with the potential for violence, especially during unauthorised protests. If you are in an area where demonstrations are taking place, you should remain vigilant, follow the advice of local authorities and move away quickly to a safe place. Previous demonstrations have led to sections of the city being closed off and temporary suspension of public transport without warning.
