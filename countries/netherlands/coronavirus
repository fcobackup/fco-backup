Travel in the Netherlands
The latest information on Dutch domestic coronavirus measures can be found on the Dutch government website (in English).
Non-medical face masks must be worn in all publicly accessible indoor spaces, including on public transport if you are aged 13 and over. If you do not wear a face mask you might be fined €95. Additionally, on platforms and stations, social distancing of 1.5 metres must be observed.
The Dutch government advises to limit your travel movements as much as possible. Public transport should be used for essential journeys only.
For other shared forms of transport, such as taxis, passenger vans and coaches, reservations should be made in advance and you must wear a non-medical face mask.
If you’re travelling in a car or other private vehicle, you are advised to wear non-medical face masks if there are two or more people in the vehicle who belong to different households.
On other forms of transport, you must stay 1.5 metres apart where possible.
Schiphol, Eindhoven and Rotterdam Airports
All passengers and staff aged 13+ must wear face masks in all areas of these airports. The terminals are only open for passengers and staff. You must not be accompanied into the airport, unless absolutely necessary for a traveller with reduced mobility.
Ferries
DFDS
All travellers must wear face coverings at check-in, whilst boarding, and during disembarkation. This applies for both foot- and car passengers, as well as freight drivers. On the Amsterdam - Newcastle route, passengers must wear face coverings whilst moving around the ship. Face coverings do not need to be worn when travellers are in their cabins, seated in a socially distanced manner or whilst social distancing on outside decks.
P&O
All travellers must wear a face mask during their journey.
Eurostar
All passengers aged 13+ must wear a face mask at Eurostar stations and on board trains. If you don’t have a mask you may be refused travel on Eurostar services.
Public Spaces and Services
Lockdown measures are in place across the Netherlands from 15 December 2020 until at least 2 March 2021. A full overview of the current Dutch measures is available online.
A night-time curfew applies throughout the Netherlands as part of the Dutch Government’s response to the COVID-19 pandemic. You are not allowed to be outdoors between 21:00 and 04:30 unless you have a permitted reason. See the Dutch Government’s website for a list of permitted reasons. If it is essential for you to be outdoors during curfew hours, you must complete a self-certified declaration form, which is also available on the Dutch Government’s website, along with a limited list of exemptions. Shops selling non-essential items are closed, as are public spaces. Supermarkets, bakeries, butchers and other shops selling food remain open. Other shops remaining open include pharmacies, chemists and petrol stations. Restaurants and cafes remain open for takeaway only.
A full list of venues and services affected by the lockdown can be found on the Dutch government website (in English).
Wearing a face mask is compulsory for everyone aged 13 and over in all indoor public spaces. This includes shops, museums, cafes and theatres. You risk having to pay a €95 fine if you do not wear a face mask as directed.
Outdoor group sizes are limited to no more than two people from different households.
The Dutch government advises against all non-essential international travel until the end of March. Holiday travel is not classified as essential by the Dutch government as is stated here.
You should check the latest local information before travelling, as individual regions might have imposed extra measures.
You must stay 1.5 metres away from other people. This applies to everyone over the age of 18: in the street, in shops and other buildings. It does not apply to members of your household and it does not apply if you are providing assistance to someone, for example pushing a wheelchair. If you notice that it is becoming difficult to keep a distance of 1.5 metres, you should leave. Avoid busy places in general, as if a gathering poses a safety or public health risk, enforcement officers can take action.
Accommodation
Foreign tourists are not obliged to reserve their holiday accommodation before travelling to the Netherlands. More information on visiting the Netherlands as a tourist can be found here and more information on Dutch coronavirus measures can be found here.

COVID-19 vaccines if you live in the Netherlands
Wherever possible British nationals should aim to be vaccinated in the country where they live. As further information is available about the national vaccination programme, this page will be updated. Sign up to get email notifications.
The Netherlands started its vaccination programme on 6 January 2021. It is the Dutch government’s goal to invite all residents aged 18 and over to receive their vaccination in 2021. Vulnerable groups and healthcare workers are the first groups to be invited. The Dutch government has issued information on the vaccination programme. If you are resident in the Netherlands, you should receive an invitation by letter or email when it is your turn to get the vaccination.
The Medicines and Healthcare Products Regulatory Agency (MHRA) is the UK authority responsible for assessing the safety, quality and efficacy of vaccines. It has authorised the Pfizer/BioNTech, Oxford/AstraZeneca and Moderna vaccines for temporary supply and use in the UK. Find out more about MHRA approval for these vaccines](https://www.gov.uk/government/collections/mhra-guidance-on-coronavirus-covid-19#vaccines-and-vaccine-safety).
British nationals living overseas should seek medical advice from their local healthcare provider in the country where they reside.
