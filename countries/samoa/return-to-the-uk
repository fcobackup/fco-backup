The Samoan Government has announced that, with effect from 26 March, all international travel by plane to and from Samoa will cease until further notice.
The Government of Australia has announced that from 9pm Australia Eastern Standard Time on 20 March, entry to the country will only be permitted to Australian citizens or permanent residents. This follows a similar announcement by New Zealand from 19 March.
Due to the rapidly changing nature of the COVID-19 outbreak across the region, flight availability and entry requirements/prohibitions can change at short notice. Our ability to provide consular services or support any evacuation in the Pacific may also be limited by these factors. You should take these limitations and risks into account when planning. Please monitor our UK in the Pacific social media platform for updates. Check out our Facebook page and Twitter feed.
