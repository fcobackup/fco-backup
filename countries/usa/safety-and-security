Terrorism
There is a high threat of terrorist attack globally affecting UK interests and British nationals, including from groups and individuals who view the UK and British nationals as targets. You should remain vigilant at all times.
UK Counter Terrorism Policing has information and advice on staying safe abroad and what to do in the event of a terrorist attack. Find out how to reduce your risk from terrorism while abroad.
Terrorism in the USA
Terrorists are very likely to try to carry out attacks in the USA.
Attacks could be indiscriminate, including in places visited by foreigners. You should remain aware of your surroundings, keep up to date with local media reports and follow the advice of local authorities. Targets could include:
crowded areas
transportation networks
public events
The US Department of Homeland Security provides current alerts within the USA and its territories.
Crime
Protecting your belongings
Do not leave passports in rental cars, especially in the boot. Gangs may target vehicles of those who appear to be tourists.
Violent crime
Tourists are rarely involved in violent and gun crime, but take care in unfamiliar areas. Avoid walking through quieter areas alone, especially at night. You can find public advisories and information about recent incidents on the websites of local law enforcement authorities.
Incidents of mass shooting can happen but are a very small percentage of homicide deaths. Read the US Department of Homeland Security advice on what to do in an active shooter incident.
Research your destination before travelling and follow the advice of local authorities. Crime associated with illegal drugs is a major issue in Mexican states bordering Arizona, California, New Mexico and Texas. Some foreign nationals have been victims of crime in the border regions, but there is no evidence to suggest they have been targeted because of their nationality.
Protests
Protests are common and can become violent. Follow the instructions of local authorities who may introduce curfews or emergency orders. If you do attend any peaceful protests, you should:
be mindful of your surroundings
move away if there are signs of trouble
follow the instructions of local authorities
Laws and cultural differences
US states may have different laws. Whilst you are in a state, you are subject to both that state’s laws as well as national (federal) law.
Personal ID
Always carry a passport showing that you have permission to enter or remain in the USA.
Alcohol laws
The national legal age for buying and drinking alcohol is 21 years. Some states have different laws. If you are under-21, check the relevant state laws before drinking or buying alcohol.
Illegal drugs and prison sentences
Possession or trafficking of illegal drugs in the USA can carry a long prison sentence and fine. Check state laws to make sure you comply with the laws on possession and use of controlled substances. The US Department of Justice website provides a list of all controlled substances.
LGBT+ travellers
The USA is a very diverse society and attitudes towards lesbian, gay, bisexual, and transgender (LGBT+) people differ hugely across the country. Read our information and advice page for the LGBT+ community before you travel. You can find more detail on LGBT+ issues in the USA on the Human Rights Campaign website.
Transport risks
Road travel
If you are planning to drive in the USA, see information on driving abroad and check the driving rules in the state(s) you’ll be visiting.
Licences and permits
If you plan on driving in the USA, you may need a 1949 international driving permit (IDP) as well as a full valid driving licence.  IDP requirements vary in each state.  For more information, you can consult individual states’ Department of Motor Vehicles as well as the American Automobile Association (AAA).
You cannot buy an IDP outside the UK, so get one before you travel. You can buy an IDP in person from some UK post offices – find your nearest post office branch that offers this service. Provisional licences are not accepted.
If you have an older, paper UK driving licence you must take another form of photographic ID, such as your passport. You may need to show an IDP to your insurance company if you’re involved in an accident.
If you’re hiring a vehicle, check requirements with your rental company before you travel.
Vehicle safety
When travelling by car, you should:
check weather conditions before a long car journey, particularly in mountainous, isolated or desert areas where services may be limited
not sleep in your car by the road or in rest areas
avoid leaving any items on display in your car
stay on main roads
use well-lit car parks
If you’re in an accident, ask any other drivers involved to follow you to a public place and call the police.
Petrol stations
Petrol stations that do not display the price of fuel usually charge considerably more than the national average. They’re often found close to tourist destinations and airports, including near to Orlando International Airport. Make sure you know the price of fuel before using these services.
Air travel
Before you travel, check the security measures you’re likely to face at the airport on the Transportation Security Administration (TSA) website. Contact TSA Cares for assistance if you have a medical condition or disability and need assistance.
To monitor airport conditions in the USA, visit the Federal Aviation Administration website.
Extreme weather and natural disasters
Extreme Heat
Extreme heat is currently affecting many parts of the USA. Check the temperature in your area and visit the CDC website for information on how to take care of yourself.
Snowstorms
Snowstorms during winter can disrupt critical infrastructure, and cause power cuts, or delays and cancellations in major transport hubs. Contact your travel company or airline before you travel.
Hurricanes
The Atlantic hurricane season normally runs from June to November. The Pacific hurricane season normally runs from May to November. They can affect coastal regions, Hawaii and Guam. The South Pacific tropical cyclone season normally runs from November to May and can affect American Samoa.
You should:
monitor the progress of approaching storms on the US National Hurricane Center website
follow instructions from local authorities, including evacuation orders
visit the Federal Emergency Management Agency (FEMA) website for information on preparing for extreme weather and evacuating, and for a list of disaster supplies that will help
see our tropical cyclones page for advice about how to prepare effectively and what to do if you’re likely to be affected by a hurricane or tropical cyclone

Wildfires
Forest and brush fires (wildfires) are a danger in many dry areas, particularly in canyons, hills and forests. High winds can mean fires spread rapidly.
You should:
monitor local media and weather reports
follow the advice of local authorities, including any evacuation orders
be careful in areas recently affected by wildfires, as there may be mudslides during heavy rainfall
For more information visit the National Interagency Fire Centre and Fire Research and Management Exchange System websites.

Arctic travel
Parts of the USA are in the Arctic Circle, including some very remote areas of land and sea. Emergency medical assistance and search and rescue are limited in these areas. See Arctic travel safety advice.
