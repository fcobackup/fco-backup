Following civil unrest across Chile you should expect to see a military presence in major cities. Further large demonstrations are expected in Santiago and other cities. You should follow the instructions and advice of the local authorities, remain vigilant, monitor local media for updates and avoid protests and demonstrations.
All of Santiago’s public transport – including the metro and buses – is running a very limited service at this time. Public transport in other cities may be affected. Some banks, shopping malls and supermarkets are operating reduced hours or remaining closed.
Some domestic and international flights have been delayed or cancelled in recent days. You should check the status of your flight with your airline before travelling to the airport.
Some land border crossing points between Chile and the neighbouring countries of Argentina, Bolivia and Peru are currently being closed overnight. If you plan to cross any land border point, check with authorities for exact closure times prior to travel.
Around 80,000 British nationals visit Chile each year. Most visits to Chile are trouble-free. Opportunistic street crime can be a problem in towns and cities, and in areas popular with tourists.
