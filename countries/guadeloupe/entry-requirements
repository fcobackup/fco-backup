This page reflects the UK government’s understanding of current rules for people travelling on a full ‘British Citizen’ passport, for the most common types of travel.
The authorities in Guadeloupe set and enforce entry rules. If you’re unsure how Guadeloupe’s entry requirements apply to you, contact its UK embassy, high commission or consulate.
Entry rules in response to coronavirus (COVID-19)
From 1 August 2022, the French government announced that all travel restrictions between France and Guadeloupe have been lifted.
You are no longer required to present proof of vaccination
You are no longer required to fill out any forms prior to your arrival; such as a justification for travel or a sworn statement
You are no longer required to show proof of a negative PCR or antigen test upon arrival
You may still face some restrictions for entry to Guadeloupe depending on your vaccination status and your country of departure. You should check the French government’s website (in French) , and the local Prefecture’s website (in French) for details on any remaining local restrictions.

Regular entry requirements
Visas
Guadeloupe is an Overseas Department of France (département d’outre-mer) and part of the European Union.
If your passport describes you as a British Citizen, you will not need a visa to enter Guadeloupe for stays of up to three months. Other British passport holders, and those who plan to stay longer than three months, should check the current entry requirements on the website of the French Ministry of Foreign Affairs and if necessary confirm with the nearest French Diplomatic mission.
UK residents in Guadeloupe
If you live in Guadeloupe, you should carry your residence document, as well as your valid passport when you travel. If you have applied but not yet received your document, carry your certificate of application. You will have received this as an email. If you have not yet applied for a residence document, you should carry evidence that you are resident in Guadeloupe. This could include a tenancy agreement or a utility bill in your name, dating from 2020. For more information, including on how to apply for a residence document, see the French government’s website.
Passport validity
Travellers should ensure that their passport has at least 3 months of validity after the date you intend to leave Guadeloupe.
Check your passport is valid for travel before you book your trip. You will need to renew your passport before travelling if you do not have enough time left on your passport.
Yellow fever certificate requirements
Check whether you need a yellow fever certificate by visiting the National Travel Health Network and Centre’s TravelHealthPro website.
