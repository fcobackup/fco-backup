International travel
Korean Air and Asiana are running direct flights from London to Seoul. Restrictions based on nationality and visa type have been lifted for regularly scheduled flights, but remain in place for some specially chartered flights.
Airline and ticket booking websites do not typically highlight in the booking process which flights have nationality or visa restrictions. You should contact the airline before booking to confirm that you will be eligible to take your desired flight based on your nationality and visa. Passengers who are ineligible to take a flight may be refused check-in even if they have purchased a ticket.
If you are travelling with Korean Air from London to Seoul in July 2021, please note that flights on Tuesdays have nationality restrictions while flights on Saturdays do not. British nationals should book onto a Saturday flight. Do not book a Tuesday flight. Further information on Korean Air flight restrictions can be found on their Covid-19 Flight Status page.
You should remain aware of the quarantine requirements on entry. See Entry requirements.
Entry and borders
See Entry requirements to find out what you will need to do when you arrive in South Korea.
Public spaces and services
Face masks are compulsory in public places and on public transport. Failure to wear a mask can result in a fine of up to 100,000 Korean Won (£66). There is a limited exception to this rule if you have received at least one vaccine shot, are outside, can maintain at least a 2 metre distance from others, and are outside of Seoul, Incheon and Gyeonggi.
South Korea currently has a four-level national social distancing scale.

COVID-19 vaccines if you live in South Korea
Wherever possible British nationals should aim to be vaccinated in the country where they live. As further information is available about the national vaccination programme, this page will be updated. Sign up to get email notifications.
Information and details of the national vaccination programme was published by the Korean Disease Control and Prevention Agency (KDCA) (only available in Korean) on 17 February.
Long-term foreign nationals in South Korea aged 60 and over are eligible to register for free vaccinations to be administered by the end of June. Military personnel and their direct family members, employees in “essential social fields” (including firefighters, police and coastguards), individuals with chronic kidney disease, care workers, some teachers and childcare workers, and some healthcare workers are also eligible.
Plans for the vaccine rollout in July-September, for which most resident foreign nationals will continue to be eligible, were published on 17 June as follows:
Individuals aged 60-74 who have not yet received their vaccinations will be prioritised
Childcare and nursery workers and kindergarten, primary school and middle school teachers will be eligible to receive the Pfizer/BioNTech and Moderna vaccines starting in July
From the week of 19 July, Year 12 students and high school teachers will be eligible to receive the Pfizer/BioNTech vaccine
From the week of 26 July (with registration opening beforehand), individuals aged 55-59 will be eligible to receive a vaccination, to be followed in due course by individuals aged 50-54
From August, individuals aged 49 and below will be eligible to register for vaccination appointments
You should confirm your eligibility with the Korean authorities before booking your vaccination. To check your eligibility or book a vaccination, you should visit the KDCA website or contact the KDCA by phone from South Korea on 1339 (English language support is available).
If you are eligible to be vaccinated according to the general criteria (see above), in addition to booking vaccination appointments via the KDCA you may be able to book an appointment at short notice to receive a “leftover vaccine”. This is a vaccine dose that was not administered because the intended recipient did not attend their vaccination appointment. Foreign nationals who belong to the Korean national health insurance scheme can use this service. “Leftover vaccine” appointments can be booked through the KakaoTalk and Naver apps (in Korean), on a first-come-first-served basis. You should look for guidance on this process (in Korean) inside the apps themselves or on the KakaoTalk and Naver websites.
The Medicines and Healthcare Products Regulatory Agency (MHRA) is the UK authority responsible for assessing the safety, quality and efficacy of vaccines. It has authorised the Pfizer/BioNTech, Oxford/AstraZeneca, Moderna and Janssen (Johnson and Johnson) vaccines for temporary supply and use in the UK. Find out more about MHRA approval for these vaccines.
British nationals living overseas should seek medical advice from their local healthcare provider in the country where they reside. Information about vaccines used in other national programmes, including regulatory status, should be available from the local authorities. This list of Stringent Regulatory Authorities recognised by the World Health Organisation may also be a useful source of additional information. Find out more information about the COVID-19 vaccines on the World Health Organization COVID-19 vaccines page.
