Male’ Airport closes daily from 12am to 6am local time.

Future travel options
The UK government is working closely with airlines, the Maldivian authorities and other governments to make sure options are available for you to return to the UK as soon as possible.
This travel will be updated with information on any other departure options. Sign up for travel advice email alerts and follow the British High Commission on Twitter.
You will need to pay for your return travel to the UK. If departure options are available but you cannot afford the travel costs and have exhausted all other options for getting funds, you may be eligible to apply for an emergency loan from the government. This is a last resort option and you would need to repay the loan when you are back in the UK. For more information, contact Corporate Travel Management (CTM). CTM are a commercial partner of the FCO and are authorised to administer such loans on behalf of the FCO.

are not allowed to leave the place you’re staying for the first 14 days you’re in the UK except in very limited situations (known as ‘self-isolating’)
See also the list of people who are exempt from the border rules.
