The Foreign and Commonwealth Office (FCO) advise against all travel to:
the Darfur states
the Abyei Region
South Kordofan and Blue Nile states
the southern area of West Kordofan state that was previously part of South Kordofan, as shown on the map
within 50km of the border with South Sudan in White Nile and Sennar states
within 200km of the border with Libya
The FCO advise against all but essential travel to the rest of Sudan, including Khartoum. If you plan to visit Sudan you should consider carefully whether your journey is absolutely necessary. As of 5 June 2019, the decision was made to withdraw non-essential British Embassy staff and dependants from Sudan and these have yet to return.
Following the removal of Sudan’s former President on 11 April 2019 and the establishment of a Transitional Military Council (TMC), the situation in Khartoum and across Sudan remains tense. On 3 June, security forces dispersed protestors by force from a civilian main protest site in central Khartoum. Approximately 30 people were killed and more than 100 injured. The African Union is currently leading mediation efforts aimed at a swift transition to a civilian led government. See Political situation
You should maintain a high level of vigilance across the country, avoid all protests and large gatherings, monitor developments closely and follow the instructions of local authorities and security services.
If you’re in Khartoum, limit your movements in and around the city and plan any travel carefully. There remains a significant security military presence in many areas of Khartoum. Khartoum Airport is operating normally but travellers are advised to check regularly with their airline for the latest information before leaving for the airport. See Local travel - Khartoum
There has been no internet service in Khartoum since 3 June. Voice and SMS is largely available on most mobile phones. There had earlier been sporadic limitations on access to internet-based communications and social media sites. Virtual Private Networks (VPNs) are not readily available to download in Sudan.
The ability of the British Embassy to provide consular support to British nationals in Sudan is severely limited. You shouldn’t assume that the FCO will be able to provide assistance to leave the country in the event of serious unrest, a further deterioration in the security situation and/or reduced capacity of commercial flights. See this page for more information about the precautions you should take in the event of a crisis and the help and support the British Embassy can provide.
Terrorists are likely to try to carry out attacks in Sudan. Attacks could be indiscriminate, including in places frequented by expatriates and foreign travellers. See Terrorism
If you’re abroad and you need emergency help from the UK government, contact the nearest British embassy, consulate or high commission.
The Overseas Business Risk service offers information and advice for British companies operating overseas on how to manage political, economic, and business security-related risks.
Take out comprehensive travel and medical insurance before you travel.
