Terrorists are very likely to try to carry out attacks in Afghanistan.
UK Counter Terrorism Policing has information and advice on staying safe abroad and what to do in the event of a terrorist attack. Find out more about the global threat from terrorism.
Multiple threats are issued daily. Terrorists and insurgents conduct frequent and widespread lethal attacks against Afghan National Defence and Security Forces (ANDSF), domestic and international political and civilian targets including within the city gates, and those working in the security, humanitarian and reconstruction fields. You should note an overall increased threat to Western interests in Kabul, including from high-profile, large-scale attacks.
Past incidents include:
on 18 October 2019, a suicide bomber targetted a mosque in Deh Bala, Nagarhar, killing 69 and wounding 36
on 18 August 2019, a suicide bomber struck at a Shia wedding ceremony in the west of Kabul, killing 63 people and wounding more than 180 others
on 7 August 2019, a suicide vehicle based device struck a police location in Kabul city, killing 14 and injuring 145, 92 of whom were civilians
on 28 July 2019, a complex attack targeted a political gathering in Kabul city, killing 20 and injuring 50
on 25 July 2019, an explosion in Kabul city targeting an international convoy caused the death of 8 civilians and injured 10 others
on 15 July 2019, a roadside bomb targeted a bus carrying civilians in Kandahar, killing 11 and injuring 35.
The insurgency has a strong anti-Western focus; this could make any UK interest or person a target. Attacks include bombs (roadside and other), suicide bombs (either on foot or by vehicle), indirect fire (rockets and mortars), direct fire (shootings and rocket propelled grenades), kidnappings and violent crime. Daesh is also fiercely hostile to the UK and other western countries.
If you decide to travel to Afghanistan, you should read this section in conjunction with the Safety and Security section.
You should be particularly vigilant on public or religious holidays, in and around landmark locations and places where large public crowds can gather. Hotels used by the government of Afghanistan and western nationals, ministries, military establishments, airports (including Kabul International) and religious sites have been attacked and further attacks are possible. Installations and life support facilities have been subject to attacks in recent years, specifically for their link to Western countries. Avoid regular visits to public places frequented by foreigners, including hotels, restaurants, shops and market places, especially at times of day when they are particularly busy and congested.
The British Embassy does not allow official visitors to stay in any hotel overnight, and has placed restaurants off limits to staff. Make sure your accommodation is secure, and review your security measures regularly.
Kidnap
The risk of being kidnapped throughout Afghanistan remains a very high and constant threat. At least four foreign nationals have been kidnapped in Kabul since July 2016, some of whom remain in captivity:
on 2 August 2018, 3 international workers were killed shortly after kidnap in Kabul
on 20 May 2017, a foreign aid worker was kidnapped in Kabul. The incident led to the death of a German national during the kidnap and subsequent release of the kidnapped Finnish national.
Over 100 westerners have been kidnapped in Afghanistan since 2001, a number of them have been British nationals. The motivation and desire to undertake kidnapping in Afghanistan is likely to continue. You should take the utmost care, vary routines and avoid setting regular patterns of movement. You should take professional security advice while in the country.
Those engaged in tourism, humanitarian aid and some other development work, journalism or business sectors are viewed as legitimate targets. If you’re kidnapped, the reason for your presence is unlikely to serve as a protection or secure your safe release.
The long-standing policy of the British government is not to make substantive concessions to hostage-takers. The British government considers that paying ransoms and releasing prisoners increases the risk of further hostage taking.
There’s considered to be a heightened threat of terrorist attack globally against UK interests and British nationals, from groups or individuals motivated by the conflict in Iraq and Syria. You should be vigilant at this time.
Regions
The Foreign and Commonwealth Office (FCO) advise against all or all but essential travel to different parts of the country according to provincial region:
Kabul
The FCO advise against all but essential travel to Kabul’s Enhanced Security Zone and Hamid Karzai International Airport, and against all travel to all other areas within the city of Kabul.
You should note an overall increased threat to Western interests in the capital. There’s an ongoing threat from high-profile, large-scale attacks.
If you’re travelling in Kabul, take particular care on Airport road, Jalalabad road and Darulaman road. Avoid travelling on Jalalabad and Darulaman roads during commuter or other busy times (around 6am to 8am, 9am to 11am and 3pm to 4pm local time), when traffic can be heaviest and the risk of an attack against government and western people or interests is most likely. Avoid travelling along Airport road except for essential movements as attacks are likely throughout the day.
Northern Afghanistan
The FCO advise against all travel to Faryab, Jowzjan, Baghlan, Takhar, Kunduz, Badakhshan, Sar-e-pul, Balkh and Samangan provinces.
There have been a number of attacks against aid workers and military vehicles resulting in deaths and injuries, and there are ongoing military operations throughout the north. The FCO advice against all travel to Badakhshan includes travel to or climbing and trekking within the Wakhan Corridor.
On 8 February 2017, six Afghan staff of the International Committee of the Red Cross (ICRC) were shot and killed in Jowzjan Province, Afghanistan. Two further staff members travelling in the same convoy are so far unaccounted for.
Eastern Afghanistan
The FCO advise against all travel to Ghazni, Kapisa, Khost, Kunar, Laghman, Logar, Nangarhar, Nuristan, Paktika, Wardak, Paktya and Parvan provinces, and Bamian province (except the capital, Bamian city).
The FCO advise against all but essential travel to the city of Bamian and the province of Panjshir.
The eastern region has been extremely volatile for some time, with almost daily suicide and roadside bomb attacks, shootings and rocket attacks. The region close to the Pakistani border is extremely dangerous with a high number of insurgents operating freely. On 27 July 2019, a Vehicle Borne Explosive Device (VBED) struck a police headquarters in Ghazni province, killing 4 and injuring 30. Insurgents continue to fight each other in Nangarhar province while maintaining a steady stream of attacks against governmental and security forces, often causing civilian casualties.
On 7 July 2019 a VBED targeted the headquarters of the Afghan National Security Directorate in Ghazni city, killing 12 and injuring 179, mainly schoolchildren.
There are regular, large military operations in this region. There have been numerous daily attacks against Afghan and non-Afghan forces. There are also daily incidents of Improvised Explosive Devices (IED), suicide and rocket attacks, and direct fire attacks on security forces patrols, checkpoints and bases as well as on the local population.
On 21 January 2019, insurgents attacked a military compound in Maidan Shar, with an estimated death toll of over 100.
Southern Afghanistan
• the FCO advise against all travel to Helmand, Kandahar, Nimroz, Uruzgan and Zabul provinces
On 18 July 2019, a truck filled with explosives detonated at the Afghan Police Headquarters in Kandahar city before attackers entered the compound. Two further vehicle borne devices increased the total number of casualties to 20 dead and 88 injured.
On 23 March 2019, 4 civilians were killed and a further 33 wounded when twin blsts detonated at a gathering celebrating farmers at Helmand province’s capitol, Lashkar Gah.
Western Afghanistan
The FCO advise against all travel to Badghis, Farah, Herat, Ghowre and Daykondi provinces.
There have been roadside bombs, suicide attacks, rocket attacks and criminal kidnappings throughout the western provinces and increased lawlessness in Western Ghowr. There is little security infrastructure in Daykondi and westerners have been kidnapped there.
On 11 January 2019, insurgents stormed the police headquarters in Herat city, killing 5 and wounding 4. On 19 May, an explosive device hit Iranian civil engineers and their protection detail working on a railway project, killing 2 and injuring 7. On 31 July, an explosion on a bus in Farah Province killed at least 27 people and wounded 17.
