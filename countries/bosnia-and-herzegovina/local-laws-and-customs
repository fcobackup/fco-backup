Coronavirus guidance is being updated.
Read the Prime Ministerâ€™s address for the latest information.

Carry your passport with you at all times. You must be able to show some form of identification if required, including when checking into hotels. For more information, please see the Ministry of Security of Bosnia and Herzegovina website.
There are no laws against same-sex sexual relations in Bosnia and Herzegovina, but LGBT issues are more tolerated than accepted. Public displays of affection are likely to be frowned upon and attract unwelcome attention. You should exercise discretion. See our information and advice page for the LGBT community before you travel.
