Warning
FCDO advises against all but essential travel to parts of Uganda.

This advice reflects the UK government’s understanding of current rules for people travelling on a full ‘British citizen’ passport from the UK, for the most common types of travel.
The authorities in Uganda set and enforce entry rules. If you’re not sure how these requirements apply to you, contact the Ugandan High Commission in the UK.
COVID-19 rules
Uganda’s Port Health Authority may check your temperature on arrival. If your temperature is above normal or you display COVID-19 symptoms, they may ask you to take a COVID-19 test.
Passport validity requirements
Your passport must have an ‘expiry date’ at least 6 months after the date you arrive in Uganda.
Check with your travel provider that your passport and other travel documents meet requirements. Renew your passport if you need to.
You will be denied entry if you do not have a valid travel document or try to use a passport that has been reported lost or stolen. 
Visa requirements
You must have a visa to enter Uganda. Check which visa best fits your needs.
Applying for a visa
You apply online to Ugandan Immigration, attaching the required documents and certificates including, in most cases, a yellow fever vaccination certificate. The immigration authorities will email you a letter of authorisation including a barcode. You print out the letter to present on arrival, where border officials will issue your visa.
Alternatively you can take the letter to a Ugandan embassy and they will issue the visa.  
You can also apply online for an East African Tourist Visa. This costs 100 US dollars and allows multiple entries into Kenya, Rwanda and Uganda over 90 days.
Airport entry restrictions
Only passengers with valid tickets and airport officials are allowed into Entebbe International Airport’s terminal building.
Vaccination requirements
You must bring the yellow fever vaccination certificate you used to get your visa.
For full details about medical entry requirements and recommended vaccinations, see TravelHealthPro’s Uganda guide.
Customs rules
There are strict rules about goods that can be taken into and out of Uganda. You must declare anything that may be prohibited or subject to tax or duty.
