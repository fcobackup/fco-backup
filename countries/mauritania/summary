Mauritania held parliamentary, regional and local elections on Saturday 1 September 2018. A second round of voting is due to take place on 15 September, although there are indications this may be delayed. Elections in Mauritania are historically peaceful. However, there will be a substantial increase in activity across the country during the election period, which may include large gatherings. You should be mindful of the situation and exercise caution on election days and subsequently as results are determined.
Terrorists are likely to try to carry out attacks in Mauritania, including kidnapping. You should be especially vigilant in public places and monitor local media. Attacks could be indiscriminate, including in places visited by foreigners. See Terrorism
Demonstrations have taken place in the capital Nouakchott. Some have involved clashes between police and demonstrators resulting in the use of tear gas. You should avoid all demonstrations. See Political situation
If you need consular assistance while you are in Mauritania, contact the British Embassy in Rabat or any EU Embassy in Nouakchott. See Safety and security.
Take out comprehensive travel and medical insurance before you travel.
