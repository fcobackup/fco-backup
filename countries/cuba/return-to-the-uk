If you wish to leave Cuba you should make a plan to leave now and contact your airline or tour operator.
Many airlines are reviewing their operations and are suspending or reducing flights into and out of Cuba. We anticipate that you will find it increasingly difficult to return to the UK. It is not known how long any disruption to services may last.
If you are taking a flight via another country, check the latest FCO travel advice for that country to be sure you can transit or enter that country.
