Health screening
British nationals with Lithuanian residency, or the right to work or study in Lithuania, or who are family members of Lithuanian citizens, may enter the country, but may be required to self-isolate for 14 days depending on their point of origin. While in isolation, you must:
not leave your accommodation without medical permission
not have guests/visitors
organise for essential provisions to be delivered by municipal authorities, friends, family or delivery services
consult with a GP by phone/email to arrange extensions to prescriptions
measure your temperature on a daily basis
call the Emergency Response Centre on 112, or Covid-19 hotline on 1808, if you develop a fever, cough or experience difficulty breathing

Finance
There is a range of financial support from the government that you can access while you are unable to return due to coronavirus restrictions.
If you’re in Lithuania, and have exhausted all other options to cover essential living costs while you wait to return home, you could apply for an emergency loan for your living costs from the UK government. You can only apply if you normally live in the UK and you cannot return home. This last-resort option is for those most in need, and you would need to repay the loan when you are back in the UK. Apply for an emergency loan.
