Before you travel check that:
your destination can provide the healthcare you may need
you have appropriate travel insurance for local treatment or unexpected medical evacuation
This is particularly important if you have a health condition or are pregnant.
Emergency medical number
Call 999 or 114 and ask for an ambulance.
Contact your insurance company quickly if you’re referred to a medical facility for treatment.

Read best practice when travelling with medicines on TravelHealthPro.
You can bring common medicines for your own use but you must carry a copy of the prescription. Tranquillisers, hypnotics, narcotics and other strong painkillers will require prior authorisation. You can check details with the Mauritius Ministry of Health and Wellness. If in any doubt, get advice from the Mauritius High Commission in the UK .
Healthcare in Mauritius
Good private healthcare is available but can be expensive. More complex cases may require evacuation to Réunion or South Africa. Make sure you have adequate travel health insurance and accessible funds to cover the cost of any medical treatment abroad and repatriation.
Private and state ambulance services are available, but the quality and response speed can vary. If you can, go directly to the hospital.
