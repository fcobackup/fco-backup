The information on this page covers the most common types of travel and reflects the UK government’s understanding of the rules currently in place. Unless otherwise stated, this information is for travellers using a full ‘British Citizen’ passport.
The authorities in the country or territory you’re travelling to are responsible for setting and enforcing the rules for entry. If you’re unclear about any aspect of the entry requirements, or you need further reassurance, you’ll need to contact the embassy, high commission or consulate of the country or territory you’re travelling to.

Entry rules in response to coronavirus
Entry to Slovakia
There are travel restrictions for travellers from the UK and most other countries. The Slovak Government may tighten its entry requirements further at short notice. Direct flights from the UK are permitted, but services are extremely limited.
As of 1 January 2021, only those UK nationals who are resident in Slovakia, close relatives of residents, close relatives of Slovak citizens, commercial transport personnel, students studying in Slovakia or those falling under certain limited exemptions may enter the country if they arrive directly from the UK or any other non-Schengen country. The above restriction does not apply for UK nationals who enter Slovakia via the land borders with Hungary, Austria, Czech Republic or Poland, or who fly from any country in the Schengen area.
If you travel to Slovakia, you must comply with the following requirements and failure to do so may incur a fine of up to 5,000 euros:
You must register in advance of travel on the Slovak government’s website and carry the confirmation with you during your stay, in case the authorities ask to see it.
If you arrive in Slovakia by air, you also need to complete the Slovak government’s Passenger Locator Form. You should carry a printed confirmation with you in case the airline or border officials ask to see it.
You must enter a 14-day period of self-isolation immediately after arrival. If you are self-isolating at a private residence, anyone living in the same household must also self-isolate.
The authorities will contact you no earlier than the 8th day of your self-isolation to arrange a free RT-PCR test for COVID-19.
You must also inform your doctor in Slovakia about your self-isolation. If you do not have a doctor in Slovakia, you should contact your nearest regional Public Health Authority for advice on how to have one assigned to you.
Ending your self-isolation depends on where you have arrived from:
If you arrive from or have visited exclusively the UK, EU countries, Iceland, Norway, Liechtenstein or Switzerland in the last 14 days you can end your self-isolation immediately upon receipt of a negative result from your official PCR test, as above. If you did not get tested and show no symptoms of Covid-19, your self-isolation ends automatically after 14 days.
If you arrive from or have visited countries other than those named above in the last 14 days you can only end your self-isolation by receiving a negative test result.
There are certain narrow exemptions to the requirement to self-isolate for the full 14-days:
Cross-border commuters may avoid self-isolation if they can show a negative antigen or PCR test result not older than 7 days and evidence of the reason for their commute.
Freight crews, funeral services employees, critical infrastructure employees, people in need of treatment or diagnosis abroad and sports teams going to competitions do not need to self-isolate provided they meet the conditions for these categories, as set out in the Slovak government’s legislation (in Slovak only).
Some travellers can shorten their self-isolation if they meet the following criteria: they must be residents of the UK, EU countries, Norway, Liechtenstein, Switzerland, or Iceland who are travelling between these countries and Slovakia for the purpose of work; or if they are citizens of the UK, EU, Switzerland, Norway, Iceland or Lichtenstein with residence in Slovakia and can show evidence that they have recovered from COVID-19 in the past 3 months; or if they can show evidence that they have received the second dose of COVID-19 vaccine more than 14 days previously (regardless of where they work or are resident). In order to qualify for this exemption, these groups must additionally follow the following steps:
show at the border a negative PCR test no older than 72 hours or a negative antigen test no older than 48 hours,
register in advance of travel on the Slovak government’s website,
enter self-isolation, which they can end as soon as they receive a negative PCR test carried out by a private laboratory in Slovakia at their own expense.
From 18 December, short cross-border trips to take a passenger to an airport in Austria, Hungary, Czech Republic or Poland are exempt from testing requirements on return to Slovakia. The driver must register in advance and be able to show evidence of the passenger’s flight. More information (in Slovak) on the Foreign Ministry website. The driver must also comply with the entry requirements of these countries, which can be found on the relevant FCDO Travel Advice.
The above information applies to UK nationals arriving by air or across land borders with Austria, Czech Republic, Hungary and Poland.
Entry into Slovakia from Ukraine is limited to certain categories of foreign traveller:
close relatives of Slovak nationals
those with Permanent Residence in Slovakia
those who meet one of the exemptions listed on the Slovak Ministry of Foreign Affairs website.
When entering Slovakia from Ukraine you must pre-register ahead of your arrival on the Slovak Government’s Coronavirus website and show evidence of your registration to the border official on arrival. For more information, see the Slovak Government’s Coronavirus website.

Regular entry requirements
Visas
The rules for travelling or working in European countries changed on 1 January 2021:
you can travel to countries in the Schengen area for up to 90 days in any 180-day period without a visa. This applies if you travel as a tourist, to visit family or friends, to attend business meetings, cultural or sports events, or for short-term studies or training.
if you are travelling to Slovakia and other Schengen countries without a visa, make sure your whole visit is within the 90 day limit. Visits to Schengen countries within the previous 180 days before you travel count towards your 90 days.
to stay longer, to work or study, for business travel or for other reasons, you will need to meet the Slovakian government’s entry requirements. Check with the Slovak Embassy what type of visa and/or work permit you may need.
if you stay in Slovakia with a visa or permit, this does not count towards the 90-day limit.
Any time you spent in Slovakia or other Schengen countries before 1 January 2021 does not count towards your 90-day visa-free limit.
At Slovakian border control, you may need to use separate lanes from EU, EEA and Swiss citizens when queueing. Your passport may be stamped on entry and exit. You may also need to:
show a return or onward ticket
show you have enough money for your stay
There are separate requirements for those who are resident in Slovakia. If you are resident in Slovakia, you should carry proof of residence as well as your valid passport when you travel. For further information on these requirements, see our Living in Slovakia guide.
Passport validity  
Check your passport is valid for travel before you book your trip, and renew your passport if you do not have enough time left on it.
You must have at least 6 months left on an adult or child passport to travel to most countries in Europe (not including Ireland).
If you renewed your current passport before the previous one expired, extra months may have been added to its expiry date. Any extra months on your passport over 10 years may not count towards the 6 months needed.
Make sure your passport is in a presentable state before you travel. The Slovak authorities can refuse entry if your passport is worn or damaged, or looks as if it’s been tampered with.
Registering with the Slovak authorities
If you plan to stay in Slovakia for a longer period of time, you should register with the police within 3 days of arrival. You’ll need your passport, 2 photographs and proof of accommodation. You’ll have an option to apply for a Slovak ‘green card’, which can be used as proof of your ID, while your passport is kept in a safe place. Visit the website of Ministry of Interior of the Slovak Republic for further information.
UK Emergency Travel Documents
UK Emergency Travel Documents (ETDs) are accepted for entry, airside transit and exit from Slovakia. They are also accepted for a return to Slovakia if you normally live there.
Travelling with pets
You cannot use the existing pet passport scheme. Instead, you’ll need an animal health certificate (AHC) for your pet. Allow at least 1 month to arrange this and relevant vaccinations.
Follow the guidance for taking your pet dog, cat or ferret abroad.
If your pet passport was issued in an EU Member State, it remains valid for travel to Slovakia.
See the Slovak Financial Administration guidance on travelling from the UK to Slovakia with pets (in Slovak only).
