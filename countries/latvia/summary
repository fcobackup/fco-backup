The Foreign, Commonwealth & Development Office (FCDO) advises against all but essential travel to:
The whole of Latvia based on the current assessment of COVID-19 risks.
Travel to Latvia is subject to entry restrictions

Everyone who intends to enter Latvia is required to complete and submit an electronic form no earlier than 48 hours before entering Latvia. Further information is available on the Latvian government’s COVID-19 website.
Asymptomatic travellers arriving in Latvia from a country (or who have been in a country in the previous 14 days) where COVID-19 cases exceed 50 per 100,000 of population over the previous 14 days are required to self-isolate for 10 days after leaving that country
All travellers entering Latvia including children age 11 and above, are required to present evidence of a negative COVID-19 test result taken no earlier than 72 hours before boarding or before crossing the Latvian border, for example by road. The test must be a PCR test.
From 17 March 2021, everyone entering Latvia from outside the EU, EEA, Switzerland and the UK by land, sea or air must pay for and take another COVID-19 test immediately on arrival. If the test is negative, you will need to self-isolate for 10 days in your place of residence. If the test is positive, you must quarantine yourself at your own expense at a hotel approved by the Latvian government.
