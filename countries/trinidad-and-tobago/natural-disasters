Earthquakes
Earthquakes are a potential threat and tremors are felt occasionally. On 21 August 2018 Trinidad and Tobago experienced an earthquake in excess of magnitude 6.7 causing damage to some buildings and communication networks. To learn more about what to do before, during and after an earthquake, visit the website of the US Federal Emergency Management Agency.
Hurricanes
The Caribbean hurricane season normally runs from June to November. Trinidad and Tobago is rarely affected by hurricanes but can experience severe storm conditions. Visitors to the Caribbean can monitor local and international weather updates from the National Hurricane Centre. 
See our Tropical cyclones page for advice about how to prepare effectively and what to do if you’re likely to be affected by a hurricane or tropical cyclone.
Seismic activity
You should monitor the alert level of the underwater volcano ‘Kick’em Jenny’, located 5 miles off the coast of Grenada. Observe any maritime exclusion zones and follow the advice of the local authorities in the event of increased activity or eruption.
