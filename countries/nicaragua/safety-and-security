Crime
There has been a rise in thefts, break-ins and muggings in recent years. Street crime is common in Managua but also occurs in other large towns. Pickpockets and thieves operate on public transport and around bus terminals. Many criminals have weapons, and most injuries and deaths have resulted when victims have resisted. If you are robbed, inform the police and get a signed and stamped copy of their report.
Express kidnappings have occurred involving passengers using unauthorised taxis, where cash is demanded for release a short while later.
If possible use radio-dispatched taxis. If you get a taxi on the street, use an authorised taxi, which has red plates, and the driver’s identification number, name and photograph clearly visible on the dashboard. Take note of the colour and number of the vehicle before you get in.
It’s a common local practice to share taxis with strangers. If you prefer to avoid this, agree a fare with the driver for a solo journey. Always agree the fare before you set off. Many assaults and robberies have occurred when using unlicensed taxis and when a stranger offers to call a taxi for you. Don’t take a taxi if it’s been called for you by someone you do not know well.
There have been reports of cars being stopped and passengers assaulted at traffic lights in Managua. Keep the windows of your car closed and the doors locked.
Don’t travel on buses after dark.
Take care when walking around, particularly in markets, bus stations, the area around the old cathedral in Managua and poorer areas of towns. Don’t walk alone after dark.
There have been reports of violent attacks against foreigners in hotels. Use hotels that are staffed at the front desk 24 hours a day and have adequate security measures.
Avoid wearing jewellery. Don’t carry large amounts of cash, credit cards or other valuables.
Local travel
When demonstrations occur, they have led to disruptions to traffic and public transportation and we advise that you check local information carefully before undertaking travel.
The North Atlantic Autonomous Region (RAAN) is very remote. You should plan any travel to this area carefully.
Don’t hike on volcanoes or in other remote areas without an experienced guide.
Although extensive de-mining operations have been carried out in rural areas of northern Nicaragua, some landmines may remain. Take care if you venture off the main roads.
Avoid road travel after dark due to the potential presence of armed groups.
Road travel
In addition to the difficulties mentioned above, road conditions are generally poor. There’s no street lighting on the main highways between major cities and only minimal street lighting in towns. Driving standards are low and the condition of vehicles, particularly taxis and buses is poor. Ignoring traffic lights is common practice. Drink driving is a severe problem.
Drivers of vehicles involved in serious injury or fatal road traffic accidents are often arrested and detained.
Right-hand drive vehicles may not be driven or imported into Nicaragua.
Air travel
During the wet season (April to October), it is usually better to fly to and from the Atlantic coast of Nicaragua on early morning flights because of the risk of severe storms later in the day.
Sea travel
Safety regulations and standards vary greatly. Although local law requires operators of public water-transport to have insurance, some operators still don’t carry recognised insurance. You should check the operator’s insurance cover before beginning your journey. In January 2016, a passenger boat travelling between islands off the Atlantic coast sank with the loss of 13 lives.
Swimming and water sports
 
Take care if you are swimming or taking part in water activities. Strong currents off sections of Nicaragua’s Pacific coast have resulted in drownings. Warning signs are not posted and lifeguards and rescue equipment are not readily available.  
Political situation
Many areas of the country have experienced a period of political unrest from April 2018, resulting in hundreds of deaths and detentions according to UN reports. Protests led to violent clashes and use of tear gas, rubber bullets and live ammunition. The situation is now quieter but remains unpredictable.
You should stay well away from all demonstrations and gatherings, even if apparently peaceful, as these could result in outbreaks of violence. It is also against Nicaraguan immigration law for foreigners to involve themselves in local politics, and you may put yourself at risk of arrest if taking part in protests, breaches of the peace, or other activity that could be perceived as acting against the government. You should exercise caution during your trip, monitor local media for reports of potential disruptions and avoid travelling at night.
Earlier in the crisis, heavily armed pro-government groups patrolled frequently. Whilst they appear to be less active at present, you should remain vigilant. The display of Nicaragua’s national blue and white flag, and these colours, as a means of protest by opposition groups has led to arrests and imprisonment in the past. Although the flag is widely flown by the authorities, its display in a context of political opposition could incur severe penalties.
