Travel in Georgia
Public transport is functioning normally in most of the country but has been suspended temporarily in the Adjara region. Taxis can hold no more than three people in a single vehicle, including the driver, with passengers sitting in the rear. If travelling from or to Tbilisi airport by taxi this social distancing rule must still be observed. Face masks must be worn in all public transport and taxis.
Accommodation
Some hotels and other rental accommodation have re-opened but many remain closed. Face masks must be worn when entering public spaces inside hotels and rental accommodation
Public spaces and services
Enforcement of regulations on social distancing and masks is being tightened as coronavirus cases have risen following the summer holidays. No more than 10 people can participate in social gatherings such as weddings and funerals, indoor or out. There is no limit on gatherings for political or election-related activities. Most shops, and some restaurants and hotels are open. Schools have restarted apart from in the Adjara region, although remote learning continues for older pupils. Universities reopen on 15 October.
It is mandatory to wear masks in enclosed spaces such as shops, when entering hotels and restaurants, and on public transport. Failing to do so can result in a 20 Lari (approx. £5) fine for an individual or 500 Lari (approx. £130) for a legal entity. In areas where there is an unexplained case of coronavirus, lockdown measures or testing may be introduced without warning.
Healthcare in Georgia
A number of medical facilities are allocated specifically for coronavirus patients, with further facilities in reserve. When cases had been low, everyone infected had been hospitalised as a precautionary measure. Since October only those with the most serious symptoms are taken to hospital. Everyone else is able to self-isolate at home. If you think you might have symptoms of coronavirus you should call the Georgian Emergency number 112.
