The Foreign and Commonwealth Office (FCO) advise against all but essential travel to central Bangui between the Airport and the Oubangui river, as shown on the map.
This area is bordered to the north by Avenue des Martyrs and Avenue de l’Indépendance linked by Avenue Koudoukou and bordered to the south by Avenue de France and Avenue Barthélemy Boganda linked by Avenue Ruth Roland. It includes the riverside area of the city centre (around Boulevard du Géneral de Gaulle) including the UNESCO building, the French Embassy and the Hotel Oubangi.
The FCO advise against all travel to the rest of Bangui and the Central African Republic (CAR).
A case of coronavirus (COVID-19) has been confirmed in the Central African Republic (CAR). The CAR authorities have introduced a number of measures to limit the spread of the virus. Given the rapidly changing situation in Democratic Republic of the Congo we are temporarily withdrawing a limited number of UK staff and their dependents from our Embassy in Kinshasa. The Embassy will continue to carry out essential work including providing 24/7 remote consular assistance and support to British people in the Central African Republic. See Health
British nationals who remain or visit against our advice should be aware that the FCO is not able to organise or assist your evacuation from the country. If the situation deteriorates further, leaving the country by commercial means will become increasingly difficult. Flights out of Bangui are limited. See Local Travel
Consular support is severely limited in the Central African Republic as there is no British Embassy. However, the British Embassy Kinshasa, in the Democratic Republic of Congo can provide limited remote consular support to British nationals. In an emergency, British nationals should contact the British Embassy Kinshasa, in the Democratic Republic of Congo. The French Embassy in Bangui may also be able to offer some consular assistance (telephone: +236 613 000 or +236 610 584) to those requiring urgent help. See Consular assistance.
Tensions are high in Bangui and across the country. There are armed patrols that have set up several roadblocks across the country. Reports of violence, reprisal killings, looting and human rights abuses continue across the country.
Since January 2015, there have been a number of kidnappings of government ministers and humanitarian and UN workers.
Over the last year there have been periodic outbreaks of inter-ethnic violence, particularly in Bangui, Bangassou Bambari and Alindao.
Terrorist attacks in the Central African Republic can’t be ruled out. See Terrorism
UK health authorities have classified the Central African Republic as having a risk of Zika virus transmission. For information and advice about the risks associated with Zika virus, visit the National Travel Health Network and Centre website.
