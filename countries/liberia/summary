The FCDO advises against all but essential travel to:
the whole of Liberia based on the current assessment of COVID-19 risks.
Travel to Liberia is subject to entry and exit restrictions
On arrival in Liberia, you will be screened for coronavirus. You must present a negative test result or be tested on arrival in Liberia.
To leave Liberia, you must have a negative coronavirus test result and a travel certificate issued by the National Public Health Institute of Liberia (NPHIL).
If you display symptoms of coronavirus, or test positive, public health officials may take you to a quarantine facility

Preparing for your return journey to the UK
If you’re returning to the UK from overseas, you will need to:
provide your journey and contact details before you travel
check if you need to self-isolate on your return
Check our advice on foreign travel during the coronavirus (COVID-19) pandemic and sign up for email alerts for this travel advice.
If you’re planning travel to Liberia, find out what you need to know about coronavirus there in the Coronavirus section.
During the COVID-19 pandemic, it is more important than ever to get travel insurance and check it provides sufficient cover. See the Foreign, Commonwealth & Development Office (FCDO) guidance on foreign travel insurance.
Protests and demonstrations do take place in Monrovia on occasion. You should avoid protests, demonstrations, large gatherings and crowds and follow the advice of local authorities.
Terrorists are likely to try to carry out attacks in Liberia. Attacks could be indiscriminate. You should be vigilant, especially in places visited by foreigners. See Terrorism
General medical facilities throughout Liberia are unable to provide the same standard of healthcare as in the UK. Facilities in rural areas are rudimentary. Many medical facilities expect to be paid up-front for treatment. If you travel to Liberia, stay in contact with your employer or host organisation about the support that they can provide to you while you’re in the country.
If you’re concerned that you might have been exposed to, or showing symptoms of Ebola or Lassa Fever, you should seek immediate medical advice. If you’re in the UK call NHS on 111.
Avoid travelling at night outside Monrovia, except to or from Roberts International Airport. Make sure you have pre-arranged transport from the airport. See Crime and Road travel
The small British Embassy in Monrovia can only offer limited consular assistance.
If you’re abroad and you need emergency help from the UK government, contact the nearest British embassy, consulate or high commission.
