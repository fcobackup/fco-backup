Limited exemptions apply for Croatian residents and those travelling for urgent personal, family or business and are subject to either: evidence of a negative COVID-19 antigen or a PCR test result (taken up to 48 hours before arrival in Croatia), proof of a vaccination or a certificate of recovery (following a positive test result between 11 and 180 days prior).

The Croatian authorities have issued guidance regarding how to get a COVID-19 vaccine in Croatia (this is only available in Croatian). The guidance includes information on how you can register your interest for a vaccine via your General Practitioner if you live in Croatia. You can now also register your interest for a vaccine through a dedicated vaccination website.
The Medicines and Healthcare Products Regulatory Agency (MHRA) is the UK authority responsible for assessing the safety, quality and efficacy of vaccines. It has authorised the Pfizer/BioNTech, Oxford/AstraZeneca and Moderna vaccines for temporary supply and use within the UK. Find out more about MHRA approval for these vaccines.
