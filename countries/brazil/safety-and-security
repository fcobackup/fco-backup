Warning
FCDO advises against all but essential travel to parts of Brazil.

This guide also has safety advice for regions of Brazil.
Terrorism
There is a high threat of terrorist attack globally affecting UK interests and British nationals, including from groups and individuals who view the UK and British nationals as targets. Stay aware of your surroundings at all times.
UK Counter Terrorism Policing has information and advice on staying safe abroad and what to do in the event of a terrorist attack. Find out how to reduce your risk from terrorism while abroad.
Terrorism in Brazil
Terrorist attacks in Brazil cannot be ruled out.
Protests and civil unrest
Protests, demonstrations and strikes take place regularly in cities across Brazil, with reports of arrests and clashes between police and protesters. They can disrupt transport. Even peaceful events can sometimes turn confrontational and escalate into violence. Police have used rubber bullets and tear gas extensively to disperse protesters. The effects of tear gas can be felt several hundred metres beyond the immediate site of demonstrations.
You should:
avoid political rallies or other events where crowds have congregated to protest
follow local news reports
comply with the instructions of local authorities
If you encounter a political protest or feel uncomfortable in a large gathering, leave the area immediately.
Favelas
Favelas (‘slum’ or ‘shanty town’) are urban neighbourhoods of high-density informal housing. They exist in all major Brazilian cities and can border areas used by tourists and visitors. 
The security situation in many favelas is unpredictable. Visiting a favela can be dangerous. Avoid all favelas, including favela tours marketed to tourists and any accommodation, restaurants or bars advertised as being within a favela.
You should:
make sure the suggested route does not take you into a favela if you’re using GPS navigation
avoid entering unpaved, cobbled or narrow streets which may lead into a favela - tourists have been shot after accidentally entering favelas
If you’re unsure about a location, check with your hotel or the local authorities.
Carnival and other large-scale celebrations
If you are attending a large-scale celebration in Brazil, such as the Carnival in Rio de Janeiro or other major cities, be aware that criminals target people who appear to be wealthy or easy targets, for example, those who have drunk a lot of alcohol.
Be aware of your personal security and surroundings, and be cautious about proposals from strangers that take you away from public areas.
Crime
If you’re the victim of crime, contact the local police number 190 or the nearest British embassy or consulate.
Read our guidance if you’re the victim of a crime abroad.
Criminal Kidnaps
Short-term opportunistic kidnapping (called ‘express kidnapping’) can happen.  Victims have been kidnapped for a short period of time and driven to an ATM to withdraw money before being abandoned. Express kidnappers may use violence.
To reduce your risk:
avoid wearing expensive clothing or jewellery, particularly in public
avoid casual taxis, use official or pre-booked taxis instead where the driver is registered
be vigilant, especially at night
Theft
Pickpocketing is common. Do not go on to city beaches after dark.
If threatened, hand over your valuables without resistance. Attackers may be armed and under the influence of drugs. Do not resist attackers – this increases the risk of harm to you.
You can take steps to reduce the risk to yourself and your belongings, including:
avoiding wearing expensive jewellery and watches
avoiding carrying large sums of money – consider wearing a money belt
avoiding using a mobile phone in the street
keeping cameras out of sight when not in use
leaving your passport and valuables in a safe place, but carry a copy of your passport and another form of photo ID, if you have one, at all times
Thefts are particularly common on public beaches and include ‘arrastões’ where large groups of thieves sometimes run through an area of the beach grabbing possessions. Keep your belongings close and avoid taking valuables to the beach.
Robberies on buses are common in many cities. Thieves target mobile phones, particularly between 4pm and 9pm.
Scams
Bank and credit card scams are common, including card cloning from ATMs and in shops. Keep sight of your card and do not use an ATM if you notice anything suspicious.
If you withdraw cash at an ATM and the cash has pink marks on it, speak to the bank (or police) straight away to get it changed. It may have been marked as damaged or counterfeit.
Sexual assault and drink spiking
Rape and other sexual offences against tourists are not common, but there have been attacks against both women and men. Some have involved date rape drugs. Buy your own drinks and keep them in sight.
If you begin to feel strange, sick or drunk after only a couple of drinks, tell a trusted friend or security staff. They should take you to a safe place, such as your hotel room or a hospital. You can phone the local police, a hospital or the nearest British embassy or consulate for advice.
Read our advice on what to do if you have been raped, sexually assaulted or drugged abroad.
Child sexual abuse
There are widespread cases of sexual abuse of children in Brazil. All sexual activity with children (persons under the age of 18) is illegal, regardless of the age of consent locally. If you commit sex offences against children abroad, you can be prosecuted in the UK.
Parental child abduction
Parental child abduction is not common but can happen in Brazil. Dial 190 to report a missing child or go to the nearest police station. Read the guidance on international parental child abduction if your child may be at risk of this.    
Carjacking
Theft from cars is common. Keep valuables out of sight.
Carjacking can happen, particularly on major roads and in tunnels. To reduce your risk you should:
approach your car with your keys in your hand so you can get into your car quickly
keep doors locked and windows closed
take particular care at traffic lights
drive in the middle lane if possible
avoid deserted or poorly lit areas, unless you have reliable local advice
be cautious of people approaching to ask for information, especially at night
If driving at night outside the city, avoid stopping at the roadside – if you must stop, try to stop in a petrol station or well-lit area
Laws and cultural differences
Illegal drugs and trafficking scams
Drug trafficking is widespread in Brazil and the penalties are severe. The penalties for possessing drugs for personal use range from educational classes to community service.
British nationals have been targeted through email scams where fraudsters offer a financial reward for travelling to Brazil, where they are then asked to carry items out of Brazil, including to the UK. These items are often illegal drugs. Anyone caught will face detention for drug trafficking, regardless of the circumstances.
Electronic smoking devices
As of 2 May 2024, all electronic cigarettes and vaping devices are banned in Brazil. Refills, parts, and accessories are also banned.
The Brazilian Health Regulatory Agency (Anvisa) prohibits the import, transport, sale, storage and advertisement of these items. Customs officials have the authority to confiscate any vape products found in travellers’ luggage (both checked in and carry on) during inspections.
LGBT+ travellers
There is no legislation against homosexuality in Brazil. Same-sex marriage is legal and LGBT+ couples have equal rights in law.
São Paulo holds the world’s largest Pride celebration, which is usually very peaceful. Violence at the event is rare. Pride in Rio de Janeiro and other cities also attracts large numbers.
Brazil is generally tolerant. However, Brazilian society is quite conservative, particularly outside the larger towns and cities. Violence against LGBT+ people is a concern. Instances of discrimination, violence and harassment against the community have been reported. Factors contributing to these concerns include societal attitudes, cultural influences and the presence of conservative perspectives. Urban areas can be more accepting. 
Read more advice for LGBT+ travellers.
Outdoor activities and adventure tourism
Swimming safety
Strong currents can be a danger off some beaches. Get local advice before going in the water. Pay attention to warning flags and the location of lifeguards if present on the beach.
Shark attacks are a danger, particularly on the beaches around Recife in north-east Brazil. Pay attention to warning signs and consult lifeguards if unsure. Do not enter the water if there are warning signs. Sharks have been known to attack in waist-deep water and deaths have occurred.
See water safety on holiday from the Royal Life Saving Society.
Transport risks
Road travel
You can use a UK photocard driving licence to drive in Brazil. If you still have a paper driving licence, you may need to update it to a photocard licence or get the 1968 version of the international driving permit (IDP) as well. An IDP is recommended. After 180 days, you need to apply for a Brazilian driving licence.
Driving standards
Brazil has a high road accident rate. Driving standards are poor. Take care on the roads and avoid riding bicycles. In many rural areas, roads are in poor condition away from the main highways. Bus and coach crashes are frequent.
Accidents
Immediately report all accidents involving personal injury to the police: call 190 or file a report at a police station. Also call the police if the vehicles are obstructing traffic and you need help.
 You can report an accident:
at the nearest police station
to the tourist police (DEAT)
Drink-driving
Drink-driving is a serious offence in Brazil and checkpoints are often set up. If you’re caught driving under the influence of alcohol, you will be prosecuted. Penalties range from fines and a suspension from driving for 12 months, to up to 3 years in prison.
Air travel
Allow plenty of time to arrive at the airport for your flight. Traffic in the main cities, especially São Paulo and Rio de Janeiro, can be very heavy.
If you have been a victim of a passport theft and you need to fly to Brasilia, São Paulo or Rio de Janeiro for consular services, you can travel on domestic flights with a valid photo ID or a police report.   
Check whether your tour operator has concerns about airlines in Brazil.
Sea travel
There have been armed and unarmed attacks on merchant vessels, including British flag vessels off the Brazilian coast and in some Brazilian ports.
Rail travel
There is a limited railway infrastructure in Brazil, and there have been safety incidents on the rail network.
Extreme weather and natural disasters
Heavy rainfall 
The rainy season runs from November until March in the south and south-east (including Rio de Janeiro – see Regional risks) and from April until July in the north-east of Brazil. However heavy rainfall and flooding can also occur outside of the designated rainy seasons, in any region of the country.
Heavy rains often disrupt infrastructure, particularly in rural areas. Flash floods and landslides, especially in poorer urban areas, are common during heavy rains. Monitor local media and follow any instructions given by the local authorities.
Forest fires
Forest fires are common from May to September, especially during July and August due to the arrival of dry season. They are highly dangerous and unpredictable. Check the latest alerts and weather forecast (in Portuguese) and follow advice of local authorities if you’re considering travelling to affected areas.
