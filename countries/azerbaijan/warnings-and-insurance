western areas of the rayons of Khojavand, Fuzuli and Aghdam

The border with Armenia remains closed. The FCDO advises against all travel to within 5km of the border with Armenia, due to tensions between Azerbaijan and Armenia. Note that this does not include the border of Azerbaijan’s Nakhchivan exclave with Armenia.
