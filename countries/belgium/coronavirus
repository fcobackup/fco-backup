Be prepared for your plans to change
No travel is risk-free during COVID-19. Countries may further restrict travel or bring in new rules at short notice, for example due to a new COVID-19 variant. Check with your travel company or airline for any transport changes which may delay your journey home.
If you test positive for COVID-19, you may need to stay where you are until you test negative. You may also need to seek treatment there.
Plan ahead and make sure you:
can access money
understand what your insurance will cover
make arrangements to quarantine at your hotel or the place you are staying, if you test positive (rules for what you can and cannot do during quarantine are found on the Belgian government’s website under ‘What should I do?’)
can make arrangements to extend your stay and be away for longer than planned
Public spaces and services
The Belgian Government has eased COVID-19 restrictions. However, wearing a face mask remains mandatory for those above 12 years old in hospitals. Restrictions can differ across regions. It is mandatory to wear a mask in pharmacies and when visiting GP surgeries in Wallonia and the Brussels Capital Region. The Flemish regional Government strongly recommends wearing a mask in pharmacies and GP surgeries.
The Belgian authorities also encourage citizens to wear a mask on public transport, in crowded spaces, or when meeting vulnerable, high-risk contacts.
