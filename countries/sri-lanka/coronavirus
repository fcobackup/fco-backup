International travel
Sri Lankan Airlines, Qatar Airways, Etihad and Emirates are currently operating some outbound flights from Sri Lanka to the UK. From 1800 (local time) on 18 October 2020, all departing passengers out of Sri Lanka will be required to present evidence of a negative COVID-19 test taken up to 72 hours before the start of travel.
Due to a recent cluster of COVID-19 cases in the community, there is a high risk of changes to flights and airport operations at short notice. If you wish to travel, you should consult your travel operator.
Repatriation flights into Sri Lanka are currently suspended. Non-national residents wishing to return to Sri Lanka should contact their nearest Sri Lankan High Commission for advice. The Sri Lankan High Commission in London can be contacted by email: mail@slhc-london.co.uk.
The police have introduced a lockdown in the Kutunayake area, in the vicinity of Colombo’s Bandaranaike International Airport (BIA). It remains possible to travel to the airport for outbound flights. If questioned by local authorities, British nationals should present their passport and airline ticket to proceed to the airport.

Travel in Sri Lanka
On 4 October, the police issued a local lockdown in the Divulapitiya, Minuwangoda and Veyangoda areas in response to positive COVID-19 cases in the community. Further lockdowns are being imposed in affected areas across a wide geographic spread, and travel restrictions may also be imposed at short notice. Those not adhering to restrictions risk arrest. You should follow the advice of local authorities.
The government of Sri Lanka has advised against all non-essential travel nation-wide. Public gatherings such as exhibitions, conferences, parties, indoor and outdoor events, carnivals, musical shows and processions have been banned.
Social distancing instructions remain in force everywhere. The police say anyone breaking social distancing or failing to wear a face mask in public will be subject to mandatory 14-day quarantine.
You should follow the media for updates, or speak to your hotel or travel agent for the latest information, and follow the instructions of the local authorities at all times.
Accommodation
Some hotels and guesthouses are open for foreign nationals who are already in Sri Lanka. But there have been reports of late-notice cancelations of room bookings, so you should check with your travel agent or accommodation provider. Social distancing and other public health measures (such as temperature checks) may be in place.
Public places and services
Some public places, including restaurants and cafés remain open, but this could change at short notice. You should expect some reduced services and social distancing measures to be in place.
Public gatherings such as exhibitions, conferences, parties, indoor and outdoor events, carnivals, musical shows and processions have been banned.
