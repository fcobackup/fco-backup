Crime
The crime rate in the Cook Islands, Tokelau and Niue is low, but you should take the same precautions as you would at home. Do not leave valuables unattended or in plain sight. Unattended items on the beach or in unsecured storage, including items stored in scooters/motorcycles, are a particular target.
Occasional assaults of tourists are reported in the Cook Islands, you should take the same precautions as you would at home.
Road travel
Driving is on the left.
You can drive in the Cook Islands with a valid UK driving licence. In Niue, you must apply for a local driving licence from the Police Department. Distances around the three Atolls of Tokelau are short and can be covered by boat and on foot.
Driving on islands in the South Pacific can be challenging, particularly at night. Road conditions and street lighting are poor and there are few footpaths. Beware of pedestrians and animals on the roads.
The legal blood alcohol limit for drivers and motorcyclists in the Cook Islands is 0.08. Do not drink and drive. Familiarise yourself with local traffic laws and practices before driving and drive defensively.
Watersports and adventure activities
If you intend to hire motorbikes, jet skis or any other motorised vehicle, you should comply with local licensing laws. Talk to your travel insurer to check your insurance policy covers such activity and seek advice on any restrictions that may apply. You should wear a helmet when using motorbikes or scooters.
Swimming, snorkeling and diving are common activities. Take local advice before swimming. At certain times of the year, some beaches in Niue are closed for traditional fishing activities.
Sea travel
Maritime safety is a concern in some Pacific countries. The safety standards you might expect of transport operators in the UK may not be replicated in the Pacific. Sufficient safety equipment may not be provided and safety regulations are not always adhered to. Ferries are often overcrowded.
Tokelau follows New Zealand maritime standards. There are strict controls on the number of passengers.
Air travel
The FCDO cannot offer advice on the safety of individual airlines. However, the International Air Transport Association publishes a list of registered airlines that have been audited and found to meet a number of operational safety standards and recommended practices. This list is not exhaustive and the absence of an airline from this list does not necessarily mean that it is unsafe.
The International Civil Aviation Organisation has carried out an audit of the level of implementation of the critical elements of safety oversight in Cook Islands.
A list of accidents and incidents in the region can be found on the Aviation Safety Network website.
There is no airport on Tokelau. Access is by boat only.
Political situation
The Cook Islands are a Parliamentary democracy based on the UK model. Officially the Islands are an independent nation in free association with New Zealand, which means the Cook Islands government has full executive powers.
Tokelau is a dependent territory of New Zealand. It has its own unique political institutions, including a national legislative body and an Executive Council. It runs its own elections every three years. The relationship between Tokelau and New Zealand is managed by the Administrator of Tokelau. This is a statutory position held by a New Zealand public servant, and appointed by the New Zealand Minister of Foreign Affairs.
Niueâ€™s system of government is based on the Westminster system. The Niue Assembly consists of 20 members, 14 of whom are elected by village constituencies and 6 from the common roll. The 20 members elect a Premier and the Premier selects three cabinet ministers from the 19. Members elect a Speaker from outside their ranks. A general election is held every three years.
The political situation across the islands is generally calm.
