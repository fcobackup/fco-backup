Tanzania lies on an active fault line stretching from the north of the country to the south and tremors occur from time to time. The last significant earthquake (magnitude 5.7) happened on 10 September 2016 in the Kagera region, north west Tanzania. The US Federal Emergency Management Agency has advice about what to do before, during and after an earthquake.
During the rainy seasons, end of March till May and October to middle of December, exceptionally heavy rainfall and strong winds can occur. Abnormal weather conditions can affect travel. If travelling to affected regions, you should take extra care and follow any advice given by the local authorities.
