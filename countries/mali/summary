Terrorists are very likely to try to carry out attacks in Mali, including kidnaps. There is a heightened risk of attack in Bamako. Attacks could be indiscriminate and occur without warning, including in places visited by foreigners. You should be especially vigilant and where possible avoid places frequented by foreigners including, diplomatic premises, hotels, restaurants, bars, nightclubs, shopping areas, markets, airports and other transport hubs, places of worship and businesses with western interests. Foreign, national or local government facilities and large crowds may also be a target. You should be vigilant, be alert to announcements, monitor local media and follow the advice of the local authorities. Avoid all large gatherings, including during national day celebrations and public holidays. Large gatherings can also include music festivals, sporting events and any public marches or demonstrations. You should exercise caution during election periods and take particular care during festivities, and religious and public holiday periods. See Terrorism
During public holidays and festivals, including New Year celebrations, security measures in Mali can be heightened due to the ongoing threat posed by terrorist organisations. During such periods you should exercise increased vigilance, limit your movements and continue to avoid large gatherings. If you think a particular venue would present a good target for terrorist activities then you should avoid it.
A nationwide state of emergency was put in place in November 2015 and has been extended several times since. You should expect a robust security presence including police patrols and possible police security checks on restaurants and hotels. There are likely to be more vehicle and personal security checks during this time and nobody will be exempt.
Regular, large and at times violent protests have taken place in Bamako, resulting in burning of tires, clashes with the police, blockage on the roads and bridges, the deployment of tear gas, and small arms fire. There have been reports of several deaths and injuries. You should avoid large gatherings, remain vigilant and monitor local social media/news.
Public demonstrations in and around Bamako have encountered a strong police and security force presence. You should stay away from all political demonstrations and any blockades set up by the police and security forces. Maintain several days’ stock of food and water in case disturbances take place. You can monitor daily developments in English through the BBC World Service (88.9 FM in Bamako).
If you’re abroad and you need emergency help from the UK government, contact the nearest British embassy, consulate or high commission.
