Travel in Fiji
Fiji entered a 14-day restriction period from 26 April following identification of a number of COVID-19 cases outside quarantine. International passenger flights have been suspended and restrictions have been put in place for public places and services. The Fijian Government has announced that from 26 April for the next 14 days, the public will not be allowed in or out of four containment zones: Lami, Suva, Nausori and Nadi-Lautoka.
During the period, police will be closing off exits at the containment zones’ checkpoints. The Nadi-Lautoka containment area will be divided into two zones and movement between the two is no longer allowed.
Only persons travelling for medical purposes will be allowed through checkpoints while all non-essential businesses must remain closed. Public transportation within the zones will be available but limited to 50 percent seating capacity.
The Fijian government is encouraging people to work from home, and to leave their houses only if essential.
A nationwide curfew is in effect from 11pm to 4am each night. More information on the latest restrictions are available on the Fiji government website.
Accommodation
Some hotels and rental accommodation are open with COVID-19 protocols including social distancing measures in place.
Public places and services
Most public places in Viti Levu are closed, other than essential businesses including supermarkets and pharmacies. Nightclubs remain closed and you must abide by the nationwide curfew which need you to remain in your home or accommodation between 11pm and 4am.
Healthcare in Fiji
If you begin to feel unwell self-isolate by staying at home, even with mild symptoms such as headache, low grade fever (37.3 C or above) and slight runny nose, until you recover. If it is essential for you to have someone bring you supplies or to go out, for example, to buy food, then wear a mask to avoid infecting other people.
If you develop symptoms of COVID-19 including fever, cough and difficulty breathing, seek medical advice promptly as this may be due to a respiratory infection or other serious condition. The Ministry of Health and Medical Services have a hotline (telephone number 158) to provide help. They will be able to direct you to the right health facility.
