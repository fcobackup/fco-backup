The hurricane season officially runs from June to November although severe storms can occur in the Caribbean throughout the year. The impact of these could be particularly severe in light of the damage caused by the 2017 hurricanes. You should monitor local and international weather updates from the US National Hurricane Center and follow the advice of local authorities, including any evacuation orders.
The BVI is also close to a major tectonic fault line and is a high risk area for earthquakes and Tsunamis. See Natural disasters
As the BVI is a British Overseas Territory, there is no formal British diplomatic or consular representation and the local authorities deal with all requests for emergency assistance. See Emergency assistance
UK Emergency Travel Documents (ETDs) are processed by the British High Commission in Barbados. ETDs are not valid for travel through the United States of America without a valid US visa. See Entry requirements
UK health authorities have classified the BVI as having a risk of Zika virus transmission. For more information and advice, visit the National Travel Health Network and Centre website.
Although there’s no recent history of terrorism in the BVI, attacks can’t be ruled out. See Terrorism
