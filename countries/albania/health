Before you travel check that:
your destination can provide the healthcare you may need
you have appropriate travel insurance for local treatment or unexpected medical evacuation
This is particularly important if you have a health condition or are pregnant.
Emergency medical number
Call 127 and ask for an ambulance.
Contact your insurance or medical assistance company promptly if you’re referred to a medical facility for treatment.
Vaccinations and health risks
At least 8 weeks before your trip check:
the latest information on recommended vaccinations and health risks in TravelHealthPro’s Albania guide
where to get vaccines and whether you have to pay on the NHS travel vaccinations page
Air pollution
There can be high levels of air pollution in Albania. You can find further information and advice on air quality on the World Health Organization (WHO) website and check air quality levels on the World Air Quality Index website.
Tap water and milk
Do not drink the tap water in Albania, as it may cause illness. Only drink bottled water. If you drink milk, make sure it is UHT (ultra high temperature) milk.
Medication
