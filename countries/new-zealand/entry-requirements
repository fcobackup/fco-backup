This page has information on travelling to New Zealand. Check what you must do to return to the UK.
This page reflects the UK government’s understanding of current rules for people travelling on a full ‘British Citizen’ passport from the UK, for the most common types of travel.
The authorities in New Zealand set and enforce entry rules.
COVID-19 entry restrictions
The New Zealand border is currently closed to almost all arrivals.
You may be able to travel to New Zealand while the border is closed if you are considered to have a critical purpose to travel. Please see the Immigration New Zealand website for criteria. The website also includes information on how to submit a request for travel to New Zealand.
On 3 February 2022 the New Zealand Government announced a 5-step plan to re-open its borders commencing 11:59pm (New Zealand Time) on 27 February 2022.
Please see the New Zealand Government’s COVID-19 website for further guidance on entry requirements.
All travellers
You do not need a visa to enter New Zealand as a visitor for up to 6 months, but you will need to get a New Zealand Electronic Travel Authority (NZeTA) before you travel. The New Zealand Government, following a temporary border closure, announced 3 February 2022 a 5-step reopening plan commencing at 11:59pm (New Zealand Time) on 27 February 2022. Please see the New Zealand Government COVID-19 website for full border re-opening requirements.
The NZeTA costs NZD $9 if applying via the dedicated mobile app, or NZD $12 if completed online. You will also need to pay an International Visitor Conservation and Tourism Levy (IVL) of NZD $35 when you apply. Once issued, the NZeTA is valid for up to two years. The New Zealand immigration authorities recommend that applicants allow up to 72 hours for processing.
On arrival in New Zealand, you will also need to satisfy the Immigration Officer that you meet the criteria for visa-free entry, which includes having an onward ticket and sufficient funds to support you during your stay. You can check the full criteria on the New Zealand Immigration website.
New Zealand’s immigration rules are strict, particularly regarding employment. Visitors cannot work in New Zealand.
For more information about visas, visit the New Zealand Immigration website or contact the nearest New Zealand High Commission.
If you’re fully vaccinated
Non-New Zealand citizens aged 17-years and over arriving into New Zealand, including New Zealand permanent residents and temporary visa holders, must be fully vaccinated. This means travellers need to have had a full course of any of the 33 COVID-19 vaccines that have been approved by a foreign government or approval authority, and which are accepted by New Zealand. You need to have had the last dose at least 14 days before you arrive in New Zealand.
Even if you are fully vaccinated, you still need to have a negative PCR or RT-PCR test result in the 48 hours prior to departure and spend time in self-isolation Managed Isolation and Quarantine (MIQ). On 3 February 2022, the New Zealand Government announced a reopening in a phased approach, staged by country of departure and visa category, for fully vaccinated travellers to enter New Zealand without going into managed isolation and quarantine commencing from 11:59pm (New Zealand Time) on 27 February 2022. All travellers will initially be required to self-isolate for a period of 10 days. Please see New Zealand Government COVID-19 for full details.
Proof of vaccination status
You must present proof that you have been fully vaccinated to enter New Zealand.
New Zealand will accept the UK’s proof of COVID-19 recovery and vaccination record and proof of COVID-19 vaccination issued in the Crown Dependencies. You need a digital vaccine passport or another form of electronic or paper document from a government health authority confirming you have had a full COVID-19 vaccine course. For full details, please see the New Zealand Government website. Your evidence must confirm your last dose was at least 14 days before departure for New Zealand.
Your NHS appointment card from vaccination centres is not designed to be used as proof of vaccination and should not be used to demonstrate your vaccine status.
You should check that your first name and your surname on your passport match how they are displayed by your NHS COVID Pass at least 2 weeks before you travel. If the names are different, contact your GP practice to have your details updated.
Residents of the Cook Islands
The current quarantine free travel agreements between New Zealand and the Cook Islands may be fully or partially paused at any time.
You should check the New Zealand government COVID-19 website for details. If your travel plans are disrupted, you should contact your airline.
You need to spend 14 full days before your date of departure in either New Zealand or the Cook Islands. Travellers from the Cook Islands are exempt from the New Zealand Government COVID-19 pre-departure testing requirements.
For more information please visit the New Zealand government COVID-19 website.
If you’re not fully vaccinated
Only those with an exemption or are a New Zealand Citizen, are aged 16 years, a refugee or a citizen of Afghanistan and you have been evacuated, do not need to have evidence you have met COVID-19 vaccination requirements. For details on who is eligible to apply and how to apply for an exemption please see the New Zealand Government COVID-19 website.
From 11:50pm (New Zealand Time) 27 February 2022 unvaccinated travellers, and those who do not meet New Zealand’s vaccination requirements, who are eligible to enter New Zealand will continue to enter Managed Isolation and Quarantine.
If you’ve had COVID-19 in the past year
You must meet COVID-19 vaccination requirements to travel to New Zealand, even if you have had COVID-19.
You must have had a full course of any of the COVID-19 vaccines that have been approved by a government health authority or approval authority.
Children and young people
Children aged 16 and under are exempt from the vaccination requirement to enter New Zealand. Children aged 2 years (24 months) and under are exempt from taking a pre-departure test. Children over the age of 2 years (24 months) will need evidence of a negative pre-departure test.
If you’re transiting through New Zealand
Transiting is when you pass through one country on the way to your final destination.
People from visa waiver nationalities on a transit visa waiver transiting to or from Australia and people departing a Pacific country or territory to return home, do not need a transit visa as long as they have a confirmed flight out of New Zealand within 24 hours to a port which will accept them.
In most cases, transit passengers must hold an Electronic Travel Authority (ETA) or transit ETA before travel. These are applied for online. See Information about NZeTA for further detail.
If the passport holder is not from a visa-waiver or transit visa-waiver country or territory, or covered by one of the situations listed above, then they will need to apply for a transit visa. Due to COVID-19, Immigration New Zealand is not currently accepting paper applications for transit visas so have put a temporary process in place for submitting applications by email.
The process for applying for a transit visa via email is available on the Immigration New Zealand website - transits.
If you are staying airside while transiting through New Zealand you do not need to provide a negative COVID-19 pre-departure test (but you may need to be tested as per the requirements of your destination country).
Exemptions
You may be able to travel to New Zealand while the border is closed if you are considered to have a critical purpose to travel. Please see the Immigration New Zealand website for criteria. The website also includes information on how to submit a request for travel to New Zealand.

Passport validity
If you are visiting New Zealand your passport should be valid for three months from the date you arrive.
Visas
You do not need a visa to enter New Zealand as a visitor for up to 6 months, but you will need to get a New Zealand Electronic Travel Authority (NZeTA) before you travel. The New Zealand government has, however, introduced a temporary border closure at this time.
UK Emergency Travel Documents
UK Emergency Travel Documents (ETDs) are valid for entry into New Zealand when accompanied by a permanent residence, work or study visa. ETDs are accepted for holidaymakers as long as New Zealand is not the final destination. ETDs are also accepted for airside transit and exit from New Zealand.
Quarantine and bio security
New Zealand has very strict bio-security regulations. It is illegal to import most food-stuffs (meat and meat products, honey, fruit, dairy produce) and strict penalties are handed out to those breaking these rules. Take care when importing wood products, golf clubs, footwear, tents, fishing equipment and items made from animal skin. The immigration arrivals card has full details. If in doubt, declare items to a Ministry of Agriculture official or dump them in one of the bins available at the airport. Failure to comply with these regulations can result in a heavy fine of up to $100,000 or imprisonment.
Medication
There are some restrictions on bringing medication into New Zealand. Visit the New Zealand Customs website for more information. If you arrive in New Zealand with any prescription medicines, you must declare it on your passenger arrival card.
All codeine-containing products are classified as prescription only medication (a con-trolled drug). Codeine is found in many pain relieving medications. You can import controlled drugs for personal use, subject to declaring them on arrival into New Zealand to the Customs Service and demonstrating they have been lawfully supplied for the treatment of yourself or someone under your care. More details on these requirements can be found on the New Zealand Customs website.
