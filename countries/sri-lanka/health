Coronavirus (COVID-19)
Check the latest information on risk from COVID-19 for Sri Lanka on the TravelHealthPro website
See the healthcare information in the Coronavirus section for information on what to do if you think you have coronavirus while in Sri Lanka.
At least 8 weeks before your trip, check the latest country-specific health advice from the National Travel Health Network and Centre (NaTHNaC) on the TravelHealthPro website. Each country-specific page has information on vaccine recommendations, any current health risks or outbreaks, and factsheets with information on staying healthy abroad. Guidance is also available from NHS (Scotland) on the FitForTravel website.
General information on travel vaccinations and a travel health checklist is available on the NHS website. You may then wish to contact your health adviser or pharmacy for advice on other preventive measures and managing any pre-existing medical conditions while you’re abroad.
The legal status and regulation of some medicines prescribed or purchased in the UK can be different in other countries. If you’re travelling with prescription or over-the-counter medicine, read this guidance from NaTHNaC on best practice when travelling with medicines. For further information on the legal status of a specific medicine, you’ll need to contact the embassy, high commission or consulate of the country or territory you’re travelling to.
While travel can be enjoyable, it can sometimes be challenging. There are clear links between mental and physical health, so looking after yourself during travel and when abroad is important. Information on travelling with mental health conditions is available in our guidance page. Further information is also available from the National Travel Health Network and Centre (NaTHNaC).
Medical treatment
The Sri Lankan healthcare system is under strain due to the impact of the pandemic and the economic crisis which has led to shortages of certain medicines. Access to routine and emergency healthcare may be limited. See Coronavirus
If you need emergency medical assistance during your trip, dial 011 2691111 and ask for an ambulance or dial 1990. You should contact your insurance/medical assistance company promptly if you are referred to a medical facility for treatment
Emergency medical treatment isn’t easily available outside main cities, and you may have to be brought to Colombo for treatment. Fuel shortages may delay your ability to access emergency services. Medical facilities are not always of a standard expected in the UK, particularly outside Colombo. Treatment in private hospitals can be expensive and the options for repatriation to the UK or neighbouring countries in an emergency are limited and very expensive. Make sure you have adequate travel health insurance and accessible funds to cover the cost of any medical treatment abroad and repatriation.
Diseases
All regions of Sri Lanka experience outbreaks of the mosquito-borne dengue fever. You should take steps to avoid being bitten by mosquitoes.
