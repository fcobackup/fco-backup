The information on this page covers the most common types of travel and reflects the UK government’s understanding of the rules currently in place. Unless otherwise stated, this information is for travellers using a full ‘British Citizen’ passport.
The authorities in the country or territory you’re travelling to are responsible for setting and enforcing the rules for entry. If you’re unclear about any aspect of the entry requirements, or you need further reassurance, you’ll need to contact the embassy, high commission or consulate of the country or territory you’re travelling to.
You should also consider checking with your transport provider or travel company to make sure your passport and other travel documents meet their requirements.
South Africa has introduced entry restrictions in response to the coronavirus (COVID-19) pandemic.
Borders
South African airspace is closed to commercial airlines as part of efforts to contain the spread of coronavirus (COVID-19).
Land borders to neighbouring countries are closed except for trade.
Visas
Entry
You will need a visa to enter South Africa. No visas will be granted during the lockdown period.
Visas will also not be issued for British nationals who have recently been in countries South Africa considers high risk for coronavirus since 15 February 2020. These include the UK, China, Germany, Iran, Italy, the Republic of Korea, Spain, the USA, France and Switzerland. This list of countries could change at short notice.
Transiting South Africa
British travellers wishing to transit South African international airports en route back to the UK may do so without a visa, as long as you stay airside and have not been in the UK or another ‘high-risk’ country since 15 March 2020.
You cannot transit South African airports en route to third countries, if travelling from the UK or another ‘high risk’ country.
If you’re currently in South Africa
The South African government has indicated that if you’re in South Africa on a work, study, or other long-term visa, currently you can remain, under the terms of that visa. If you leave South Africa, you will not be permitted to return on the same visa, and will need to apply for a new visa.
If you entered South Africa on a 90-day stamp which has not yet expired, you do not need a visa to leave South Africa.
Generally, if you overstay in South Africa, you are likely to be declared undesirable and denied entry in future. The enforcement of these penalties is strict, and appeals can take many months to process. Since the introduction of restrictions to international flights, the South African authorities have advised that people who exceed their 90 day stay as a result of travel restrictions linked to COVID-19 will not be penalised as over-stayers when they depart.

Health screening at ports and airports
Screening processes have been introduced at all major ports of entry, including airports, for arrivals, departures and transit passengers. You should comply with any additional screening measures put in place by the authorities. Screening may include temperature measurements and checks on recent travel to affected areas.
If port health officials believe you should be tested for coronavirus, you will be taken to a nearby hospital designated for receiving and testing suspected cases. If tested positive, you may be placed into quarantine or asked to self-isolate depending on your circumstances.
If you are identified as in need of testing, or if quarantine or further treatment is required, you should contact your insurer, and speak to health officials, to understand where the quarantine or treatment should take place. Private hospitals in South Africa are prepared to treat coronavirus, and the standard of care may be higher than in government hospitals. See Local medical care
Passport validity
Technically, your passport should be valid for at least 30 days beyond your intended date of exit from South Africa, in line with South African immigration regulations. However, some immigration officials still request that a passport should have at least 6 months validity on the date of entry to South Africa. To avoid problems at the airport on arrival, you’re advised to ensure your passport meets this requirement.
Your passport should have at least 2 blank pages if you require a visa to enter the country. If you do not need a visa, one blank page will be sufficient.
Travelling with children
There are special requirements for travelling to South Africa with children under the age of 18. Parents wishing to apply for a visa for their child to enter South Africa will need to submit additional documentation. There are different requirements for unaccompanied children entering South Africa.
Check the advisory from the South African Department of Home Affairs for more details, and consult your nearest South African high commission or embassy if you have any questions about these requirements.
Residence permits
If you have Permanent Residency in South Africa, you can leave and re-enter South Africa but must carry valid documentation with you proving your permanent residency rights. If you enter South Africa from the UK or another high risk country, you will be placed under quarantine for 14 days.
Receipts issued by the Department of Home Affairs for applications to renew a permit will not be accepted by the immigration authorities. For more information, contact the South African High Commission or the South African Department of Home Affairs.
Dual citizenship
If you hold South African citizenship, you must enter and exit South Africa on your South African passport. It is an offence for a South African citizen aged 18 or over to enter or leave the country on a foreign passport.
UK Emergency Travel Documents
South African authorities advise that UK Emergency Travel Documents (ETDs) are usually accepted for entry, transit and exit from South Africa. British Nationals entering South Africa on an ETD will be subject to new visa requirements announced by South Africa in response to coronavirus. See coronavirus
If you are planning to enter South Africa using an ETD, you will need a visa. You should make sure you allow time before you travel to apply for a visa once you have received your ETD.
South Africa have not told us how they intend to treat travellers wishing to transit using ETDs. If you’re planning to enter or transit South Africa using an ETD, you should confirm requirements with the nearest South African Embassy, High Commission or Consulate before confirming your travel plans. ETDs should have a minimum of 6 months validity for entry, transit or exit.
Biometric capturing
South Africa has implemented biometric capturing at all ports of entry. This may result in some delays at land borders. You should allow additional time for border crossings.
