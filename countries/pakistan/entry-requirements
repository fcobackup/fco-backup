The information on this page covers the most common types of travel and reflects the UK government’s understanding of the rules currently in place. Unless otherwise stated, this information is for travellers using a full ‘British Citizen’ passport.
The authorities in the country or territory you’re travelling to are responsible for setting and enforcing the rules for entry. If you’re unclear about any aspect of the entry requirements, or you need further reassurance, you’ll need to contact the embassy, high commission or consulate of the country or territory you’re travelling to.
On 21 March, the government of Pakistan announced the suspension of all international flights to Pakistan, effective from 2000 PST on 21 March until 2000 PST on 4 April. The government of Pakistan described the measure as a ‘temporary suspension imposed due to exceptional circumstances’. We understand that the suspension applies also to international flights out of Pakistan. Despite this suspension, we understand that some airlines may be planning one-off or limited services leaving Pakistan in the next few days. If you wish to leave, you should contact airlines and travel agents immediately. If transiting a third country, please check that you will be able to fly on to the UK. Some internal flights within Pakistan have also been cancelled.
