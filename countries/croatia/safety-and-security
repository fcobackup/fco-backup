Terrorism
There is a high threat of terrorist attack globally affecting UK interests and British nationals, including from groups and individuals who view the UK and British nationals as targets. You should remain vigilant.
UK Counter Terrorism Policing has information and advice on staying safe abroad and what to do in the event of a terrorist attack. Find out how to reduce your risk from terrorism while abroad.
Terrorism in Croatia
Terrorist attacks in Croatia cannot be ruled out. Attacks could be indiscriminate, including in places visited by foreigners.
Crime
Crime levels are low and violent crime is rare.
Protecting yourself and your belongings
Tourists have been overcharged at bars and clubs (‘gentlemen’s clubs’), sometimes by thousands of Euros, and threatened with violence if they will not pay.
Pickpockets operate in tourist areas. Avoid carrying large sums of cash, do not leave valuables unattended and use hotel safes if possible.
Laws and cultural differences
Personal ID
Always carry your passport or, if you’re a resident, your Croatian ID card. Keep a photocopy of your passport’s photo page in a safe place. If your passport is lost or stolen, report it to the police and get a police report.
Antisocial behaviour
In some Croatian town centres, for example in popular coastal tourist destinations such as Split and Dubrovnik, you can get on-the-spot fines for behaviour seen as inappropriate, including:
drinking alcohol or using drugs in public spaces (drugs are illegal)
sleeping in public spaces
urinating or vomiting in public spaces
walking through towns shirtless or in swimwear
wearing clothing that promotes drug use
climbing on monuments
You can also be fined up to 4000 euros for public order disturbances, including:
fighting
verbal abuse (shouting, arguing)
drunken behaviour
belittling or insulting police officers or other public officials
Illegal drugs and prison sentences
Drug offences are punished with fines and jail sentences.
Unexploded mines
If you travel outside the tourist resorts, beware of unexploded mines in previously war-affected areas, including:
Eastern Slavonia
Brod-Posavina County
Karlovac County
areas around Zadar County
more remote areas of the Plitvice Lakes National Park
For more information about mine-affected areas, visit the Civil Protection website (in Croatian only) or contact the Civil Protection offices.
If you’re travelling in these areas, do not walk on uncultivated land or step off the marked paths. If in doubt, seek local advice.
Hiking and mountaineering
If you’re hiking in the mountains, get expert advice from local guides, however tame the mountain might seem. Weather in the Croatian mountains can change quickly, even in summer, and temperatures can get very low overnight. Be aware of the risks of getting lost in the mountains when out hiking alone and using unmarked paths. Read the Croatian Mountain Rescue tips on mountaineering, follow their Twitter at Hrvatska GSS, and see their maps. If you get into trouble, call the emergency number 112 for help from the Croatian Mountain Rescue Service.
Transport risks
Road travel
You can drive in Croatia using your UK driving licence for up to 12 months. You don’t need an International Driving Permit.
If you’re driving in Croatia, see information on driving abroad and read the RAC Croatia guide.
The Croatian Automobile Association lists current traffic hazards.
Attacks and sexual assaults in taxis
There have been reports of sexual assaults in taxis or Ubers in Croatia. To reduce risk and help prevent potential assaults you can:
take a photo of the inside, where the number of the taxi is visible, and send to a friend or someone else
share your ride status on the Uber app
make a call while in the taxi telling someone which taxi it is and where you are going

Driving regulations
It is illegal to drive with more than 0.05% of alcohol in your blood system.
You must:
have your headlights on and dipped when driving a car from 1 November until 31 March, even during daytime. For scooters and motorcycles, you must drive with dipped headlights year-round
use winter tyres between 15 November and 15 April
carry a fluorescent vest kept in the car, not in the boot. Wear the vest while attending to a breakdown
You must not use a mobile phone while driving.
Sea travel
Do not drink alcohol if you’re in charge of a yacht or boat. There are heavy penalties for being caught drunk in charge of a boat and a zero tolerance approach.
It is a requirement that you sail by the most direct route to a port of entry upon entering territorial waters.
Authorities can arrest you for entering a non-designated entry port without telling them. If you cannot use the correct entry port, contact the local harbour master or the police before entering.
Register your presence on a boat in Croatia by filling in a police form obrazac 16a. The completed form must be handed in at a police station.
All captains must have an International Certificate of Competence.
Extreme weather and natural disasters
Follow media reports and the advice of local authorities if a forest fire, earthquake, floods or other natural disaster occurs in your area.
Forest fires
Fires are common during Croatia’s hot and dry summers. Take care when visiting or driving through woodland and forest areas. If you see a fire, call the emergency services on 112. If you’re affected, follow the advice of local authorities.
From 1 June to 31 October it is illegal to set outdoor fires and barbecues except in designated areas. Intentionally causing a fire is illegal in Croatia and you could be fined from approximately 2,000 to 20,000 euros, or even imprisoned.
You can also be fined for unintentionally causing a fire. Properly extinguish cigarette ends and do not leave any rubbish behind, particularly empty bottles, as these are known to start fires. Fines in these cases have ranged from 260 to 1,200 euros.
Earthquakes
Earthquakes in Croatia can be strong and cause deaths and damage to infrastructure. In recent years, there have been earthquakes in Zagreb and in Petrinja, near Sisak in central Croatia. Both caused extensive damage to buildings and infrastructure and 8 people died. Heavily damaged buildings, which are not always signposted, may be unstable.
There are small tremors several times a month throughout the year. Most pass without consequences. To learn more about what to do before, during and after an earthquake, visit the website of the US Federal Emergency Management Agency.
Floods
Flash floods can happen with very little warning and lead to dangerous water flows and disruption to transport and other networks. There is the highest risk of flooding in central Croatia, between Karlovac and Slavonski Brod. Monitor weather forecasts and follow the advice of local authorities.
