The authorities in Croatia set and enforce entry rules.

Check your passport and travel documents before you travel
Passport validity
If you are planning to travel to an EU country (except Ireland), or Switzerland, Norway, Iceland, Liechtenstein, Andorra, Monaco, San Marino or Vatican City, you must follow the Schengen area passport requirements.
Your passport must be:
Issued less than 10 years before the date you enter the country (check the ‘date of issue’)
valid for at least 3 months after the day you plan to leave (check the ‘expiry date’)
You must check your passport meets these requirements before you travel. If your passport was issued before 1 October 2018, extra months may have been added to its expiry date.
Contact the embassy of the country you are visiting if you think that your passport does not meet both these requirements. Renew your passport if you need to.
Visas
Croatia is not part of the Schengen area, but does apply Schengen rules of entry. If you have been banned from entering Schengen countries, you will not be allowed to enter Croatia.
Visits to other EU or Schengen countries do not count towards your 90-day visa-free limit in Croatia. Visits to Croatia do not count towards your 90-day visa-free limit in the Schengen area.
You can travel to Croatia for up to 90 days in any 180-day period without a visa. This applies if you travel as a tourist, to visit family or friends, to attend business meetings, cultural or sports events, or for short-term studies or training.
To stay longer, to work or study, for business travel or for other reasons, you will need to meet the Croatian government’s entry requirements. Check with the Croatian Embassy in London as to what type of visa and/or work permit you may need.
If you are travelling to Croatia for work, read the guidance on visas and permits.
If you stay in Croatia with a Croatia residence permit or long-stay visa, this line does not count towards your 90-day visa-free limit for Croatia.
Passport stamping
As a visitor, your passport will be stamped when you enter and exit Croatia. Border guards will use passport stamps to check you’re complying with the 90-day visa-free limit for short stays in Croatia.
If you enter or exit the Schengen area through Croatia as a visitor, check that your passport is stamped. This will show border guards that you are complying with the 90-day visa-free limit for Croatia and the separate 90-day visa-free limit for the Schengen area.
If the relevant entry or exit stamp is not in your passport, border guards will presume that you have overstayed your visa-free limit. If you show evidence e.g. transport tickets to prove when you entered or exited Croatia, border guards should add this entry or exit date and the location in your passport.
You may also need to:
show a return or onward ticket
show proof of accommodation
show you have enough money for your stay
If you have a Withdrawal Agreement residency document for another country, your passport might still be stamped if you are a visitor to Croatia.
If you are resident in Croatia, read our Living in Croatia guide for passport stamping information.
UK Emergency Travel Documents
UK ETDs are accepted for entry, transit and exit from Croatia.
