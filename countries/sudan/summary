Sporadic protests have led to a state of emergency and curfews being imposed in several towns and cities across Sudan. In Khartoum, the areas around Omdurman, Haj Yousif and Souq Al-Arabi have seen the most regular protests and security operations, but demonstrations have occurred sporadically across the city, particularly following Friday prayers. Live ammunition and tear gas have been used against protestors on occasion. You should avoid protests or large gatherings, observe local curfews and follow the instructions of the relevant authorities. You’re advised to: limit travel, including within/around cities; seek information on the situation in districts you propose travelling to or through before departing; and identify and remain in a place of safety if local circumstances dictate.
The government of Sudan has declared an outbreak of Chikungunya in the east of Sudan (especially Kassala). There have also been reports of cases in other parts of Sudan. See Health
On a number of occasions in 2018, there have been shortages of fuel throughout Sudan including in Khartoum. At times these have led to very long queues (several hours or even overnight) at petrol stations (which regularly run dry) and rationing of the commercial supply. Earlier in the year, the shortages had knock on effects, including availability of services and some basic food items. There have been some violent incidents at petrol stations. If you need to travel by road, consider how you will get fuel during your journey and whether you have sufficient fuel for your return trip.
Since early January 2018 there have been sporadic protests against increases in the price of basic goods in a number of locations across Sudan, particularly in West Darfur, Wad Madani, the Omdurman and Bahri areas of Khartoum, and around the University of Khartoum. While these are not targeting the international community, tear gas and force have been used to subdue some protests. You should exercise vigilance and avoid large crowds or demonstrations.
On 30 December 2017, President Omar Al Bashir announced a state of emergency in the states of Kassala and North Kordofan, which remains in place. States of emergency give the authorities increased powers of arrest in these areas. On 5 January 2018, the Government of Sudan announced that the border between Sudan and Eritrea had been closed and the Rapid Support Forces had been deployed to the area. The border remains closed.
Terrorists are likely to try to carry out attacks in Sudan. Attacks could be indiscriminate, including in places frequented by expatriates and foreign travellers. See Terrorism
The British Embassy no longer registers British nationals in Sudan and the capacity of the British Embassy to help in times of crisis may be limited. You should consider your own travel arrangements carefully and make sure you have up-to-date travel documents and visas in case you need to leave at short notice. In case of a crisis this page outlines the precautions you should take and the help and support the British Embassy can provide.
If you’re abroad and you need emergency help from the UK government, contact the nearest British embassy, consulate or high commission.
