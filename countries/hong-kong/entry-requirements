This page has information on travelling to Hong Kong. Check what you must do to return to the UK.
This page reflects the UK government’s understanding of current rules for people travelling on a full ‘British Citizen’ passport from the UK, for the most common types of travel.
The authorities in Hong Kong set and enforce entry rules.
All travellers
Although Hong Kong is now part of the People’s Republic of China, it remains a Special Administrative Region with its own immigration controls. You can visit Hong Kong for up to 6 months without a visa. However during the COVID-19 pandemic, different entry requirements are being applied in Hong Kong. For up-to-date advice on entry requirements and restrictions, please visit the Hong Kong SAR government’s website.
Vaccinated Hong Kong residents who have visited the UK within the past 14 days are permitted to enter Hong Kong. From 1 May, this will be expanded to include vaccinated non-Hong Kong residents.
You should visit the Hong Kong SAR Government website for further details.
Travellers from all places other than mainland China, Macao and Taiwan will need to undergo 7 days quarantine at a designated quarantine hotel. On arrival, travellers will need to provide confirmation of a hotel room reservation at their designated quarantine hotel. You can find further details on the Hong Kong SAR government website.
You should check the Hong Kong SAR government’s website for important details about the documents required and check the Hong Kong SAR government’s list of designated hotels when you make your booking. You must take designated transport, which is provided by the government, from the airport to your hotel.
Flights may be suspended at short notice if previous flights on the route carry a certain number of people who test positive for COVID-19. Ensure you understand the cancellation policies on all your bookings, keep in close contact with your airline and be prepared to change your plans.
Testing on arrival
All inbound travellers via Hong Kong International Airport need to submit a health declaration form.
All travellers ending their journey at Hong Kong International Airport will have to undergo a PCR test and rapid antigen test for coronavirus. Travellers will be required to remain at the airport whilst awaiting the results of the rapid antigen test. Further information is available on the Centre for Health Protection’s website.
If you test positive, the Hong Kong authorities will arrange for admission to a public hospital or isolation facility. If you are deemed to be a contact of a positive case, you may be placed in a Hong Kong government quarantine centre for a minimum of 7 days. All arrivals including those who test negative for coronavirus need to undergo 7-day compulsory quarantine in a designated hotel. See “Quarantine requirements” below.
You may be separated from your child if one of you tests positive for coronavirus. If this happens to you, you can call +(852) 2901 3000 for 24/7 urgent consular assistance.
Quarantine requirements
Quarantine following travel is spent at a designated hotel.
If you test positive for COVID-19 whilst in Hong Kong, you may be placed in a government isolation facility for a minimum of 7 days. Family members of someone who tests positive, or those who have been in contact with a positive case, may also be placed in a government quarantine centre.
For up-to-date advice on entry requirements and restrictions, please visit the Hong Kong SAR government’s website.
For quarantine arrangements in Hong Kong:
you are not allowed to leave your designated quarantine location/room for 7 days. This means you’re also unable to leave Hong Kong for the duration of the quarantine
if you are allocated a government quarantine centre, you may be asked to contribute around £20 (HK$200) per night towards the cost
items that can be taken in to government quarantine centres are restricted. There is no smoking allowed and no alcohol. Depending on your centre, facilities may be basic: there may be no fridge and no air-conditioning and you may need to share a room
Failure to comply with the quarantine conditions may result in you being immediately taken to government quarantine facilities (if you are in a designated hotel). You could face a 6-month prison sentence and a substantial fine. You should comply with the requirements of your quarantine arrangements.
See the Hong Kong government coronavirus website for further information.
Proof of vaccination status
From 1 April, fully vaccinated travellers who have visited the UK or other overseas destinations within the past 14 days will be permitted to enter Hong Kong.
For travellers arriving from other countries, Hong Kong will accept the UK’s proof of COVID-19 recovery and vaccination record and proof of COVID-19 vaccination issued in the Crown Dependencies. Your last vaccine dose must have been administered at least 14 days prior to travel. Your NHS appointment card from vaccination centres is not designed to be used as proof of vaccination and should not be used to demonstrate your vaccine status. Children under the age of 12 who are not vaccinated will be allowed to enter with a fully vaccinated accompanying adult.
Travellers arriving to Hong Kong will need to provide a negative nucleic acid test result for COVID-19, taken no more than 48 hours prior to their departure. The Hong Kong Government has specified that this must be a polymerase chain reaction (PCR) based nucleic acid test. Other types of tests such as the reverse transcription loop-mediated isothermal amplification (RT- LAMP) will not be accepted and do not fulfil the relevant boarding requirement. From 1 June, you will no longer need a separate certificate confirming that the testing laboratory meets the required standards.
Travel between Hong Kong, Macao and mainland China
All border crossings with mainland China remain closed indefinitely, with the exception of the Shenzhen Bay Checkpoint and the Hong Kong-Zhuhai-Macao Bridge. All passengers wanting to board a shuttle bus to cross the bridge departing from Hong Kong to Macao must present a certificate confirming that they have tested negative for COVID-19 within 24 hours of their departure. The special ferry service between Taipa Ferry Terminal in Macao and Hong Kong International Airport has now ceased operations. All ferry crossings between Hong Kong and mainland China are currently not in operation with the exception of the service from Shenzhen Shekou Port to Hong Kong International Airport. Kai Tak Cruise and Ocean Terminals are also closed to passengers indefinitely.
Arrivals from mainland China, Taiwan and Macao must quarantine at home or in a hotel for 7 - 14 days. Certain groups of people travelling from mainland China, Taiwan and Macao may be granted an exemption from quarantine requirements by applying in advance to the Chief Secretary of the Administration.
Hong Kong residents in mainland China may be eligible for the Return2hk scheme, which enables quarantine free travel from mainland China to Hong Kong. Non-residents in mainland China may be eligible for the Come2hk scheme, which offers similar exemptions to entry requirements. You can find further information on the Hong Kong SAR government coronavirus website.
If you’re not fully vaccinated
If you are not fully vaccinated and have visited places outside mainland China, Macao or Taiwan within the past 14 days, you will be denied entry into Hong Kong.
If you are unable to be fully vaccinated due to medical reasons, you may still be permitted entry to Hong Kong, but will be required to undergo 14 days quarantine in a designated quarantine hotel. You will be required to show proof of the relevant medical reason certified by a medical practitioner before boarding a flight to Hong Kong.
Children under the age of 12 who are not vaccinated will be allowed to enter with a vaccinated accompanying adult.
If you’ve had COVID-19 in the past year
If you have previously infected with COVID-19 and have received one dose of COVID-19 vaccine, you will be considered fully vaccinated.
If you have tested positive for COVID-19 recently and are unable to produce a negative pre-departure PCR test result, you may still enter Hong Kong if you can provide certain additional documentation. You will need to provide a recovery certificate proving you were infected with COVID-19 between 14 and 90 days before your arrival in Hong Kong, as well as evidence of a negative Rapid Antigen Test taken within 24 hours of your scheduled departure time. Further important information on required documentation can be found on the Hong Kong SAR Government’s Coronavirus website.
Should you test positive on the PCR or Rapid Antigen Test required on arrival in Hong Kong, the Department for Health will take recovery certificates into account when deciding on the location and duration of the quarantine order you are issued.
As with all cases of a positive test on arrival in Hong Kong, there is a risk that you will be placed in a government isolation facility for a minimum of 7 days. See Quarantine requirements for further information.
Children and young people
Proof of a single dose of the BioNTech vaccination will be accepted for 12-17 year-old Hong Kong residents entering Hong Kong and for non-Hong Kong residents from 1 May.
Unvaccinated minors under the age of 12 will also be permitted entry to Hong Kong if they are travelling with fully vaccinated adults who meet the requirements. They will be subject to the same quarantine and testing requirements as the adults accompanying them.
Children 12-17 years of age who meet the vaccination requirements and are travelling alone will also need to quarantine for 7 days on arrival in a designated hotel. It is down to hotel policy whether a child can self-isolate alone. Further details can be found on the Hong Kong SAR government’s website and you should call the Port Heath Division (+852 3904 9333) to understand the latest requirements if your child is travelling alone.
From 1 June, children under the age of 3 will no longer be required to present proof of a pre-departure test when entering Hong Kong. They will still be subject to both PCR and rapid antigen testing on arrival.
If you’re transiting through Hong Kong
Transit services at Hong Kong International Airport resumed on 1 April.
Transiting through Hong Kong from, but not to, mainland China is now allowed.
From 1 August, transit passengers travelling through Hong Kong International Airport must have an onward flight booked, which departs within 24 hours of their scheduled time of arrival in Hong Kong.
From 1 June, transit passengers travelling through Hong Kong International Airport will no longer be required to provide evidence of a pre-departure PCR test before boarding their flight to Hong Kong. If in doubt, you should check with your travel agent or airline before travelling and check the Hong Kong International Airport website.
There is a risk when transiting that you will be placed into isolation in hospital in Hong Kong or a government quarantine facility. All passengers transiting Hong Kong Inter-national Airport will be subject to advanced screening measures, including temperature checks. Passengers deemed to have a high temperature will undergo further checks by the Port Health Office at the airport. If you meet further risk criteria, you will be transferred to a Hong Kong public hospital for mandatory checks/treatment, where it is highly likely you will be asked to complete a mandatory COVID-19 test. If you successfully pass health screening you need to sit in designated areas at boarding gates and use designated queues in dining facilities and shops, in line with Hong Kong International Airport anti-virus measures.

Details for exemptions can be found on the Hong Kong SAR government’s website.
