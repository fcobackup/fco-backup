In December 2019, legislation came into force to decriminalise possession of up to 30 grams of marijuana/cannabis. Anyone with more than 30 grams of cannabis, or more than five grams of cannabis resin, commits an offence and is liable to a fine of TT$50,000. You are not allowed to smoke in public spaces or while operating a vehicle.
Severe penalties will remain in place for other drug related offences, including attempting to export narcotics.
Male and female same-sex sexual activity is illegal in Trinidad and Tobago. There is legislation in place that bars LGBT individuals from entering the country. In practice, these laws are rarely enforced and there is growing local support for LGBT rights. However, public displays of affection between same sex couples may attract negative attention. See our information and advice page for the LGBT community before you travel.
It is an offence for anyone, including children, to carry or dress in camouflage clothing.
