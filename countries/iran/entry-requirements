Warning
FCDO advises against all travel to Iran.

This advice reflects the UK government’s understanding of current rules for people travelling on a full ‘British citizen’ passport from the UK, for the most common types of travel. 
The authorities in Iran set and enforce entry rules. If you’re not sure how these requirements apply to you, contact the Iranian Embassy in the UK. 
COVID-19 rules 
There are no COVID-19 testing or vaccination requirements for travellers entering Iran.  
Passport validity requirements 
If you visit Iran against FCDO advice, your passport should be valid for a minimum of 6 months from the date you arrive. It’s not possible for British nationals or dual nationals to apply for a UK passport in Iran. 
Check with your travel provider to make sure your passport and other travel documents meet their requirements. Renew your passport if you need to.  
You will be denied entry if you do not have a valid travel document or try to use a passport that has been reported lost or stolen. 
Previous travel to Israel 
If your passport has stamps from Israel or other countries’ border crossing points with Israel, you may be refused entry to Iran. 
Visa requirements 
You need a visa to enter Iran as a visitor. 
Check the expiry date of your visa before travelling. If you overstay your visa, you may have to stay in Iran until this is resolved and you are at risk of being detained.  
Women and girls aged 10 or over should wear a headscarf in their visa application photos. 
If you’re travelling through an Iranian airport, check visa requirements with your airline and the Iranian Embassy in the UK. 
Applying for a visa 
If you choose to travel to Iran against FCDO advice, apply for a visa well in advance of your travel. The application process for an Iranian visa can be long and unpredictable.  
If you want to travel to Iran with a British passport, the Iranian Embassy has told FCDO that to get a visa you must either apply as part of an organised tour, or have a sponsor in Iran. Check with the Iranian Embassy in the UK for more information. 
Some British nationals have had problems getting visas from private online visa agencies. 
Your passport must be valid for at least 6 months from the date you submit your visa application. 
Vaccination requirements  
At least 8 weeks before your trip, check the vaccinations and certificates you need in TravelHealthPro’s Iran guide. 
Dual nationality 
Iran does not recognise dual nationality. Dual nationals are considered Iranian nationals by Iranian authorities. All Iranian nationals must travel to and from Iran using an Iranian passport.  
You may also be required to demonstrate to the Iranian airport authorities that you have the right to enter the UK. You must be able to produce your British passport or a valid UK visa in your Iranian passport on request.   
Holding a British passport can be reason enough for the Iranian authorities to question you. The Iranian authorities have shown a pattern of hostility towards the UK and its citizens. 
Being considered an Iranian national 
Even if you do not consider yourself Iranian, you may be seen as an Iranian national by Iranian authorities. For example, if your father is Iranian, or if you’re married to an Iranian man. 
Customs rules 
There are strict rules about goods that can be brought into and taken out of Iran. You must declare anything that may be prohibited or subject to tax or duty. 
Pork products 
Importing pork products is illegal. 
Children travelling without a male parent 
In Iran, a female parent travelling with her children must have the father’s permission, usually verbal, to take them out of Iran. This is assumed to be the case by Iranian immigration authorities unless the father has petitioned the court, or the court has ruled to prevent the children travelling. For more information, contact the Iranian Embassy in the UK. 
Kish Island 
To enter Kish Island, you must arrange your visit through an Iranian travel agency. The agency must: 
inform the Iranian Ministry of Foreign Affairs about your visit at least 2 weeks before you travel 
have received confirmation that a visa will be issued on arrival 
The nearest Iranian embassy or consulate can give you advice and a list of registered travel agents. 
You must also have a hotel reservation before you travel. Your guide must: 
pass a copy of the hotel reservation confirmation to the Immigration Office at Kish Airport at least 48 hours before you arrive 
meet you at the airport when you arrive 
Travellers have occasionally been denied entry to Kish without explanation. If you’re denied entry, follow the advice of your airline or travel agent.
