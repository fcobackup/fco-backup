Cases of coronavirus (COVID-19) have been confirmed in Germany. The German authorities have introduced a number of temporary enforceable rules to limit the spread of the virus.
British nationals in Germany should follow the advice of the German authorities. British nationals that wish to leave Germany should contact their travel operator to make arrangements to do so as soon as possible. For information on how to return to the UK from Germany see Return to the UK
Entry and borders
Germany has intensified border controls at airports and land borders. Unless travellers are resident in Germany, can demonstrate a compelling reason for their travel to Germany, or are border workers commuting between Germany and neighbouring countries, they will be refused entry. If you intend to fly to Germany, check with your airline before you travel and ensure you bring any supporting documentation you need to justify your travel.
The British Embassy understands that British citizens may still be able to enter Germany in order to transit to the UK, but proof of onward travel will be required. You should bear in mind that the situation is changing quickly and that border police in some regions may take a more strict approach.
Germany imposed temporary border checks on its land borders with France, Austria, Switzerland, Luxembourg and Denmark on Monday 16 March. Those without a good reason for travelling will not be permitted entry. Frontier workers and goods traffic are not currently affected. German nationals and residents will be allowed to return to Germany. Germany is advising its own citizens against all unnecessary travel abroad.
The German Health Minister has advised that all people in Germany who have been in a risk area in the last 14 days should self-isolate for two weeks, as well as those who have been close contact with a person who has been tested positive for COVID-19. The high risk areas are listed on the Robert Koch Institute website (in German).
Local measures
On 22 March, nationwide rules were introduced furthering restrictions on peopleâ€™s movement and limiting activity. These will be enforced by the police and regulatory authorities.
Gatherings of more than two people are now prohibited, excluding families and members of the same household.
All contact with other individuals should be kept to a minimum, and a distance of 1.5m should be maintained at all times.
Under the new rules, commuting, exercising outdoors or offering assistance to others are permitted. Meetings deemed absolutely necessary for business and official purposes also remain permissible.
Restaurants may only offer takeaway or delivery services. Body care services, such as hairdressers, nail and tattoo salons are now closed, though treatments deemed medically necessary such as therapeutic massages and rehab centres remain permissable. Workplaces will now introduce and uphold specific hygiene rules for staff and visitors.
Visits to hospitals and care homes may also be restricted.
These heightened measures are expected to remain in place for at least the next two weeks.
Further restrictions vary by region. As there is some variation between the federal states, you should follow the latest local guidance, much of which is available in English.
