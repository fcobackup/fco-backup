You can spread the virus even if you don’t have symptoms.

Cases of coronavirus (COVID-19) have been confirmed throughout South Korea.
While the majority of new and existing cases are within the designated “special care zones”, the number of cases elsewhere in South Korea also continues to rise. The virus may cause more severe symptoms in older people, and those with pre-existing medical conditions. You should exercise caution throughout the country, follow the advice of local authorities, and continue to comply with any additional screening measures put in place. You should ensure you have up to date, comprehensive health insurance.

The South Korean authorities have introduced a number of measures to limit the spread of the virus.
Special care zones
The FCO advise against all travel to the cities of Daegu, Cheongdo and Gyeongsan, which the Government of South Korea has designated as “special care zones” following a high number of cases in these areas.
Medical services in these areas are under pressure and you may experience delays in receiving treatment should you become ill. If you’re already in Daegu, Cheongdo or Gyeongsan, follow the instructions and advice of the local authorities and pay particular regard to virus control testing and measures.
Screening and quarantine
Since 22 March, all foreign travellers from Europe have been subject to testing for COVID-19 on arrival at South Korean ports and airports.
Testing may take up to 24 hours and you may be held in a separate facility during this time. If a person tests positive for the virus they will be transferred to the appropriate healthcare facility.
From 1 April, all arrivals – regardless of their nationality and length of stay – will be required to undergo quarantine for a period of 14 days. Those with an Alien Registration Card and a residence in Korea may self-quarantine at home. Those without a residence or Alien Registration Card will be quarantined at government-arranged facilities and charged a fee – likely to be around 100,000KRW (approximately £66) per day.
Very limited exemptions from the self-quarantine system may be applied for in order to conduct important – primarily COVID-19 related – business, humanitarian or academic purposes. Approval must be received before travelling from the Embassy of the Republic of Korea in the United Kingdom. Individuals with an exemption will still be tested for COVID-19 on arrival, and will need to subject themselves to an active monitoring system via regular calls with a health expert and a specialised mobile App.
All visitors should ensure you have with you a mobile telephone with the roaming function enabled, and/or the telephone number of a friend, relative or contact who can update the authorities daily on your state of health. A hotel telephone number will not be accepted.
Immigration authorities will undertake a test call before travellers leave the airport, and any individual unable to verify their contact details may be denied entry to South Korea.
Transit passengers will receive a temperature check on arrival in Korea. Symptomatic individuals will be subject to a COVID-19 test and hospitalisation if found positive. Passengers who do not show symptoms and/or test negative may continue their journey.
Entry and borders
The Government of South Korea has announced that foreign nationals who have been in Hubei province in China within the previous 14 days will not be allowed to enter South Korea.
The Government of South Korea has announced measures to extend the expiry date of some visas automatically due to the current situation with COVID-19. You should continue to consult the Korea Immigration Service website for more information, or contact 1345 (option 3 then *) from inside South Korea.
Further information
For British nationals in all affected areas, Public Health England advise that you should maintain good hand, respiratory and personal hygiene and should avoid visiting animal and bird markets or people who are ill with respiratory symptoms. There is a shortage in the supply of facemasks inside South Korea at present. Travellers who wish to use a facemask while in South Korea should aim to bring their own supply with them.
Further advice and details on confirmed cases can be found on the Korean Ministry of Health and Welfare website in English and Korean. South Korea’s Center for Disease Control and Prevention (KCDC) also provides daily updates in English and in Korean.
Further advice on coronavirus is also available from Public Health England and on the TravelHealthPro website.
