Public spaces and services
On 14 August, President Moreno renewed the state of emergency for a further 30 days. It will now remain in force until 12 September. This includes general nationwide measures such as:
self-isolation and extra precaution advised for people over 60 years old, and people whose medical conditions make them vulnerable to COVID-19
mandatory use of face masks in public spaces. Fines will be given to those who do not comply. Each city will define the cost of the fine

pubs, nightclubs and children playgrounds remain closed
schools at all levels and universities remain closed nationwide. Classes will be delivered online

The Government has emphasised that measures will be enforced robustly and infringements will be sanctioned. You should ensure you comply, including with self-isolation measures. Check specific details on self-isolation (Spanish only).
Once the state of emergency is lifted, in principle local governments/municipalities and other competent authorities (amongst others, health, transport and education) will decide which restrictions to maintain for their specific locations. However, Ecuador´s National Emergency Commission (COE) will continue operating nationwide and reviewing the whole COVID-19 situation.
New phase of restrictions by municipality
The Government has updated the measures applied under each level of the “red, amber, green” system with effect from 1 July. These measures apply nationwide with the exception of Quito, where stricter measures remain in place.
Each municipal government is responsible for determining whether they move from one stage to the next. You can find an interactive map showing the colour of each city through this online tool. Municipalities can implement additional measures to those stated below.
