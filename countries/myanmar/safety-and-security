Warning
FCDO advises against all travel to parts of Myanmar (Burma).

Terrorism
There is a high threat of terrorist attack globally affecting UK interests and British nationals, including from groups and individuals who view the UK and British nationals as targets. Stay aware of your surroundings at all times.  
UK Counter Terrorism Policing has information and advice on staying safe abroad and what to do in the event of a terrorist attack. Find out how to reduce your risk from terrorism while abroad.
Terrorism in Myanmar
Terrorist attacks in Myanmar cannot be ruled out.
Attacks could be indiscriminate including in places visited by foreigners. Stay aware of your surroundings, keep up to date with local media reports and follow the advice of trusted local sources.
Political situation
In 2021, the Myanmar military took control of the country by force and declared a state of emergency. There has been widespread political violence involving the deaths of hundreds of ordinary people and active clashes between armed actors.
After the executions of high-profile political prisoners in July 2022, tensions across the country have increased. There have been a number of explosions in public places. Visitors to Myanmar should be extra vigilant.
There is a higher likelihood of opposition attacks after sunset and an increased presence of security forces on occasions of national significance, including:   
Myanmar National Day (4 January)
the anniversary of the 2021 coup (1 February)
Union Day (12 February)
Peasants Day (2 March)
Armed Forces Day (27 March)
Martyrs’ Day (19 July)
the anniversary of the execution of political prisoners (23 to 25 July)
the lapsing of the state of emergency (1 August)
the 8888 uprising (8 August)
Some areas in Myanmar are under martial law; others have curfews or ‘stay at home’ orders. In Yangon, a number of townships have a curfew from 1am to 3am. Ensure you are aware of local rules and restrictions before you arrive in an area.
Opposition activists regularly detonate small-scale improvised explosive devices across the country. While small-scale, these devices are becoming increasingly sophisticated and the attacks more deadly. The main targets are:
military and government buildings
police stations
businesses, hotels and restaurants linked to the military, or seen as such
There have also been attacks on schools and hospitals.
Be cautious and avoid all demonstrations, large crowds and political gatherings. Do not attempt to photograph any gatherings. If you ignore military instructions or curfews, you could be detained and, if you’re convicted, you could face a lengthy prison sentence. Curfews are in place nationwide. Local wards may unexpectedly change rules and curfew times, so keep up to date with local rules.
Crime
The most common crimes in Myanmar are non-violent crimes of opportunity, including:
bag snatching
gem or confidence scams
pickpocketing
theft of unattended possessions in public places or hotel rooms
Myanmar is largely a cash society. Make sure you have access to your cash, but avoid displaying it or other valuables in public.
Protecting your belongings
Thieves often distract their victims by asking questions, begging for money, offering items for sale, or simply bumping or jostling. Take extra care of your belongings and be wary of strangers who approach you.
Scams
Be wary of merchants offering to sell gems, gold or semi-precious stones. You could lose your money or get drawn into an illegal activity. Do not buy gems or minerals from an unlicensed source.
Be cautious of job offers that appear too good to be true in Myanmar and neighbouring countries. There are cyber scam centres operating in eastern Myanmar, particularly in the Myawaddy district in eastern Kayin and Tachileik township in eastern Shan. Victims are trafficked into Myanmar to carry out online scams. They are held in poor living conditions and subjected to severe mistreatment. Some victims have had their passports confiscated, and held to ransom.
FCDO is aware of fraudulent emails being sent by individuals claiming to work for British firms seeking loans to advance their business interests in Myanmar. These have falsely stated they are acting on the advice of the British Embassy. See our pages on fraud and financial scams for further guidance.
Landmines
The risk of landmines in rural areas is serious, particularly in northern and central Rakhine, northern Shan and Kachin states. There is evidence of landmine use having spread to other areas since the coup in 2021. Some areas with known mines are marked by signs, but this practice is not widespread. Be extremely cautious if you must leave the main roads in these areas.
Mobile phones and internet
The Myanmar authorities periodically cut off access to the internet and have blocked some websites.
Many visitors travel with a spare mobile phone and buy a SIM card for a nominal fee when they arrive. They can top up as needed.
Laws and cultural differences
Detention and arrest
There is a risk of arbitrary detention and arrest, particularly for journalists and human rights activists. The criminal justice process followed in such cases falls below international standards. Myanmar does not recognise dual nationality. If you are a dual national with Myanmar nationality you will be treated as a Myanmar national by local authorities.
In February, Myanmar authorities announced that Myanmar men and women could be required, by law, to serve in the armed forces. Length of service can depend on criteria such as age, occupation, and whether there is a state of emergency. Myanmar does not recognise dual nationality. If you are a British-Myanmar dual national, holding a British passport may not exempt you from this law. The plans for implementation of this law remain unclear.
Myanmar’s defamation laws give broad scope for individuals to bring arbitrary charges, which could result in criminal penalties, including a prison sentence. Foreigners have been subject to criminal investigations for acts such as posting a critical review of a hotel online.
If you’re arrested and convicted of a crime in Myanmar, you can expect a long prison sentence. Conditions in detention are extremely poor. Pre-trial detention can also last many months.
The legal process in Myanmar is unpredictable, lacks transparency and is open to interference from powerful political and business interests. The investigation and trial process falls far below the standard expected in the UK. There are limits to the assistance the British Embassy can offer to those with concerns about the fairness of their trial, as we are unable to interfere in the legal processes of a host country.
Religious customs
Respect religious customs when visiting Buddhist religious sites. Shorts and sleeveless tops will cause offence. You should remove shoes and socks before entering a pagoda or monastery.
Under Myanmar law, insulting religion is a prosecutable offence. Insulting religion is a broad term and can include any disrespectful depiction or image of Buddha or other religious representation. This includes tattoos of Buddha.
Illegal drugs
Penalties for drug trafficking include a prison sentence of a minimum 15 years or even the death penalty.
For possession of illegal drugs in Myanmar, you could get a fine and a prison sentence of a minimum 5 years to a maximum of 10 years, regardless of the quantity of drugs.
Photography and drones
Do not take photographs or videos of the police, demonstrations, military installations or military personnel.
Using a drone around government buildings, religious buildings or even tourist sites can result in criminal penalties, including prison sentences. If you wish to bring and use a drone in Myanmar, get permission from the Myanmar authorities.
LGBT+ travellers
Same-sex sexual activity is illegal in Myanmar for men and women, although in practice these laws are not consistently enforced. If convicted, the punishment can be up to life imprisonment. There have been reports of police using threats of prosecution to extort bribes. This is alleged to include arbitrary arrest and detention.
Public attitudes towards LGBT+ people can be mixed. Up until recently, there have been increasingly large Pride festivals and growing visibility of the LGBT+ community, including gay bars and clubs. Public displays of affection, whether heterosexual or LGBT+, are frowned upon in Myanmar culture.
Read more advice for LGBT+ travellers.
Wildlife, animal products and souvenirs
Myanmar is a party to the Convention on International Trade in Endangered Species (CITES). Over 800 species of animals and plants are banned from international trade and a further 30,000 are strictly controlled by legislation. The restrictions cover some exotic souvenirs, such as those made from turtle shell.
Transport risks
Road travel
If you are planning to drive in Myanmar, see information on driving abroad.
You’ll need to have both the 1968 international driving permit (IDP) and your UK driving licence with you in the car. You cannot buy an IDP outside the UK, so get one before you travel.
Overland travel can be hazardous, particularly in the rainy season from May to October. Roads can become impassable and bridges are sometimes damaged. Travel outside the key destinations of Yangon, Mandalay, Bago and Irrawaddy regions is often restricted.
Road safety standards are significantly lower than in the UK. Serious road accidents are common. Under Myanmar law, the driver of a car involved in an accident with a pedestrian is always at fault.
Many vehicles, including taxis and buses, are in a poor condition. Although driving is on the right in Myanmar, the majority of cars are right-hand drive.
Rail travel
Railway safety standards are significantly below those in the UK.
Sea and river travel
River transport may not meet internationally recognised safety standards and search and rescue facilities may be limited.
During the monsoon season from May to October, heavy rains can cause flooding. Make sure life jackets are available if you travel by boat or ferry, and check local weather conditions before undertaking a river journey.
Get local advice about where it is safe to swim or dive. Bathing in fresh water carries a risk of catching schistosomiasis.
Extreme weather and natural disasters
Cyclones
Myanmar normally experiences cyclones between mid-April and mid-May, and during October and November. You can monitor the progress of tropical cyclones on the website of the World Meteorological Organization. Floods and landslides may occur. Check local weather reports before travelling, particularly in coastal areas.
Earthquakes
There is a risk of earthquakes and tremors. The US Federal Emergency Management Agency has advice about what to do before, during and after an earthquake or tsunami.
