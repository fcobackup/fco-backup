The Foreign and Commonwealth Office (FCO) is advising British nationals against all non-essential international travel at this time. Existing advice for DRC remains in place:
The FCO advise against all travel to:
the provinces of Kasaï, Kasaï Central, Kasaï Oriental, Haut-Uele, Haut Lomami, Ituri, North Kivu (except the city of Goma - see below), South Kivu (except the city of Bukavu - see below), Maniema and Tanganyika in eastern DRC
areas to the west and east of Kananga, including Tshikapa and Mwene-Ditu (as shown on the map)
within 50km of the border with the Central African Republic and South Sudan.
The FCO advise against all but essential travel to:
the city of Goma in North Kivu province
the city of Bukavu in South Kivu province
the districts of N’djili and Kimbanseke in Kinshasa, both of which are south of the main access road to N’djili airport (located in Nsele district).
Cases of coronavirus (COVID-19) have been confirmed in DRC. The Congolese authorities have introduced a number of measures to limit the spread of the virus. See Staying during coronavirus and Entry requirements.
Booking for the UK special flight on 14 May has now closed. There are currently no further special flights organised from DRC. This travel advice will be updated with further information on options to return to the UK as soon as this is available. See Return to the UK
Given the rapidly changing situation in Democratic Republic of the Congo we have temporarily withdrawn a limited number of UK staff and their dependents from our Embassy. The Embassy will continue to carry out essential work including providing 24/7 consular assistance and support to British people in Democratic Republic of the Congo.
Public gatherings and demonstrations can be called with little or no notice and can quickly turn violent. You should follow local media for updates. In all instances, you should remain vigilant and be aware of disruptions to journeys. If a demonstration or disturbance takes place, leave quickly and don’t attempt to watch or photograph it.
The security situation in eastern DRC remains unstable. The continued presence of armed groups, military operations against them, intercommunal violence and an influx of refugees from neighbouring countries all contribute to a deterioration in the security and humanitarian situation. There are continued reports of attacks and kidnappings. NGO staff and Ebola response workers have been known to be targeted. See Safety and security
Consular support is severely limited in parts of DRC. The lack of infrastructure throughout the country and insecurity in eastern DRC often prevent the British Embassy in Kinshasa from being able to extend normal levels of consular assistance to British nationals anywhere in the DRC other than Kinshasa. You should not assume that the FCO will be able to provide assistance to leave the country in the event of serious unrest or crisis.
On 17 July 2019, the World Health Organisation declared a Public Health Emergency of International Concern (PHEIC) following an outbreak of the Ebola virus in eastern DRC. If you are in these areas you should take precautions to minimise your risk of exposure. Further advice is available on the World Health Organisation website. Public Health England’s Returning Workers Scheme provides guidance for British nationals who will be returning to the UK from areas affected by the outbreak. See Health
Street crime and robbery is common. You should avoid using any taxis in DRC. If you must take a taxi, use a privately booked one. Don’t hail taxis in the street. Beware of gangs promising you cut price gold and diamonds. See Crime
Terrorists are likely to try to carry out attacks in the Democratic Republic of the Congo. Attacks could be indiscriminate. You should be vigilant, especially in places visited by foreigners. See Terrorism
If you’re abroad and you need emergency help from the UK government, contact the nearest British embassy, consulate or high commission.
Take out comprehensive travel and medical insurance before you travel.
