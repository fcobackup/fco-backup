Coronavirus travel health
See the TravelHealthPro website for further advice on travel abroad and reducing spread of respiratory viruses during the COVID-19 pandemic.
Travel in Singapore
Read the Singapore Government article on the phased approach to resuming activities safely for information.
Those who do not comply with these measures will be fined and foreign nationals could face deportation. Repeat offenders will face further fines and/or prosecution. Be aware that restrictions and penalties are subject to change at short notice.
Public spaces and services
The wearing of facemasks is compulsory for everyone when outside of their place of residence, except children under 6 years old, when eating or when engaged in strenuous exercise.
Most shops, services and eateries are open with social distancing measures in place. No alcohol will be available in bars and restaurants after 10:30pm.
You must record visits to any shops, services etc. through a ‘Safe Entry’ phone app or by signing in at the entrance. You will be required to either download Singapore’s ‘TraceTogether’ app or collect a ‘TraceTogether’ token from the Singapore government in order to enter an increasing number of locations.
Groups of up to 8 people are allowed to meet outside the home. Households are able to receive up to a total of 8 visitors in one day. A distance of 1 metre should be maintained between people, except when this is not possible due to space constraints e.g. in a lift or on public transport. Speaking is discouraged on public transport.
Healthcare in Singapore
For contact details for English speaking doctors visit our list of healthcare providers. English is almost universally spoken in Singapore, so all hospitals – whether private or public – will have English-speaking medical staff.
For a complete list of healthcare institutions in Singapore, see the HCI directory.
From Tuesday 1 December 2020 anyone needing a COVID-19 polymerase chain reaction (PCR) test can get it from one of the clinics approved by the Ministry of Health.
From 10 March 2021, these clinics will be issuing digital test result certificates. You should have these digital certificates notarised before you travel. Anyone looking to have their digital certificates notarised can use the services provided by the Government of Singapore.

COVID-19 vaccines if you live in Singapore
Wherever possible British nationals should aim to be vaccinated in the country where they live. As further information is available about the national vaccination programme, this page will be updated. Sign up to get email notifications.
The Singapore government has stated that it will vaccinate all residents and long-term visitors (including Permanent Residents, Employment Pass, S-Pass and Work Permit holders, foreign domestic workers, Dependent Pass, Long-Term Visit Pass and Student Pass holders). More information, including on registration, can be found at Singapore’s COVID-19 vaccination website. The local authorities have warned that vaccine-related scams exist. If in doubt, check the https://www.moh.gov.sg/covid-19/vaccination or call the Ministry of Health hotline at 1800-333-9999.
The Medicines and Healthcare Products Regulatory Agency (MHRA) is the UK authority responsible for assessing the safety, quality and efficacy of vaccines. It has authorised the Pfizer/BioNTech, Oxford/AstraZeneca and Moderna vaccines for temporary supply and use in the UK. Find out more about MHRA approval for these vaccines.
British nationals living overseas should seek medical advice from their local healthcare provider in the country where they reside. Information about vaccines used in other national programmes, including regulatory status, should be available from the local authorities. This list of Stringent Regulatory Authorities recognised by the World Health Organisation may also be a useful source of additional information. Find out more about COVID-19 vaccines on the World Health Organisation COVID-19 vaccines page.
