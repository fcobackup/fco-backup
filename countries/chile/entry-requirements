Entry rules in response to coronavirus
Since 5 April, all non-resident foreign nationals are not permitted to enter Chile. The only exception is for non-resident foreign nationals with specific permits or visas issued by a Chilean Consulate allowing you to enter during this specific period. See Coronavirus. Additionally, since 5 April, all Chilean borders (including Santiago Airport) are closed and Chilean authorities are currently prohibiting all non-essential overseas travel to Chileans and resident foreign nationals. There will be some exceptions that must be requested via the Comisaria Virtual website.
All non-resident foreign nationals - who have been in the United Kingdom during the last 14 days – are not currently permitted to enter Chile. Direct UK-Chile flights have been suspended until further notice. See Coronavirus.
From 31 March, all travellers (including Chileans, resident and non-resident foreign nationals) must complete a mandatory 10-day quarantine on arrival in Chile. This cannot be avoided under any circumstances, such as with a proof of C19 vaccine. You will not be able to leave quarantine early with a negative PCR.
All travellers will be transferred to a ‘transitory’ hotel, and will have to take a PCR test. They must remain there for five days. After staying at the ‘transitory’ hotel for five days and having obtained a negative PCR test result, passengers are allowed to leave the ‘transitory’ hotel to continue to their final destination where they will have to complete the remaining five-day of quarantine. If the PCR test result is positive, the passenger will have to remain in a ‘Residencia Sanitaria’ (quarantine hotel). All costs related to transfer, transitory hotel, quarantine hotel and PCR test may be charged to the passenger prior to boarding the flight to Chile when filling in the ‘Pasaporte Sanitario’ or on arrival in Chile. Check the Santiago Airport official website (in English) for further information.
Additionally, any traveller who tests positive for COVID within the first 14 days from arrival must complete a further period of 11 days in a quarantine hotel.
Furthermore, any traveller at an arrival point in Chile who presents one or two COVID symptoms will have to enter a quarantine hotel until local health authorities give the all clear.
From 7 January 2021, all travellers (including Chileans, resident and non-resident foreign nationals) require a negative PCR test (rapid PCR tests will not be accepted) taken within 72-hours of boarding the flight to enter Chile. The mandatory 10-day quarantine will remain in place.
From 11 March 2021, all passengers arriving from Brazil, or who have visited Brazil during the last 14 days, will be transferred to a ‘transitory’ hotel, and will have to take a PCR test. They must remain there for at least 72 hours, even if the PCR test result is negative. After staying at the ‘transitory’ hotel for 72 hours and having obtained a negative PCR test result, passengers may leave the hotel to continue to their final destination where a 10-day mandatory quarantine must be completed. If the PCR test result is positive, the passenger will have to remain in a quarantine hotel. All costs related to transfer, transitory hotel and PCR test must be paid by the passenger prior to boarding the flight to Chile when filling in the ‘Pasaporte Sanitario’. You should be aware that Chilean health authorities at Santiago Airport are selecting passengers on arrival for random PCR testing, even when passengers have complied with the requirement to hold a negative PCR test on arrival.
