Although British nationals are eligible for visa on arrival for a period of 1 month for the purpose of official duty, business, investment and tourism, we recommend obtaining a visa before travelling.

Terrorists are very likely to try to carry out attacks in Bangladesh. The threat extends across the country. The last confirmed terrorist attack was the murder of a Bangladeshi writer and publisher on 11 June 2018. On 29 April and 26 May 2019, small devices exploded near local police units in Dhaka Division. Daesh (formerly referred to as ISIL) has claimed responsibility for a number of terrorist attacks in Bangladesh since 2015. There have been recent media reports suggesting continued Daesh interest in attacking targets in Bangladesh. Groups affiliated to Al Qaeda in the Indian Sub-continent (AQIS) are also active.
There is a risk that future attacks could target public gatherings, including religious gatherings and political rallies. There is also the risk that foreign nationals could be directly targeted in future attacks. Although Bangladeshi authorities have successfully disrupted a number of planned attacks, they remain at high alert. Increases in security force presence and restrictions on movement may be put in place at short notice. Crowded areas and places where foreign nationals are known to gather may be at higher risk of attack. You should minimise your exposure to these areas, consider your movements carefully and follow any specific advice of the local authorities. See Terrorism
Political rallies with the potential for disorder, or clashes between groups and with law enforcement agencies may take place. You’re advised to avoid large gatherings, including those for religious gatherings, festivals and political rallies.
As a result of ongoing violence in Myanmar (Burma) since August 2017, hundreds of thousands of Rohingya refugees have arrived in the south-east of Bangladesh, close to the border with Myanmar. They’re concentrated in the sub-districts of Ukhia and Teknaf in the southern part of Cox’s Bazar district. The Bangladeshi authorities regulate access to the areas where the Rohingya are accommodated. There have been reports of insecurity in these areas. You should exercise caution and consult the local authorities about the latest situation before visiting Ukhia and Teknaf. We encourage all humanitarian assistance to be coordinated through recognised humanitarian agencies registered with the Bangladeshi authorities. See Myanmar border
