Earthquakes
Fiji is in an earthquake zone and suffers from tremors from time to time. These can trigger tsunami alerts. Make sure you understand local safety procedures in the event of an earthquake or tsunami. To learn more about what to do before, during and after an earthquake, visit the website of the US Federal Emergency Management Agency.
Tropical cyclones
The tropical cyclone season in Fiji normally runs from November to April, but cyclones can occur throughout the year. During this period there is a greater risk of strong winds, heavy rains, flooding, landslides and road closures.
Fiji Meteorological Service have warned of a cyclone, expected to be named Cyclone Ana, forecast to impact Fiji on 30-31 January. You should check and follow the advice of the Fijian authorities.
Weather updates are available from Fiji Meteorological Service and can also be found in local newspapers and on Radio Fiji GOLD on 100.4 FM. The National Disaster Management Office has information on how to prepare. See our Tropical Cyclones page for further advice about what to do if youâ€™re caught up in a storm.
