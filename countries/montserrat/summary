Montserrat is a British Overseas Territory. There is no formal British diplomatic or consular representation. The local authorities deal with all requests for emergency assistance. See Emergency assistance.
The Government of Montserrat is advising visitors to the island to rearrange their flights and depart earlier than they may have initially planned. We strongly encourage non-resident British nationals in Montserrat to heed this advice and to consider leaving quickly to avoid difficulties they will face if travel out of the territory and the wider region are further restricted and they are unable to get home. See Return to the UK.
