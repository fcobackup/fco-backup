As of 13 March, entry to Slovakia is permitted only for Slovak citizens, foreign residents with proof of temporary or permanent residence and other foreign nationals under certain circumstances. You must pre-register with the Slovak authorities 72 hours in advance of travel and enter mandatory quarantine in a government facility upon arrival in Slovakia. Since 23 May, the Slovak government has been rolling out a system for home quarantine as an alternative to a government facility. See Entry Requirements.
If you’re visiting Slovakia and wish to leave, contact your travel operator to make arrangements to do so as soon as possible. Exit via Austria is an option, but new requirements were introduced by the Austrian government from 14 April. See Return to the UK for more information.
