There is a military conflict ongoing in the north of Ethiopia. Military clashes are now occurring in Tigray, Amhara and Afar regional states. The conflict has potential to escalate and spread quickly and with little warning. The FCDO advises against all travel to Ethiopia, except Addis Ababa, because of the risk of the conflict spreading to new areas without prior warning.
You should review your need to stay in Ethiopia and consider leaving while commercial options are still available. It is likely to become much more difficult to leave Ethiopia in the coming days. Consular support is severely limited in parts of Ethiopia where we advise against all travel and limited where we advise against all but essential travel. In the event of deterioration in the political or security situation, the British Embassy may be limited in the assistance that it can provide. Do not rely on the FCDO being able to evacuate you in an emergency. Currently there remain good commercial transit options to most destinations from Addis Ababa Bole International Airport.
You should check that you are prepared for dealing with a crisis overseas (see our crisis guidance). Please make sure you are ready to change your plans quickly if you need to. If you are in the vicinity of military activity and you cannot leave safely, you should stay indoors, away from windows and remain alert to developments that would enable you to leave safely.
On 2 November, a Nationwide State of Emergency was declared. Public meetings and demonstrations are banned. Movement without ID will be restricted.

You should avoid large gatherings and demonstrations.
Those of Tigrayan ethnicity may face arrest or increased scrutiny by the authorities, including at the airport and through police operations. You should follow the instructions of the authorities. For more information, see Addis Ababa

Some of these can cause temporary closure of roads, internet and mobile networks or disruption to local businesses and transport. In the past some protests have escalated into serious violence.

Terrorists are likely to try to carry out attacks in Ethiopia. Attacks could be indiscriminate, including in places visited by foreigners. You should be vigilant at all times, especially in crowded areas and public places like transport hubs, hotels, restaurants, bars and places of worship and during major gatherings like religious or sporting events. There is a threat of kidnapping in Ethiopia’s Somali region, and on the southern border with Kenya, particularly in the eastern areas to which the FCDO advise against all travel. See Terrorism
