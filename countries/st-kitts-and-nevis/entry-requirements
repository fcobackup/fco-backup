This page reflects the UK government’s understanding of current rules for people travelling on a full ‘British Citizen’ passport, for the most common types of travel.
The authorities in St Kitts and Nevis set and enforce entry rules. For further information contact the embassy, high commission or consulate of the country or territory you’re travelling to. You should also consider checking with your transport provider or travel company to make sure your passport and other travel documents meet their requirements.
Entry rules in response to coronavirus (COVID-19)
If you are not a St Kitts & Nevis national or resident, you must be fully vaccinated to enter St Kitts and Nevis. “Fully vaccinated” means having received two doses of the vaccine more than 14 days prior to arrival (or one dose for one-dose vaccines). Non-vaccinated adult visitors will not be permitted entry to St Kitts and Nevis.
All travellers, including returning nationals, tourists or international travellers must submit a COVID-19 Reverse Transcription Polymerase Chain reaction Laboratory-Based Molecular Test (RT-PCR Test) done within 72 hours of travel at an ISO 17025/CLIA accredited laboratory. On receiving a negative result, travellers should visit https://www.knatravelform.kn/, complete the embarkation form and upload their test results and evidence of vaccination. Proof of recovery documents are not valid, as a negative RT-PCR within 72 hours of travel is required. All travellers will be required to undergo a health screening on arrival at the airport.
There is no requirement to quarantine on arrival for fully vaccinated adult travellers who have submitted a negative RT-PCR test result. All travellers must review the KNA Travel Form website for any updates before travel.
Unvaccinated children aged 12-17 years travelling with fully vaccinated parents must have an RT-PCR test done within 24 hours of arrival. Parents are to remain in quarantine with the child until a negative result is obtained. Unvaccinated children under 12 years who are traveling with their fully vaccinated parents will be subject to the same entry protocol as their fully vaccinated parents, once a negative RT-PCR test done within 72 hours of travel, is submitted for the child.
Travellers should regularly check the St Kitts Tourism Authority websites, St Kitts Tourism and Nevis Tourism Authority for updates and information on pre-travel authorisation, documentation required, permitted hotels and other travel requirements. Changes may take effect at short notice.
Demonstrating your COVID-19 status
St Kitts and Nevis will accept the UK’s proof of COVID-19 recovery and vaccination record. Your NHS appointment card from vaccination centres is not designed to be used as proof of vaccination and should not be used to demonstrate your vaccine status.
