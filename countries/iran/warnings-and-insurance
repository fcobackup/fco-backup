Your travel insurance could be invalidated if you travel against FCDO advice. Consular support is also severely limited where FCDO advises against travel.
If you’re a British national already in Iran, either resident or visitor, carefully consider your presence there and the risks you take by staying.
FCDO advises against all travel to Iran. British and British-Iranian dual nationals are at significant risk of arbitrary arrest, questioning or detention in Iran. Holding a British passport can be reason enough for the Iranian authorities to question you. If you are detained in Iran, you could face months or years in prison.

Dual nationals 
The Iranian authorities do not recognise dual nationality. If you are a British-Iranian dual national and you are detained in Iran, the authorities will not tell FCDO or grant FCDO access to see you. If you are detained, your case will be in the hands of the Iranian authorities, who have shown a pattern of hostility towards the UK and British citizens.
