Bermuda is a separate legal jurisdiction to the United Kingdom and has its own laws.
Don’t become involved with drugs of any kind. Possession or importation can attract severe penalties.
The possession or importation of weapons (including air pistols and catapults) or ammunition (including empty magazines) is illegal. Those caught will be subject to severe penalties.
Bermuda, while welcoming, is a conservative place and you should dress modestly. Bathing suits, revealing tops and short shorts should only be worn at the beach or pools. There are no nude or topless beaches and it is an offence to appear in public topless or wearing a bathing suit top. Drinking alcohol in public outside of licensed premises is not allowed.
Homosexuality became legal under Bermuda law in 1994. The Domestic Partnerships Act came into effect on 1 June 2018 which provides domestic partnerships for both same sex and opposite sex couples. The provisions of the Act relating to the removal of the entitlement for same sex couples to marry are currently under the consideration by the Court of Appeal. Same sex marriages that have taken place in Bermuda before 31 May 2018 remain valid.
From 1 June 2018 Bermuda will treat certain same sex relationships entered into outside of Bermuda as equivalent to domestic partnerships. For more information see the Government of Bermuda’s website.
Attitudes to homosexuality are tolerant but conservative and some people may not approve of public displays of affection between same-sex couples. See our information and advice page for the LGBT community before you travel.
