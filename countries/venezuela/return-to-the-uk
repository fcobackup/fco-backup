If you live in the UK and are currently visiting Venezuela, you’re strongly advised to return now by commercial means. Don’t run the risk of getting stranded.
UK special charter flights will only operate for priority countries where commercial flights are not possible. You should not assume that these flights will become available in countries where commercial routes are operating. Please do not contact the contracted travel management company if no flight is advertised here.
Flights
Limited unscheduled (charter) flights with Conviasa airlines (through Mexico) remain, but their operations are limited and under constant review due to COVID-19. Websites contain limited information – please remain in contact with your tour operator or travel agent for further details.
You will need to pay for your return travel to the UK.
