Entry rules in response to coronavirus (COVID-19)
Entry to Pakistan
On 21 December, the Pakistan government announced that, due to the COVID-19 situation, inbound travellers from the UK, or those who have been in the UK in the last 10 days, will not be able to enter Pakistan. The Pakistan government reviews these restrictions on a regular basis.
There are some exemptions to this restriction:
From 9 January: All those who have a Pakistani passport, National Identity Card for Overseas Pakistanis (NICOP) or Pakistani Origin Card (POC) are allowed to enter Pakistan. There are some additional arrangements on arrival – please see Pakistan government advice to confirm if you are eligible
Travellers permitted to enter Pakistan from the UK and South Africa are required to present evidence of a negative COVID-19 test taken up to 72 hours before the start of travel. For information about this and possible quarantine periods on arrival please see Pakistan government advice.
You should not use the NHS testing service to get a test in order to facilitate your travel to another country. You should arrange to take a private test.
Since 5 October 2020, international travellers to Pakistan have been required to present evidence of a negative COVID-19 test taken up to 96 hours before the start of travel. Arrivals from some other countries are exempted from this requirement.
The Pakistani authorities have closed land borders with Afghanistan, India and Iran. Despite this, there are ongoing limited border openings for repatriation and trade. Those crossing into Pakistan may have to comply with coronavirus testing and quarantine measures. The FCDO currently advises against travel to the most of the Afghanistan and Iran border areas.
Testing / screening on arrival
International travellers travelling by air that show symptoms of COVID-19 on arrival are required to take a COVID-19 test and self-isolate if the result is positive. Self-isolation guidance is also available on the Pakistan government COVID-19 website.
Travellers to Pakistan will also be required to provide their contact information through the Pass Track App or through a web-based form. If necessary you may also be able to fill in a health declaration form on arrival.
Government guidelines, issued on 18 November, state that children under the age of 12 and disabled passengers are exempt from the COVID-19 test requirement and Pass Track App requirement. However they will be required to complete a health declaration form upon arrival.
Government guidelines state that all international air passengers travelling to Pakistan are subject to screening for COVID-19 symptoms on arrival, including thermal screening. If you’re found to be symptomatic, you will be allowed to proceed to your destination but you will be required to have a COVID-19 test within 48 hours of arrival and submit the results of the test to the authorities. If the test is positive you will have to self-isolate in line with Pakistan’s guidelines.
You may also be required to follow special measures before boarding flights to Pakistan and while on board the aircraft, including the wearing of a face mask.
Pakistan government guidance, including links to the Pass Track App and web-based form is available on their COVID-19 website.
Screening on departure
If you’re leaving Pakistan, you will be screened at the airport for any symptoms of COVID-19. You may also be subject to thermal screening for high temperatures. If you’re free from symptoms you will be allowed to travel. If you’re suspected of having symptoms of COVID-19, including fever, cough and breathing difficulty, you will be subject to a secondary screening by a medical professional. After which, you may be allowed to board if it is assessed that you do not have symptoms, have not been at risk of exposure and do not have a fever. If the secondary screening assesses that you may have COVID-19 you may be asked to self-isolate for 14 days before you can travel. You may also be referred to a medical facility.
