The information on this page covers the most common types of travel and reflects the UK government’s understanding of the rules currently in place. Unless otherwise stated, this information is for travellers using a full ‘British Citizen’ passport.
New entry requirements have applied since 1 January 2021. You may need to do extra things before you travel. On the date you travel, your passport must have both at least 6 months left before it expires, and be less than 10 years old.
The authorities in the country or territory you’re travelling to are responsible for setting and enforcing the rules for entry. If you’re unclear about any aspect of the entry requirements, or you need further reassurance, you’ll need to contact the embassy, high commission or consulate of the country or territory you’re travelling to.
You should also consider checking with your transport provider or travel company to make sure your passport and other travel documents meet their requirements.
If you are travelling to Portugal for work, read the guidance on visas and permits as the rules have changed since 1 January 2021.
Entry rules in response to coronavirus
Entry to Portugal, including the autonomous regions of Madeira and the Azores
There are no restrictions on travelling to Portugal from the EU/EEA or from the UK or USA. See Screening on arrival, below.
If you are travelling from any other non-EU/EEA country, you can only enter for essential purposes, such as to live with immediate family members, or for professional, educational, health or humanitarian reasons.
Check the Portuguese Immigration Service website for further details of the entry requirements.
You need to complete an online passenger locator card before you arrive in Portugal (see also ‘Quarantining on arrival in mainland Portugal’ if you are travelling from the UK’).
Screening on arrival
With the exception of children up to the age of 12, you must have proof of a negative COVID-19 test to travel to or through mainland Portugal. The test can be:
a Nucleic Acid Amplification Test (NAAT), including RT-PCR, taken within 72 hours of travel, or
an Antigen test that meets the performance standards set out in the EU common list of Rapid Antigen Tests, taken within 48 hours of travel.
You must show your test certificate before you board your flight to Portugal. Your airline is likely to deny boarding if you cannot show this at check-in. Check with your airline before you travel.
You will be subject to health screening on arrival. If your temperature is 38ºC or over or you show signs of being unwell, you may be required to take a further COVID-19 test and remain at the airport until you receive your test result.
You should not use the NHS testing service to get a test in order to facilitate your travel to another country. You should arrange to take a private test. Make sure you have a NAAT or an antigen test that meets the requirements. Check your test result identifies the type of test taken and gives your name, date of birth, the date and time the sample was collected and the date of the result.
Quarantining on arrival in mainland Portugal
If you have travelled from the UK to mainland Portugal, you must quarantine for 14 days in the place you are staying or at a place indicated by the Portuguese health authority, unless you can show you have been fully vaccinated with an EU approved COVID-19 vaccine at least 14 days prior to travel. Further details will be set out on this page once confirmed by the Portuguese authorities.
If your journey originated in India, Nepal, South Africa or Brazil, or you have travelled through any of these countries in the last 14 days, you must also quarantine, without exception, for 14 days in the place you are staying or at a place indicated by the Portuguese health authority.
The rules on quarantining apply to passengers arriving by air, as well as by road, rail or sea.
If the quarantining rules apply to you, complete this form.
Transiting Spain and France
Check the requirements for entering and transiting France and Spain on FCDO Travel Advice, before you travel.
Entry to Madeira and Porto Santo
With the exception of children up to, and including, the age of 12, all travellers to Madeira and Porto Santo must:
Complete and submit a traveller questionnaire. If you are travelling with a child aged 12 or under, include their details in your questionnaire
Take a RT-PCR test 72 hours before travel and upload the test result to the traveller questionnaire; or
Obtain a COVID-19 vaccination status certificate. See ‘Demonstrating your COVID-19 Vaccination Status’ below.
Screening on arrival
On arrival in Madeira and Porto Santo, you will be asked to show:
your RT-PCR COVID-19 test certificate if you have not uploaded it with your passenger questionnaire, or
your COVID-19 vaccination status certificate
If you are unable to show one of these certificates and your airline has allowed you to travel, you will have to take a COVID-19 test on arrival and remain in government provided accommodation until the results are known. This will take about 12 hours.
If your test is positive or inconclusive, you will have to repeat the test until the result is negative.
Demonstrating your COVID-19 vaccination status
If you have recovered from COVID-19 in the last 90 days, or have had both doses of the vaccine at least 14 days prior to travel, you will be exempt from showing a RT-PCR test on entry to Madeira and Porto Santo.
If you live in England, the authorities in Madeira and Porto Santo will accept your NHS COVID Pass as evidence of your COVID-19 vaccination status. If you live in Scotland or Wales, the authorities will accept your respective NHS letter.
Your NHS appointment card from vaccination centres is not designed to be used as proof of vaccination and should not be used to demonstrate your vaccine status.
If you have recovered from COVID-19, you will need to show a medical report as evidence of your recovery in the last 90 days before travel.
Check the Madeira Tourist Board’s information for visitors for full details of entry requirements
Entry to the Azores
All travellers, including children, must complete and submit a passenger questionnaire before arriving in the Azores.
With the exception of children up to, and including, the age of 12, all travellers to the Azores must:
take a RT-PCR test within 72 hours of travel and upload the test result on to the passenger questionnaire, or
show a medical report confirming recovery from COVID-19 in the last 90 days, or
from 1 July, hold an EU-issued COVID-19 digital green certificate
Screening on arrival
If you do not hold an EU COVID-19 digital green certificate or a medical report proving you have recovered from COVID-19 in the last 90 days and your airline has allowed you to travel without a RT-PCR COVID-19 test, you will have to take a test on arrival.
If you are staying for more than 7 or 12 days, you will have to repeat the test locally 6 or 13 days respectively after the first test.
Check the Regional government’s website for full details of entry requirements
Regular entry requirements
Visas
Should you meet the criteria of the current COVID-19 restrictions, you should be aware that the rules for travelling or working in European countries changed on 1 January 2021:
you can travel to countries in the Schengen area for up to 90 days in any 180-day period without a visa. This applies if you travel as a tourist, to visit family or friends, to attend business meetings, cultural or sports events, or for short-term studies or training
if you are travelling to Portugal and other Schengen countries without a visa, make sure your whole visit is within the 90-day limit. Visits to Schengen countries within the previous 180 days before you travel count towards your 90 days
to stay longer, to work or study, for business travel or for other reasons, you will need to meet the Portuguese government’s entry requirements. Check the Portuguese Immigration Service (scroll to the bottom of the page) and check with the Portuguese Embassy what type of visa and/or work permit you may need.
if you stay in Portugal with a residence permit or long-stay visa, this does not count towards your 90-day visa-free limit
Any time spent in Portugal or other Schengen countries before 1 January 2021 does not count towards your 90-day visa-free limit.
At Portuguese border control, you will need to use separate lanes from EU, EEA and Swiss citizens when queueing. Your passport may be stamped on entry and exit. You may also need to:
show a return or onward ticket
show you have enough money for your stay
There are separate requirements for those who are resident in Portugal. If you are resident in Portugal, you should carry proof of residence as well as your valid passport when you travel. For further information on these requirements, see our Living in Portugal guide.
Passport validity
Check your passport is valid for travel before you book your trip, and renew your passport if you do not have enough time left on it.
You must have at least 6 months left on an adult or child passport to travel to most countries in Europe (not including Ireland).
If you renewed your current passport before the previous one expired, extra months may have been added to its expiry date. Any extra months on your passport over 10 years may not count towards the 6 months needed.
Travelling with children
Portuguese Border Control (SEF) advise that a child under the age of 18 who is travelling to Portugal alone or without a parent or legal guardian should either:
be met at the airport or point of entry by their parent or guardian, or
carry a letter of authorisation to travel from their parent or guardian. The letter should name the adult in Portugal who will be responsible for them during their stay. There is no legal requirement for the letter to be notarised. However, the onus is on the parent or legal guardian to provide reasonable evidence, including contact details, to confirm that adequate care arrangements are in place.
Resident minors leaving Portugal
A child under the age of 18 who is resident in Portugal must carry a notarised letter of authority from their parent or guardian if they’re travelling out of the country alone or without a parent or legal guardian. The letter of authority can be issued by:
one of the child’s parents (if the parents are married)
the parent the child lives with (if the parents are separated or divorced)
one of the adoptive parents (if the child is adopted) or
the child’s legal guardian
Further information in English, together with a standard form of words (in Portuguese), are available on the Portuguese immigration service website
UK Emergency Travel Documents
UK ETDs are accepted for entry, airside transit and exit from Portugal.
