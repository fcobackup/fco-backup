Entry and borders
See Entry requirements to find out what you will need to do when you arrive in Latvia.
Returning to the UK
When you return, you must follow the rules for entering the UK.
You are responsible for organising your own COVID-19 test, in line with UK government testing requirements. You should contact local authorities for information on testing facilities. You should check that the test result can be provided in the correct format and language.
Be prepared for your plans to change
No travel is risk-free during COVID. Countries may further restrict travel or bring in new rules at short notice, for example due to a new COVID-19 variant. Check with your travel company or airline for any transport changes which may delay your journey home.
If you test positive for COVID-19, you may need to stay where you are until you test negative. You may also need to seek treatment there.
Plan ahead and make sure you:
can access money
understand what your insurance will cover
can make arrangements to extend your stay and be away for longer than planned
Travel in Latvia
The State of Emergency was lifted on 6 April 2021 but some of its measures remain in place. This includes restrictions on catering, retail, entertainment and leisure establishments and limits on the number of people allowed to gather at private and public events both indoors and outdoors. See the Latvian government’s COVID-19 website for full details.
Face masks must be worn:
On public transport;
In taxis by passengers and by the driver, if a special barrier, such as a separating wall, is not installed;
At bus stations, railway stations, ports, and airports;
In shops, pharmacies, post offices, petrol stations, and other indoor points of sale;
In museums, libraries, exhibition halls, concert halls, cinemas and similar places;
In churches;
In any other public place;
In workplaces;
When providing and receiving services;
When attending events where personalised, fixed seating is required.
In medical institutions.
The using of a face mask does not substitute social distancing and disinfection requirements. Wearing a face mask is not obligatory for:
children under 7 years of age;
anyone with certain medical conditions, for example, if a person has difficulty wearing a mask due to a movement disorder or if the person has a mental health disorder.
The fine for not wearing a face mask when required is 50 Euros.
Be aware that the NHS COVID-19 App digital QR code is not verifiable in Latvia, and therefore cannot be used. This means that you may not be allowed to enter venues, such as bars and cafes, or events.

COVID-19 vaccines if you live in Latvia
Wherever possible British nationals should aim to be vaccinated in the country where they live. We will update this page when the Government of Latvia announces new information on the national vaccination programme. You can sign up to get email notifications when this page is updated.
The Latvian national vaccination programme started in January 2021 and is using the AstraZeneca, Pfizer-BioNTech, Janssen (Johnson and Johnson) and Moderna vaccines. The Government of Latvia has stated that British nationals resident in Latvia are eligible for vaccination. Information about the Latvian national COVID-19 vaccination programme is available on the Latvian government’s COVID-19 website.
Find out more, including about vaccines that are authorised in the UK or approved by the World Health Organisation, on the COVID-19 vaccines if you live abroad.
If you’re a British national living in Latvia, you should seek medical advice from your local healthcare provider. Information about COVID-19 vaccines used in the national programme where you live, including regulatory status, should be available from local authorities.
If you receive your COVID-19 vaccination in Latvia, you can get an EU Digital COVID Certificate from the national authorities. The Certificate proves that you have been vaccinated against COVID-19, received a negative test result, or recovered from COVID-19. It will help facilitate your travel within the EU and, in some countries, you can use it to demonstrate your COVID-19 status to businesses and other organisations. For further information visit the European Commission’s EU Digital COVID Certificate page.
