This page reflects the UK government’s understanding of current rules for people travelling on a full ‘British Citizen’ passport, for the most common types of travel.
The authorities in Philippines set and enforce entry rules. For further information contact the embassy, high commission or consulate of the country or territory you’re travelling to. You should also consider checking with your transport provider or travel company to make sure your passport and other travel documents meet their requirements.
Entry rules in response to coronavirus (COVID-19)
Entry to the Philippines
The Philippine Inter-Agency Task Force on the Management of Emerging Infectious Diseases has announced that from 1 May the following passengers shall be permitted entry to the Philippines:
Filipino citizens, including those with an Identification Certificate (IC) as proof of recognition as a Filipino citizen or as proof of retention/reacquisition of Philippine citizenship under RA9225;
Foreign nationals with valid and existing visas at time of entry;
Foreign nationals allowed entry under the Balikbayan Program (RA6768) provided they are nationals from non-visa required countries under EO408: a) Former Filipino citizens, together with their foreign spouses and children regardless of age, who are travelling with them; and b) Filipino citizens’ spouses and children, regardless of age, who are travelling with them
Foreign nationals who are holders of valid and existing Special Resident and Retirees Visa (SRRV)
Foreign nationals who are holders of a valid Section 9(a) visa, provided they present, upon arrival, an entry exemption document issued by the Department of Foreign Affairs.
The Government also announced that form 1 August, foreign spouses, parent(s) and/or children of Filipino citizens who hold valid 9(a) visas will be permitted to enter the country without needing an entry exemption document.
The entry of all foreign nationals shall be subject to the following conditions:
All arriving travellers must undergo 14 days of quarantine on arrival, unless they have been fully vaccinated in the Philippines, where a 7 day quarantine will apply. For those who are not fully vaccinated, the first 10 days of quarantine must be pre-booked in an accredited quarantine hotel/facility. The final 4 days can be completed under home quarantine at their destination (subject to COVID-19 testing at the quarantine hotel/facility on the seventh day from date of arrival).
You are considered fully vaccinated two or more weeks after receiving the second dose in a 2-dose series, or two or more weeks after receiving a single-dose vaccine. A fully vaccinated individual must verify their vaccination certificate prior to departure, and must present it to a Bureau of Quarantine (BOQ) representative for re-verification at the Department of Transportation (DOTr) One-Stop Shop upon arrival in the Philippines. See ‘Demonstrating your COVID-19 vaccination status’
The pre-booked accommodation in a quarantine hotel accredited by the Department of Tourism shall be presented for initial check at the immigration counters. Those who fail to present proof of pre-booked accommodation shall be denied entry and risk being boarded immediately on the next return flight.
Foreign nationals who were cleared for entry but subsequently found to have presented counterfeit or fraudulent pre-booked accommodation upon validation by the Department of Tourism, or those who violate the testing and quarantine protocols of the Department of Health, are subject to deportation.
Demonstrating your COVID-19 vaccination status
Philippines has not yet confirmed that it will accept the UK’s proof of COVID-19 recovery and vaccination record. You should follow the entry rules for unvaccinated people. Your NHS appointment card from vaccination centres is not designed to be used as proof of vaccination
Quarantine requirements
Passengers arriving at any international port of entry may be subjected to mandatory quarantine (for a maximum of 14 days) and/or need to undergo COVID-19 testing either on arrival or on the sixth day of quarantine at the quarantine facility or an assigned laboratory. You’re expected to pay the costs of your quarantine and/or COVID-19 testing.
Visas
As long as you have a valid visa you will be allowed to remain in the country, but will need to observe the local government rules if your present location is under quarantine.
If your tourist visa expired during the ECQ period
You can apply for an extension, without penalty, up to 30 days after the lifting of the Enhanced Community Quarantine (ECQ). If you have overstayed and are trying to leave the country, you can arrange a visa extension at international airports. There may be a standard fee in order to extend the visa but no penalty fee will be applied.
If your visa expired before the ECQ and you have been in the Philippines for more than 12 months
Any fines and penalties will need to be settled in a Bureau of Immigration (BI) sub-port office. The list of BI sub-port offices may be found at the Bureau of Immigration website.
If your visa expired before the ECQ and you have been in the Philippines for less than 12 months
Any fines and penalties may be settled at the airport before your departure.
Emigration Clearance Certificate (ECC)
You should refer to the Bureau of Immigration website to check if you need to pay for an ECC. Instructions and a checklist can also be found at the Bureau of Immigration website. You can settle this at the airport before your departure.
All ACR I cardholders generally need to pay for the ECC upon departure. Those with approved visas but who are yet to receive their ACR I cards can show their receipt at the airport. Foreigners with approved visa applications which have not yet been issued can present their valid passport, DOJ endorsement or Certification from the approving office and receipt.
Travel Pass
From 1 March 2021, anyone holding a visa issued by the Department of Justice (DoJ), the Board of Investments (BoI), the Philippine Retirement Authority (PRA) and the Philippine Economic Zone Authority (PEZA) must obtain a travel pass from the Department that issued their visa in order to leave the Philippines. Anyone holding an ECC issued by the Bureau of Immigration is exempt from this requirement.
Regular entry requirements
Visas
You can enter the Philippines without a visa for an initial period of 30 days. You can also get a tourist visa from the Philippine Embassy before you travel, which will allow an initial 59 day stay.
You can apply to extend your stay at the offices of the Bureau of Immigration. Overstaying without the proper authority is a serious matter and can lead to detention pending payment of outstanding fees and fines and voluntary deportation at your own expense. The British Embassy is aware of cases where visitors trying to extend their stay in the Philippines by regular renewals of tourist visas have been challenged on arrival by Philippine immigration officials. If you wish to stay long-term in the Philippines, make sure you do so in full accordance with Philippine immigration regulations.
Annual Returns for registered foreign nationals
All registered foreign nationals are required to report in person to the Bureau of Immigration and its office within the first sixty (60) days of every calendar year. Please visit the Bureau of Immigration for more details.
Evidence of onward travel
Entry to the Philippines may be refused if you’re unable to produce evidence of return or onward travel - for example an onward or return air ticket.
Passport validity
Your passport should be valid for the proposed duration of your stay. No additional period of validity beyond this is needed.
Departure tax
If you’re leaving the country from Cebu Mactan airport you must pay a departure tax of 850 pesos in local currency or the equivalent in US dollars. There’s no longer a departure tax at Manila airport. This information is subject to change and you should check with local authorities before you travel.
Visiting Boracay Island
If you’re planning to visit Boracay Island, you will need to have evidence of a confirmed booking with an accredited hotel. You should take local advice on documentation and port of entry to the island before you travel.
Living, working or studying in the Philippines
If you intend to live, work, or study in the Philippines you’ll need to have certain UK documents (eg birth certificates, marriage certificates, UK police certificates, school documents) legalised by the FCDO Legalisation Office. These documents do not need to be legalised or authenticated by the Philippine Embassy in London. Alternatively, the requesting local authority may wish to verify the Apostille certificate issued by the Legalisation Office at https://www.gov.uk/verify-apostille.
Children travelling to the Philippines without their parents
Non-Filipino children under the age of 15, who are not travelling with a parent or joining a parent in the Philippines, must apply for a Waiver of Exclusion Ground (WEG) for entry into the Philippines. You can do this at the Philippine Embassy in London or on arrival through the Bureau of Immigration. For either application, you will need to submit the right documentation and pay a fee. For more information and details of payment, visit the Department of Foreign Affairs’ website
If a minor under the age of 15 is travelling to visit a parent they should carry a copy of their parents’ resident visa.
Yellow fever certificate requirements
Check whether you need a yellow fever certificate by visiting the National Travel Health Network and Centre’s TravelHealthPro website.
UK Emergency Travel Documents
UK Emergency Travel Documents (ETDs) are valid for entry, airside transit and exit from the Philippines. If you plan to use an ETD to enter Philippines, the ETD should be valid for 6 months from the date of arrival and have a valid Philippine visa. Check entry requirements with the nearest Philippine Embassy before you travel.
If you apply for an ETD from the British Embassy in Manila, you should get the necessary stamps from the Bureau of Immigration and confirm your Philippine visa is up to date before attempting to leave the Philippines otherwise you’re likely to face problems at the point of departure.
