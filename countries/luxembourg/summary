The Foreign and Commonwealth Office (FCO) advise against all but essential travel to Luxembourg. This is based on the current assessment of COVID-19 risks.
The FCO is not advising those already travelling in Luxembourg to leave at this time. Travellers should follow the advice of the local authorities on how best to protect themselves and others, including any measures that they bring in to control the virus.
If you are returning from Luxembourg you will be required to self-isolate on your return to the UK, but the FCO is not advising you to cut short your visit. You should contact your tour operator or airline if you have any questions about your return journey.
