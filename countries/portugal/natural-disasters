Forest fires
There is a heightened risk of forest fires during the summer months.
Forest fires can occur anywhere in Portugal. In recent years, fires have become more frequent due to drought and high temperatures. Forest fires are highly dangerous and unpredictable. The Portuguese authorities may evacuate areas and close roads for safety reasons.
If you are travelling in Portugal during the summer period, you should familiarise yourself with local safety and emergency procedures, remain vigilant and follow the advice of the Portuguese authorities. Causing a forest fire is treated as a criminal offence in Portugal, even if unintentional.
For information on the risk of forest fires (interactive map), visit the pages on the Portuguese Met Office website for continental Portugal and Madeira. For severe weather warnings, visit the European Meteorological Services website
If you see a wild fire, call the emergency services on 112.
