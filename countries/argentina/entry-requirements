The information on this page covers the most common types of travel and reflects the UK government’s understanding of the rules currently in place. Unless otherwise stated, this information is for travellers using a full ‘British Citizen’ passport.
The authorities in the country or territory you’re travelling to are responsible for setting and enforcing the rules for entry. If you’re unclear about any aspect of the entry requirements, or you need further reassurance, you’ll need to contact the embassy, high commission or consulate of the country or territory you’re travelling to.
You should also consider checking with your transport provider or travel company to make sure your passport and other travel documents meet their requirements.
Restrictions in response to coronavirus
Borders and travel
Argentina’s borders are closed to non-resident foreign nationals. Some exceptions apply to this rule. Exemptions may be granted by the Argentine Migrations Office, such as for non-resident essential workers, family members of Argentine nationals or residents and sportspersons. If you believe you might fall into one of these categories, you must contact the Argentine Migrations Office (Migraciones) to seek approval for you trip.
Until at least midnight 12 March, all travellers who are authorised to enter Argentina must comply with the requirements set out below.
All travellers to Argentina (including those in transit to another country) must fill in an electronic ‘sworn statement’ form within 48 hours of travelling.
All travellers to Argentina (children under 6 are exempted) must present a negative COVID-19 PCR test taken within 72 hours of travelling, unless you are: a crew member, transiting the country through an international airport for less than 24 hours; or have had coronavirus confirmed by a lab test within 90 days of your trip. If you have had coronavirus confirmed by a lab test within 90 days of your trip you don’t need to take a COVID-19 PCR test again. Instead, you will need to show evidence of your diagnosis and a medical certificate issued at least 10 days after being diagnosed, confirming that you have a clean bill of health.
If, for justified reasons, you cannot take a COVID-19 test before travelling, you must present a medical certificate issued within 72 hours of travelling confirming that you do not have COVID-19 related symptoms and you must take a PCR test upon arrival. If this applies to you, check in advance with your airline to ensure you will be allowed to board the aircraft.
All travellers to Argentina must also self-isolate for a total of 10 days counting from the day they took the PCR test, unless you are:
a crew member on duty,
a diplomat on duty,
a sportsperson authorised by the Argentine Migrations Office to enter the country,
a non-resident foreign national authorised by the Argentine Migrations Office to enter the country to carry out essential work, or
in transit in an international airport for less than 24 hours
All non-resident foreign nationals with authorisation from the Argentine Migrations Office to enter the country must have medical insurance with comprehensive cover for coronavirus, including hospitalisation and the costs of self-isolation if required.
Regular entry requirements
Visas
You don’t need a visa to enter Argentina as a tourist unless you’re travelling on an Emergency Travel Document. On presentation of a valid British passport you will normally be given an entry stamp permitting you to stay in the country for a period of up to 90 days.
If you wish to extend your stay for another 90-day period, seek advice from the Argentine Migrations Office.
If you’re travelling to Argentina for any purpose other than tourism, contact the Embassy of the Argentine Republic in London.
Passport validity
Your passport should be valid for the proposed duration of your stay. No additional period of validity beyond this is required.
Proof of onward travel
You may need to provide proof of onward or return travel. You should make all flight reservations before departing for Argentina. Airlines have sometimes refused to board passengers travelling to Argentina without proof of onward travel.
UK Emergency Travel Documents
UK Emergency Travel Documents (ETDs) are accepted for entry, airside transit and exit from Argentina. However, holders of an ETD must apply for the appropriate Argentine visa to enter the country.
