Coronavirus guidance is being updated.
Read the Prime Minister’s statement for the latest information.

Always carry a copy of your passport data page and the page containing your visitors permit or residence permit for South Africa. South African officials may request identification and proof of legal residence at any time.
It’s safer to keep your passport in a hotel safe or another secure location rather than carry it on your person unless you need it for official identification purposes.
Drug-taking and smuggling is an offence.
It is illegal to buy, sell, kill or capture any protected wild animal or trade any of its parts without a permit. South Africa is a signatory to the Convention on International Trade in Endangered Species of Wild Fauna and Flora (CITES) under which there is a ban on trade in ivory and rhino horn. Anyone caught buying or trafficking banned goods will be prosecuted. Check UK customs requirements before buying meat and other products to take back to the UK.
Homosexuality is legal, and the South African authorities have introduced legislation which bans any discrimination on the basis of sexual orientation. See our information and advice page for the LGBT community before you travel.
