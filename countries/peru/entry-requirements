This page has information on travelling to Peru.
This page reflects the UK government’s understanding of current rules for people travelling on a full ‘British Citizen’ passport from the UK, for the most common types of travel.
The authorities in Peru set and enforce entry rules. If you’re unsure how Peru’s entry requirements apply to you, contact its UK embassy, high commission or consulate.
All travellers
Normally, you don’t need a visa to travel if the purpose of the visit is tourism/visit. If you’re travelling for any other purpose, check entry clearance requirements with the Peruvian Consulate-General in London. For information see the Visas section.
Please note that previous requirements relating to Covid-19 vaccinations for entry in Peru were removed on 26 October 2022.
Immigration
If you enter Peru overland from Ecuador, make sure your passport is stamped with a Peruvian entry stamp at the local immigration office. Most people crossing the border with Ecuador enter Peru through Aguas Verdes (Tumbes region) - you may need to ask for directions to the immigration office. If your passport is not stamped at the border with Ecuador, you can have it stamped at the Immigration Office in the city of Tumbes.
If you enter Peru from Bolivia by bus or taxi, make sure your passport is stamped with a Peruvian entry stamp at the immigration office in Desaguadero or Copacabana (Puno region).
Immigration authorities may also not let you leave Peru without a valid exit stamp from the last country you visited.
If you enter Peru without an entry stamp then you’re required by law to apply for a new entry stamp at the nearest immigration office. The immigration authorities will need you to provide your passport and evidence of your entry to Peru, eg air/bus ticket in your name, exit stamp from the last country you visited, and any other documentation they deem necessary. If you’re unable to provide any such evidence you must apply for an exit or expulsion order at the Immigration Office in Lima. You won’t be allowed to leave Peru without this, and you may be prevented from re-entering Peru for the next five to ten years.
The British Embassy can’t intervene in immigration issues. Make sure you get your entry stamp when you arrive in Peru, but if your passport was not stamped on entry into Peru, we can assist you in requesting the entry stamp or the exit order. The sooner you start that process, the better.
Please note that passports are not stamped when you enter Peru through Jorge Chavez inter-national airport in Lima. Your details will be recorded in the immigration database and will be available when you leave Peru.
Check your passport and travel documents before you travel
Check with your travel provider to make sure your passport and other travel documents meet their requirements.
Passport validity
If you are visiting Peru, your passport should be valid for six months from the date you arrive. This is not applicable to foreign residents in Peru holding a valid Peruvian residence card (‘carné de extranjería’), as their passports will not require a minimum validity.
Some airlines have been allowing non-resident passengers to travel to Peru without the six-month passport validity requirement. These passengers have not been allowed to enter Peru upon arrival.
Visas
Normally, you don’t need a visa to travel if the purpose of the visit is tourism/visit. If you’re travelling for any other purpose, check entry clearance requirements with the Peruvian Consulate-General in London.
If you have tourism status in Peru, you’ll need to apply online for a special permit in order to sign any type of contract, eg, purchase of a home, business contracts, at a notary public. For more information, please contact the Peruvian Immigration Office or the Peruvian Consulate-General in London.
On arrival, you’re normally given permission to stay for up to 90 days.
Double check the period of time you’ve been granted. If you overstay, you’ll need to pay a fine. In the worst case scenario you could be held in detention.
While it is not required by the immigration authorities, some airlines require passengers to show proof of onward travel (e.g. an airline ticket) in order to travel to Peru.
Travelling with children
Children under the age of 18 years travelling on a British passport who have resident status in Peru need written permission (Autorización de Viaje Notarial) from the non accompanying parent(s) to leave the country.
This permission is obtained by a notary public in Peru. The letter must mention the proposed destination, the purpose of the trip, the date of departure and the return date.
If unable to obtain a notarial permission, the child will need a judicial written permission (Autorización de Viaje Judicial) issued by a judge. If one of the parents has committed certain crimes, the other parent can request a judicial written permission from the judge. If one of the parents is deceased, the other parent would need to submit the death certificate to a notary public, so that an indefinite notarial permit to travel with the child is issued.
Children who have tourist status do not need these permissions, but immigration officers are free to request them in circumstances considered suspicious by the immigration authorities or if the child has stayed in Peru for over 90 days.
For further information, contact the Peruvian Consulate in London or the Peruvian Immigration Department.
Customs
You can enter Peru with one laptop and two mobiles phones maximum per passenger without paying taxes. You should familiarise yourself with Peruvian immigration or customs procedures before you enter the country. For further details contact the Peruvian Consulate in London.
If you are returning to the UK via Europe, be aware that the customs authorities in European airports frequently confiscate duty free alcohol and other liquids purchased at the duty free shops in Lima airport from passengers in transit.  
UK Emergency Travel Documents
UK Emergency Travel Documents (ETD) are accepted to enter, transit and exit Peru. They need to be valid for six months from the date you arrive. If the ETD is issued in Peru, after receiving the ETD, the holder will have to approach the Peruvian Immigration Office to get a new entry immigration stamp or update passport details, if the previous passport has been lost or stolen. The authorities will request a police report. An appointment needs to be scheduled beforehand. For urgent cases, the process can be done at the airport or immigration points at land borders. You can find more information online.
