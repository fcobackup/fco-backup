Myanmar has suspended all scheduled commercial passenger flights in and out of the country, and sealed off all of its land borders to foreigners. International airports will not re-open commercial inbound flights to Myanmar until 15 May.
We know this is concerning for British people trying to leave Myanmar. The UK government is working closely with airlines, the Myanmar authorities and other governments to make sure options are available for you to return to the UK as soon as possible.
If you cannot leave Myanmar at this time, see advice on staying in Myanmar during coronavirus.
Flights
There remain options for British nationals looking to return to the UK. On 15, 22 and 29 May, Myanmar Airways International (MAI) are running flights from Yangon to Seoul, South Korea. British nationals are able to transit through Seoul for up to 24 hours to connect onto other flights to the UK through other transit hubs using Korean Air, Qatar Airways and KLM Dutch Airlines. No pre-flight medical certificate is required at check-in at Yangon but passengers must show a confirmed onward ticket from Seoul Incheon Airport to their destination.
Details of the MAI flights are on the MAI website, email csc@maiair.com or telephone + 95 1 967 0007. You will need to refer to your travel agent for connecting flights from Seoul. Please check the MAI website and with your travel provider before departure to the airport.
On arrival in Seoul transit passengers will receive a temperature check. Symptomatic individuals will be subject to a COVID-19 test and hospitalisation if found positive. Passengers who do not show symptoms and/or test negative may continue their journey. Airside transit hotels are available in both terminals at Seoul Incheon Airport.

If departure options are available but you cannot afford the travel costs and have exhausted all other options for getting funds, you may be eligible to apply for an emergency loan from the government. This is a last resort option and you would need to repay the loan when you are back in the UK. For more information, you should contact Corporate Travel Management (CTM).
