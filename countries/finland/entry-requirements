This page reflects the UK government’s understanding of current rules for people travelling on a full ‘British Citizen’ passport, for the most common types of travel.
The authorities in Finland set and enforce entry rules. For further information contact their embassy, high commission or consulate. You may also check with your transport provider or travel company to make sure your passport and travel documents meet their requirements.
If you are travelling to Finland for work, read the guidance on visas and permits as the rules have changed since 1 January 2021.
Entry rules in response to coronavirus (COVID-19)
Entry to Finland - fully vaccinated and over 18
If you are travelling to Finland from the UK, you will need:
Proof of being fully vaccinated at least 14 days prior to arrival. See ‘Demonstrating your COVID-19 status’
Entry to Finland – not fully vaccinated
If you are travelling to Finland from the UK, you will need:
Evidence of an essential or compassionate reason for entry to Finland. Visit the Finnish Border Guard website (Section 3.2 – Entry into Finland from countries and regions for which restrictions are still enforced) for full details
If you have received a negative COVID-19 test within 72 hours prior to arrival and/or a first dose of a COVID-19 vaccine received at least 2 weeks prior to arrival, you will need to take a COVID-19 test between days 3-5 in Finland. You should avoid contact with others and remain at home or in your accommodation, until you receive a negative test result
If you have no proof of a vaccination dose or negative COVID-19 test taken prior to arrival, you will need to take a COVID-19 test no later than 24 hours after arrival. You will also need to take a COVID-19 test between days 3-5 in Finland and should self-isolate until you receive a negative test result
Entry to Finland – travelling with under 18 year olds
Young people born in 2006 or later are exempt from Finland’s COVID-19 entry requirements and they do not need to provide proof of vaccination or take a COVID test.
Young people aged 16 and 17 years old who have received one vaccination shot will need to take a COVID-19 test (either PCR or lateral flow test) between days 3 to 5 in Finland. They are recommended to self-isolate whilst waiting for the test result.
Demonstrating your COVID-19 status
Finland will accept the UK’s proof of COVID-19 vaccination record. If you are travelling with a printed PDF proof of vaccination status, it must date from 1 November to ensure that the certificate can be scanned successfully. Proof of recovery from COVID-19 will not be accepted for travellers from the UK demonstrating their COVID-19 status.
Your NHS appointment card from vaccination centres is not designed to be used as proof of vaccination and should not be used to demonstrate your vaccine status.
Transiting Finland
There are no Finnish restrictions on cross-border traffic with other states in the Schengen area for commuter and other essential traffic. Restrictions for other travellers remain in place. See the Finnish Border Guard website for more information.
Passengers are allowed to transit through Helsinki Airport as long as they can verify acceptance at their final destination. Finavia strongly recommend that passengers use facemasks as they travel round airports in Finland, and Finnair have made the wearing of facemasks mandatory for passengers aged seven or over on their flights. Please check your carrier’s requirements before travelling.
Regular entry requirements
Visas
The rules for travelling or working in European countries changed on 1 January 2021:
you can travel to countries in the Schengen area for up to 90 days in any 180-day period without a visa. This applies if you travel as a tourist, to visit family or friends, to attend business meetings, cultural or sports events, or for short-term studies or training
if you are travelling to Finland and other Schengen countries without a visa, make sure your whole visit is within the 90-day limit. Visits to Schengen countries within the previous 180 days before you travel count towards your 90 days
to stay longer, to work or study, for business or for other reasons, you will need to meet the Finnish government’s entry requirements. Check with the Finnish Embassy what type of visa and/or work permit you may need
if you stay in Finland with a residence permit or long-stay visa, this does not count towards your 90-day visa-free limit
Any time you spent in Finland or other Schengen countries before 1 January 2021 does not count towards your 90-day visa-free limit.
At Finnish border control, you may need to queue in separate lanes from EU, EEA and Swiss citizens.
Check your passport is stamped if you enter or exit the Schengen area through Finland as a visitor. Border guards will use passport stamps to check you’re complying with the 90-day visa-free limit for short stays in the Schengen area. If relevant entry or exit stamps are not in your passport, border guards will presume that you have overstayed your visa-free limit.
You can show evidence of when and where you entered or exited the Schengen area, and ask the border guards to add this date and location in your passport. Examples of acceptable evidence include boarding passes and tickets.
You may also need to:
show a return or onward ticket
show you have enough money for your stay
If you are resident in Finland your passport should not be stamped. You should proactively show your proof of residence as well as your valid passport at Finnish border control. For further information, see our Living in Finland guide.
Passport validity
Check your passport is valid for travel before you book your trip, and renew your passport if you do not have enough time left on it.
Make sure your passport is:
valid for at least 3 months after the day you plan to leave Finland, or any other Schengen country
less than 10 years old
The 3 months you need when leaving a country must be within 10 years of the passport issue date.
If you renewed your current passport before the previous one expired, extra months may have been added to its expiry date. Any extra months on your passport over 10 years may not count towards the minimum 3 months needed.
UK Emergency Travel Documents
UK Emergency Travel Documents (ETDs) are accepted for entry, airside transit and exit from Finland.
Entering Finland with children
Minors are permitted to enter Finland with an adult who is not their legal guardian (such as grandparents) but you are advised to carry a free-form letter of consent from the legal guardian(s) including their contact details.
If you have further queries about entry to Finland you can contact the Finnish Border Guard directly on their helpline (+358 295 420 100), open Monday to Friday between 8am and 4pm Finnish local time (GMT +2).
