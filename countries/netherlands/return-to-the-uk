There remain commercial options to return to the UK from the Netherlands.
If you live in the UK and are currently visiting the Netherlands, you’re strongly advised to return now by commercial means. Don’t run the risk of getting stranded. We recommend that UK nationals who wish to leave check the latest travel advice and the most recent updates from their travel operator before travelling.
UK special charter flights will only operate for priority countries where commercial flights are not possible. You should not assume that these flights will become available in countries where commercial routes are operating.
If you are travelling via Belgium or France, please check FCO Travel Advice for those countries.
Flights
KLM, British Airways and Ryanair are operating flights to the UK on a much reduced service. Please check airline websites, including comparison websites for the latest times and information.
