The French Prime Minister has increased France’s national security threat level to “urgent” following a potential terrorist incident in Nice. You should be vigilant at this time and follow the advice of local authorities. On Thursday 29 October, French police are responding to a potential terrorist incident in Nice close to the church of Notre Dame Basilica, where there have been some fatalities and several injured in a knife attack. You should follow police advice to avoid the area whilst police investigations are continuing.
French police are also responding to an incident in the Montfavet district of Avignon, involving a single suspect who threatened police and was shot dead. You should monitor local reports and follow the police advice.
The Foreign, Commonwealth & Development Office (FCDO) advise against all but essential travel to France (including Corsica). This is based on the current assessment of COVID-19 risks. Check separate travel advice pages for overseas territories of France.
There has been a sharp rise in the number of COVID-19 cases in France during recent weeks. The French government has announced a national lockdown from 00:01 on 30 October. As a result, you should remain at home unless you need to go out for an essential reason.
You will need an attestation (or self-certificate) when you do go out. These are available on the Ministry of Interior website, and through France’s digital app ‘Tous anti-Covid.’ Those needing to travel within France, between 30 October and 1 November, to return to their home address, will need to fill out an additional attestation to declare this, which is accessible at the government’s public services website.
The French government will provide further guidance on requirements for crossing the border into France. We will update this page with further details as soon as possible.
The FCDO is not advising those already travelling in France to leave at this time. You should follow the advice of the local authorities on how best to protect yourself and others, including any measures that they bring in to control the virus. Contact your travel operator if you have any questions about your return journey.
If you are returning to the UK from France on or after 15 August, you will need to self-isolate on your return, unless you are exempt.

Due to ongoing threats to France by Islamist terrorist groups, and recent French military intervention against Daesh (formerly referred to as ISIL), the French government has warned the public to be especially vigilant and has reinforced its security measures.
