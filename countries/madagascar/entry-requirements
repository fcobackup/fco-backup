This page reflects the UK government’s understanding of current rules for people travelling on a full ‘British Citizen’ passport, for the most common types of travel.
The authorities in Madagascar set and enforce entry rules. For further information contact the embassy, high commission or consulate of the country or territory you’re travelling to. You should also consider checking with your transport provider or travel company to make sure your passport and other travel documents meet their requirements.
Entry rules in response to coronavirus (COVID-19)
Madagascar’s borders are open to limited regional flights and limited commercial and charter flights from Europe. Private flights require advance permissions from the Presidency and Prime Minister’s office. COVID-19 vaccination is not a requirement for entry.
To enter Madagascar you will need to provide proof of a negative PCR test taken within 72 hours of travel. You should not use the NHS testing service to get a test in order to facilitate your travel to another country. You should arrange to take a private test.
You will also be required to make an advance hotel booking for two nights and pay in advance for at least one night for quarantine after your arrival, and take a COVID-19 test on arrival at Ivato International Airport. The €25 cost of the test can be paid in cash or by bank card on arrival. If the test is negative, you will be able to leave quarantine within 24-48hrs. If the test is positive, you will need to quarantine for a further 14 days and may be required to go to a state-mandated facility for treatment. You will be asked to complete a declaration to confirm you will abide by quarantine until the result of your arrival test, and a locator form to indicate your movements after quarantine.
See the Ministry of Tourism website (in French) for the most up to date entry information, relevant forms and FAQs.
Regular entry requirements
Visas
You can buy a 30, 60 or 90-day tourist visa on arrival at the airport in cash using US$, Euros, or Malagasy Ariary.
Alternatively, you can apply for an e-visa on the official Malagasy e-visa website before you travel.
You will be asked for evidence of onward or return travel at check-in and on arrival in Madagascar.
Make sure an entry stamp is recorded in your passport, and that your visa is valid for the period and purpose of your journey. A tourist visa cannot be extended beyond 90 days. Overstaying may lead to detention and deportation.

Your passport must have at least 6 months’ validity remaining on your date of entry into Madagascar. You should have at least 2 blank pages in your passport on arrival.
