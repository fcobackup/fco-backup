This page reflects the UK government’s understanding of current rules for people travelling on a full ‘British Citizen’ passport, for the most common types of travel.
The authorities in Fiji set and enforce entry rules. For further information contact the embassy, high commission or consulate of the country or territory you’re travelling to. You should also consider checking with your transport provider or travel company to make sure your passport and other travel documents meet their requirements.
Entry rules in response to coronavirus (COVID-19)
Fiji’s international border reopened on 1 December 2021. From 1 May 2022, fully vaccinated visitors to Fiji will no longer be required to produce a pre-arrival negative COVID-19 test prior to entry. Within 72 hours of arrival into Fiji, travellers 12 years and above must take an approved rapid antigen test at their hotel or testing facility. The Fijian Government website has more information on entry conditions. You should carefully check requirements relating your country of departure, transit points and airline or other method of transport.
Only fully vaccinated travellers are able to enter Fiji and the vaccine must be of a type approved by the Fijian authorities. You will also need to ensure you meet testing and vaccination requirements of your airline and any countries transited on route to Fiji.
All foreign passport holders must have medical travel insurance with international cover for COVID-19. Valid permit holders are exempt from this requirement but must instead provide a supporting letter from their sponsor or employer confirming they will meet all COVID-19 related costs, including isolation if required.
You may transit Nadi Airport if you have a valid ticket, negative COVID-19 test and are fully vaccinated.
These COVID-19 restrictions are in addition to the regular entry requirements set out below.
Regular entry requirements
Visas
Visas are not needed for visits of up to 4 months. You must have an onward or return ticket and a valid visa for the next country you’re travelling to. If you’re visiting Fiji on business you will be granted a stay for 14 days on arrival.
If you plan to stay for longer than 4 months, you will need to apply for a visa from the Fiji High Commission in London.
Yachts can only enter Fiji through Suva, Lautoka, Savusavu and Levuka. For other ports, such as Nadi/Denarau, prior arrangement with the Fijian Authorities is needed.
Passport validity
Your passport should have at least 6 months’ validity remaining on your date of entry into Fiji.
UK Emergency Travel Documents
UK Emergency Travel Documents are valid for entry, airside transit and exit from Fiji.
Yellow fever certificate requirements
Check whether you need a yellow fever certificate by visiting the National Travel Health Network and Centre’s TravelHealthPro website.
Customs requirements
Fiji customs enforce strict quarantine regulations and x-ray all in-bound luggage at Nadi airport. Most perishable foodstuffs will be confiscated on arrival, unless arriving from a country with quarantine agreements with Fiji.
You must declare currency amounts in excess of FJ$10,000.
Travelling with children
Some countries need documentary evidence of parental responsibility before allowing lone parents to enter the country or, in some cases, before permitting the children to leave the country.
In the case of Fiji, no such documentation is needed for visitors. But it is needed for those applying for work and/or residency permits. For further information contact the Fiji High Commission in London.
