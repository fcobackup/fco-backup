Warning
FCDO advises against all travel to parts of Nigeria.

This section has safety advice for regions of Nigeria. It only covers regions where FCDO has specific advice. 
Insecurity is increasing across Nigeria. Kidnapping, violent crime, and intercommunal violence occur throughout all regions of Nigeria. You should also read FCDO’s overall travel advice and safety and security advice.
North East Nigeria
FCDO advises against all travel to Borno State, Yobe State, Adamawa State and Gombe State.
FCDO advises against all but essential travel to Bauchi and Taraba states.
There is a high and increasing threat from Boko Haram or Islamic State West Africa, particularly around transport hubs, religious areas and large gatherings. Humanitarian personnel, vehicles, supplies and infrastructure can be targeted by terrorists and criminals.
There is a high threat of kidnap and violent attacks. Intercommunal tensions can lead to outbreaks of violence. During the dry season when roads are more easily accessible this risk is heightened. 
Regular military operations are ongoing in Adamawa, Borno and Yobe states. There is a risk of retaliatory attacks.
If you’re in the north-east against FCDO advice, keep in touch with the authorities and the wider community on the security situation. Make sure your safety procedures and contingency plans are up to date. If you are working, make sure you have confidence in your employer’s ability to extract you in the event of any emergency.
If in Maiduguri, be aware that if security were to deteriorate any further, it could be extremely difficult for you to leave the city. FCDO does not advise travelling by road in this area. 
North West Nigeria
FCDO advises against all travel to Kaduna State, Katsina State and Zamfara State.
FCDO advises against all but essential travel to Kano State, Jigawa State, and Sokoto State, and within 20km of the border with Niger in Kebbi State.
Banditry and violent attacks are frequent and there is a high threat of kidnap. Incidents of intercommunal violence occur and trains are vulnerable to attack. If you’re travelling in the north-west against FCDO advice, be extremely cautious and monitor local media.
North Central Nigeria and the Federal Capital Territory, including Abuja
FCDO advises against all but essential travel to Niger, Kogi, and Plateau states due to criminal and militant activity and incidents of intercommunal violence.
The outer suburbs of Abuja, within the Federal Capital Territory are prone to varying levels of violence, and the safety of daily activity is unpredictable. Violent crime, often involving firearms, has increased and spread from the outer suburbs to more central, wealthier areas of the city.
The risk of terrorism in Abuja and the Federal Capital Territory area has increased. Islamic State West Africa (ISWA) has claimed responsibility for attacks. In one attack on Kuje Prison in Abuja in 2022, an unknown number of prisoners escaped, including suspected terrorists. The risk is present across the Federal Capital Territory, including Abuja, particularly in the border areas.
Be cautious when travelling in the Federal Capital Territory. Take advice from trusted contacts and be prepared to cancel or limit your plans.
There are regular protests in Abuja, which can turn violent. Monitor local media, avoid demonstrations and large gatherings and follow instructions from local police and security forces.
South East and South South Nigeria
FCDO advises against all travel to the riverine areas (the river and swamp locations accessible by boat, but not by road) of Delta, Bayelsa, Rivers, Akwa Ibom and Cross River states.
FCDO advises against all but essential travel to Abia, Anambra and Imo states and non-riverine areas of Delta, Bayelsa and Rivers states.
Militant groups are active across the Niger Delta region and have carried out a number of attacks on oil and gas infrastructure. There’s a high risk of armed robbery, criminality and kidnap in the Niger Delta region.
There have been a number of attacks and targeted killings. Some attacks have been on isolated roads and in remote locations, but they could occur in metropolitan areas. There is also a heightened risk of indiscriminate attacks on police and security infrastructure, which may affect bystanders. A number of states have imposed curfews. Be cautious about travelling in remote areas at night and follow local news and information outlets.
Secessionist groups are active in the south-east and attacks and violent clashes often occur with the military and other security forces. Although foreign nationals are not normally targeted, there is a risk you could be caught in an attack. Monitor local government announcements and media reporting.
South West Nigeria
Violent crime such as mugging, kidnapping, car-jacking and armed robberies are common, particularly in the larger cities . Large-scale attacks are rare, but Islamic State West Africa claimed 2 attacks in 2022. Intercommunal violence is common. While these attacks have not targeted foreign nationals, try to avoid being caught up in such incidents.
Be alert and take any security advice given by your hotel, employer or your hosts.
Nigeria borders
The Nigeria-Niger land border has been closed by the Nigerian authorities in response to the political situation in Niger. Additional checks are in place at the Nigeria-Benin, Nigeria-Niger and Nigeria-Cameroon land borders. If you’re planning to make a land crossing from Nigeria, check with the local authorities for the latest information before travelling.
