This page has information on travelling to Tunisia.
This page reflects the UK government’s understanding of current rules for people travelling on a full ‘British Citizen’ passport from the UK, for the most common types of travel.
The authorities in Tunisia set and enforce entry rules. If you’re unsure how Tunisia’s entry requirements apply to you, contact its UK embassy, high commission or consulate
All travellers
Once you arrive in Tunisia, you might be subject to a random rapid lateral flow or PCR test. If you test positive, you will need to self-isolate at your own accommodation for five days. If your symptoms persist, you will need to self-isolate for another two days.
On arrival in Tunisia, you must share your contact details and travel information with authorities.
For visits lasting less than 90 days, British passport holders do not need a visa to enter Tunisia. You must be able to demonstrate that you have enough money to cover the cost of your stay, and provide evidence of your return ticket for leaving the country.
See Visas for more information.
Officially, evidence of a hotel reservation is required to enter the country, however this policy is not applied uniformly. In the majority of cases, if asked, an explanation of alternative accommodation arrangements will be accepted.
A small number of visitors have been refused entry to Tunisia, or delayed, for not being able to provide sufficient evidence of a hotel reservation. If you are refused entry to Tunisia, the Embassy will not be able to intervene as entry to the country is at the discretion of the Tunisian authorities.
Should you need assistance with matters other than this, you can call the consular team on +216 71 108 700.
If you’re fully vaccinated
If you’re fully vaccinated, you can enter Tunisia without needing to test or quarantine.
Proof of vaccination status
Tunisia will accept the UK’s proof of COVID-19 recovery and vaccination record and proof of COVID-19 vaccination issued in the Crown Dependencies.
At least 28 days must have passed since your dose of the Janssen vaccine. For all other vaccines, at least seven days must have passed since your second dose.
Your NHS appointment card from vaccination centres is not designed to be used as proof of vaccination and should not be used to demonstrate your vaccine status.
If you’re not fully vaccinated
If you’re not fully vaccinated and 18 years old or over, you’ll need to show proof of a negative PCR test (taken no more than 48 hours before entry) or rapid lateral flow test (taken no more than 24 hours before entry) when entering Tunisia. This test result must include the date it was taken, and a QR code. See information on getting a test before entry.
If you’re not fully vaccinated and aged 17 and under, you do not need to take a test.
If you’ve had COVID-19 in the past year
There are no specific requirements for travellers who have had COVID-19 in the past year.
Children and young people
There are no specific requirements for children and young people.
If you’re transiting through Tunisia
Transiting is when you pass through one country on the way to your final destination.
If you are transiting through Tunisia on your way to another country and staying in the airport (airside) you should follow the full entry requirements (listed above).
If you are transiting through Tunisia on your way to another country and will be passing through immigration (sometimes known as a layover), for example to stay in a hotel for a flight the next day, you should follow the full entry requirements (listed above).
Exemptions
There are no exemptions to Tunisia’s entry requirements
Check your passport and travel documents before you travel
Passport validity
If you are visiting Tunisia, your passport should be valid for the full duration of your stay. You don’t need any additional period of validity beyond this.
Dual British-Tunisian nationals should enter and leave Tunisia on their Tunisian passports.
Check with your travel provider to make sure your passport and other travel documents meet their requirements.
Visas
For visits lasting less than 90 days, British passport holders do not need a visa to enter Tunisia.
For stays longer than 90 days, you will need a visa. You should contact the Tunisian Embassy in London for information on how to apply: https://www.diplomatie.gov.tn/en/nc/mission/etranger/ambassade-de-tunisie-a-londres-royaume-uni/
If you stay in Tunisia for longer than the authorised period, you will have to pay a fine. This rule may not apply if you are vulnerable and current circumstances oblige you to remain in the country.
UK Emergency Travel Documents
Tunisian authorities accept UK ETDs for entry to and exit from Tunisia. If you’re leaving Tunisia on an ETD, make sure you have a copy of the police report about the loss/theft of your full validity passport to present to the Immigration Officer.
