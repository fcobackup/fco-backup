Travel in Greece
It is mandatory to wear face-masks on public transport (including flights and ferries), at airports and in taxis.
Travel in a private car or a taxi is limited to a maximum of 3 adult passengers per vehicle, in addition to the driver. Any children in the vehicle do not count towards this limit. When travelling in a taxi, all passengers must wear face-masks.
Travel to and from islands
You may travel throughout Greece, including to the islands.
If you are travelling via ferry, you will need to complete a health questionnaire and hand it to the ferry operator before boarding. The necessary forms will be provided by the operator: you should contact them directly if you need further information. Temperature checks may also be carried out before boarding; and it is obligatory to wear masks on all ferries, including on open air decks, where capacity is limited to allow for social distancing. No celebrations are allowed on board ferries.
If you are travelling by internal (domestic) flights, you are also required to wear masks throughout the journey. Specific measures relating to check-in, baggage allowances and other details are in place to reduce the spread of coronavirus. You should check with your operator directly for further detail.
Since 1 August, cruise ships can dock at Piraeus, Rhodes, Heraklion, Volos, Corfu and Katakolo. After their first docking, the ships may visit any other Greek port on their itinerary. Rules will be kept under review.
Travel by private sailboats (and yachts) is now permitted within Greece. If your vessel is arriving in Greece from another country, you must comply with specific requirements upon your first landing in Greece. No passengers are permitted on the vessel, except for the crew. Upon arrival, you must present to harbour authorities, who will require the completion of a health declaration, and mandatory testing (to be paid for by the occupants of each vessel).
Changes to what is open or permitted, including international travel options, are subject to change and may occur at short notice. Keep up to date with the latest information and advice from your travel contact or business partners, as well as the sources in this travel advice.
You can read the Greek authorities’ plans for future changes here (in Greek). These plans remain subject to change, and you should monitor the website regularly for updates.
Public spaces and services
Shops, bars and restaurants are open, as are other service providers like driving schools and private tuition centres (‘frontisteria’). Relevant public health regulations apply when visiting shops, bars, restaurants and other public spaces, including limits on the number of customers per square metre.
Face masks are also obligatory in public indoor spaces, including medical facilities, lifts, staircases and any enclosed venue providing goods or services (including supermarkets, grocery stores, bakeries, cafes, banks, government and utility providers’ offices, retail shops, barber shops, hairdressers and beauty parlours and places of worship). There are exemptions for dining areas and for medical reasons. No standing customers are allowed in entertainment venues (clubs, live music venues, bars, restaurants, cafes).
You should comply with these requirements, and all other advice of the Greek authorities
Universities are closed, but schools and nurseries are open.
Accommodation
All hotels are permitted to open. AirBnB accommodation is also available.
Healthcare in Greece
If you think you have symptoms, including a fever or respiratory difficulties such as shortness of breath or a cough, you should avoid visiting local health facilities, but contact a doctor remotely to see whether a test is recommended. There is likely to be a cost associated with this, for call out, examination and testing, which you will have to pay.
If you are staying in a hotel or resort, your accommodation provider will have a list of private doctors that they will call to assess your symptoms and conduct a COVID-19 test.
If you have arranged your own accommodation you can find details of English speaking, private doctors on our list of healthcare providers.
If you are tested and the result is positive, the Greek authorities will ask you to quarantine or self-isolate. You may be able to remain in your existing accommodation, or be required to transfer into a state hospital or other government-provided accommodation. All costs related to transfer to alternative accommodation and treatment at state healthcare facilities will be covered by the Greek Government.
