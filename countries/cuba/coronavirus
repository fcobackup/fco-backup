Everyone should comply with the measures put in place in Cuba to limit the spread of coronavirus (COVID-19). On 11 June, the Government set out three recovery phases that will gradually lift the measures in place. Havana was in phase one from 3 July. However, this has ended, and stricter measures have been re-introduced. Mayabeque and Artemisa Provinces are in phase two, and the Municipality of Bauta within Artemisa Province is back to phase 1. All other Provinces are in phase 3 since July.

Entry and borders
See Entry requirements to find out what you will need to do when you arrive in Cuba.
During the period of Cuban government coronavirus measures, visa extension requirements have been suspended while immigration offices have had limited services. If you are still in Cuba and your visa has expired or will expire while flights are suspended, you should keep in touch with the local immigration office; there is one in each municipality. All types of visas that have expired during Coronavirus measures will remain valid for 30 days after the suspension on commercial flights is lifted (they are currently suspended until 1 September 2020).
Havana airport is open for humanitarian and repatriation flights. Only Cuban nationals and foreign nationals with permanent residency permits can enter, subject to clearance, on those flights. Commercial flights are suspended until 1 September 2020 (subject to review).
From 1 July, Tourists can enter Cuba on international charter flights arriving directly into these destinations: Cayo Coco, Cayo Cruz or Cayo Guillermo (served by Jardines del Rey airport); Cayo Santa Maria (flying into Santa Clara airport), or Cayo Largo del Sur. Passengers may only bring one check-in bag each, up to a maximum of 32kgs.
Foreign boats (yachts, etc) are not allowed in Cuban waters yet.
If you have dual British and Cuban nationality, you are subject to Cuban measures and should check your immigration status to clarify if you can leave Cuba while current travel restrictions are in place (and when flights resume). If you need permission to leave, you should get this from the immigration office in Havana; permission cannot be given at the airport.
Travel in Cuba
There is a difference in travel and transport services for Provinces in different phases of the virus management or recovery plan.
In Havana, all public transport and private taxi services have been suspended again (from 9 August). Private cars are allowed for transport but for specific reasons such as shopping, essential work, medical etc.
There are limited transport services in Mayabeque and Artemisa Provinces (in phase two) and less in Bauta Municipality in Artemisa Province (phase one), with limited passenger numbers allowed.
There are no transport services allowed between Havana, or Bauta Municipality with the other Provinces or Municipalities. There may be police check points in and out of Havana and Bauta.
Car rental is not allowed in Havana, Mayabeque or Artemisa.
There are taxis running to and from Havana airport.
There will not be any train services until Havana is in phase 2.
For all other Provinces in phase three (i.e. not Havana, Artemisa or Mayabeque) the transport services within the Provinces have restarted as has inter-provincial travel between those Provinces. Only passengers with tickets are allowed to enter the bus stations.
Face masks must be worn at all times when travelling on buses and in taxis. Tourists arriving on charter flights to the Cayos (see Entry and Borders above) will be transported to their resort by bus and must wear a mask during the transfer. Tourists in the five Cayos can rent cars but they cannot leave the Cayo.
Accommodation
International tourists are allowed into the Hotels in the five Cayos, arriving on international charter flights (see Entry and Borders above).
Hotels and guest houses are starting to reopen for Cubans and foreign residents of Cuba (known as ‘national tourism’) but to a limited occupancy (between 30 and 50%). Guests going to hotels must have a PCR test 48 hours in advance. Guests may have to wear face masks in some hotel facilities. Medical teams may visit to check on health of guests, including taking their temperature.
Campsites are also starting to reopen to a limited capacity.
Hotels must limit the numbers of people using facilities at any one time, especially swimming pools and elevators.
Public spaces and services
Wearing a face mask in public is compulsory as is social distancing of a minimum of one metre.
Shops in all Provinces can open but must limit the number of customers within the shop. This means there are queues to enter shops.
Cafés, bars and restaurants in Havana are only open for take away service. In other provinces, they may re-open but must limit the opening hours, the number of customers and separate tables by 1.5 metres. No dancing is allowed during phase one or phase two of the recovery plan.
The re-opening measures below apply to all Provinces except Havana, where stricter measures have been re-introduced from 9 August and such venues are closed again:
Social clubs, gyms, museums, etc can re-open to a limited capacity and visitors must observe social distancing.
Swimming pools can open to a limited capacity and to restricted visit times, to allow cleaning for the next opening times.
Beaches are open but limited numbers of people are allowed during phase one and phase two. There will be personnel at the beaches to manage access.
Churches are also able to re-open for services.
Provinces in Phase three of the recovery plan (currently all except Havana, Artemis and Mayabeque), can start to re-open theatres and cinemas and hold some sporting events.
Healthcare in Cuba
If you think you have COVID-19 symptoms, you should contact a local clinic straight away. If you are staying in a hotel, the hotel reception will be able to contact them for you.
If you are staying in private home or a hotel, you are likely to receive regular home checks by medical representatives (known as “pesquisia”). The Hotels in the Cayos for International tourists have medical teams 24/7.
