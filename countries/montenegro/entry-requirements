This information is for people travelling on a full ‘British citizen’ passport from the UK. It is based on the UK government’s understanding of the current rules for the most common types of travel.
The authorities in Montenegro set and enforce entry rules. If you’re not sure how these requirements apply to you, contact the Montenegrin Embassy in the UK.
The authorities may close land border crossings at short notice.     
Passport validity requirements
To enter Montenegro, your passport must:
have been issued less than 10 years before the date you enter Montenegro – if you renewed your passport before 1 October 2018, it may have a date of issue that is more than 10 years ago
have an ‘expiry date’ at least 3 months after the day you plan to leave
Check with your travel provider that your passport and other travel documents meet requirements. Renew your passport if you need to.
You will be denied entry if you do not have a valid travel document or try to use a passport that has been reported lost or stolen.
Visa requirements
You can visit Montenegro without a visa for up to 90 days in any 180-day period. This applies if you travel:
as a tourist
to visit family or friends
to attend business meetings, cultural or sports events
for short-term studies or training
If you are travelling to Montenegro without a visa, make sure your whole visit is within the 90-day limit. Visits to Montenegro within the previous 180 days before you travel count towards your 90 days.
Montenegro is not part of the Schengen area, so: 
visits to Montenegro do not count towards your 90-day visa-free limit in the Schengen area
visits to other EU or Schengen countries do not count towards your 90-day visa-free limit in Montenegro
Make sure you get your passport stamped on entry and exit. 
The dated entry stamp helps avoid any problems about the length of your stay in the country.
Staying longer than 90 days in a 180-day period 
To stay longer than 90 days, you must meet the Montenegrin government’s entry requirements. Check which type of visa or work permit you may need with the Montenegrin Embassy in the UK in advance of your arrival to Montenegro.
