The presence of violent extremist groups in northern Mali continues to fuel mounting insecurity across the Sahel. AQ-M and its network of Mali based affiliates remain the dominant force within this region. 2016 witnessed an increase in attacks, which is likely to continue through 2017 as the group remains intent on demonstrating capability and increasing influence across the region. This has been demonstrated by the recent merger of AQ-M Sahel, Ansar al-Dine and al-Murabitun into the new group “Jamaat Nusrat al-Islam wal Muslimeen”. The threat to western interests in the region remains.
