This page reflects the UK government’s understanding of current rules for people travelling on a full ‘British Citizen’ passport, for the most common types of travel.
The authorities in Argentina set and enforce entry rules. For further information contact the embassy, high commission or consulate of the country or territory you’re travelling to. You should also consider checking with your transport provider or travel company to make sure your passport and other travel documents meet their requirements.
Restrictions in response to coronavirus
Borders and travel
Argentina’s borders are closed to non-resident foreign nationals. Some exceptions apply to this rule. Exemptions based on humanitarian grounds may be granted by the Argentine Migrations Office. If you believe you might fall into this category, you must contact the Argentine Migrations Office (Migraciones) to seek approval for your trip.
Direct family members of Argentine nationals and of residents of Argentina can be allowed into the country for a temporary visit (for a permanent stay you must apply for a visa at your nearest Argentine Consulate). If this applies to you, you will have to show a copy of your Argentine/resident relative’s ID (DNI) and a legalised (apostilled) birth or marriage certificate, or common law partnership documentation, to the airline or Buquebus authorities before boarding and will have to pay a fee of ARS 9000 at the point of entry.
Ezeiza International Airport, San Fernando Airport, Jorge Newbery Airport and Buquebus Port Terminal are the only approved entry points to Argentina.
All travellers who are authorised to enter Argentina must comply with the requirements set out below.
All travellers to Argentina (including those in transit to another country) must fill in an electronic ‘sworn statement’ form within 48 hours of travelling.
All travellers to Argentina (children under 6 are exempted) must present a negative COVID-19 PCR test taken within 72 hours of travelling, unless you are: a crew member, transiting the country through an international airport for less than 24 hours; or have had coronavirus confirmed by a lab test within 90 days of your trip. If you have had coronavirus confirmed by a lab test within 90 days of your trip you don’t need to take a COVID-19 PCR test again. Instead, you will need to show evidence of your diagnosis and a medical certificate issued at least 10 days after being diagnosed, confirming that you have a clean bill of health.
All travellers to Argentina must take a COVID-19 test on arrival. If the test is positive, you will have to take a second test to determine the strain you’re carrying. Regardless of whether the first test is positive or negative you must self-isolate for 7 days. The local authority will determine whether you must isolate at the place you are staying or at a designated quarantine hotel. You will have to take a further test on the 7th day to end your quarantine. You must pay for all tests and costs related to your managed quarantine.
All non-resident foreign nationals with authorisation from the Argentine Migrations Office to enter the country must have medical insurance with comprehensive cover for coronavirus, including hospitalisation and the costs of self-isolation if required.
Visas
The 90-day permission to visit Argentina for those who entered the country before 17 March 2020 and whose original 90 days expired after 17 March 2020, is no longer being automatically extended. If you have any questions about your immigration status, you should contact the Argentine Migrations Office (Migraciones).
Regular entry requirements
Visas
You don’t need a visa to enter Argentina as a tourist unless you’re travelling on an Emergency Travel Document. On presentation of a valid British passport you will normally be given an entry stamp permitting you to stay in the country for a period of up to 90 days.
If you wish to extend your stay for another 90-day period, seek advice from the Argentine Migrations Office.
If you’re travelling to Argentina for any purpose other than tourism, contact the Embassy of the Argentine Republic in London.
Passport validity
Your passport should be valid for the proposed duration of your stay. No additional period of validity beyond this is required.
Proof of onward travel
You may need to provide proof of onward or return travel. You should make all flight reservations before departing for Argentina. Airlines have sometimes refused to board passengers travelling to Argentina without proof of onward travel.
UK Emergency Travel Documents
UK Emergency Travel Documents (ETDs) are accepted for entry, airside transit and exit from Argentina. However, holders of an ETD must apply for the appropriate Argentine visa to enter the country.
For entry into Argentina, your ETD should be valid for the proposed duration of your stay. No additional period of validity beyond this is required.
