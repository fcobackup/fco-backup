The information on this page covers the most common types of travel and reflects the UK government’s understanding of the rules currently in place. Unless otherwise stated, this information is for travellers using a full ‘British Citizen’ passport.
The authorities in the country or territory you’re travelling to are responsible for setting and enforcing the rules for entry. If you’re unclear about any aspect of the entry requirements, or you need further reassurance, you’ll need to contact the embassy, high commission or consulate of the country or territory you’re travelling to.
You should also consider checking with your transport provider or travel company to make sure your passport and other travel documents meet their requirements.
Entry rules in response to coronavirus (COVID-19)
Entry to Greece
British nationals are not affected by the European Union’s measures to close EU borders to non-EU country nationals. If you’re a British national, you can still enter Greece, but you must comply with the Greek authorities’ requirements, including on testing and self-isolation.
Greece’s borders with most neighbouring countries (Turkey, Albania and North Macedonia) are closed to passenger traffic. The border with Bulgaria is open.
You must wear a face mask at all times when on an aeroplane or ferry travelling to or from Greece; and whilst at airports.
Passenger Locator Form
You must complete an online Passenger Locator Form (PLF) at least 24 hours before your arrival in Greece. The form is in English.
Once you have completed the form, you will receive an email acknowledgement. In a separate email, you will also receive a QR code. This code is likely to be sent up to 24 hours before you travel, regardless of how early you fill in your form. When you receive your code, make sure you either print it, or can show it on your mobile phone.
You will need to show your code to the Greek authorities on your arrival in Greece. Some airlines may also ask you to show your code before you board your flight to Greece- you should contact the airline directly if you need any further information.
Testing and quarantine on arrival
When you arrive in Greece, the Greek authorities will scan your QR code and may require you to undergo testing for coronavirus, as part of health screening. The Greek authorities’ instructions will differ according to whether you arrive by land, sea or air. Check the requirements that will apply to you on the PLF form page.
Any passenger entering Greece may be asked to undergo a test, but you are more likely to be asked if you have arrived from a country outside of the EU (including the UK), either directly or via indirect flights.
If you live permanently within the EU, or have been in another EU country for some time before travelling on to Greece, you may be asked to prove that you have not recently travelled from or through the UK.
If you are required to take a test on arrival:
you will then need to self-isolate at the address you gave on your Passenger Locator Form while you await the results of your test. Test results are expected to become available within 24 hours
the Greek authorities will contact you to provide your test results and give further instructions (e.g. whether you are free to leave your accommodation, or must self-isolate for a longer period)
if your test result is negative, you will no longer need to self-isolate
if your test result is positive, the Greek authorities are likely to ask you to self-isolate for 14 days. Depending on the nature of your accommodation (e.g. whether you’re staying in a hotel, or in a private property like a house or villa), you may be required to move to government-provided accommodation. If you’re asked to move, the costs of transfer and your new accommodation will be paid by the Greek authorities
If you are not required to take a test on arrival, you will not be required to self-isolate.
You must comply with all instructions given by the Greek authorities. Failure to do so may result in you being refused permission to enter Greece and/or legal enforcement.
You should also be aware that if other passengers on your flight subsequently test positive, you may be subject to further quarantine/self isolation requirements. These will be mandatory and you should comply with the Greek authorities’ requirements.
Regular entry requirements
Passport validity
Your passport should be valid for the proposed duration of your stay; you do not need any additional period of validity on your passport beyond this.

The rules on travel will stay the same until 31 December 2020.
Travelling with medication
According to Greek law, a visitor can bring up to 5 different prescribed medicines for personal use, with a maximum of 2 boxes of each medicine.
Some prescribed and over-the-counter medicines available in the UK, including medication containing codeine, are considered controlled substances in Greece. A doctor’s prescription is required in all cases, which should mention your details, the types of medicine and the condition treated. On arrival, Greek Customs may in some cases require you to obtain permission from the Greek National Organisation of Medicines - if you need to carry more than the permitted number of boxes, for example. The National Organisation of Medicines examines these requests on a case by case basis.
For more information on controlled medicines, contact the Greek National Organisation of Medicines (telephone: 0030 213 2040 285 / 307 / 225, open Monday to Friday, 12pm to 3pm Greece time, or email: relation@eof.gr).
UK Emergency Travel Documents
UK Emergency Travel Documents are valid for entry, airside transit and exit from Greece.
