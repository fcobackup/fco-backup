The information on this page covers the most common types of travel and reflects the UK government’s understanding of the rules currently in place. Unless otherwise stated, this information is for travellers using a full ‘British Citizen’ passport.
The authorities in the country or territory you’re travelling to are responsible for setting and enforcing the rules for entry. If you’re unclear about any aspect of the entry requirements, or you need further reassurance, you’ll need to contact the embassy, high commission or consulate of the country or territory you’re travelling to.
You should also consider checking with your transport provider or travel company to make sure your passport and other travel documents meet their requirements.
Travelling to Azerbaijan
Options for travelling to Azerbaijan are extremely limited, and our current understanding is that Azal have suspended taking bookings for the flight to and from London. Call Azal London +44 1414 160 888 for further information.
Visas
British nationals travelling to Azerbaijan usually need to get a visa in advance.
The Asan Visa (e-Visa) service is temporarily suspended, no new e-visas are being issued and those issued but not yet used have been annulled.
You can still apply for a visa through the Azerbaijan Embassy-affiliated Visa Service Centre in the UK. You should apply for a visa at least one month ahead of your intended travel date. All applicants must provide confirmation they have tested negative for COVID-19. Visit the official Visa Centre website for more information.
Make sure you check the duration of your visa immediately to avoid overstaying unintentionally. Your visa should be valid when departing Azerbaijan.
E-visas are normally valid for 30 days and are single entry. The Azerbaijani authorities have agreed that e-visas can be extended in some circumstances. For more information contact the State Migration Service email: info@migration.gov.az.
On 24 March the authorities announced that foreign nationals can extend their stay in Azerbaijan for up to 60 days. A fee will be payable. Visit the State Migration Service of the Republic of Azerbaijan website. Their address is:
202 Binagadi Highway
3123 Block
Binagadi district
Baku city
AZ1114
Azerbaijan Republic
Telephone +994 (0)12 562 56 23 or +994 (0)12 562 57 73; e-mail info@migration.gov.az. Alternatively, try the Migration Information Centre: telephone: 919 (in country calls only).
If you overstay you can obtain an ‘Exit Permit’ letter (an official letter giving permission to leave Azerbaijan within 48 hours) from the State Migration Service before you depart. You will be liable to a fine of between AZN300 to AZN400. You should get a receipt.
Passport validity
Your passport should be valid for a minimum period of 6 months when you enter Azerbaijan.
UK Emergency Travel Documents
UK Emergency Travel Documents (ETDs) are accepted for entry, airside transit and exit from Azerbaijan.
Registration
If you’re staying in Azerbaijan for longer than 15 days you must register with the State Migration Service within 15 days of arrival by either visiting the State Migration Service in person or online. Hotels may provide this service for their guests, but visitors staying in apartments or private residences will have to register by themselves. Each traveller is responsible for ensuring that the registration has been completed.
If you’re staying longer than 30 days, you will need to obtain a temporary residence card unless applying to extend your visa on compassionate grounds. For more information refer to the State Migration Service.
Dual nationals
Azerbaijan doesn’t allow adults (18 years or older) to hold dual nationality. You may be refused entry, denied departure or even face criminal liability if you’re 18 years or older and are found to be holding both an Azerbaijani passport and a passport of a different nationality. If you’re a British passport holder with links to Azerbaijan (through birth or otherwise) and wish to check your nationality status contact the State Migration Service before you travel. Children under 18 years old holding a second nationality shouldn’t face any difficulties.
