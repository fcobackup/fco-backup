At least 8 weeks before your trip, check the latest country or territory-specific health advice from the National Travel Health Network and Centre (NaTHNaC) on the TravelHealthPro website. Each country/territory-specific page has information on vaccine recommendations, any current health risks or outbreaks, and factsheets with information on staying healthy abroad. Guidance is also available from NHS (Scotland) on the FitForTravel website.
General information on travel vaccinations and a travel health checklist are available on the NHS website. You may then wish to contact your health adviser or pharmacy for advice on other preventive measures and managing any pre-existing medical conditions while you’re abroad.
While travel can be enjoyable, it can sometimes be challenging. There are clear links between mental and physical health, so looking after yourself during travel and when abroad is important. Information on travelling with mental health conditions is available in our guidance page. Further information is also available from the National Travel Health Network and Centre (NaTHNaC).
Medication
The legal status and regulation of some medicines prescribed or purchased in the UK can be different in other countries and territories. If you’re travelling with prescription or over-the-counter medicine, read this guidance from NaTHNaC on best practice when travelling with medicines.
If you’re bringing any prescribed medicine into Taiwan, you should bring the prescription issued by your doctor, hospital or clinic that shows the medicine is for your personal use. The amount of medication you bring must be consistent with the amount stated on the prescription. Cannabis oil and cannabis derived medication, even if legally prescribed elsewhere, cannot be brought into Taiwan.
For further information on the legal status of a specific medicine, you’ll need to contact the Taipei Representative Office in London.
Coronavirus
There is an ongoing outbreak of coronavirus (COVID-19).
Taiwan has put in place a number of measures to combat coronavirus. The list below covers the main restrictions but is not exhaustive and entry procedures are being regularly reviewed so may change at short notice:
From Thursday 19 March (Taiwan Time) foreign nationals will no longer be permitted to enter Taiwan. Foreign nationals who hold a valid ARC or APRC will still be allowed to enter. These measures apply to those people who are eligible for visa-free treatment, landing visas, and e-visas, as well as those carrying valid visas.
If you are unsure if you are permitted to enter Taiwan, you should contact your local Taipei Representative Office, or your airline before you attempt to travel.
If you are not a resident but still wish to travel to Taiwan, you will need special permission to enter. You should contact the Taipei Representative Office in the country you are travelling from to apply for this permission.
If you do meet the criteria for entry into Taiwan you will be required to self-isolate for 14 days on arrival. Local authorities monitor self-isolation and there are legal penalties for breaching self-isolation.
Effective immediately, anyone who has entered Taiwan from the UK, Ireland or Schengen Area from the 5th March onwards will now be required to self-isolate for 14 days. This rule will be applied retrospectively and applies to all travellers. If you are affected by this change, you should contact the Taiwan Centers for Disease Control (CDC) helpline which is 1922.
All airline passengers entering Taiwan are now required to fill in a health declaration which includes travel history for the preceding 14 days.
If you are granted permission to enter Taiwan, you may find it difficult to find a hotel who will accept travellers who need to self-isolate for 14 days. You should confirm with your hotel provider that they are able to offer accommodation to someone required to self-isolate for 14 days before you travel.
As a result of entry and travel restrictions, a number of flights out of Taiwan have been cancelled, and this may change without notice as the situation progresses. Contact your airline or tour operator for the latest information.
You should comply with any additional screening measures put in place by the Taiwanese authorities. Monitor the Taiwan Centers for Disease Control website for measures that Taiwan is taking to combat coronavirus.
If you are in Taiwan and believe, you may have been exposed to or may have contracted coronavirus, your first point of contact should be the Taiwan Centers for Disease Control (CDC) helpline which is 1922. If you are unable to speak to anyone at the CDC you can contact the British Office, Taipei for support.
As a response to coronavirus, a number of countries have placed entry restrictions on those who have travelled in or transited through China. Some countries may include Taiwan within these restrictions. If you’re travelling to or via other countries from Taiwan, check the travel advice for these destinations. If you need further information, contact the local immigration authorities or the embassy, high commission or consulate of the country you’re travelling to.
Further advice on coronavirus is available from Public Health England and on the TravelHealthPro website.
Medical treatment
Taiwan has adequate health and dental facilities to handle routine, emergency and outpatient treatment. Some have English-speaking staff. Hospitals operate on a ’pay as you use’ basis. Make sure you have adequate travel health insurance and accessible funds to cover the cost of any medical treatment abroad and repatriation.
If you need emergency medical assistance during your trip, dial 119 and ask for an ambulance. You should contact your insurance/medical assistance company promptly if you are referred to a medical facility for treatment. Unlike the UK, it is not normal practice for a paramedic to accompany an ambulance.
Health risks
There has been a significant increase in cases of dengue fever. Cases are usually concentrated in the south of Taiwan (including the cities of Kaohsiung and Tainan) and are highest during the summer months. See the Taiwan Centre for Disease Control website for more information. You should take precautions to avoid mosquito bites.
