This advice reflects the UK government’s understanding of current rules for people travelling on a full ‘British citizen’ passport from the UK, for the most common types of travel.
The authorities in Uruguay set and enforce entry rules. If you’re not sure how these requirements apply to you, contact the Uruguayan Embassy in the UK.

Check with your travel provider that your passport and other travel documents meet requirements. Renew your passport if you need to.
