Travelling from and returning to the UK
If you plan to pass through another country to return to the UK, check the travel advice for the country you’re transiting.
Be prepared for your plans to change
No travel is risk-free during COVID. Countries may further restrict travel or bring in new rules at short notice, for example due to a new COVID-19 variant. Check with your travel company or airline for any transport changes which may delay your journey home.
If you test positive for COVID-19, you may need to stay where you are until you test negative. You may also need to seek treatment there.
Plan ahead and make sure you:
can access money
understand what your insurance will cover
can make arrangements to extend your stay and be away for longer than planned
Travel in Japan
COVID-19 related measures have been lifted across the country. Travel, dining out and other activities are permitted. However, guidance encouraging social distancing, mask-wearing and other basic precautions remains in place and compliance rates are high. Some businesses may still be operating with restrictions.
More restrictive rules may be imposed at short notice. You should follow the instructions of your local authority.
Local authorities may also put in place special measures for natural disaster response, including additional evacuation locations and medical procedures. See Natural disasters for more information on general disaster preparedness in Japan.
Healthcare in Japan
For contact details of English speaking doctors visit our list of healthcare providers. For guidance on what to do if you think you may have COVID-19, please visit the Ministry of Health, Labour and Welfare website.
If you think you have COVID-19 symptoms, you should contact a COVID-19 Consultation Centre, who will direct you to a PCR testing centre. If you subsequently test positive for COVID-19, you will be contacted by the relevant public health centre. They will instruct you to self-isolate for 10 days at home, to move to a government-managed quarantine facility, or the most serious cases to stay in a hospital. Under-18s are not exempt from these requirements, though quarantine staff will contact their legal representatives.
If you are isolating at home and your symptoms become severe, you should contact the public health centre. They will advise you whether and how to seek medical treatment (you will be required to avoid public transport). They may send a car to transport you to a hotel or hospital.
If there is a possibility that your life is in danger at any stage, you should dial 119 and ask for an ambulance.
The Japan National Tourism Organisation has a 24 hour hotline (+81 50 3816-2787) which provides support and advice in English for visitors in Japan including on coronavirus. It has published relevant information and further external links (in English) including a guide to accessing medical facilities in Japan.
