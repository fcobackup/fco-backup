You can spread the virus even if you don’t have symptoms.

The British government now strongly recommends that if you live in the UK and are currently travelling overseas, you should seek to return to the UK where and when there are commercial flights available.
Currently there are no commercial flights entering or leaving Saudi Arabia.
What to do
The British Embassy is working closely with airlines, the Saudi authorities and other governments to ensure that British nationals can buy tickets for commercial flights to the UK as soon as possible. The British Embassy is no longer arranging commercial flights to London, nor collating details of individual British nationals that wish to purchase tickets for flights.
If you are a British national and urgently need to return to the UK, please email your phone number and details of your situation to KSA.info@fco.gov.uk with URGENT RETURN in the title.
This email address is not for consular assistance. For consular assistance please call +966 (0) 11 481 9100, or use the forms available for the British Consulate in Riyadh and British Consulate in Jeddah
If you cannot leave at this time, you should:
follow the advice of local authorities, including local measures to help minimise your risk of exposure to coronavirus (COVID-19)
find accommodation that’s suitable for your needs
keep in regular contact with family and friends at home, so they know you are safe and well
