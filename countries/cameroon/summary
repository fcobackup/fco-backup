There is an increased risk of kidnap in the North West and South West regions. In April 2018 it was reported that a tourist group, including 7 Swiss, 6 Cameroonians and 5 Italians were kidnapped in the South West region. Military intervention secured their release and no one was injured. This follows the kidnap in March 2018 of 2 Tunisian and 2 Cameroonian road workers. One Tunisian was killed during a rescue operation. Kidnaps of Cameroon officials have been reported in the North West and South West regions. There have also been multiple exchanges of fire between the Cameroonian security forces and armed groups over the past few months in some towns and villages in the North West and South West regions.
This follows violent and deadly clashes between demonstrators and the Cameroonian security forces in the North West and South West regions in September and October 2017. Restrictions including night curfews, a ban on public meetings and other restrictions remain in place. A general strike is observed in parts of the two regions on some days. If you’re in these regions, you should remain vigilant and keep in touch with developments through local media.
Terrorists are very likely to try to carry out attacks in Cameroon. The terrorist group Boko Haram is active in the Far North region but attacks could occur anywhere including major towns and cities such as Yaoundé and Douala. There have been numerous suicide attacks since 2016 which have resulted in over 200 dead in the Far North region. Key targets have been large open markets, hotels, parks and sporting venues. There have also been attempts to take hostages and heavy gunfights reported in Babouang and Mbarang in Adamaoua region (Cameroon).
There’s a heightened threat of kidnap to western nationals in the north of Cameroon, including in the major cities and along the border between the Far North region and Nigeria. Boko Haram has publicly threatened Cameroon with attacks and further kidnappings due to Cameroon’s involvement in the regional fight to counter Boko Haram. See Terrorism
There have been reports of criminality including large armed gangs and highway bandits, stopping travellers, taking hostages and demanding payment, particularly in the east of Cameroon, close to the Central African Republic (CAR) border. There are frequent instances of violence in CAR spilling across the border to Cameroon.
Criminality by large gangs and hostage taking for ransom are also a threat more widely in Adamawa region. In January 2017, an armed group attacked a UN border monitoring team near the Nigerian border killing 5 people.
Nigerian military operations in the states of Borno, Yobe and Adamawa in Nigeria could have an impact across the border in Cameroon.
UK health authorities have classified Cameroon as having a risk of Zika virus transmission. For information and advice about the risks associated with Zika virus, visit the National Travel Health Network and Centre website.
There are increased reports of piracy in the Gulf of Guinea. Take great care when travelling in coastal waters, including the coastline of Cameroon and the Doula port. Despite the high crime levels, most visits to Cameroon are trouble-free. Only a few British nationals needed consular assistance in the past year.
If you’re abroad and you need emergency help from the UK government, contact the nearest British embassy, consulate or high commission.
Take out comprehensive travel and medical insurance before you travel.
