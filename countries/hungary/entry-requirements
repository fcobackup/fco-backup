The information on this page covers the most common types of travel and reflects the UK government’s understanding of the rules currently in place. Unless otherwise stated, this information is for travellers using a full ‘British Citizen’ passport.
The authorities in the country or territory you’re travelling to are responsible for setting and enforcing the rules for entry. If you’re unclear about any aspect of the entry requirements, or you need further reassurance, you’ll need to contact the embassy, high commission or consulate of the country or territory you’re travelling to.
You should also consider checking with your transport provider or travel company to make sure your passport and other travel documents meet their requirements.
Restrictions in response to coronavirus
Hungary has restricted entry to foreign nationals.
Hungarian citizens and EEA citizens (including UK nationals) holding a Permanent Residence Card or a Registration Certificate and Address Card are allowed to enter the country following a medical examination at the border to check for signs of Covid-19 infection. Those individuals suspected of infection will be put into officially designated quarantine for 14 days. If there is no suspicion of infection, individuals will still be required to quarantine at home for 14 days.
Hungary has begun to agree with neighbouring countries some relaxations to this policy. For example, Serbian citizens may now enter Hungary from Serbia without restriction, as may Slovenian citizens travelling from Slovenia. From 5 June, Hungary removed its travel restrictions with Austria, Czech Republic and Slovakia. This freedom of movement applies to the citizens, as well as to EEA and UK nationals with permanent residency in all of these four countries (Austria, Czech Republic, Hungary, Slovakia). There are also exemptions for nationals from Germany, the Republic of Korea, Japan and Poland entering Hungary for business purposes from their homeland. Entry rules may change at short notice. You can find the latest announcements on the Hungarian government website (in English).
UK nationals who do not fall into the categories noted above, but who wish to enter Hungary for exceptional reasons, or transit through Hungary, must submit an application for exemption on the official website of the Hungarian Police by completing an electronic form here. The form is currently only available in Hungarian and must be completed in Hungarian. The Hungarian Ministry of Foreign Affairs and Trade recommend applications are submitted at least a few days before the planned travel day, clearly stating the justification for the exemption application. The form sets out more details about the type of exceptional circumstances in which the authorities may allow entry. Anyone entering Hungary following this application route will need to follow the same quarantine rules as returning residents, as noted above.
The situation may change rapidly, including in neighbouring countries, where some airports have closed or ceased direct flights to the UK.

The export and import of goods purchased for non-commercial purposes (for personal use or as gifts) while travelling is not restricted, however, the transport of certain goods (such as: pets, hunting weapons, alcohol and tobacco products, medicines containing drugs, etc.) within the European Union is restricted or subject to special permissions.
