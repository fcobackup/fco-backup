Street demonstrations, protests and strikes are common across all of Chile, Santiago in particular. Although most are peaceful, they can turn violent. If protests take place, you should follow the instructions and advice of the local authorities, remain vigilant, monitor developments via official sources and avoid protests and demonstrations areas. Under Chilean law, foreign nationals visiting or living in Chile could be deported for involvement in protests and demonstrations. See Local laws and customs
Opportunistic street crime can be a problem in towns and cities, and in areas popular with tourists including airports, bus stations and ports. Take care of your personal belongings at all times and be aware of your surroundings. Carry a photocopy of your passport and keep the original document in a safe place. See Crime.
Terrorist attacks in Chile can’t be ruled out. See Terrorism
