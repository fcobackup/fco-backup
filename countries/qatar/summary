Around 20,000 British nationals live in Qatar, and approximately 130,000 visit annually. Most visits are trouble-free.
Since June 2017, following the decision by Saudi Arabia, United Arab Emirates, Bahrain and Egypt to cut diplomatic ties with Qatar, the land border between Qatar and Saudi Arabia has been closed. All flights between Qatar and Saudi Arabia, United Arab Emirates, Egypt and Bahrain are also suspended until further notice. These measures are likely to lead to some disruption for travellers in the region. You should check with your airline before you travel. Direct flights between the UK and Qatar aren’t affected.
Restrictions on entry to the UAE have also been placed on certain holders of Qatari Residence Permits. These restrictions don’t apply to British nationals.
Terrorist attacks in Qatar can’t be ruled out. See Terrorism
