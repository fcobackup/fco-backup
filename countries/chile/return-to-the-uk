LATAM require all passengers to have filled-in a “Pasaporte Sanitario” to be allowed to board their flights. This government form, requests information on recent countries visited and coronavirus-related health. Once filled-in and submitted, you will receive a PDF of the completed form that you can store on your phone or print.
You will need to pay for your return travel to the UK. If departure options are available but you cannot afford the travel costs and have exhausted all other options for getting funds, you may be eligible to apply for an emergency loan from the government. This is a last resort option and you would need to repay the loan when you are back in the UK.
