This section has safety advice for regions of Kyrgyzstan. It only covers regions where FCDO has specific advice.
You should also read FCDO’s overall travel advice and safety and security advice.
Osh and Jalal-Abad provinces
Stay aware of your surroundings if you travel to the provinces (‘oblasts’) of Osh and Jalal-Abad. While there has been no widespread violence since the ethnic clashes in 2010, there are still underlying tensions between the local Kyrgyz and Uzbek populations, particularly south and west of the city of Osh.
Border with Tajikistan, including Batken Province
There is a risk of conflict over recognition of the border with Tajikistan. Negotiations between the two countries on the border are ongoing. There have been security incidents along the border including with exchanges of gunfire.
In September 2022, armed conflict between the Kyrgyz and Tajik militaries resulted in over 100 deaths, including civilians. There was significant destruction of civilian property and infrastructure. Around 140,000 civilians were displaced. There is a risk of further violence and border closures at any time. Unexploded landmines and weapons remain a risk.
Border with Uzbekistan
There are occasional violent incidents on Kyrgyzstan’s border with Uzbekistan. There is also a risk of landmines in these border areas.
Border crossings
Crossing the borders  can be complex, take local advice if you’re planning on crossing.
Check local media reports before you travel to see which border posts are open. Only use officially recognised border crossings. Border crossings can close at short notice, particularly the Tajikistan-Kyrgyzstan border near the Vorukh enclave.
