Coronavirus guidance is being updated.
Read the Prime Minister’s statement for the latest information.

The information on this page covers the most common types of travel and reflects the UK government’s understanding of the rules currently in place. Unless otherwise stated, this information is for travellers using a full ‘British Citizen’ passport.
The authorities in the country or territory you’re travelling to are responsible for setting and enforcing the rules for entry. If you’re unclear about any aspect of the entry requirements, or you need further reassurance, you’ll need to contact the embassy, high commission or consulate of the country or territory you’re travelling to.
You should also consider checking with your transport provider or travel company to make sure your passport and other travel documents meet their requirements.
Restrictions in response to coronavirus
Entry
Foreign nationals are no longer permitted to enter Taiwan, with the exception of holders of a valid Alien Resident Certificate (ARC) or Alien Permanent Resident Certificate(APRC). These measures apply to those eligible for visa-free treatment, landing visas, and e-visas, as well as those carrying valid visas.
There are a very small number of exemptions where you can apply for special permission to enter. This can be done at the Taipei Representative Office in the country from which you plan to travel. If you are unsure if you are permitted to enter Taiwan, you should contact your local Taipei Representative Office or airline before you attempt to travel.
Entry procedures are being regularly reviewed so may change at short notice.
Self-isolation requirements
All airline passengers entering Taiwan are required to fill in a health declaration which includes travel history for the preceding 14 days.
If you do meet the criteria for entry into Taiwan, you will be required to self-isolate for 14 days on arrival. Local authorities monitor those self-isolating, and there are legal penalties for anyone breaching the conditions.
Transit
There is currently a ban on air travellers transiting Taiwan. You should adjust your travel plans accordingly.
Regular entry requirements
Visas
You may spend up to 90 days in Taiwan without a visa. You can then extend this by a further 90 days once you have entered Taiwan. If you plan to stay in Taiwan for longer than 180 days you must have a visa before you arrive.
Specific rules exist for naturalised British Citizens born in the People’s Republic of China and holders of British National (Overseas) passports wishing to enter under the visa waiver scheme.
For further information on entry requirements, contact the Taipei Representative Office in London, 50 Grosvenor Gardens, London, SW1W 0EB, telephone: 020 7881 2650 or in Edinburgh, 1 Melville Street, Edinburgh EH3 7PE, telephone: 01312 206886.
Passport validity
Your passport should be valid for a minimum period of six months from the date of entry into Taiwan.
UK Emergency Travel Documents
UK Emergency Travel Documents are accepted for entry, airside transit and exit from Taiwan. If you’re entering Taiwan using an Emergency Travel Document (ETD), you must apply for a visit visa before travelling (unless you’re travelling from mainland China, in which case you can get a visa on arrival).
Customs regulations
You should not enter Taiwan with animal products without prior authorisation as those caught smuggling products may face heavy fines. Due to recent reports of African Swine Fever Virus (ASF) in pork products, particularly from the People’s Republic of China (PRC), local authorities have increased quarantine checks and inspections
Medications
When bringing medications into Taiwan, you should bring a prescription from a hospital, clinic or doctor stating that the medicines are for the use of the individual. The amount brought in must be consistent with the amount on the prescription. See Health
