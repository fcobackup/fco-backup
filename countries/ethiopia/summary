There is a military conflict ongoing in the north of Ethiopia. Military clashes are now occurring in Tigray, Amhara and Afar regional states, with some localised clashes in Oromia. The conflict has potential to escalate and spread quickly and with little warning. The FCDO advises against all travel to Tigray, Amhara and Afar regional states. If you are in Tigray, Amhara and Afar states, and it is safe to do so, you should leave. If you are in the vicinity of military activity and you cannot leave safely, you should stay indoors, away from windows and remain alert to developments that would enable you to leave safely. The FCDO advises against all but essential travel to all other remaining areas of Ethiopia because of the risk of the conflict spreading to new areas without prior warning. See Tigray Region, Amhara Region, Afar Region and Oromia Region.

Curfews and roadblocks may be introduced with little or no warning. There is an enhanced security presence.
