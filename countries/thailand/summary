There is an ongoing outbreak of coronavirus (COVID-19) in Thailand. The Thai authorities have introduced a number of measures to limit the spread of the virus.
If you wish to leave Thailand you should make a plan to leave now and contact your airline or tour operator. We are aware that many airlines are suspending or reducing flights, both direct and indirect, to the United Kingdom. All British Airways flights are suspended from 29th March. We anticipate that you will find it increasingly difficult to return to the UK. This disruption is likely to last for many months.
From 22 March, Thailand will introduce additional screening measures for passengers flying to Thailand from all countries., These additional screening measures will apply to passengers travelling to Thailand from all destinations, including those in transit.
All passengers will need to present a medical certificate signed by a medical professional confirming no evidence of the coronavirus infection in the previous 72 hours, and also present evidence of medical insurance of no less than US$100,000 which covers COVID-19. Failure to meet these requirements will mean passengers are not permitted to board their flight even if they are transiting airside to another international destination.
Upon arrival in Thailand, passengers will be asked to present their health certificate and insurance details to disease control officials. Passengers will also need to present a completed T8 form with their name, nationality, passport number, active mobile phone number and e-mail address, or show that they have filled out this same information on the ‘AOT Airport of Thailand’ mobile application. Disease control officials may decide that some passengers be subject to a 14 day quarantine or self-isolation period within Thailand. You are advised to keep up to date with the latest information on boarding procedures on the website of the Civil Aviation Authority of Thailand, and the website of the Ministry of Public Health for information about quarantine and self-isolation procedures.

On 17 March, Thai authorities introduced measures that place restrictions on public gatherings, popular tourist events such as full moon parties and Songkran celebrations. On 21 March the Governor of Bangkok announced a further set of restrictions in Bangkok including closing malls and markets from 22 March – 12 April. Supermarkets, pharmacies, sections in malls selling foodstuffs and restaurants offering takeaway service remain open. Many entertainment venues such as pubs and clubs, and educational institutions are already closed. Further restrictions are expected. You should follow the advice of the authorities.
All British nationals in Thailand are advised to remain up to date with the latest health advice provided by Thailand’s Ministry of Public Health and updates from the Thai Government on the situation.

Thailand is experiencing a drought that has led to some sea water entering the fresh water supply and tap water. This issue may continue for several months. Thailand’s Metropolitan Waterworks Authority advise that there is no risk to public health from drinking tap water but salty water can affect people in higher risk groups, such as those with kidney disease. If you are concerned about the risks to your personal health, you should drink bottled water and/or get medical advice.
Avoid any protests, political gatherings, demonstrations or marches, and be wary of making political statements in public. People have faced criminal charges for participating in these activities. Others, including British people, have faced charges for sharing articles online that could be seen as portraying Thailand negatively or making accusations about individuals. Lèse-majesté (criticism of the monarchy in any form) is a crime which can be broadly interpreted, and carries a long jail sentence. See Political situation
