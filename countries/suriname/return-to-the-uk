Future travel options
We know this is concerning for British people trying to leave Suriname.The UK government is working closely with airlines, the Surinamese authorities and other governments to make sure options are available for you to return to the UK as soon as possible.
This travel advice will be updated when departure options become available.
You will need to pay for your return travel to the UK. If departure options are available but you cannot afford the travel costs and have exhausted all other options for getting funds, you may be eligible to apply for an emergency loan from the government. This is a last resort option and you would need to repay the loan when you are back in the UK.
For more information, you should contact Corporate Travel Management (CTM). CTM are a commercial partner of the FCO and are authorised to administer such loans on behalf of the FCO.
Where possible, the British High Commission in Guyana, which covers Suriname, will share relevant information about departure options on Facebook.
