As of 19 March all international flights to and from Algeria were suspended. All land borders are now closed and ferry services are suspended.
On 5 April, the partial lockdown in Algiers and 8 other wilayas (Betna, Tizi Ouzou, Sétif, Constantine, Médéa, Oran, Bourmerdes, Al Oued and Tipaza) was extended, and now runs from 15:00 to 07:00. The wilaya of Blida remains under full lockdown. In addition, the original 19:00-07:00 lockdown has been extended all 39 remaining wilayas.
Across the country, schools, nurseries, universities and mosques have closed; sporting events have been cancelled and many public amenities and public spaces have been shut to the public.
