Warning
FCDO advises against all but essential travel to parts of Papua New Guinea.

This section has safety advice for regions of Papua New Guinea. It only covers regions where the Foreign, Commonwealth & Development Office (FCDO) has specific advice.
You should also read FCDO’s overall travel advice and safety and security advice.
Enga, Hela and Southern Highlands Provinces
FCDO advises against all but essential travel to Hela, Southern Highlands and Enga Provinces (except Wabag District) due to the high risk of tribal fighting.
If you plan to travel there, be cautious, stay away from large crowds and gatherings and consider getting private security advice.  Pay attention to local advice on curfews and other restrictions which may be imposed at short notice.
Be particularly cautious and stay away from, the area around the Porgera gold mine, which has been subject to violent landowner disputes.
See Tribal fighting.
Papua New Guinea-Indonesia border
The land border between Papua New Guinea and Indonesia stretches for around 760km and is poorly defined. There are sometimes armed clashes along the border between the Indonesian military and the Organisasi Papua Merdeka (OPM, Free Papua Movement).
The Papua New Guinea government has defence units at its Wutung border post in Sandaun Province. Be extremely cautious and be prepared for possible sudden closure of the border crossing.
Bougainville Island
Bougainville Island has been calm since a 2001 peace agreement ended separatist fighting. You should still be cautious, particularly in central and southern Bougainville. There is a risk of lawlessness and violence. The autonomous Bougainville government has designated the mountainous area in central Bougainville around the old Panguna mine a ‘no go zone’. Do not travel to it without prior authorisation.
