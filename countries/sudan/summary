For security reasons the FCDO advises against all travel to:
the Darfur states
the Abyei Region
South Kordofan and Blue Nile states
the southern area of West Kordofan state that was previously part of South Kordofan, as shown on the map
within 50km of the border with South Sudan in White Nile and Sennar states
within 200km of the border with Libya
The FCDO advises against all but essential travel to:
the remainder of Sudan
British Embassy Khartoum are following developments after a military coup on 25 October. Protests are taking place across the country and internet and telephone services remain unreliable. There is a heightened risk that the situation in Khartoum and elsewhere in Sudan could deteriorate rapidly. You should avoid all unessential movement. If travel is essential, avoid all demonstrations, monitor media coverage and follow the advice of the local authorities.
The Embassy continues to carry out essential work including providing 24/7 consular assistance and support to British people in Sudan. We continue to offer consular services online or by telephone, 24 hours a day, 7 days a week. If you have any questions, please call + 249 (0) 156 77 5500 / +44 (0)1908 516666. When calling, you may hear a message stating that our offices are closed. If so, stay on the line and select the option for ‘calling about an emergency involving a British National’ to speak to an officer.
Consular support is severely limited in parts of Sudan where the FCDO has existing advice against all travel and all but essential travel (as set out above). The British Embassy no longer registers British nationals in Sudan and the capacity of the British Embassy to help in times of crisis may be limited. You should consider your own travel arrangements carefully and make sure you have up-to-date travel documents and visas in case you need to leave at short notice. See this crisis guidance page for more information about the precautions you should take in the event of a crisis and the help and support the British Embassy can provide.
