Cases of coronavirus (COVID-19) have been confirmed in Russia. The Russian authorities have introduced measures to limit the spread of the virus.
Entry and borders
On 18 March the Russian government introduced restrictions on entry into the whole country for almost all foreign citizens until 1 May 2020. These restrictions do not apply to certain groups including transit passengers, those with permanent residency in Russia, and members of diplomatic missions.
Visa extensions have been granted for those nationals who are in Russia at present but cannot travel back to the UK, regardless of the purpose of entry. If you need to extend your visa, you should go to the nearest office of the Russian Ministry of Internal Affairs, or contact your visa facilitation company, if you have one. Commercial flight options are still available with carriers, but these are declining. If you want to travel back to the UK or have a return ticket to do so, please contact your airline to discuss your options.
On 19 March, the Russian government announced that all arrivals to the country should self-isolate at home for a period of 14 days, regardless of whether they show symptoms. You should comply with any additional screening measures put in place by the authorities.
Local measures
On 16 March, the authorities in Moscow introduced a ban on gatherings in the city of more than 50 people.
