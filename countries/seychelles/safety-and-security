Terrorism
There is a high threat of terrorist attack globally affecting UK interests and British nationals, including from groups and individuals who view the UK and British nationals as targets. Stay aware of your surroundings at all times.    
UK Counter Terrorism Policing has information and advice on staying safe abroad and what to do in the event of a terrorist attack. Find out how to reduce your risk from terrorism while abroad.
Terrorism in Seychelles
Although there is no recent history of terrorism in Seychelles, attacks cannot be ruled out.
Crime
Protecting yourself and your belongings
There is a risk of break-ins, robberies, burglaries and opportunistic thefts. Crime is generally non-violent, but people can have their bags snatched, cars broken into or be robbed while walking at night.
Criminals may target parked cars, residential accommodation including guest houses, hotels, beaches, and marked and unmarked walking trails.
To reduce the risk to yourself and your belongings:
make sure your living accommodation has external security lighting, grilles and overnight security guards
use a hotel safe or safety deposit box to store valuables, money and passports
do not leave valuables in cars or anywhere on display
avoid carrying large amounts of cash or wearing expensive-looking jewellery or watches
carry a mobile phone with roaming capability for use in an emergency
Be particularly alert in:
Beau Vallon
the back streets of Victoria
any isolated area, especially at night
Call the Seychelles police on +248 428 8000 to report any incident.
Laws and cultural differences
Public nudity
Topless sunbathing is uncommon. Nudism is not accepted and is likely to cause offence.
Illegal drugs and prison sentences
Drug taking and smuggling are serious offences in Seychelles. Penalties are severe and may include fines and prison sentences, up to life imprisonment.
LGBT+ travellers
Same-sex sexual activity is legal in Seychelles, but attitudes vary. Same-sex marriage is not recognised.
Read more advice for LGBT+ travellers.
Outdoor activities and adventure tourism
Swimming
Beaches can be safe for swimming at some times of the year and dangerous at others. In general, the west coast is unsafe during the north-west monsoon (around December to March), and the east coast is unsafe during the south-east winds season (around May to September). Beaches at the southern tip are not suitable for swimming at any time.
Beaches do not always have safety information. You should not assume they’re safe. The popular Beau Vallon beach, and some other beaches, may have dangerous rip currents when the sea is rough.
There are not many lifeguards, though some are stationed on popular beaches. Ask for local advice about the conditions before you visit the beaches and follow any warning signs.
See water safety on holiday from the Royal Life Saving Society.
Hiking
It is generally safe to hike in Seychelles. Visitors have sometimes got lost on nature walks or hiking on trails. You can plan a route and access online guides and safety tips from the Seychelles Tourism Department.
Transport risks
Road travel
If you are planning to drive in Seychelles, see information on driving abroad.   
 
You can see the legal requirements you need to be aware of in the Road Transport Act.
You can use a UK photocard driving licence to drive in Seychelles for 3 months. If you still have a paper driving licence, you may need to update it to a photocard licence or get a 1968 international driving permit (IDP) as well.
Hire car companies often have stricter requirements for their customers, such as a year of driving experience, a higher minimum age and holding an IDP.
Driving and road standards
Mahé is mountainous, and roads are narrow and winding, often with sheer drops and hairpin bends. Not all such roads are equipped with safety barriers. Deep, uncovered storm drains flank many roads.
Drink-driving is a problem, so other road users may behave erratically.
Sudden heavy downpours can reduce visibility and road surface conditions quickly. Potholes can appear suddenly after heavy rains. Drivers sometimes veer sharply across lanes to avoid them.
Public transport
Buses are cheap but infrequent on some routes. A timetable is available from the bus station in Victoria or from the Seychelles Public Transport Corporation. Most public buses do not operate after 8pm.
Taxis are generally of a good standard. Taxi meters are increasingly common but if a taxi is not equipped with one, agree a fare before starting your journey.
Sea travel
Piracy in the region has decreased but there is still some risk, especially off the coast of Somalia. You can check the latest situation with United Kingdom Maritime Trade Operations and Maritime Security Centre (Horn of Africa).
For more information and advice, see piracy and armed robbery at sea.
Most of the inner island resorts are accessible by ferry. Pay attention to safety briefings when taking any boat trips. Make sure life jackets are provided, especially on smaller excursion boats.
