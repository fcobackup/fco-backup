Transport risks
Road travel
If you plan to drive in Norway, see information on driving abroad and read the RAC Norway guide.
For stays of less than 90 days you can drive with a UK photocard driving licence. For longer stays or if you only have a paper licence, you need an international driving permit (IDP).
Drink-driving laws are strict in Norway. The legal alcohol limit is one quarter of the UK’s legal limit. There are frequent roadside checks for alcohol. Penalties for driving under the influence are severe and include prison sentences.
Car drivers must use winter tyres with a minimum 3 millimetre (mm) tread if there is snow or ice covering the roads. You may also need to use studded tyres or snow chains. Truck drivers must use winter tyres with a minimum 5mm tread and have a sufficient number of snow chains.
You can get the full tyre requirements from Norway’s State Highways.
Keep your headlights on, but dipped, during the daytime all year round in all places.
On roads that are not marked with a priority sign (yellow diamond), you must give way to traffic coming from the right.
If you commit a driving offence, you could get an on-the-spot fine of up to 10,000 Norwegian krone.
Arctic travel
Nearly half of Norway’s land mass is in the Arctic Circle, and if you are travelling to remote Arctic areas in Norway, or travelling by sea in the Arctic you could be at risk.
Consular assistance and support to British nationals in these areas is limited by the capacity of national and local authorities. Make sure you have appropriate travel insurance and accessible funds to cover the cost of any medical treatment or potential repatriation.
Before you visit:
consider your access to medical facilities, search and rescue and evacuation options
have emergency plans in place, particularly if you are an independent traveller
Sea travel in the Arctic
Most people visit the Arctic by ship. Some areas of the Arctic are uncharted and ice-covered. Before you travel:
check the experience and credentials of operators offering travel in the region
consider the on-board medical facilities and discuss any pre-existing medical conditions with the cruise operator
Search and rescue
In the highest latitude regions of the Arctic, cruise ships may be isolated from other vessels or populated areas. Be aware that:
search and rescue responders may be very far off, due to extreme distances
assistance to stranded vessels may take several days to arrive, particularly in bad weather
search and rescue teams only offer basic transport and medical care, and are unlikely to be able to give advanced life support
Extreme weather and natural disasters
Extreme weather, floods and landslides can occur. You should follow the advice of local authorities.
Climate and temperature
The weather can change rapidly, producing Arctic conditions even in summer on exposed mountain tops. Extreme weather can cause floods and landslides.
The winter is long and can last well into April. Temperatures can drop to -25°C and below. There is also a high wind chill factor, particularly in unsheltered areas and mountain ranges. Weather conditions can worsen quickly.
Forest fires
During especially hot and dry periods there is a danger of forest fires. Police enforce bans on campfires in many areas.
