Travel
The availability of transport from Ireland to Great Britain is subject to change. Flights and ferry services continue to operate between Ireland and Great Britain. Some flight operators have already announced that service will reduce in the coming days. If you’re visiting Ireland, you should closely monitor public announcements regarding the scheduling of flight and ferry services, and be prepared to adjust your travel plans accordingly.
On 26 April the Irish Government announced that all arrivals from overseas, including Irish residents, will be asked to self-isolate for 14 days on arrival. This does not apply to those returning to Ireland from Northern Ireland, nor to those who are briefly stopping over at an airport on their way to another country, nor to specified categories of essential supply chain workers such as aircrew, hauliers, maritime staff whether Irish-based or foreign-based.
Passengers on air and sea routes into Ireland must fill in a health passenger locator form providing the address of where they will self-isolate for the next 14 days and contact details for follow up. Details of passengers’ state of health are not requested. Individuals may be subject to spot checks by telephone after arrival to verify their compliance with these requirements.
