Travel to Japan is subject to entry restrictions
New entry to Japan by foreign nationals from the majority of countries, including the UK, is currently not permitted. Foreign residents of Japan returning to Japan may re-enter
All those entering Japan currently need to provide written evidence of a negative COVID-19 test result conducted within the 72 hours before/prior to your flight departure time. Arrivals from most countries will further be required to undergo a COVID-19 test on arrival and to self-isolate for 14 days on arrival at a designated location (such as a hotel or your own home) even if the test result is negative. If you are coming from the UK or South Africa, you will also be required to spend the first 3 days of that self-isolation in a government-provided facility, with a further COVID-19 test on the third day
Japan’s visa waiver system for anyone travelling on a British passport remains suspended
