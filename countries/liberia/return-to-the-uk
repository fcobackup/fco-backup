Coronavirus guidance is being updated.
Read what you can and cannot do

There are currently no commercial options available to return to the UK from Liberia. All commercial flights (except cargo, charter and special flights) are suspended.
Currently all land borders (with Sierra Leone, Guinea and Côte d’Ivoire) are closed to travellers.
We know this is concerning for British people trying to leave Liberia. The UK government is working closely with airlines, the Liberian authorities and other governments to make sure options are available for you to return to the UK as soon as possible.
If you cannot leave Liberia at this time, see advice on staying in Liberia during coronavirus.

Future travel options

You will need to pay for your return travel to the UK. If departure options are available but you cannot afford the travel costs and have exhausted all other options for getting funds, you may be eligible to apply for an emergency loan from the government. This is a last resort option and you would need to repay the loan when you are back in the UK. For more information, contact Corporate Travel Management (CTM). CTM are a commercial partner of the FCO and are authorised to administer such loans on behalf of the FCO.
