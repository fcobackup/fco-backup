Entry rules in response to coronavirus (COVID-19)
Entry to Dominica
Borders and the Douglas Charles airport are now open for nationals and non-nationals arriving in Dominica.
Pre-arrival requirements
Arriving passengers must complete an online questionnaire 24 hours before arrival, and have a PCR swab test with a negative result taken up to 72 hours before arrival. This result must be uploaded and submitted with the questionnaire so that your arrival can be approved by email from the Dominican Ministry of Health. Without this email you will not be allowed to board the flight coming into Dominica.
You should not use the NHS testing service to get a test in order to facilitate your travel to another country. You should arrange to take a private test.
Screening on arrival
A pinprick Rapid Diagnostic Test (RDT) will be taken on arrival. If the RDT is negative, then the traveller must self-isolate in a government operated or government certified facility for five days before having a further PCR test. If the RDT is positive, then a further PCR swab test will be carried out. This will be at the traveller’s expense. Further information can be found via https://discoverdominica.com/en/travel-advisory-for-dominica.
If the PCR test is positive a mandatory 14 day quarantine will be necessary, in a government facility for which fees will be charged.
The results of the second PCR test are likely to take at least 48 hours. Once a negative test is received the next seven days can be spent at an uncertified premises but the traveller should remain inside and monitor their temperature. Managed tourist activities are possible with strict supervision from certified operators.
