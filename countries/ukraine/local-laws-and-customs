Penalties for being caught in possession of drugs are severe.
Smoking and drinking alcoholic drinks in public places is officially banned. Public places include transport, bus stops, underground crossings, cultural, sports and governmental establishments, playgrounds and parks.
Carry your passport at all times for ID purposes. Police may carry out passport checks on foreign nationals. Police officers should introduce themselves (name, post, rank, reason for ID check) and present a document verifying their position. Your original passport is required since no other document can provide information on your legal status in Ukraine. If you’re detained because you have been unable to present your passport, you should ask for an official report.
Ukrainian officials generally only speak Ukrainian and Russian.
Don’t take photographs near government or military establishments.
Although homosexuality is not prohibited by law, public attitudes are less tolerant than in the UK and public displays of affection may attract negative attention. There’s no provision under Ukrainian legislation guaranteeing freedom from discrimination on the grounds of sexual orientation.

Surrogacy
The Foreign, Commonwealth and Development Office (FCDO) advises against all travel to Ukraine. Because of security challenges in Ukraine, we currently advise against commissioning new surrogacy arrangements there.
If you already have surrogacy arrangements in Ukraine, contact the FCDO on 01908 516 666 if you have not already done so.
You should seek legal advice: in the UK about Parental Orders and the documentation required for nationality determinations and travel documents
You should also seek legal advice in Ukraine but, due to the Russian invasion of Ukraine, we cannot confirm which lawyers are offering services.
Changing surrogacy arrangements
If you are considering changing your surrogacy arrangements, or making a new arrangement in another country, you should read about surrogacy arrangements in foreign countries.
A surrogacy arrangement in a country near Ukraine must comply with the law of that country, not Ukrainian law. In some other countries, surrogacy arrangements may, in certain circumstances, be illegal.
We strongly advise you to seek specialist independent UK and in-country legal advice before changing arrangements.
Corruption
Corruption remains a major problem. If you think you have been mistreated by an official then you should report your case to the relevant government department:

complaints about immigration issues should be raised with the State Border Guard Service of Ukraine: telephone (+38 044) 527 63 63, e-mail: dovira@dpsu.gov.ua
corruption by the police should be reported to the General Prosecutor’s Office: telephone (+38 044) 280 80 63, online form
you should complain about customs officials to the State Customs Service of Ukraine: telephone (+38 044) 284 19 34.
