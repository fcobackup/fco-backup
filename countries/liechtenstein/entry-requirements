Coronavirus guidance is being updated.
Read the Prime Minister’s address for the latest information.

The information on this page covers the most common types of travel and reflects the UK government’s understanding of the rules currently in place. Unless otherwise stated, this information is for travellers using a full ‘British Citizen’ passport.
The authorities in the country or territory you’re travelling to are responsible for setting and enforcing the rules for entry. If you’re unclear about any aspect of the entry requirements, or you need further reassurance, you’ll need to contact the embassy, high commission or consulate of the country or territory you’re travelling to.
You should also consider checking with your transport provider or travel company to make sure your passport and other travel documents meet their requirements.
Immigration and customs
Switzerland handles immigration and customs matters for Liechtenstein. Entry requirements are the same as for Switzerland. There is an open border between Switzerland and Liechtenstein.
The border crossings at Schellenberg and Mauren are currently closed. The border crossings at Ruggell and Schaanwald remain open for commuters, goods traffic and transit. Further restrictions and inspections may be in operation. We advise travellers seeking to cross the border at Ruggell and Schaanwald to check the latest travel advice for Austria ahead of your journey.
Passport validity
Your passport should be valid for the proposed duration of your stay; you do not need any additional period of validity on your passport beyond this.
The rules on travel will stay the same until 31 December 2020.
Visas
If you hold a British Citizen passport, you don’t need a visa to enter Liechtenstein. If you’re planning a stay of longer than 3 months, see the Living in Liechtenstein guide and contact the Swiss Embassy in London if you have further questions.
The rules on travel will stay the same until 31 December 2020.
UK Emergency Travel Documents (ETDs)
UK ETDs are accepted for entry and exit from Liechtenstein.
Working in Liechtenstein
If you intend to work in Liechtenstein, you should get detailed information on employment regulations from the Migration and Passport Office (in German).
