We advise a high degree of caution in Honiara. Ahead of the next parliamentary sittings on 15 May, the Royal Solomon Islands Police Force (RSIPF) has issued a statement reminding Honiara residents to remain safe and mindful of their personal security. Political unrest can happen in Honiara during sittings of Parliament, elections and times of political uncertainty. Demonstrations can turn violent quickly. Avoid protests and political gatherings. See Safety and security
The Royal Solomon Islands Police Force has limited resources and response times to calls for help can be slow. There have been reports of robberies involving violence, handbag snatching, pick-pocketing, distraction thefts and harassment, particularly around the central market in Honiara. See Crime
