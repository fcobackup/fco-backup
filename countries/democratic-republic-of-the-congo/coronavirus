Cases of coronavirus (COVID-19) have been confirmed in DRC. The DRC authorities have introduced a number of measures to limit the spread of the virus.
Travel restrictions and borders
As of 20 March, DRC has suspended all major international flight routes both into and out of the country until further notice. Land and maritime borders are closed and only open to cargo.
Should entry be permitted on an exceptional basis, all travellers entering the DRC are to be subject to screening, including temperature checks. Those suspected of having coronavirus will be placed into quarantine, likely in local health centres, for up to 14 days.
Internal travel to and from Kinshasa has been suspended with the exception of cargo.
Public measures
Gatherings of more than 20 people in public places, including religious ceremonies and sporting activities, are banned. Schools and universities are closed from 19 March for an initial period of four weeks. Social enterprises such as bars and night clubs are closed. Restrictions have been placed on the number of people per vehicle for public transport. Public health measures can change at short notice and you should monitor local media for the latest developments.
You should comply with any additional measures put in place by the authorities. Keep up to date with information from your tour operator, transport or accommodation provider on the impact on any existing travel plans.

Further information on coronavirus, including advice on preparing for foreign travel and helping reduce the spread of the virus, is available from Public Health England and on the TravelHealthPro website.
