Following widespread disruption, including violent protests, in many areas of Zimbabwe during January 2019, you should continue to exercise caution and monitor local media and this travel advice for updates.
Avoid any political gatherings or demonstrations. These can be unpredictable and may turn violent and the response from the security forces may be disproportionate. Taking photographs of members of police and armed forces personnel and of demonstrations and protests is not permitted. You should avoid political activity, or activities which could be considered political, including political discussions in public places. Ensure you carry identification, so that you can produce it if required to do so by the security forces. See Political situation
Tropical Cyclone Idai caused significant flooding and mud slides across many parts of eastern Zimbabwe. Whilst the access situation has improved, many roads and bridges in the affected areas are still impassable. Electricity, water, and telecommunications networks have been impacted. If travelling to affected regions, take extra care and follow any advice given by the local authorities. Contact your hotel prior to travel to check that the hotel is still accessible and open.
Zimbabwe’s economic situation remains unpredictable. Make sure you have sufficient funds in US dollar notes for your visit, or check with your tour operator that international card payments will be accepted. The official local currency in Zimbabwe changed in February 2019 and is now the “RTGS Dollar”. This includes Zimbabwean bond notes, bond coins and mobile money such as ECOCASH. However, there is a shortage of physical cash and it’s currently not possible to make cash withdrawals using an international bank card. Several other currencies remain legal tender including the US Dollar. You should check before making a transaction whether the price quoted is in RTGS or US dollars as the symbol for both is $, and it is recommended to check exchange rates prior to any transaction. The price in USD cash may be different to USD card. Stock levels in supermarkets, including some basic commodities, are inconsistent. Some businesses, including some medical providers, may only accept payment in US dollars in cash, rather than credit or debit cards. Banks are experiencing challenges dispensing foreign currency cash including for international transfers from outside of Zimbabwe. See Money
