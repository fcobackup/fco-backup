Warning
FCDO advises against all travel to parts of Moldova.

This information is for people travelling on a full ‘British citizen’ passport from the UK. It is based on the UK government’s understanding of the current rules for the most common types of travel.
The authorities in Moldova set and enforce entry rules. If you’re not sure how these requirements apply to you, contact the Moldovan Embassy in the UK.
Passport validity requirements
Your passport must have an ‘expiry date’ at least 3 months after the date you plan to leave Moldova, and at least one blank page.
Check with your travel provider that your passport and other travel documents meet requirements. Renew your passport if you need to.
You will be denied entry if you do not have a valid travel document or try to use a passport that has been reported lost or stolen.
Visa requirements
You can visit Moldova for tourism or business without a visa for up to 90 days in a 6-month period. You must be able to show a return or onward flight ticket.
You need a work permit or residence permit to work or for stays of more than 90 days. See more information on work and residence permits. 
The Moldovan authorities will automatically register your arrival date. They strictly enforce penalties, including fines and expulsion, against foreign visitors who stay in Moldova longer than allowed. Contact the Moldovan authorities with any additional questions.
Land border crossings
Entering and leaving Transnistria
FCDO advises against all travel to Transnistria.
There is no official border between Moldova and Transnistria. However, there are border control points established by the de facto Transnistria leadership between Moldova and Transnistria. Passports will be controlled but will not be stamped.
When you enter Transnistria, you need to fill in 2 copies of a migration card for the de facto authorities – keep one copy to show them when you leave. The de facto authorities may ask the purpose and length of your visit, and where you will stay. They may also deny you entry. 
All border crossings between Ukraine and Transnistria are temporarily closed. FCDO does not know when they will reopen.     
Entering Moldova from Romania
Check for updates on border crossings from Romania with the Moldovan Border Police.
Entering Moldova from Ukraine
Check for updates on border crossings from Ukraine with the Moldovan Border Police.
If you enter Moldova overland from Ukraine, go to an internationally recognised border crossing point. These are in the north and south of Moldova, excluding the Transnistria region.
If you have travelled to Moldova from Ukraine and need assistance, call (+373) 22 225 902 or contact FCDO online.
If you’re near a Ukraine-Moldova border crossing point and need assistance, call +44 1908 516666 and select option 2: consular services for British nationals.       
Entering Ukraine from Moldova 
Check for updates on border crossings with Ukraine with the Moldovan Border Police. This is particularly important around Transnistria, which is outside the control of the Moldovan authorities. Read FCDO’s Ukraine travel advice.
Vaccine requirements  
For details about medical entry requirements and recommended vaccinations, see TravelHealthPro’s Moldova guide.
Customs rules 
There are strict rules about goods you can take into or out of Moldova. You must declare anything that may be prohibited or subject to tax or duty. 
Taking money into Moldova 
Declare cash or travellers cheques if the value is 10,000 euros or more. You will get a certified declaration to show you brought it in with you. If you do not, your money could be seized when you leave.
