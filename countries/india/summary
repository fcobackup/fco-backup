Terrorists are very likely to try to carry out attacks in India. Recent attacks have targeted public places including those visited by foreigners. There have been recent media reports suggesting Daesh (formerly referred to as ISIL) may have an interest in attacking targets in India.

You should be vigilant at this time, monitor local media and take all precautions for your safety. See Terrorism
