The Foreign and Commonwealth Office (FCO) advise against all travel to:
all areas of the country north of the town of Boulsa
within 40km of the western border with Mali
Sahel and Est regions (including the W and Arly National Parks and their contiguous reserves and hunting areas)
Koulpélogo province in Centre-Est region
The FCO advise against all but essential travel to the rest of Burkina Faso, including the capital Ouagadougou.
On June 21, Burkina Faso passed a law criminalising the dissemination of information about terrorist attacks and security forces that could undermine public order or the conduct of security operations.
On 11 May 2019 four hostages, including westerners, were rescued during a French military operation in northern Burkina Faso. Two of the rescued hostages were French tourists who had been kidnapped from Pendjari National Park in Benin on 1 May 2019.
Terrorists are very likely to try to carry out attacks in Burkina Faso, including Ouagadougou.
On 31 December 2018, the President of Burkina Faso declared a partial state of emergency covering the whole of the Est and Sahel regions, the western provinces of Kossi and Sourou, the central-eastern province of Koulpélogo, the western province of Kénédougou and northern province of Lorum. This followed a terrorist attack in Sourou province on 27 December, which killed 10 gendarmes. The measure gives security forces extra powers to search homes and restrict freedom of movement. On 11 January 2019, parliament extended the state of emergency for 6 months, and extended it again on 11 July for a further 6 months.
In March 2018, a terrorist attack took place on the French Embassy and the Army Headquarters in Ouagadougou. 16 people were killed, including 8 attackers, and 80 people injured. In May 2018, a shootout occurred on the outskirts of the city between security forces and terrorists suspected of being linked to March attack.
In August 2017, gunmen attacked the Aziz Istanbul restaurant in Ouagadougou. In January 2016, there was a terrorist attack against a hotel and café in central Ouagadougou. Further attacks are possible. You should exercise particular caution around religious holidays.
There have also been regular attacks on Burkinabe security forces. On 28 August, 7 members of the security forces were killed after their vehicle was struck by a roadside bomb near Fada N’Gourma in the Eastern Region. There have also been recent attacks on police and military personnel close to the borders with Mali, Niger and Cote d’Ivoire. You should take extra care and follow the instructions of the security authorities.
There’s also a risk that terrorist groups may cross the border from Mali and the northern border with Niger into Burkina Faso to carry out kidnap attacks. See Terrorism
