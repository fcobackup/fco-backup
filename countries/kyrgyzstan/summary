The Foreign, Commonwealth & Development Office (FCDO) advises against all but essential travel to:
the whole of Kyrgyzstan based on the current assessment of COVID-19 risks.
Travel to Kyrgyzstan is subject to entry restrictions
British nationals are able to enter Kyrgyzstan.
A negative PCR test, taken no more than 72 hours before your arrival by flight or 120 hours before crossing a land border, is needed for all foreign nationals entering Kyrgyzstan. In case of flight delays or extended transit exceeding 72 hours, the passenger must take a PCR test upon arrival to the country. Requirements could change at short notice. Check with your airline or travel provider before travel.
See Entry requirements
Preparing for your return journey to the UK
If you’re returning to the UK from overseas, you will need to:
provide your journey and contact details before you travel
check if you need to self-isolate on your return
If your return journey to the UK transits another country, you should check whether it is subject to a travel ban or any other additional requirements. If so, contact your travel provider.
Check our advice on foreign travel during the coronavirus (COVID-19) pandemic and sign up for email alerts for this travel advice.
If you’re planning travel to Kyrgyzstan, find out what you need to know about coronavirus there in the Coronavirus section.
During the COVID-19 pandemic, it is more important than ever to get travel insurance and check it provides sufficient cover. See the FCDO guidance on foreign travel insurance.
For information about COVID-19 vaccines, see the Coronavirus page.
The Kyrgyz authorities have lifted most restrictions introduced in response to the Coronavirus. A negative PCR test from no more than 72 hours before your arrival by air, or 120 hours by land, is now needed for entry into Kyrgyzstan. In case of flight delays or extended transit exceeding 72 hours the passenger must take a PCR test upon arrival to the country. See Coronavirus and Entry requirements. Further restrictions could be reintroduced at short notice if the situation deteriorates. You should follow local government advice, and media reporting for notice of changes to Coronavirus requirements.
Terrorist attacks in Kyrgyzstan can not be ruled out. You should be vigilant in public places and follow security advice from the local authorities. See Terrorism.
Take care if you travel to the Oblasts (Provinces) of Osh, Batken and Jalal-Abad. See Local travel
Skirmishes can occur along the disputed Kyrgyz-Tajik border. Previous incidents have involved both civilians and border guards and several have involved firearms. There are also occasional security incidents on the Kyrgyz/Uzbek and Kyrgyz/Kazakh borders. There’s a risk of further localised violence and border closures at any time. You should remain vigilant in border areas and check local media reports before you travel. See Local travel
You should also be aware that Kazakhstan has introduced visa requirements, and has additional entry requirements in place. See the Visas Section of Travel Advice for Kazakhstan for more information.
There is a high risk of earthquakes. See Natural disasters
You must carry your passport, or a notarised copy of it, at all times. See Local laws and customs
Dual nationality isn’t recognised in Kyrgyzstan. If you enter Kyrgyzstan on a Kyrgyz passport and also hold British nationality the British Embassy can only provide very limited consular assistance. In cases of arrest or detention, consular access is unlikely to be granted.
If you’re abroad and you need emergency help from the UK government, contact the nearest British embassy, consulate or high commission.
