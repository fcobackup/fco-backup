Cases of coronavirus (COVID-19) have been confirmed in New Zealand. The New Zealand authorities have introduced a number of measures to limit the spread of the virus.
Entry and borders
Most foreign travellers can no longer enter New Zealand.
New Zealand citizens, permanent residents, residents with valid travel conditions, and their immediate family (partner or spouse, legal guardian, and dependent children under the age of 24) travelling with the New Zealand citizen can still enter New Zealand.
On 9 April 2020, the Government announced that anyone entering the country will be required to undergo quarantine or managed isolation in an approved facility for a minimum of 14 days. You should visit the New Zealand Ministry of Health website for more information.
You should contact your insurance company and airline for the latest travel information, and contact i-SITE if accommodation is needed.
Transit via New Zealand
On 9 April 2020, the UK and New Zealand governments agreed a reciprocal transit arrangement. This permits British citizens and residents to transit through New Zealand airports within a 10-hour window. Conditions apply.
Visas
Holders of a work, student, or visitor visa with an expiry date of 1 April 2020 or earlier and who are unable to leave New Zealand must apply online for a new visa. An interim visa will be issued.
Holders of a work, student, visitor, limited or interim visa with an expiry date of 2 April to 9 July 2020 inclusive who are in New Zealand on 2 April 2020 will have their visas automatically extended to 25 September 2020. Confirmation of extensions will be emailed to all visa holders.
Given the fast changing situation, you should check the latest entry requirements for your destination on the New Zealand Immigration website or check with your airline before you travel.
Local measures
On 21 March 2020, the New Zealand Government introduced a four-level national COVID-19 alert response. The previous level was COVID-19 Alert Level 2 – “Reduce Contact”. New Zealand moved to COVID-19 Alert Level 4 – “Eliminate” (highest level) at 2359 local time on 25 March 2020 for an initial four week period:
Level 4 response measures instruct people to stay at home, and sees educational facilities close, travel severely restricted, and businesses close except for essential services (e.g. supermarkets, pharmacies, clinics) and lifeline utilities.
Full details on the New Zealand Government’s COVID-19 national response alert system can be found on the New Zealand Government COVID-19 website.

On 25 March Prime Minister Ardern declared a State of National Emergency to fight COVID-19. The declaration allows the Director Civil Defence Emergency Management to direct and coordinate personnel, material, and other resources, and provides access to other extra-ordinary powers that will support delivery of an effective and timely response to COVID-19.
The Cook Islands
