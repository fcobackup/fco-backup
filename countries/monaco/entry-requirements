Entry rules in response to coronavirus (COVID-19)
On 27th July, the Monaco Health Department announced new measures applicable to all travellers arriving in the Principality. Regardless of nationality, anyone who wishes to enter the Principality from either:
A region within Europe (the UK, an EU Member State, Andorra, Holy See, Iceland, Liechtenstein, Monaco, Norway, San Marino and Switzerland) which has recorded more than 20 cases per 100,000 people in a week according to the map on the ECDC website
A country outside Europe
must contact the COVID-19 Call Centre as soon as they arrive in Monaco. They will be required to provide their contact details and relevant travel information and then either i) supply evidence of a negative Polymerase Chain Reaction (PCR) test carried out in their country of origin 72 hours before their arrival in the Principality, or ii) agree to undergo a PCR test in Monaco and self-isolate until the result is available. More information is available on the Government of Monaco website.
Yachts visiting Monaco must submit a medical declaration of health for their passengers and crews to the Marine and Airport Police Division of the Police Department 48 hours before making a port of call.
Visas
France handles immigration and customs matters for Monaco. If your passport describes you as a British Citizen you will not need a visa to enter France. Other British passport holders should check the current entry requirements on the website of the French Foreign Ministry and if necessary confirm with the nearest French Diplomatic mission.
Passport validity
You must hold a valid passport to enter Monaco. Your passport must be valid for the proposed duration of your stay. No additional period of validity beyond this is required.
UK emergency travel documents
UK emergency travel documents are accepted for entry, airside transit and exit from Monaco.
