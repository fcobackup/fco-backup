Laws and cultural differences
Alcohol and drug laws   
The laws of Gibraltar are similar to UK laws for alcohol, drugs and anti-social behaviour.
LGBT+ travellers
Same-sex relationships are legal. There is an active LGBT+ community, but due to the small size of Gibraltar, there are few places  which are exclusively LGBT+ orientated.
