This page reflects the UK government’s understanding of current rules for people travelling on a full ‘British Citizen’ passport, for the most common types of travel.
The authorities in Lesotho set and enforce entry rules. For further information contact the embassy, high commission or consulate of the country or territory you’re travelling to. You should also consider checking with your transport provider or travel company to make sure your passport and other travel documents meet their requirements.
Entry rules in response to coronavirus (COVID-19)
Entry to Lesotho
Requirements to enter Lesotho
Fully vaccinated travellers (i.e. those who have taken a full course of WHO-recognised COVID-19 vaccine) are allowed to enter Lesotho with a valid vaccination card or certificate with a unique identifier in the form of a QR or bar code that can be verified. The last dose must have been taken at least 14 days before travel.
Partially vaccinated and unvaccinated travellers must show a negative PCR test result that was obtained no more than 72 hours before arrival at the border.
Unvaccinated Basotho and Lesotho Residence Permit holders may take a Rapid Antigen Test when entering Lesotho at their own cost, or may be offered free vaccination.
Children 5 years and below are exempted from requiring vaccination or a negative COVID-19 test.
Requirements to exit Lesotho
The same requirements set out above are also required on exiting Lesotho. In addition, travellers who have recently recovered from COVID-19 and cannot obtain a negative PCR certificate may present a letter of exemption from the Ministry of Health.
Lesotho residents in permitted categories may re-enter Lesotho using the same PCR test that they presented on exit for a period of 14 days from the test date.
Where a negative COVID-19 PCR test is required, this should show:
the name of the traveller (which must correspond with their travel document)
a serial number which is not duplicated
clear and visible proof that the certificate was issued within 72 hours
the date on which the swab was taken and the date the results were provided to the traveller
the name of the testing laboratory approved by the Minister responsible for health
Travellers departing from the UK should not use the NHS testing service to get a test in order to facilitate your travel to another country. You should arrange to take a private test.
Lesotho residents may re-enter Lesotho using the same PCR test that they presented on exit for a period of 14 days from the test date.
Screening on arrival and departure
Everyone entering Lesotho will be screened for coronavirus.
You should comply with any additional screening measures.
Quarantine requirements
Travellers showing symptoms of coronavirus will be required to self-isolate at their permanent or temporary residence or may be placed in an isolation facility in a government hospital at their own expense.
Data collection
Travellers entering Lesotho may be required to provide details of where they will be staying to aid the Government’s efforts to tackle COVID-19.
If you need further information about entry requirements, contact the local immigration authorities or the nearest Lesotho High Commission.
Regular entry requirements
Visas
British nationals can obtain entry visas on arrival. Overstaying without proper authority is a serious matter. You may be held in detention.
