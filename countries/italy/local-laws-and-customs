By law you must be able to show some form of identification at all times.

The police will normally ask for your full passport if you are stopped while driving.
Tickets on public transport must be endorsed in a ticket machine before you start a journey. The machines are usually positioned at the entrance to platforms in railway stations, in the entrance hall to metro stations and on board some buses and trams.
