Earthquakes
The Portuguese Civil Protection authorities in the Azores have been monitoring an increase in seismic activity on the island of São Jorge since 19 March. As a precaution, they have now activated their earthquake prevention plan and have advised against all but essential travel to the island.
The areas of flat terrain, known locally as Fajãs, at the foot of the cliffs overlooking the sea in the Velas municipality are being evacuated due to the possibility of landslides following a yellow weather warning that is predicting heavy rain and high winds. Follow local authority advice on the Civil Protection authority’s general website or download the Prociv Azores app. Check also the municipal Facebook pages for Velas and Calheta for advice that is specific to these municipalities (in Portuguese).
Information of seismic activity can be followed on the Earthquake Information and Surveillance Centre’s website (in Portuguese). Further general advice on what to do in the event of a tremor is also available online in Portuguese.
Forest fires
There’s an increased risk of forest fires during summer months and when the weather is hot and dry. Forest fires are highly dangerous and unpredictable. If you’re travelling at these times, check the weather conditions with the Portuguese Met Office and areas where fires may be active with the local Civil Protection authorities. If you see a forest fire, call the emergency services on 112.
Take care when visiting or driving through woodland areas. Make sure cigarette ends are properly extinguished, do not light barbecues and do not leave empty bottles behind. Causing a forest fire is treated as a criminal offence in Portugal even if unintentional.
