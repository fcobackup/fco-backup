On 20 March, the Government of Vanuatu announced the closure of the country’s borders. All international flights in and out of the country are suspended until further notice. If you hold a ticket for an outbound flight, please stay in touch with your airline or travel provider for any updates.
If you hold a short term visa for Vanuatu which is close to expiry, you should report to the Director of Immigration in order to have your visa extended.
