From 4 July, Brunei is exempt from the FCO advice against all non-essential international travel. This is based on the current assessment of COVID-19 risks.
Travel to Brunei is subject to entry restrictions
Entry to Brunei is severely restricted. It is not yet clear which exceptional circumstances, if any, foreign nationals may be permitted to enter Brunei.
If the Government of Brunei permits you entry, you will be required to go into quarantine on arrival at a government booked facility (usually a local hotel).
All foreigners will have to pay $350 BND for a COVID-19 test upon arrival, and will need to cover the cost of their stay in a quarantine facility (15 days from the date of arrival).
See Entry requirements for more information before you plan to travel.
