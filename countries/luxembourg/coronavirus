Other measures
The Luxembourg Government has announced its exit strategy (in English), which outlines the resumption of activities in successive phases.
Under the first phase, which began on 20 April, construction and gardening/landscaping activities restarted, and recycling centres and DIY shops reopened. Some senior secondary school classes resumed on 4 May.
The second phase will began on 11 May with the reopening of shops and other commercial establishments. However, restaurants, bars, café, cinemas, sports halls and restaurants will remain closed until at least 1 June. Outdoor sports activities without physical contact and of a non-competitive nature can resume.
Hairdressers and beauticians can open on an appointment only basis, and cultural institutions, including libraries and museums will reopen within a strict framework of reduced numbers and online reservations.
Social visits are permitted indoors for up to six people (plus members of the household), and outdoor gatherings of up to 20 people are authorised.
Secondary schools resumed. Pupils returning to school will be separated and masks will be obligatory where the two-metre social distancing requirement cannot be guaranteed.
The third phase will begin on 25 May with the opening of primary schools, crèches and childcare facilities.
Gatherings will remain prohibited until 31 July, with the exception of funerals, civil weddings with a maximum of 20 people and where the 2-metre social distancing requirement can be respected.
Face masks
It is mandatory to wear a mask (or anything else covering the mouth and nose, such as a scarf), to be worn in situations where the social distancing requirement cannot be met e.g. supermarkets and on public transport.
