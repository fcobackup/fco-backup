Crime
Violence and street crime are rare. However, there have been reports of people walking between La Linea (Spain) and Gibraltar at night being attacked and robbed.
Crossing between Spain and Gibraltar
The Gibraltar-Spain border is a busy external Schengen Border and Gibraltar is outside the customs union. You may experience delays crossing the border by road or on foot due to the high volume of traffic at peak times, and customs and immigration/identity checks. Take water with you during the hot summer months.
