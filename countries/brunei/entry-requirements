If you’re staying longer than 90 days and/or visiting for non-tourist purposes, you will need to get a visa from the nearest Brunei diplomatic mission before you travel.
Passport validity  
Your passport should be valid for a minimum period of 6 months from the date of entry into Brunei. You should ensure that your passport is in good condition, without damage.
Dual nationality
