Entry rules in response to coronavirus
Grenada Government announced in January 2022 that travellers recently infected with COVID may be allowed to enter Grenada with certain documentation as evidence of recovery . See below and the Ministry of Health website.
Entry to Grenada
The Prime Minister has announced that the testing and vaccination requirement for arriving passengers will be discontinued from 4 April. Details will be available on the Ministry of health website in due course. Until then, only fully vaccinated visitors will be allowed entry into Grenada, with some exemptions. See the exemption list for more details.
The Government of Grenada announced on 15 February with immediate effect that as an alternative to obtaining a negative COVID PCR test result within 3 days, arrivals can also obtain a negative antigen test within 1 day of travel. Travellers must also complete an online health declaration form before arrival. You will receive your approved health certificate automatically upon submission but will no longer be required to present this before boarding a flight to Grenada. On arrival you must present your health certificate, your negative PCR or antigen test result and your vaccination card. Full details are on the Ministry of health website.
The Grenada Government announced in January 2022 that travellers recently infected with COVID may be allowed to enter Grenada with a positive COVID viral test on a sample taken no more than 90 days before arriving AND a letter from a licensed healthcare provider or health official stating you were cleared to travel AND a negative rapid antigen test taken no more than one (1) day before arrival. Full details are on the Ministry of Health website.
The ban on entry for people with a travel history to South Africa, Namibia, Zimbabwe, Botswana, Lesotho and Eswatini in the last 14 days, has now been lifted.
These rules are subject to change and should be checked regularly. You should not use the NHS testing service to get a test in order to facilitate your travel to another country. You should arrange to take a private test.

Testing/screening and quarantine on arrival
Grenada Government announced that from 15 November you do not need to quarantine on arrival if you are fully vaccinated and arrive with a negative PCR test.
