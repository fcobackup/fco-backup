The information on this page covers the most common types of travel and reflects the UK government’s understanding of the rules currently in place. Unless otherwise stated, this information is for travellers using a full ‘British Citizen’ passport.
The authorities in the country or territory you’re travelling to are responsible for setting and enforcing the rules for entry. If you’re unclear about any aspect of the entry requirements, or you need further reassurance, you’ll need to contact the embassy, high commission or consulate of the country or territory you’re travelling to.
You should also consider checking with your transport provider or travel company to make sure your passport and other travel documents meet their requirements.
Restrictions in response to coronavirus
Airports in Slovenia re-opened for passenger flights on 11 May. Scheduled flights are operating, but at present, there are no direct flights to the UK. You should consult airlines for details of flight options, to and from Slovenia.
Passenger train connections between Slovenia and Austria remain suspended.
The Slovene authorities have announced new border entry procedures.
Health checks are conducted at all border entry points. If you display signs of coronavirus infections you will be refused entry, unless you hold a permanent residence permit for Slovenia.
On 13 June, the Slovenian authorities imposed a 14-day quarantine on all arrivals to Slovenia from the UK, irrespective of nationality or residence status in Slovenia, unless they meet one of the exemptions (see below).
On 18 June, the Slovenian authorities extended a 14-day quarantine to anyone of any nationality arriving into Slovenia from countries listed on the National Institute for Public Health “red list”. There are currently 34 countries on the Red List, including the UK, USA, Sweden, Gibraltar, Serbia, Bosnia & Herzegovina and Kosovo. A full list of the countries on the “red list” can be found here (in Slovene).
Anyone required to enter into quarantine will need to provide an address (where they will be staying) to the Border authorities. Failure to do so may result in the Border authorities denying you entry. During self-isolation, you are required to stay in your accommodation and not socialise outside of your household. You can take short walks for exercise, but should maintain social distancing and not engage with people from outside your household. The local municipality can make arrangements for the delivery of essential supplies if friends or family cannot support you.
You will not be required to undertake a 14-day self-isolation period on arrival in Slovenia if you satisfy one of the exemptions below. Some of these exemptions also require travellers to have a negative coronavirus test, no more than 3 days old. Exemptions from quarantine include:
People transiting Slovenia while traveling to another country within 12 hours after the entry:
People with diplomatic passports;
People who provide services for which they have been issued a certificate by the competent ministry and if imposing a quarantine could result in major social or economic damage due to the non-provision of these services; (with a negative coronavirus test, no more than 3 days old)
workers in international transport.
A full list of the exemptions can be found at the Slovenian Government website here
All arriving travellers will be given advice at the border, regarding the steps they may need to take.
There are restrictions in place at Slovenia’s border with Austria. Non-Slovene or non-Austrian nationals must cross at one of three border crossings:
Karavanke-Karawanken Tunnel
Ljublej-Loibtunnel
Šentilj-Spielfeld
Only Slovene and Hungarian citizens may use border crossing between Slovenia and Hungary. Non-Slovene and non-Hungarian nationals must cross the Slovenia-Hungary border at one of the following border crossings:
Dolga vas-Redics
Pince-Torniyszentmiklos
If you enter Slovenia you are advised to carry with you evidence of your reason for travel (for example, onward travel bookings; proof of residency; a work permit).
Neighbouring countries have reduced restrictions on entry from Slovenia. See travel advice for Austria, Croatia, Hungary and Italy.

If you remain in Slovenia, you should be aware that for stays longer than 90 days, you will be required to register as a Temporary Resident. This requires you to submit a form requesting temporary residency, which should be sent to the Slovene authorities via registered post as proof of your application. Contact the Uprava Enota (the department that handles these applications) at +386 1 306 3035 or at ue.ljubljana@gov.si. The department is open Monday to Thursday from 0800-1800, and on Friday from 0800-1400.
