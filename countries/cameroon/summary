The Foreign and Commonwealth Office (FCO) advise against all travel to:

Following violent and deadly clashes between demonstrators and the Cameroonian security forces in the North West and South West regions in September and October 2017, there have been curfews, a ban on public meetings and other restrictions put in place. There have also been exchanges of fire between the Cameroonian security forces and armed groups in November and December in Eyumojock, Akwaya and Mamfe in Manyu Division of the South West region killing over a dozen people. The city of Buea (South West region) is calm but tensions remain high in Mamfe (South West region) and Bamenda (North West region). Once a week a general strike is observed in parts of the two regions. If you’re in these regions, you should remain vigilant and keep in touch with developments through local media.
Terrorists are very likely to try to carry out attacks in Cameroon. The terrorist group Boko Haram is active in the Far North region but attacks could occur anywhere including major towns and cities such as Yaoundé and Douala. In 2016 and 2017, there have been numerous suicide attacks which have resulted in over 200 dead in the Far North region. Key targets have been large open markets, hotels, parks and sporting venues. There have also been attempts to take hostages and heavy gunfights reported in Babouang and Mbarang in Adamaoua region.
Boko Haram has publicly threatened Cameroon with attacks and further kidnappings due to Cameroon’s involvement in the regional fight to counter Boko Haram. There’s a heightened threat of kidnap to western nationals in the north of Cameroon, including in the major cities and along the border between the Far North region and Nigeria.You should remain vigilant and exercise caution.

There have been reports of criminality including large armed gangs and highway bandits, stopping travellers, taking hostages and demanding payment, particularly in the east of Cameroon, close to the Central African Republic (CAR) border. There are frequent instances of violence in CAR spilling across the border to Cameroon.
Criminality by large gangs is also a threat more widely in Adamawa province. In January 2017, an armed group attacked a UN border monitoring team near the Nigerian border killing 5 people.
Nigerian military operations in the states of Borno, Yobe and Adamawa in Nigeria could have an impact across the border in Cameroon.
