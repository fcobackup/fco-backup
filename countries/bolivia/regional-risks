Warning
FCDO advises against all but essential travel to parts of Bolivia.

This section has safety advice for regions of Bolivia. It only covers regions where FCDO has specific advice.
You should also read FCDOâ€™s overall travel advice and safety and security advice.
Chapare Region of Cochabamba Department
FCDO now advises against all but essential travel to the Chapare region of Cochabamba Department. This includes Villa Tunari and highway routes 4 and 24 that pass through Chapare. This is due to a high level of gang-related violent crime predominantly linked to the production and trafficking of illegal drugs.
Tourists are not usually targeted; however, you could be a victim of violence due to mistaken identity or by getting caught up in a security incident involving others.
It is difficult for the British Embassy to provide in-person emergency or consular support in these areas. The local authorities may also be very limited in the help they can provide.
