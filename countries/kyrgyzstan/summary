The Kyrgyz authorities have lifted most restrictions introduced in response to the Coronavirus, including around entry requirements and on business operations. See Staying during coronavirus and Entry requirements. Restrictions could be reintroduced at short notice if the situation deteriorates again. You should follow local government advice, and media reporting for notice of changes to Coronavirus requirements.
Terrorist attacks in Kyrgyzstan can’t be ruled out. You should be vigilant in public places and follow security advice from the local authorities. See Terrorism.

Skirmishes can occur along the disputed Kyrgyz-Tajik border. Previous incidents have involved both civilians and border guards and several have involved firearms. There are also occasional security incidents on the Kyrgyz/Uzbek and Kyrgyz/Kazakh borders. There’s a risk of further localised violence and border closures at any time. You should remain vigilant in border areas and check local media reports before you travel. See Local travel
You should also be aware that Kazakhstan has introduced new visa requirements, and currently has additional entry requirements in the place. See the Visas Section of Travel Advice for Kazakhstan for more information.

Dual nationality isn’t recognised in Kyrgyzstan. If you enter Kyrgyzstan on a Kyrgyz passport and also hold British nationality the British Embassy can only provide very limited consular assistance. In cases of arrest or detention, consular access is unlikely to be granted.
If you’re abroad and you need emergency help from the UK government, contact the nearest British embassy, consulate or high commission.
