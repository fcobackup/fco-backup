This page reflects the UK government’s understanding of current rules for people travelling on a full ‘British Citizen’ passport, for the most common types of travel.
The authorities in Bolivia set and enforce entry rules. For further information contact the embassy, high commission or consulate of the country or territory you’re travelling to. You should also consider checking with your transport provider or travel company to make sure your passport and other travel documents meet their requirements.
Restrictions in response to coronavirus
Flight restrictions from Europe have been lifted. Passengers arriving from all countries require a PCR test taken up to 72 hours before flying and is required for everybody over 5-years of age to enter Bolivia. On arrival you must quarantine for 10 days, and pay for a PCR test on the 7th day of quarantine. Tourists must show proof of medical insurance that will cover the cost of COVID treatment.
You should not use the NHS testing service to get a test in order to facilitate your travel to another country. You should arrange to take a private test.
You should check specific requirements with your airline. The border with Brazil is temporarily closed. Other land, river and lake border crossings have been opened by Bolivian authorities, but Paraguay is the only neighbouring country that has opened its borders so far.
Regular entry requirements
Visitor visas
British nationals don’t need a visa to visit Bolivia. The length of stay permitted on entering Bolivia is initially 30 days. This can be extended for a further 60 days, at no extra charge, as long as you apply before the end of the 30 day period at one of the Department of Immigration offices throughout the country. The Department of Immigration has imposed an annual limit for tourists of 90 days in Bolivia without a visa. If you want to stay for a longer period seek advice from the Bolivian Embassy in London or the Department of Immigration office in La Paz at Avenida Camacho No. 1468.
Make sure you get an entry stamp when you arrive in Bolivia, otherwise you’ll have to pay a fine to leave. If you enter Bolivia overland, make sure your passport is stamped on both sides of the border, with an exit stamp from the country you are leaving and an entry stamp on the Bolivian side - you may need to ask for directions to the immigration office. The British Embassy can’t intervene in immigration issues.
Many countries in the region are not allowing entry to foreign citizens and are likely to need valid documents for entry, so you should check with authorities before planning to leave.
Residence permits and other types of visas
The Bolivian Immigration authority (Dirección General de Migración) has introduced new procedures and requirements for British nationals applying for residence permits and other types of visas in Bolivia. New requirements now include a police certificate of criminal records from the UK, which you can get from the Association of Chief Police Officers website. If you need any documents from the UK, get them translated into Spanish and legalised at the Foreign Commonwealth and Development office in London.
Visit the Bolivian Immigration authority for more information.
Passport validity
Your passport should be valid for a minimum period of six months from the date of entry into Bolivia. Full valid passports are shipped from the UK. Applications from Bolivia for replacements will experience delay, due to suspension of flights and courier services.
