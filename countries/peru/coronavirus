See the TravelHealthPro website for further advice on travel abroad and reducing spread of respiratory viruses during the COVID-19 pandemic.
International travel
Passengers at the airport will need to follow strict regulations, including the mandatory use of masks and facial protectors (usually a clear plastic full-face covering) and social distancing
At present, commercial airlines are operating to and from Peru and the wider Americas (up to 8 hours flying time). On December 21, President Sagasti announced a two week ban on all flights originating in Europe. This follows the earlier announcement of an indefinite suspension of direct flights from the UK and those with a stopover in the UK. In addition, non-Peruvian citizens or residents who have been in the UK in the last 14 days will be prohibited from entering Peru. If travelling via another country, it is essential you check the Travel Advice for that country, as some currently do not permit transit to/from the UK
