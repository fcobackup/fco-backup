The information on this page covers the most common types of travel and reflects the UK government’s understanding of the rules currently in place. Unless otherwise stated, this information is for travellers using a full ‘British Citizen’ passport.
The authorities in the country or territory you’re travelling to are responsible for setting and enforcing the rules for entry. If you’re unclear about any aspect of the entry requirements, or you need further reassurance, you’ll need to contact the embassy, high commission or consulate of the country or territory you’re travelling to.
You should also consider checking with your transport provider or travel company to make sure your passport and other travel documents meet their requirements.
Entry rules in response to coronavirus (COVID-19)
Entry to Hungary
From 1 September, Hungary has closed its border to all foreign nationals, including UK nationals, for an indefinite period due to the coronavirus pandemic. Only Hungarian nationals are currently allowed entry into the country. There are some limited exemptions where foreign nationals, including UK nationals, may be allowed entry:
military convoys,
people travelling on diplomatic or official passports,
people transiting through Hungary (through travel corridors),
special rules may be put in place for foreign nationals attending or participating in some sports events, such as the Super Cup Final scheduled for 24 September in Budapest.
Entry rules may change at short notice. You can find the latest announcements on the Hungarian government website (in English).
Transiting through Hungary
All foreign nationals transiting through Hungary must undergo a medical examination at the border and show no symptoms of COVID-19. You must be able to prove what your destination is, the reason you are travelling and that you are able to transit to your final destination. Throughout the transit you can only use specified routes (more information is available in Hungarian here), dedicated petrol and rest stations and specific border crossing points
Testing / screening on arrival
Anyone entering Hungary from a country classified as amber or red will undergo a medical check.
Depending on the classification of your country of origin, the result of the medical check and whether you have a valid residency permit in Hungary, you either need to follow a 14-day quarantine rule or you may be denied entry. For specific rules check Entry to Hungary.
Regular entry requirements
Visas
If you hold a British Citizen passport, you don’t need a visa to enter Hungary. If you’re planning a stay of longer than 3 months, see our Living in Hungary guide and contact the Hungarian Embassy if you have further questions.
The rules on travel will stay the same until 31 December 2020.
Passport validity
Your passport should be valid for the proposed duration of your stay; you do not need any additional period of validity on your passport beyond this.
The rules on travel will stay the same until 31 December 2020.
UK Emergency Travel Documents
UK Emergency Travel Documents are accepted for entry, airside transit and exit from Hungary.
Fines
Entry into Hungary can be barred if you have failed to pay a previous fine in Hungary. Contact the Hungarian Embassy in London for guidance on paying any outstanding fines before you next enter Hungary.
Customs regulations
Community regulations ensure the free movement of goods between EU member states. This means that no customs procedures are required for exporting goods from Hungary to another EU member state and/or for importing goods from a member state to Hungary. The export and import of goods purchased for non-commercial purposes (for personal use or as gifts) while travelling is not restricted, however, the transport of certain goods (such as: pets, hunting weapons, alcohol and tobacco products, medicines containing drugs, etc.) within the European Union is restricted or subject to special permissions.
Check the customs regulations before entering or leaving Hungary on the National Tax and Customs Administration of Hungary website.
