The currency of Haiti is the Gourde. Although the US dollar is widely cited on menus and price lists, the Government of Haiti announced in 2018 that all commercial transactions would be carried out in the Haitian Gourde.
Avoid using banks or withdrawing money at public cash points (see Crime). Don’t change money on the street. You can exchange US dollars cash or travellers’ cheques for local currency in large hotels or the large supermarkets in Port au Prince.
Most credit cards can be used in major hotels, and in some shops and businesses in the large towns and cities. However, there is a risk of credit card cloning and theft.
