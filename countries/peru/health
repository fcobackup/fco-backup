At least 8 weeks before your trip, check the latest country-specific health advice from the National Travel Health Network and Centre (NaTHNaC) on the TravelHealthPro website. Each country-specific page has information on vaccine recommendations, any current health risks or outbreaks, and factsheets with information on staying healthy abroad. Guidance is also available from NHS (Scotland) on the FitForTravel website.
General information on travel vaccinations and a travel health checklist is available on the NHS website. You may then wish to contact your health adviser or pharmacy for advice on other preventive measures and managing any pre-existing medical conditions while you’re abroad.
The legal status and regulation of some medicines prescribed or purchased in the UK can be different in other countries. If you’re travelling with prescription or over-the-counter medicine, read this guidance from NaTHNaC on best practice when travelling with medicines. For further information on the legal status of a specific medicine, you’ll need to contact the foreign embassy, high commission or consulate of the country or territory you’re travelling to.
While travel can be enjoyable, it can sometimes be challenging. There are clear links between mental and physical health, so looking after yourself during travel and when abroad is important. Information on travelling with mental health conditions is available in our guidance page. Further information is also available from the National Travel Health Network and Centre (NaTHNaC).

Coronavirus
There is an ongoing outbreak of coronavirus (COVID-19) in China, but cases have been confirmed in other countries, including Peru.
The Foreign and Commonwealth Office (FCO) advise against all but essential travel to Peru, due to the ongoing coronavirus (COVID-19) pandemic and in line with various controls and restrictions imposed by the Peruvian authorities, including a ban on all flights to and from Europe and Asia from 16 March for at least 30 days. Flights from Peru to the USA are currently operating. British nationals in Peru should follow the advice of the Peruvian authorities. We strongly encourage non-Resident British nationals in Peru to consider leaving to avoid difficulties they will face if flights out of the country and the region are further restricted and they are unable to get home.
On 12 March Peru announced a ban on all flights arriving from and departing to Europe and Asia with effect from Monday 16 March. The ban is for 30 days and could be extended.
Private and public school classes in Peru have been suspended until 30 March.
