This travel advice covers Israel and the Occupied Palestinian Territories
There are ATMs in Israel and Jerusalem that accept international cards. There are fewer ATMs in the West Bank and Gaza. Scottish and Irish banknotes canâ€™t be exchanged in Israel or the Occupied Palestinian Territories. Money transfer through Western Union to a local Israeli post office normally takes 3-4 hours during a normal working day. Post offices and banks in Israel and Jerusalem close from midday on Friday to Sunday morning. In the West Bank and Gaza they are usually just closed on Fridays.
Purchasing property
There are risks involved with purchasing property in Israeli settlements on land considered to be occupied under international law in East Jerusalem, the rest of the West Bank, and the Golan. Potential purchasers should be aware that a future peace deal between Israel and the Palestinians, or between Israel and Syria, could have consequences for property they purchase in these settlements.
