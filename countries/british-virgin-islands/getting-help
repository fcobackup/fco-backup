The Foreign, Commonwealth & Development Office (FCDO) cannot provide tailored advice for individual trips. Read this travel advice and carry out your own research before deciding whether to travel.
As the British Virgin Islands (BVI) is a British Overseas Territory, there is no formal British diplomatic or consular representation and the local authorities deal with all requests for emergency assistance.
Emergency services in the British Virgin Islands
Telephone: 911 (ambulance, fire and police)
You can also use the telephone number 311 to contact the police.
Contact your travel provider and insurer
Contact your travel provider and your insurer if you are involved in a serious incident or emergency abroad. They will tell you if they can help and what you need to do.
Refunds and changes to travel
For refunds or changes to travel, contact your travel provider. You may also be able to make a claim through insurance. However, insurers usually require you to talk to your travel provider first.
