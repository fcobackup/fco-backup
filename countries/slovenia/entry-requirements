The information on this page covers the most common types of travel and reflects the UK government’s understanding of the rules currently in place. Unless otherwise stated, this information is for travellers using a full ‘British Citizen’ passport.
The authorities in the country or territory you’re travelling to are responsible for setting and enforcing the rules for entry. If you’re unclear about any aspect of the entry requirements, or you need further reassurance, you’ll need to contact the embassy, high commission or consulate of the country or territory you’re travelling to.
You should also consider checking with your transport provider or travel company to make sure your passport and other travel documents meet their requirements.
Entry rules in response to coronavirus (COVID-19)
Entry to Slovenia
Airports in Slovenia re-opened for passenger flights on 11 May. You should consult airlines for details of flight options, to and from Slovenia.
International passenger train connections have re-started. Visit the Deutsche Bahn website for the latest schedule
The Slovene authorities have announced new border entry procedures.
Testing/screening on arrival
Health checks may be conducted at all border entry points. If you display signs of coronavirus infections you will be refused entry, unless you hold a permanent residence permit for Slovenia.
Quarantine requirements
The Slovenian authorities have implemented a Red, Amber, Green list to determine the requirements for people arriving into Slovenia. The UK is currently on the Green List. Full details can be found on the Ministry of the Interior website.
Anyone arriving from a country on the Green List and who has not visited or transited through a country on the Red List, will not be required to enter into quarantine on arrival.
Anyone arriving from a country on the Red List will be required to enter into 14 day quarantine on arrival, unless they meet one of the exemptions listed below.
For travellers arriving from countries that are on neither the Green nor the Red List, restrictions will be imposed if you are not a Slovene Citizen nor hold permanent or temporary residence in Slovenia.
Anyone required to enter into quarantine will need to provide an address (where they will be staying) to the Border authorities. Failure to do so may result in the Border authorities denying you entry. During self-isolation, you are required to stay in your accommodation and not socialise outside of your household. You can take short walks for exercise, but should maintain social distancing and not engage with people from outside your household. The local municipality can make arrangements for the delivery of essential supplies if friends or family cannot support you.
If you are travelling from a country on the Amber or Red list, you will not be required to undertake a 14-day self-isolation period on arrival in Slovenia if you satisfy one of the exemptions below. Some of these exemptions also require travellers to have a negative coronavirus test, no more than 3 days old. Exemptions from quarantine include:
People transiting Slovenia while traveling to another country within 12 hours after the entry:
People with diplomatic passports;
People who provide services for which they have been issued a certificate by the competent ministry and if imposing a quarantine could result in major social or economic damage due to the non-provision of these services; (with a negative coronavirus test, no more than 36 hours old)
workers in international transport.
A full list of the exemptions can be found at the Slovenian Government website
All arriving travellers will be given advice at the border, regarding the steps they may need to take.
On 21 August, Croatia was added to Slovenia’s Red List. This means anyone entering Slovenia who has visited Croatia since 21 August, must enter into 14 days of quarantine on arrival, unless they fall under one of the exemptions listed above.
There are restrictions in place at Slovenia’s border with Italy. Non-Slovene or non-Italian nationals must cross at one of three border crossings:
Vrtojba‒St. Andrea
Fernetiči‒Fernetti
Škofije‒Rabuese
Krvavi potok‒Pesse
There are restrictions in place at Slovenia’s border with Austria. Non-Slovene or non-Austrian nationals must cross at one of three border crossings:
Karavanke-Karawanken Tunnel
Ljublej-Loibtunnel
Šentilj-Spielfeld
If you enter Slovenia you are advised to carry with you evidence of your reason for travel (for example, onward travel bookings; proof of residency; a work permit).
Neighbouring countries have reduced restrictions on entry from Slovenia. See travel advice for Austria, Croatia, Hungary and Italy.
If you remain in Slovenia, you should be aware that for stays longer than 90 days, you will be required to register as a Temporary Resident. Contact the Uprava Enota (the department that handles these applications) at +386 1 306 3035 or at ue.ljubljana@gov.si. The department is open Monday to Thursday from 0800-1800, and on Friday from 0800-1400.
Regular entry requirements
Visas  
If you hold a British Citizen passport, you don’t need a visa to enter Slovenia. If you’re planning a stay of longer than 3 months, see our Living in Slovenia guide and contact the Slovene Embassy if you have further questions.
The rules on travel will stay the same until 31 December 2020.
Visas from 1 January 2021
The rules for travelling or working in Europe will change from 1 January 2021:
You will be able to travel to countries in the Schengen area for up to 90 days in any 180-day period without a visa for purposes such as tourism. This is a rolling 180-day period.
Therefore, if you’re travelling to Slovenia, previous visits to the Schengen area within the 180 days before your date of travel would count against the 90-day limit.
If you are travelling visa-free to Slovenia and to other countries in the Schengen area, make sure your whole visit is within the limit.
To stay for longer, to work or study, or for business travel you will need to meet the entry requirements set out by Slovenia. This could mean applying for a visa or work permit. You should check with the Slovene Embassy what type of visa, if any, you will need.
Periods of stay authorised under a visa or permit will not count against the 90-day limit.
The European Commission has not yet set out how the limit of 90 days in any 180-day period for visa-free travel will be implemented for those who are already travelling in the EU or Schengen Area on 31 December 2020.
If you are travelling to Slovenia before 31 December 2020 and will stay until 1 January 2021 or later, you should check with the Slovene Embassy for information on how the 90-day visa-free limit will apply to you. This also applies if your stay includes travel to other Schengen area countries.
At border control for Slovenia, you may need to:
show a return or onward ticket
show you have enough money for your stay
use separate lanes from EU, EEA and Swiss citizens when queueing
Your passport may be stamped on entry and exit.
Passport validity
The rules on travel will stay the same until 31 December 2020.
Your passport should be valid for the proposed duration of your stay; you do not need any additional period of validity on your passport beyond this.
Passport validity from 1 January 2021
From 1 January 2021, you must have at least 6 months left on an adult or child passport to travel to most countries in Europe (not including Ireland).
If you renewed your current passport before the previous one expired, extra months may have been added to its expiry date. Any extra months on your passport over 10 years may not count towards the 6 months needed.
Check your passport is valid for travel before you book your trip. You will need to renew your passport before travelling if you do not have enough time left on your passport.
UK Emergency Travel Documents
UK Emergency Travel Documents (ETDs) are accepted for entry, airside transit and exit from Slovenia.
