The information on this page covers the most common types of travel and reflects the UK government’s understanding of the rules currently in place. Unless otherwise stated, this information is for travellers using a full ‘British Citizen’ passport.
The authorities in the country or territory you’re travelling to are responsible for setting and enforcing the rules for entry. If you’re unclear about any aspect of the entry requirements, or you need further reassurance, you’ll need to contact the embassy, high commission or consulate of the country or territory you’re travelling to.
You should also consider checking with your transport provider or travel company to make sure your passport and other travel documents meet their requirements.
Visas
All British passport holders need a tourist or business visa to enter Tanzania. You can get one from the Tanzanian High Commission before you travel. Tanzania has also introduced an ‘e-visas’ system which allows applications to be submitted and approved online without the need to visit their High Commission in London.
It is possible to get a tourist or business visa for a single entry on arrival at main ports of entry to Tanzania, but this is subject to the fulfilment of all immigration requirements. You may be asked to provide proof of your return journey. You will not be able to get a multiple entry visa on arrival. For further information about visas visit the Tanzanian Ministry of Home Affairs website.
If you are planning to work or volunteer, you will need a valid work permit. Your employer or volunteer organisation should arrange this before you travel.
From December 2015, Carrying on Temporary Assignment (CTA) passes are no longer valid. If you’re working on a short term assignment you must apply to the Ministry of Labour and Employment for a short term work permit. The application should be submitted prior to entering the country.
If you overstay the validity of your visa or permit you can be arrested, detained and fined before being deported. Reports made to the British High Commission by Black, Asian and Minority Ethnic (BAME) British passport holders have indicated that they are experiencing additional levels of harassment from immigration officials. In these circumstances, you should stay calm and request that the Consular section of the British High Commission is immediately informed.
Passport validity
Your passport should be valid for a minimum period of 6 months from the date of your visa application.
UK Emergency Travel Documents
UK Emergency Travel Documents, with a minimum of six months’ validity, are accepted for entry, airside transit and exit from Tanzania.
