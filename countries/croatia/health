Before you travel check that: 
your destination can provide the healthcare you may need
you have appropriate travel insurance for local treatment or unexpected medical evacuation
This is particularly important if you have a health condition or are pregnant. 
Emergency medical number 
Dial 112 and ask for an ambulance. 
Contact your insurance or medical assistance company quickly if you’re referred to a medical facility for treatment. 
Vaccine recommendations and health risks

Healthcare in Croatia 
FCDO has a list of medical facilities in Croatia, where some staff will speak English. 
Health insurance cards 
To get medically necessary state healthcare in Croatia, you need a Global Health Insurance Card (GHIC) or a European Health Insurance Card (EHIC).
The NHS’s getting healthcare abroad webpage has details about:
how to apply for a GHIC
how to get temporary cover if you lose your card or it does not arrive in time
who qualifies for a new EHIC instead of a GHIC
what treatment counts as medically necessary
A GHIC or EHIC is not an alternative to travel insurance. In Croatia there is always a charge for treatment, which can be up to 530 euros. You may have other costs your GHIC or EHIC does not cover, including: 
changes to travel and accommodation bookings
additional standard costs for treatment
medical repatriation to the UK
treatment that is ruled non-urgent
private healthcare
private clinics
There is also guidance on healthcare if you’re living in Croatia.
Travel and mental health 
Read FCDO guidance on travel and mental health. There is also mental health guidance on TravelHealthPro.
