The UK government is working closely with airlines, the Lebanese authorities and other governments to make sure options are available for you to return to the UK as soon as possible. While Lebanon’s borders remain closed, the Lebanese Government is permitting a limited number of flights to operate on an exceptional basis to facilitate the repatriation of stranded travellers.
MEA flights to London on 14 - 24 May 2020
There may be a limited number of seats available on exceptional Middle East Airlines (MEA) commercial flights (ME203) from Beirut to London daily between 14 - 24 May, for British Nationals and their direct dependants wishing to return to the UK.
If you wish to travel on any of these flights, please contact MEA to book your ticket. This can be done via the telephone on +961 1 629 999 or on the internet at www.mea.com.lb. Please do not contact the British Embassy to reserve your flight.
Once you have booked your ticket, please send a scan or clear photograph of the photo page of your passport, along with a copy of your booking confirmation, to the Embassy using the following email address beirut.consular@fco.gov.uk.
All travellers will need a valid travel document and the right to enter the United Kingdom.
In light of the road travel restrictions currently in place as part of measures to contain the COVID-19 outbreak, you should arrange your journey to the airport as soon as possible, and aim to arrive at least two hours in advance of the scheduled departure time.
Tickets will not be on sale at the airport. Do not travel to the airport without a confirmed ticket.
If you cannot leave Lebanon at this time, you should:
follow the advice of local authorities, including local measures to help minimise your risk of exposure to coronavirus
find accommodation that’s suitable for your needs
keep in regular contact with family and friends at home, so they know you are safe and well
