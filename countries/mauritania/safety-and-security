Political situation
Presidential elections last took place on 22 June 2019 and were won by Mohamed Ould Ghazouani. President Ghazouani was inaugurated on 1 August 2019, marking the first constitutional transfer of power in Mauritania since independence in 1960. You should avoid political gatherings and demonstrations, and follow the advice of local authorities. Always observe instructions given by the local security forces.
Crime
Crime levels are moderate but steadily increasing. You should avoid the unlit and isolated beaches at Nouakchott and ‘Le Cinquième’ district where a number of thefts and violent incidents have taken place after dark.
Local travel
Crossing the border into Mauritania can be time-consuming and officials may ask for payments before they allow you to cross. You should check local advice before travelling towards neighbouring countries in case border crossings are closed or congested.
Road travel
The conditions of paved roads in Mauritania are generally poor, and overland travel is difficult. Use four wheel drive vehicles, check the tide times on coastal roads, travel in convoy and make sure you have adequate supplies of water and fuel on long journeys. Driving standards can also be poor.
You can drive with a valid UK driving licence.
If you’re planning to hire a car, check with your car hire company for information on their requirements before you travel.
