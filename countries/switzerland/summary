The FCDO advises against all but essential travel to:
the whole of Switzerland based on the current assessment of COVID-19 risks.
On 20 December, Switzerland announced a general entry ban for all travellers from the UK, and suspended all flights between the UK and Switzerland. On 23 December, the Swiss Government introduced an exemption to allow passenger flights to/from the UK from 24 December for the purpose of enabling residents of UK and Switzerland to return in both directions. If you are planning to travel to/from the United Kingdom please contact your travel operator. Further updates will be published when they are available. Check our advice on things to consider, and be prepared to stay overseas longer than planned.
Anyone arriving in Switzerland from the United Kingdom since the 14 December, regardless of nationality, is required to self-isolate for 10 days from the date of arrival. British citizens currently in quarantine who intend to travel to the airport will need to follow protective measures to remain in quarantine; your local cantonal authorities will be able to advise on this, which may include avoiding public transport.
If you are returning to the UK from Switzerland, you will need to self-isolate on your return (unless you are exempt). Check the latest guidance for England, Northern Ireland, Scotland and Wales.
Travel is subject to entry restrictions
Travellers from the UK are not permitted to enter Switzerland. However, there are limited exceptions. This does not apply to UK nationals who hold a residence or cross-border permit for Switzerland
Travellers from the UK, including those who have arrived since 14 December, must go into quarantine for 10 days
See Entry requirements for more information before you plan to travel.
Preparing for your return journey to the UK
If you’re returning to the UK from overseas, you will need to:
provide your journey and contact details before you travel
check if you need to self-isolate on your return
In addition to flight options for returning UK residents resuming from 24 December, the land border remains open enabling overland return travel. There are currently no restrictions on travelling through France to the UK but this is subject to change. Due to the current situation we strongly advise to contact your transport provider and consult the travel advice for France before you travel.
