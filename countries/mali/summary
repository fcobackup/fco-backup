The Foreign and Commonwealth Office (FCO) advise against all travel to:
the provinces of Tombouctou, Kidal, Gao and Mopti
parts of the provinces of Kayes, Koulikoro and Segou, as shown on the map
The FCO advise against all but essential travel to the rest of Mali, including Bamako.
Terrorists are very likely to try to carry out attacks in Mali, including kidnaps. There is a heightened risk of attack in Bamako. Attacks could be indiscriminate, including in places visited by foreigners. Terrorist attacks against a hotel in Bamako in November 2015 and the Le Campement Resort in Kangaba, on the outskirts of Bamako, in June 2017 resulted in multiple casualties, including foreign nationals and tourists.
You should be vigilant, especially in places such as hotels, restaurants, bars, nightclubs, shopping areas, markets, transport hubs, places of worship and businesses with western interests. You should keep a low profile and follow the advice of local authorities. Avoid all large gatherings, including music festivals and sporting events. The Festival au Désert in Timbuktu was cancelled in January 2017 and has not taken place since due to security concerns. Festivals in other parts of the country, such as the Festival sur le Niger in Segou, are also vulnerable to attack.
During public holidays and festivals, including New Year celebrations, security measures in Mali can be heightened due to the ongoing threat posed by terrorist organisations. During such periods you should exercise increased vigilance and avoid large gatherings. If you think a particular venue would present a good target for terrorist activities then you should consider whether you need to visit it. You should exercise caution and limit your movements during holiday and festival periods. See Terrorism
A nationwide state of emergency in place since November 2015 has been extended several times, most recently in October 2018 by one year until 31 October 2019. You should expect a robust security presence including police patrols and possible police security checks on restaurants and hotels. There are likely to be more vehicle and personal security checks during this time and nobody will be exempt.
Recent public demonstrations in Bamako have encountered a strong police and security force presence. You should stay away from all political demonstrations and any blockades set up by the police and security forces.
You should maintain several days’ stock of food and water in case disturbances take place. You can monitor daily developments in English through the BBC World Service (88.9 FM in Bamako).
If you’re abroad and you need emergency help from the UK government, contact the nearest British embassy, consulate or high commission. Consular support is severely limited in parts of Mali, especially outside Bamako.
Take out comprehensive travel and medical insurance before you travel.
