Crime
Extreme poverty means that levels of crime, especially in the capital Niamey, are high. Thefts, robberies and residential break-ins can occur at any time. The main type of incident for which British nationals need consular assistance in Niger is theft. Take sensible precautions to keep important items like money, passports, jewelry and mobile phones safe. The areas around the Gaweye Hotel, National Museum and Petit Marché in Niamey are particularly prone to muggings and you should not walk alone there, or cross the Kennedy Bridge on foot at any time. Walking at night is dangerous due to the lack of street lighting.
Car thieves often target off-road vehicles. Make sure car doors are locked at all times.
Banditry, smuggling and other criminal activity is common in border areas, especially after dark.
Bandits are thought to be operating in the border area with Nigeria south of Zinder. You should take special care and avoid crossing the border with Nigeria during the hours of darkness.
There have also been incidents of Nigeriens being killed in the course of hold-ups and robberies on public transport buses travelling between Tahoua and Agadez and between Agadez and Arlit.
Scams
British nationals are increasingly being targeted by scams. The scams come in many forms: romance and friendship, business ventures, work and employment opportunities, and can pose great financial risk to victims. You should treat with considerable caution any requests for funds, a job offer, a business venture or a face to face meeting from someone you have been in correspondence with over the internet who lives in West Africa.
Local travel
Travel around Niger can be difficult, and conditions are poor for overland travel. You should take all necessary safety precautions, especially outside of main urban areas, have confidence in your security arrangements and maintain a high level of vigilance.
Avoid all travel between towns at night. Seek local advice and use local travel agents and guides when travelling outside main towns and in desert areas. An approved local travel agent can arrange all the necessary permits for your journey and leave details of your itinerary with the local authorities. Travel in convoy and carry an independent satellite phone when travelling off the beaten track. You should prepare well in advance and make sure you have a sufficient supply of drinking water and food.
Northern and eastern Niger
Local authorities are extremely sensitive about foreigners travelling out of Tahoua to other parts of Niger in the east and the north. There is a risk of arrest and deportation for even enquiring about travel to Agadez, given the security situation in that region.
The following roads in northern Niger are permanently closed to tourists, except with special authorisation:
Chirfa (Djado) / Djanet (Algeria)
Achouloma (north Djado) / Salvador Pass (Libya)
Adrar Bous (north Aïr) / Djanet (Algeria)
Adrar Bous (north Aïr) / In Azawa (Algeria)
Agadez / Arlit / Iferouane
Agadez / Tahoua
The MNJ armed group has launched attacks in the north including the use of land mines, and Islamist terrorist groups have recently launched attacks in Agadez, Arlit and against a prison in Niamey. The Governor of the city of Agadez has banned vehicles without a security forces escort from leaving the city after 4pm. Attacks against tourists are known to take place at El Meki between Agadez and Timia. The Aïr and Ténéré regions are particularly prone to attacks.
A curfew has been implemented in the whole of the Diffa region since 2014. As of 19 April 2019, this prohibits the movement of motorised vehicles from 7pm to 5am.
Western Niger
A state of emergency has been in place in the urban municipality of Tillabéri since February 2019. The movement of motorcycles and cars is banned from 7pm to 6am, and the movement of pedestrians is banned from 10pm to 6am. Public meetings are banned, unless expressly permitted by the authorities. Defence and security forces are authorised to carry out searches, and to check identities, both day and night.
A state of emergency has also been in place in Ouallam, Ayorou, Bankilare, Abala and Banibongou (Tillabéri region) and Tassara and Tillia (Tahoua region) since March 2017.
Southern Niger
A state of emergency is in place in the states of Borno and Yobe in Nigeria, which border Niger.
Road travel
You can drive in Niger using an International Driving Permit (IDP) for up to 3 months. If you’re staying longer than 3 months, you’ll need to get a Niger licence.
If you’re driving on an IDP, you should have the 1968 version IDP to drive in Niger. 1949 IDPs previously issued by the UK may no longer be accepted in Niger. You can only get IDPs over the counter from 2,500 UK Post Offices. You will not be able to buy an IDP outside the UK, so get one before you travel.
You should carry car registration documents with you at all times.
The main roads between Niamey and other large towns are generally satisfactory by African standards, but some roads are pot-holed. Driving standards are poor. Vehicles are often poorly lit at night and there is little street lighting. There have been reports of land mines being used in Burkina Faso on the road between Ouagadougou and Niamey. Seek local advice before making this journey.
Buses operate on routes between Niamey and other large towns, but distances are long and buses are prone to mechanical failure. There have also been incidents of Nigeriens being killed in the course of hold-ups and robberies on public transport buses travelling between Tahoua and Agadez and between Agadez and Arlit.
Taxis are available but are often in poor mechanical condition. Driving standards are poor.
In the case of an accident, you should go immediately to the nearest police station to file a report: remaining on the spot risks being taken to task, sometimes violently, by the local population. Medical help in the event of an accident is likely to be limited.
Political situation
President Issoufou was elected in April 2011. He won a second 5-year term in March 2016. Niger has contributed troops to the UN Peacekeeping Mission (MINUSMA) in neighbouring Mali and is committing troops to the regional fight against Boko Haram.
There has recently been an increase in demonstrations in Niamey. Protests, marches and demonstrations can occur with little prior notice. If you become aware of any nearby protests, marches or demonstrations, you should move away from the area immediately, as the atmosphere can change quickly and without warning.
Consular assistance
The British Ambassador to Niger resides in Bamako, Mali. Consular support is limited in Niger as there is no British Embassy. However, the British Embassy in Bamako, Mali can provide consular support to British nationals
