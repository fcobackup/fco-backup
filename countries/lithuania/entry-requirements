Entry rules in response to coronavirus (COVID-19)
Entry to Lithuania
From 00:00 7 September 2020, British nationals resident in the UK will need to provide proof of a negative COVID-19 PCR test on arrival in Lithuania. This is in addition to the requirement to self-isolate for 14 days on arrival. The test must be a PCR swab test. Other test results, including antibody tests, are not accepted. The test must be taken no earlier than 72 hours before. Lithuanian border authorities will not consider text message confirmation of results as sufficient proof – proof of results must include the name of the individual, along with the date and time of the test. Lithuanian border authorities reserve the right to refuse entry to individuals who fail to comply with these requirements.
Individuals travelling to Lithuania by air or sea will need to complete a registration form prior to arrival. Registration forms can be filled out on paper during your journey, or in advance online. If you are travelling to Lithuania by land, you must complete the registration form within 12 hours of arrival.
On arrival in Lithuania from a country where the incidence of COVID-19 has exceeded 16 cases per 100,000 of population in the last 14 days, you must self-isolate for 14 days. It is recommended that you use your own vehicle or ask a member of your household to take you to your place of isolation. Updated information on which countries this applies to can be found on the Lithuanian Government Korona Stop website.
On arrival in Lithuania from a country where the incidence of COVID-19 has exceeded 25 cases per 100,000 of population in the last 14 days you must self-isolate for 14 days and present proof of a negative COVID-19 test carried out up to 72 hours before your arrival in Lithuania.
