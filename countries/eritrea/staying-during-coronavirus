This page gives you guidance on how to stay safely in Eritrea as a visitor, if you are unable to return to the UK.
Everyone should comply with the measures put in place in Eritrea to limit the spread of coronavirus (COVID-19).
Moving around in Eritrea

Finance
There is a range of financial support from the government that you can access while you are unable to return due to coronavirus restrictions.
If you’re in Eritrea, and have exhausted all other options to cover essential living costs while you wait to return home, you could apply for an emergency loan for your living costs from the UK government. You can only apply if you normally live in the UK and you cannot return home. This last-resort option is for those most in need, and you would need to repay the loan when you are back in the UK. Apply for an emergency loan.
