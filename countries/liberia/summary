The FCDO advises against all but essential travel to the whole of Liberia based on the current assessment of COVID-19 risks.
Travel to Liberia is subject to entry and exit restrictions
Before travelling to Liberia you must have a negative coronavirus test result conducted by an accredited lab not more than 96 hours before arrival in Liberia.
On arrival in Liberia, you will be screened for coronavirus. You must be tested on arrival in Liberia (there are some exemptions).
If you have travelled from India, Pakistan, Bangladesh, Nepal or Brazil in the previous 14 days you must stay in managed quarantine on arrival, at your own cost, for a minimum of 8 days.
See Entry requirements for more information before you plan to travel.
To leave Liberia, you must have a negative coronavirus test result and a travel certificate issued by the National Public Health Institute of Liberia (there are some exemptions).
If you display symptoms of coronavirus, or test positive, public health officials may take you to a government quarantine facility or treatment unit.

Liberia’s banking sector is currently experiencing cash shortages (of both US dollars and Liberian dollars). Banks and foreign exchange facilities may be unable to pay out transferred funds or fulfil ATM withdrawals. Bring sufficient funds, in US dollars cash, to cover all expenses. See Money.
Protests and demonstrations do take place in Monrovia on occasion. You should avoid protests, demonstrations, political rallies, large gatherings and crowds and follow the advice of local authorities.
Terrorists are likely to try to carry out attacks in Liberia. Attacks could be indiscriminate. You should be vigilant, especially in places visited by foreigners. See Terrorism
General medical facilities throughout Liberia are unable to provide the same standard of healthcare as in the UK. Facilities in rural areas are rudimentary. Many medical facilities expect to be paid up-front for treatment. If you travel to Liberia, stay in contact with your employer or host organisation about the support that they can provide to you while you’re in the country.
If you’re concerned that you might have been exposed to, or showing symptoms of Ebola or Lassa fever, you should seek immediate medical advice. If you’re in the UK call NHS on 111.
Avoid travelling at night outside Monrovia, except to or from Roberts International Airport. Make sure you have pre-arranged transport from the airport. See Crime and Road travel
The small British Embassy in Monrovia can only offer limited consular assistance.
If you’re abroad and you need emergency help from the UK government, contact the nearest British embassy, consulate or high commission.
