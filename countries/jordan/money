Cash machines are available throughout Amman and in other major towns and cities. ATMs are less widely available in rural areas, though most petrol stations on major roads offer ATMs.
The Central Bank of Jordan announced on 17 March that it will allow banks to remain open on Wednesday 18 March and Thursday 19 March exclusively for the purpose of delivering salaries to citizens and disbursing temporary unemployment allowances and maternity allowances for clients who do not have ATM cards. However, banks will be closed for other types of services between Wednesday 18 March and Tuesday 31 March. ATMs will continue to operate.
