There are commercial flight options to return to the UK from Montenegro on indirect flights. Schedules are limited and are subject to change at short notice. Border crossings are open, subject to entry requirements in neighbouring countries. See Entry Requirements.
Flights
If you have booked, or are looking to book, flights between Montenegro and the UK, you should be aware that cancellations are possible. We recommend that you contact your airline for the latest information.
If you are a British national who wishes to leave Montenegro by car, please contact the British Embassy in Podgorica, for help with obtaining the necessary country exit permit from the Montenegrin authorities.
You will need to pay for your return travel to the UK. If departure options are available but you cannot afford the travel costs and have exhausted all other options for getting funds, you may be eligible to apply for an emergency loan from the government. This is a last resort option and you would need to repay the loan when you are back in the UK.
For more information, you should contact Corporate Travel Management (CTM). CTM are a commercial partner of the FCO and are authorised to administer such loans on behalf of the FCO.

See also the list of people who are exempt from the border rules.
The National Travel Health Network and Centre (NaTHNaC) also provides advice on how to stay safe as you travel by air.
