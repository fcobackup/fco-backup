Iraq remains subject to regional tensions. Militant groups opposed to western presence in Iraq continue to pose a threat to UK and other interests in Iraq – including through attacks on Global Coalition military bases, diplomatic premises, and foreign nationals. It is possible that the security situation could deteriorate quickly. The situation remains uncertain and could worsen at short notice. You should avoid any rallies, marches or processions, and follow the instructions of local authorities. See Political and security situation
There is a possibility of an increased threat against Western interests, including against UK citizens. You should remain vigilant, have robust security arrangements and contingency plans in place, keeping these under review, and keep up to date with the latest developments, including via the media and this travel advice.
In the event of a sudden deterioration in the security station, there may be limits to the assistance the FCDO can provide. You should not assume that the FCDO will be able to provide assistance to leave the country.
You may be eligible to obtain a visit visa on arrival in federal Iraq. Check visa requirements with the Iraqi Embassy in London, or the Iraqi Consulate in Manchester before you travel. In the Kurdistan Region of Iraq (KRI) you can obtain a 30 day visa on arrival at Erbil and Sulaimaniah International Airports. This is valid for travel in the KRI only. See Visas
The Iraqi Prime Minister announced the territorial defeat of Daesh in Iraq on 9 December 2017. However, terrorists are still very likely to try to carry out attacks in Iraq. You should remain vigilant and monitor media reports. See Terrorism
There’s also a high threat of kidnapping throughout the country, including from both Daesh and other terrorist and militant groups, which can be motivated by criminality or terrorism. You should review your security arrangements regularly and consider carefully any travel plans around the country. See Kidnap
Turkey conducts regular military action in the north of the Kurdistan Region of Iraq (KRI) and, occasionally, further south. There is particular risk in mountainous areas, especially around Qandil, Makhmur, and near the border with Turkey. Crossing points along the Iraq-Turkey border may also be affected. See Kurdistan Region
The government of Iraq is taking measures to improve the structural integrity of the Mosul Dam as there is a risk the dam could fail. It’s currently impossible to accurately predict if or when this might occur. See Local travel
If you’re abroad and you need emergency help from the UK government, contact the nearest British embassy, consulate or high commission. Consular support is severely limited in Iraq. The British Embassy in Baghdad and the British Consulate-General in Erbil operate a limited consular service by appointment only. The Embassy and Consulate-General’s ability to visit locations across Iraq is limited and travel to unsecure areas to deliver consular services may not be possible.
Take out comprehensive travel and medical insurance before you travel.
