Be prepared for your plans to change
No travel is risk-free during COVID-19. Countries may further restrict travel or bring in new rules at short notice, for example due to a new COVID-19 variant. Check with your travel company or airline for any transport changes which may delay your journey home.
If you test positive for COVID-19, you may need to stay where you are until you test negative. You may also need to seek treatment there.
Plan ahead and make sure you:
can access money
understand what your insurance will cover
can make arrangements to extend your stay and be away for longer than planned
Accommodation
Resorts, hotels and cottages reopened at the beginning of July 2020. We recommend you check before you travel.
Public spaces and services
Face masks are required to be worn indoors when travelling by bus, ferry (excluding the outdoor decks), taxi, limousine or minibus. Face masks are also required to be worn indoors when working in or visiting health service providers, prisons and at the airport.
Businesses may prefer to continue to require face masks be worn by people entering their premises or accessing their services. If so, all customers must comply with the mask policy of the business.
For further information on coronavirus regulations, you should consult the Bermuda Government website.
