There are no confirmed cases of coronavirus (COVID-19) in Lesotho. However the Lesotho authorities have introduced a number of precautionary measures in response to the coronavirus pandemic.
Travel restrictions and borders
Restrictions on movement are in place until 5 May.
Lesotho’s borders are closed until 5 May. Movement of persons in or out of Lesotho is prohibited. SAA Airlink flights between Maseru and Johannesburg Airport have been suspended.
Moshoeshoe International Airport and the border crossing points at Maseru Bridge, Caledonspoort (Butha Buthe), Maputsoe Bridge, Qacha’s Nek Bridge and Vanrooyens Gate (Mafeteng) remain open, but with reduced operating hours, for conveyance of essential goods and services only.
Non-essential travel within and outside the country is prohibited except for the transport of food, medical supplies and essential household goods. Entry/Exit to provide or receive emergency medical services for a life threatening condition is allowed, with approval from the Ministry of Home Affairs.
For information on how to return to the UK from Lesotho, see Return to the UK.
Travel via South Africa
The Ministry of Foreign Affairs have told us that foreign national visitors travelling home will be allowed to leave Lesotho. However, visitors to Lesotho must travel through, or transit via, South Africa. Since 18 March, South Africa has put in place travel restrictions and visa requirements for individuals from countries affected by coronavirus, including the United Kingdom.
We understand that the South African High Commission Maseru is temporarily closed but may still issue visas in emergency situations.
South Africa has announced the closure of its airspace from midnight on 26 March until at least the end of April. Follow our travel advice for South Africa and consult your nearest South African High Commission for further information on return flights to the UK.
Health Screening
Prior to the closure of the borders, the Government announced that all travellers arriving in Lesotho would be screened for coronavirus. Anyone entering Lesotho should comply with any additional screening measures by the authorities if asked to go through extra checks. Anyone showing symptoms of coronavirus may be placed in an isolation facility in a government hospital.
All individuals who have been in coronavirus affected areas within the past 14 days, including the UK, are required to self-isolate for 14 days. The Prime Minister of Lesotho has announced that this self-isolation period will take place in a government-nominated hotel at the visitor’s expense.
If you need further information about entry requirements, contact the local immigration authorities or the nearest Lesotho High Commission.
Local measures
On 25 March the Government of Lesotho announced restrictions on movement from midnight on 29 March until 21 April. The restrictions have now been extended until 5 May. Everyone in Lesotho must stay at home except for purchase of food and essential household shopping or to access medial services. Schools are closed. Supermarkets and food shops are operating reduced hours (8am – 2pm Monday to Friday).
All gatherings are prohibited (except funeral services of no more than 50 people).
Where travel by vehicle is necessary to obtain essential goods and services, restrictions are in place to limit the number of passengers carried. Private vehicles are allowed to carry one person (in addition to the driver) seated behind the front passenger seat.
Public transport is only permitted to operate between 8am and 4pm.
Medical care
Medical care in Lesotho is limited. Most expatriates use medical facilities in South Africa. Access to these facilities is currently restricted due to the new South African visa requirements.
Entry/Exit to provide or receive emergency medical services for a life threatening condition is allowed, with approval from the Ministry of Home Affairs.
If you take regular medication, you should ensure you have sufficient supply for the full duration of the Lesotho and South Africa lockdowns. Pharmacies are classified as an essential service and will remain open, with reduced hours. Most medicines that require a prescription from a doctor in the UK will require one in Lesotho. If necessary, you should obtain an electronic subscription from your medical practitioner to enable a local doctor to write on. Ask your insurer or you accommodation provider, to help you find one.
