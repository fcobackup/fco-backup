Government of India ‘Vande Bharat’ Air India flights
The Government of India is operating a series of repatriation flights under its ‘Vande Bharat’ mission, to return Indians stranded abroad to India.
Travellers in India wishing to return to the UK are also able to book seats on the outbound flights from India to the UK.
How to book
Air India is managing the booking process for these flights. For information on schedule, eligibility and to book, visit the Air India website. The British High Commission cannot assist with ticketing.
The number of seats is limited and we understand that website traffic is heavy. Monitor the Air India website for any availability.
We advise that if you are a British national with a confirmed seat on these Air India flights you carry identification, a copy of your confirmed flight ticket and a permission letter which is available for download. You should follow the instructions of local authorities.
Further information

Travel to the airport
Do not travel to the airport without a confirmed ticket.
You should allow plenty of time to get to the airport as travelling may be more difficult than normal. You should make sure you are able to show authorities proof of a booked flight (a boarding pass if possible) and your passport.
It may not be possible to buy food or water on the way to the airport, so get these before you travel.
At the airport
You will not be able to travel if you are currently showing coronavirus symptoms (you will need to self-isolate and travel later). You should comply with any additional healthcare screening measures put in place by the authorities prior to your departure.
