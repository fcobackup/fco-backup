Public protests against Russia’s invasion of Ukraine may happen at short notice. These have been peaceful but may mean that areas of central Prague become crowded. Transport hubs may be busier as a result of Ukrainian nationals arriving into the Czech Republic.
Crime
Most visitors to the Czech Republic experience no difficulties but you should be aware of street crime and petty theft, particularly in Prague.
Prague city police advise visitors to:
always exchange currency at a currency exchange office or bank, never on the street as this money is often counterfeit
avoid contact with women and men acting as street prostitutes as they are often pickpockets
take care when using cash machines
the sale and distribution of drugs is illegal and the drugs are often hazardous counterfeits
be aware of consumption charges in night clubs; they are often high. Be careful with consumption cards, which carry high financial penalties if they are lost before the bill is paid
Take care of yourself and your belongings in the same way as you would do in the UK. Take precautions against pickpockets and bag snatchers and don’t leave your belongings or food / drinks unattended.
Petty theft is a problem, especially in major tourist areas in Prague. Try to avoid busy carriages on the metro and trams, which are favoured by pickpockets. There is also a risk of pick-pocketing on flights from the UK. It is best to keep your passport and valuables with you before and during your flight.
Beware of bogus plain-clothes policemen, who may ask to see your foreign currency and passport. If approached, don’t show your money, but offer instead to go with them to the nearest police station. If you suspect that you are dealing with a bogus police officer, you can call 158 or 112 to check their identity. No police officer in the Czech Republic has the right to check your money or its authenticity. 
Report any thefts in person to the Czech police within 24 hours and get a police report crime number. Prague police station (Jungmannovo namesti 9, Prague 1 – nearest metro stop is Mustek) is open 24 hours and has English translators. There’s also a police station at the airport where you can get a police report. It’s possible to obtain a reference number for a crime related incident by reporting it to a police station in the UK, but it’s much better to report the crime in the Czech Republic.
If your passport is lost or stolen you will need to get a police report and apply for an Emergency Travel Document from the British Embassy in Prague.
Every lamppost in Prague has a 6-digit number posted at eye-level. Should you need assistance from the police or emergency services, these codes will help pinpoint your location if you’re unable to offer an exact address.
Local travel
If you’re travelling in a group keep a careful note of your hotel telephone number and address in case you are separated from the rest of your party. Leave contact details of your travelling companions with a friend or relative at home who you can contact if you get separated from your group.
Every year there are accidents involving trams. Take extra care when near tram tracks and make sure you look both ways. Trams can’t stop quickly.  
Seasonal flooding (normally during the Spring) occurs occasionally. Check the Ministry of Agriculture website for more information. By selecting ‘Enter’ you’ll see a map of the country which showing any current flood warnings.
Taxis
It’s safer to use a major taxi company like Tick Tack tel: 14 144 or AAA tel: 233 113 311. If you do pick up a taxi in the street, always check the fare per km before getting in. Some taxis can charge highly inflated prices. The rates should be clearly marked on the side of the taxi.
