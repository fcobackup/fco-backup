Preparing for your return journey to the UK
Uruguay is on the red list for entering England. Check what you must do to enter England, Scotland, Wales or Northern Ireland.
If your return journey to the UK transits another country, you should check whether it is subject to a travel ban or any other additional requirements. If so, contact your travel provider.
Only Uruguayan nationals and legal residents are allowed to enter Uruguay at present. Exemptions may be granted in special circumstances. For information on getting a coronavirus test, health declaration, pre-authorisation to enter and the Uruguayan Government’s Coronavirus App. See Entry requirements

Around 20,000 British nationals visit Uruguay every year. Most visits are trouble-free.
Most criminal incidents occur in Montevideo, where opportunistic street crime is on the rise. Take care of your personal belongings at all times and be aware of your surroundings. Take particular care in and around the downtown and port areas. Don’t walk through these areas alone or at night; consider taking a taxi if necessary. See Crime
Carry a photocopy of your passport and keep the original document in a safe place.
There’s a zero tolerance limit for driving under the influence of alcohol. See Road travel
Although there’s no recent history of terrorism in Uruguay, attacks can’t be ruled out. See Terrorism
You can contact the emergency services by calling 911.
If you’re abroad and you need emergency help from the UK government, contact the nearest British embassy, consulate or high commission.
