This page reflects the UK government’s understanding of current rules for people travelling on a full ‘British Citizen’ passport, for the most common types of travel.
The authorities in Cameroon set and enforce entry rules. If you’re unsure how Cameroon’s entry requirements apply to you, contact its UK embassy, high commission or consulate.
You should also consider checking with your transport provider or travel company to make sure your passport and other travel documents meet their requirements.
Entry rules in response to coronavirus (COVID-19)
Entry to Cameroon
There are multiple commercial flight options to enter and leave Cameroon. See Coronavirus
Travel requirements to enter and exit Cameroon can change without notice and without proactive communication. The Centre for the Coordination of Public Health Emergency Operations conditions of entry and exit to Cameroon website is the best source of the latest information.
The British High Commission understands that the following requirements apply:
If you have proof of at least two doses (or the Jansen vaccine single dose) COVID-19 vaccination, you are no longer required to present a negative PCR test to enter Cameroon.
If you are not vaccinated or do not have proof of your COVID-19 vaccination, and are five years old or over, you must provide a recent (no older than 72 hours before first boarding) negative coronavirus PCR test to board your flight to Cameroon and to enter at Yaoundé or Douala Airports. (Some airlines demand a PCR test from travellers aged two and above, so check with your airline.)
Negative coronavirus test results should be in PDF format, clearly stating the date of the test and the type of test. Electronic copies are accepted.
You should not use the NHS testing service to get a test in order to facilitate your travel to another country. You should arrange to take a private test.
Testing/screening on arrival
All international travellers are subjected to rapid flow testing for Coronavirus on arrival at Yaoundé and Douala international airports. These tests are compulsory. Results are returned while passengers are at the airport. There is no fee.
Quarantine requirements
If you have a proof of a recent (no older than 72 hours before boarding) negative coronavirus test, you will normally not have to self-isolate. Anyone that has developed symptoms of Coronavirus on their travel or tests positive on arrival at Yaoundé or Douala airport will be held for further enquiries to trace contacts and movements. We believe that anyone testing positive can quarantine at the location of your host or private accommodation until a negative PCR test is produced. These requirements are regularly evolving.
Exit requirements
Negative PCR certificates are no longer required for all passengers leaving Cameroon, and are only necessary if it is the requirement of your country of destination. Call 1506 for any complaints regarding airport checks.
If you require a PCR test to leave Cameroon, you will be charged a standard rate of FCFA 30,000 in Yaoundé, Douala or other large cities. You can request and pay for a test online. You can also pay in-person at various sites including: the National Public Health Laboratory in Yaoundé, the Laquintinie Hospital in Douala and the Regional Hospital Centre in Garoua. For further information on the testing process, you should call 1510. Your country of destination or transit may have other requirements.
Travellers leaving Cameroon are frequently asked for their Yellow Fever certificate as they pass through security. You should carry it with you as you pass through the airport.
Regular entry requirements
Visas
You will need a visa to enter Cameroon.
Visa applications should be made online, through the visa portal. There have been technical problems with this online visa system since its implementation in May 2023, which has prevented many from obtaining visas.
There is currently no visa-on-arrival service at either Yaoundé or Douala International Airport.
If you have a query about your immigration status while in Cameroon, contact the General Delegation for National Security in Yaoundé (telephone: +237 22221 2884).
Dual nationality
Cameroon does not recognise dual nationality in adults. If you have acquired British citizenship but previously held Cameroon citizenship, or as an adult still hold a Cameroon passport, you should not attempt to enter Cameroon on your Cameroonian passport because this is against the law.
Passport validity
Your passport should be valid for a minimum period of six months from the date of entry into Cameroon.
Yellow fever certificate requirements
You must present a yellow fever certificate upon arrival in Cameroon, and you may be asked for it on exit as well. Check the requirements by visiting the National Travel Health Network and Centre’s TravelHealthPro website.
