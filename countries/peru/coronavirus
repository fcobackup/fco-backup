Coronavirus travel health
Check the latest information on risk from COVID-19 for Peru on the TravelHealthPro website.
See the TravelHealthPro website for further advice on travel abroad and reducing spread of respiratory viruses during the COVID-19 pandemic.
International travel
Passengers at the airport will need to follow strict regulations, including the mandatory use of two masks and social distancing.
Commercial airlines are operating to and from Peru. If travelling via another country, it is essential you check the travel advice for that country, as some currently do not permit transit to/from the UK.
Some airlines are flying to some destinations in Europe from Lima on a weekly basis.
Entry and borders
See Entry requirements to find out what you will need to do when you arrive in Peru.
Returning to the UK
When you return, you must follow the rules for entering the UK.
You are responsible for organising your own COVID-19 test, in line with UK government testing requirements. The Peruvian authorities provide guidance on public health centres in Lima and laboratories that process tests in the country (only available in Spanish). COVID-19 PCR tests are widely available in both public clinics and private labs in Peru. Some regions in Peru, outside Lima, do not have private lab facilities and rely entirely on public facilities.
Be prepared for your plans to change
No travel is risk-free during COVID. Countries may further restrict travel or bring in new rules at short notice, for example due to a new COVID-19 variant. Check with your travel company or airline for any transport changes which may delay your journey home.
If you test positive for COVID-19, you may need to stay where you are until you test negative. You may also need to seek treatment there.
Plan ahead and make sure you:
can access money
understand what your insurance will cover
can make arrangements to extend your stay and be away for longer than planned
Travel in Peru
On 15 March 2020, Peru announced a national State of Emergency, which has now been extended until at least 30 September 2021. The latest tier-based regulations will be in effect until at least 19 September.
Peru has been placed under a four-tier system of restrictions (Extreme, Very High, High and Moderate). Measures to contain the virus include curfews, restricted opening hours and reduced capacity limits in shops and other enclosed spaces. There is a requirement to wear masks in all public places (including outdoors) and two masks and a face shield in some indoor venues and on public transport.
For information on the tiers and restrictions in each area, you should visit the El Peruano website. Restrictions may change at short notice – you should follow official guidance and the local media for updates. Fines may be imposed for those breaking the rules.
Public places and services
Public places and services may be open or closed, depending on the tier level of the region.

COVID-19 vaccines if you live in Peru
We will update this page when the Government of Peru announces new information on the national vaccination programme. You can sign up to get email notifications when this page is updated.
The Peru national vaccination programme started in February 2021 and is currently using Pfizer-BioNTech and Sinopharm vaccines. The Government of Peru has stated that British nationals resident in Peru are eligible for vaccination, following the same prioritisation scheme as Peruvian nationals, if they choose to join the programme. The Peruvian Immigration Office is requesting all foreign nationals with non-residential status in Peru to register or update their details in their database. They have requested this because they will use the information to inform the national vaccination programme.
On 16 April the Ministry of Health launched a new national vaccine strategy aimed at vaccinating populations by district and province by age group. The vaccines registry (where people can check their vaccine date once available) is available on the government’s website.
Find out more, including about vaccines that are authorised in the UK or approved by the World Health Organisation, on the COVID-19 vaccines if you live abroad.
If you’re a British national living in Peru, you should seek medical advice from your local healthcare provider. Information about COVID-19 vaccines used in the national programme where you live, including regulatory status, should be available from local authorities.
