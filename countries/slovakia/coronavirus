Public spaces and services
The Slovak Government has imposed restrictions on public life to counter the spread of COVID-19.
Over the weekend of 31 October and 1 November, the authorities implemented a nationwide programme of testing for Covid-19. From 2 November, only those with a negative test certificate from the nationwide testing programme are allowed to move freely, including going to work and shopping for non-essentials. Police and shop staff may ask to see your test certificate, and you should carry this paper document with you. There are some limited exceptions for young children and those with certain medical conditions, see text of regulation in Slovak.
In addition to the above, previous restrictions on activities and social distancing rules remain in force:
Facemasks must be worn outdoors in all built-up areas, such as towns and villages. The wearing of facemasks remains compulsory indoors, including on public transport and in shops. Masks are not required in the countryside if you are with others from the same household or can maintain a five-metre distance.
You may only gather in groups of up to 6 people, unless all are from the same household.
Local public transport is running, but face masks are compulsory .
Hotels and guest houses are permitted to remain open, but may close or have reduced or cancelled services in order to comply with nationwide travel restrictions, social distancing and hygiene requirements.
Restaurants, bars and cafés may only operate a takeaway service.
Fitness centres, wellness centres, swimming pools, water parks, saunas, cinemas and theatres are closed.
The number of people in shops is restricted and temperature checks will be carried out at the entrances. You must maintain a two metre distance when queuing.
Supermarkets and chemists have reserved shopping hours between 9am and 11am for those over 65.
Those who chose not to take part in the nationwide testing programme must remain in self-isolation. There are a number of exemptions, including:
Travelling between the hours of 1 am and 5 am
Travelling to take a coronavirus test
Buying food and toiletries at your nearest shop
Visiting a doctor or a pharmacy
For a wedding or christening ceremony, or the funeral of a close friend or relative
Travel to care for relatives or close friends that are vulnerable or unwell
Dog walking is limited to within 100 metres of your home.
Over the weekend of 7 to 8 November, a second round of testing will take place in districts with the highest rates of Covid-19 infection. These districts are mainly situated across the north of the country. A full list of districts affected by the second round of testing are listed on the Slovak Ministry of Defence website (in Slovak). Lists of testing sites have been published on local authorities’ websites and on social media. Testing is free of charge, and you will need to take your ID card or passport. More information including a video showing the testing procedure is on the “I am responsible” website (in Slovak only).
This second round of widespread testing will not be carried out in the two largest cities Bratislava or Kosice, nor in the majority of districts in the south of the country. In these districts, a negative test certificate from the nationwide programme of 30 October to 1 November will remain valid proof for the purpose of travelling freely.
For more information check the Slovak government website in English and the Slovak Public Health Authority (in Slovak only). The International Organisation for Migration (IOM) also has information in English. You should also monitor developments on local English language media such as Radio Slovakia International and The Slovak Spectator.
