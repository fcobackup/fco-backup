The information on this page covers the most common types of travel and reflects the UK government’s understanding of the rules currently in place. Unless otherwise stated, this information is for travellers using a full ‘British Citizen’ passport.
The authorities in the country or territory you’re travelling to are responsible for setting and enforcing the rules for entry. If you’re unclear about any aspect of the entry requirements, or you need further reassurance, you’ll need to contact the embassy, high commission or consulate of the country or territory you’re travelling to.
You should also consider checking with your transport provider or travel company to make sure your passport and other travel documents meet their requirements.
Entry rules in response to coronavirus
Entry to Croatia
UK nationals travelling to Croatia are subject to strict epidemiological measures and must carry evidence of health status (a negative COVID-19 antigen or PCR test result taken up to 48 hours before arrival in Croatia, proof of a vaccination, or a certificate of recovery following a positive test result between 11 and 180 days prior). Travel is permitted within defined purposes, including, but not limited to, residence, business and tourism. In addition to evidence of your negative COVID-19 status, those travelling under the tourism exemption are required to hold a valid accommodation booking or proof of property ownership in Croatia.
In the case of a rapid antigen test, and a stay longer than 10 days in the Republic of Croatia, a test must be repeated within ten days from the date of issuing the first test.
From 13 January 2021, there are additional restrictions if you are travelling to Croatia from South Africa, Brazil or Zanzibar. In addition to holding a negative PCR test result taken within 48 hours prior to arrival, permitted travellers must also undergo a mandatory 14 day self-isolation period on arrival to Croatia. The isolation period can be reduced to 7 days if a subsequent PCR test confirms a negative result.
Individual Croatian Counties may introduce more restricted COVID-19 measures for limited periods of time. Please follow the local authorities’ advice and adhere to the measures in place.
Details of eligibility to travel, possible exemptions, and instructions for arrivals including approved rapid antigen tests are available from the Croatian Ministry of Interior.
Tests are not available at Croatia’s airports. Those seeking a test on arrival will need to contact a clinic directly and may temporarily leave their accommodation to attend a test appointment. See more information about testing centres in Croatia. Tests cost approximately 700 Croatian Kuna and results are generally available within 48 hours.
If you have recovered from COVID-19 within the past three months, you must provide evidence of your recovery with a doctor’s certificate or a negative test result.
Demonstrating your COVID-19 vaccination status
If you live in England, Croatia will accept the NHS COVID Pass or your NHS letter to demonstrate your COVID-19 vaccination status. If you live in Scotland or Wales, Croatia will accept your respective NHS letter to demonstrate your COVID-19 vaccination status. Your NHS appointment card from vaccination centres is not designed to be used as proof of vaccination and should not be used to demonstrate your vaccine status.
Quarantine requirements
UK nationals travelling to Croatia should produce a negative PCR test on arrival in Croatia or self-isolate until a negative test result has been obtained locally. Travellers are advised to check the latest situation with the Croatian authorities before starting a journey, as health requirements may change. It is mandatory for passengers to wear masks on public transport and taxis and in shops and other commercial premises.
Screening on arrival
The Croatian government has introduced a new online entry form to expedite the entry of foreign visitors. You are advised to carry a copy of your accommodation booking or proof of ownership of holiday homes / boats when arriving in Croatia. If you are travelling to Croatia for business, you are advised to carry evidence of a business invitation or meetings.
Restrictions on travel may change at any time. You should check the latest regulations before travelling on the Croatian government website. British citizens are permitted to leave Croatia and it remains possible to return to the UK by air and road.
Regular entry requirements
Visas
The rules for travelling or working in European countries changed from 1 January 2021:
you can travel to Croatia for up to 90 days in any 180-day period without a visa. This applies if you travel as a tourist, to visit for family or friends, to attend business meetings, cultural or sports events, or for short-term studies or training
visits to other EU or Schengen countries do not count towards your 90-day limit in Croatia as it is not in the Schengen area. Visits to Croatia do not count towards your 90-day visa-free limit in the Schengen area
to stay longer, to work or study, for business travel or for other reasons, you will need to meet the Croatian government’s entry requirements. Check with the Croatian Embassy what type of visa and/or work permit you may need
if you stay in Croatia with a residence permit or long-stay visa, this does not count towards your 90-day visa-free limit
Any time you spent in Croatia before 1 January 2021 does not count towards the 90-day visa-free limit.
At Croatian border control, you may need to use separate lanes from EU, EEA and Swiss citizens when queueing. Your passport may be stamped on entry and exit.
You may also need to:
show a return or onward ticket
show you have enough money for your stay
There are separate requirements for those who are resident in Croatia. If you are resident in Croatia, you should carry proof of residence as well as your valid passport when you travel. For further information on these requirements, see our Living in Croatia guide.
Passport validity
Check your passport is valid for travel before you book your trip, and renew your passport if you do not have enough time left on it.
You must have at least 6 months left on an adult or child passport to travel to most countries in Europe (not including Ireland).
If you renewed your current passport before the previous one expired, extra months may have been added to its expiry date. Any extra months on your passport over 10 years may not count towards the 6 months needed.
UK Emergency Travel Documents
UK ETDs are accepted for entry, transit and exit from Croatia and are a valid ID document in Croatia.
