Coronavirus guidance is being updated.
Read what you can and cannot do

Kyrgyzstan has a secular constitution. Most Kyrgyz people are Muslims. You should respect local traditions, customs, laws and religions at all times and be aware of your actions to ensure that they do not offend other cultures or religious beliefs, especially during the holy month of Ramadan or if you intend to visit religious areas. Lack of cultural sensitivity has caused trouble for some unaware foreign nationals.
In 2020, the holy month of Ramadan started on 23 April and finishes on 23 May. See Travelling during Ramadan
Possession and use of drugs is illegal. If you are found guilty, you could face a lengthy prison sentence in basic conditions.
Homosexuality is legal, but not often discussed or recognised publicly. You should take care over public displays of affection. See our information and advice page for the LGBT community before you travel.
Taking photos of anything that could be perceived as being of military or security interest may result in problems with the authorities.
You must carry your passport, or a notarised copy of it, at all times. The police can arrest you if you do not carry ID.
