Coronavirus guidance is being updated.
Read the Prime Minister’s address for the latest information.

Myanmar has suspended all commercial passenger flights in and out of the country, and sealed off all of its land borders to foreigners. International airports will not re-open commercial inbound flights to Myanmar until 15 May.
We know this is concerning for British people trying to leave Myanmar. The UK government is working closely with airlines, the Myanmar authorities and other governments to make sure options are available for you to return to the UK as soon as possible.
If you cannot leave Myanmar at this time, see advice on staying in Myanmar during coronavirus.
Flights
There remain options for British nationals looking to return to the UK.
If you have managed to secure a seat on a special charter flight you should confirm with your airline before travel and continue to monitor your flight until you have received your boarding pass at the airport. Transit via Hong Kong, Singapore and Thailand are not currently possible for most travellers.
Travel via Seoul
On 3, 5, 8, 15, 22 and 29 May, Myanmar Airways International (MAI) are running special flights from Yangon to Seoul, South Korea. British nationals are able to transit through Seoul for up to 24 hours to connect onto other flights to the UK through other transit hubs using Korean Air, Qatar Airways, KLM Dutch Airlines and Emirates Airlines. No pre-flight medical certificate is required at check-in at Yangon but passengers must show a confirmed onward ticket from Seoul Incheon Airport to their destination.
Details of the MAI flights are on the MAI website, email csc@maiair.com or telephone + 95 1 967 0007. You will need to refer to your travel agent for connecting flights from Seoul. Please check the MAI website and with your travel provider before departure to the airport.
On airside arrival in Seoul passengers will be temperature-checked and made to complete a questionnaire on health and travel history. Anyone displaying a high temperature or a high-risk travel history will be made to pass immigration to take a COVID-19 test. A positive result will lead to admission into a South Korean hospital. A negative result will result in 14 days quarantine in a government facility at passengers’ expense (c £1000). Asymptomatic passengers will be free to transit to their connecting flights. Airside transit hotels are available in both terminals at Seoul Incheon Airport.
Travel via Kuala Lumpur
There is a possible repatriation flight to Kuala Lumpur, from where connections to the UK are available, being arranged by the Malaysian Embassy. If you are interested in this opportunity, register directly with them.
UK nationals are not allowed to enter Malaysia but can transit - see our travel advice for Malaysia. You will be required to pay for the flight and will be responsible for arranging your own onward journey back to the UK. The British Embassy has no further details of if and when this flight will be confirmed.
Your journey home
The National Travel Health Network and Centre (NaTHNaC) provides advice on how to stay safe as you travel by air.
When you arrive back in the UK, follow the guidance for when you return to the UK on steps you should take to protect yourself and others.
Help and support
You will need to pay for your return travel to the UK. If departure options are available but you cannot afford the travel costs and have exhausted all other options for getting funds, you may be eligible to apply for an emergency loan from the government. This is a last resort option and you would need to repay the loan when you are back in the UK. For more information, you should contact Corporate Travel Management (CTM). CTM are a commercial partner of the FCO and are authorised to administer such loans on behalf of the FCO.
If you need urgent consular assistance, contact the British Embassy on +959891233423.
The Embassy cannot provide further information or advice about departure options over the phone. To get the latest information, sign up for travel advice email alerts.
