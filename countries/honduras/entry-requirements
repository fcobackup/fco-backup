Coronavirus
Honduran authorities have suspended academic activities in both public and private institutions for 14 days. All kinds of public gatherings are suspended for 14 days with the exception of religious activities which may go ahead but with precautions and measures suggested by the international health organisation.
The Honduran authorities request that people keep up to date with the latest restrictions by visiting the following official page where all important information about COVID-19 as well as all advice from the Honduran authorities can be found. See Health and Entry requirements
On 15 March 2020 the President of Honduras announced that that from 23:59 hours on Sunday 15th March, Honduras would close its land, air and maritime borders for the transit of people. Borders will be open for the transportation of cargo and supplies. He also reiterated that all public events are suspended.
The President also announced that the number of confirmed cases of people affected by COVID-19 had increased to 6 cases and given the impact it has caused in all the countries affected and in the region, he decided to implement more stricter measures. For this reason, the country must start a quarantine with the cooperation of the entire population. He asked that all businesses close, all except supermarkets, markets, small stores, pharmacies, hospitals, hotels, petrol stations and private banks. He asked that they take precautions and keep people at least one meter apart from each other. In all cases, they must regulate that the number of people in these businesses do not exceed 50 people.
Visas
British nationals don’t need a visa to visit Honduras. You can get a 30 day visit entry stamp on arrival. If you wish to extend this you can do so up to a maximum of 90 days by applying at an Immigration Office.
If you overstay your visa then expect to pay a fine at the Immigration Office when you apply to extend your stay or before departure. For information on which office to go to and how to follow this process contact the National Institute of Migration (Facebook).
For more information on entry requirements for other purposes, like voluntary work, contact the Honduran Embassy in London hondurasuk@lineone.net.
Children travelling with only one parent or without both parents or legal guardians must present a notarised letter of consent from the non-travelling parent(s) or legal guardian(s) to enter and exit Honduras. Contact the nearest Embassy or Consulate of Honduras, or if you’re in Honduras the nearest National Institute of Migration (Facebook), for information about the process and language requirements for consent documents.
Passport validity
Your passport should be valid for a minimum period of 6 months from the date of entry into Honduras.
Central America Border Control Agreement
Honduras is party to the Central America Border Control Agreement (CA-4). Under the terms of this agreement, British tourists can travel within any of the CA-4 countries (Honduras, Nicaragua, El Salvador and Guatemala) for a period of up to 90 days without completing entry and exit formalities at border immigration checkpoints. This period begins at the first point of entry of any of the CA-4 countries. Fines are applied for travellers who exceed this 90-day limit, although a request for an extension can be made for up to 30 days by paying a fee before the 90 day limit expires. If you are expelled from any of the four countries you are also excluded from the entire CA-4 region.
If you’re planning on travelling to Nicaragua, prior to your trip you should check information on entry requirements with your travel company, the Nicaraguan Immigration authorities or by contacting your nearest Nicaraguan embassy. You should also check our travel advice for Nicaragua.

If you arrive or depart at a land border, the immigration authorities may charge you a fee of US$3 at the border crossing. Keep the receipt until you leave the country and make sure your passport is stamped. Be aware that the “El Florido” border crossing between Guatemala and the town of Copan is shut overnight, from 9pm to 6am.
