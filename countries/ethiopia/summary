There is a military conflict ongoing in the north of Ethiopia. Military clashes are now occurring in Tigray, Amhara and Afar regional states. The conflict has potential to escalate and spread quickly and with little warning. The FCDO advises against all travel to Ethiopia, except Addis Ababa Bole International Airport, because of the risk of the conflict spreading to new areas without prior warning.
You should leave Ethiopia now while commercial options are still available. It is likely to become much more difficult to leave Ethiopia in the coming days. Consular support is severely limited across Ethiopia. In the event of deterioration in the political or security situation, the British Embassy may be limited in the assistance that it can provide. Do not rely on the FCDO being able to evacuate you in an emergency. Currently, there remain good commercial options to most destinations from Addis Ababa Bole International Airport, with most domestic flights operating normally (except Semera, Dessie, Weldiya and Tigray).
Addis Ababa Bole International Airport is a transit hub for flights across Africa and these flights continue to operate safely at this time.
You should check that you are prepared for dealing with a crisis overseas (see our crisis guidance). Please make sure you are ready to change your plans quickly if you need to. If you are in the vicinity of military activity and you cannot leave safely, you should stay indoors, away from windows and remain alert to developments that would enable you to leave safely.
On 2 November, a nationwide State of Emergency was declared. Public meetings and demonstrations are banned. Movement without ID will be restricted. Curfews and roadblocks may be introduced with little or no warning. There is likely to be an enhanced security presence. Travellers are advised to monitor local news and social media closely and comply with instructions from the authorities. You should carry copies of your identification at all times. You should avoid large gatherings and demonstrations.
The nationwide State of Emergency provides the police with greater powers to arrest and to search property. You should be aware that the police are using these powers where there are security threats or where there is a concern about an individual’s support to banned groups. Those of Tigrayan or Oromo ethnicity may face increased scrutiny, although this power could affect all people, including at the airport and through direct police operations. You should comply with the law, including on carrying ID cards, possession of foreign currency and possession of weapons. You should avoid confrontation and follow the instructions of the authorities. See Addis Ababa

There are frequent incidences of civil unrest in Ethiopia, including protests and strikes. Some of these can cause temporary closure of roads, internet and mobile networks or disruption to local businesses and transport. In the past some protests have escalated into serious violence. See Local travel
Terrorists are likely to try to carry out attacks in Ethiopia. Attacks could be indiscriminate, including in places visited by foreigners. You should be vigilant at all times, especially in crowded areas and public places like transport hubs, hotels, restaurants, bars and places of worship and during major gatherings like religious or sporting events. There is a threat of kidnapping in Ethiopia’s Somali region, and on the southern border with Kenya, particularly in the eastern areas to which the FCDO advise against all travel. See Terrorism
Internet connections in Ethiopia, including mobile data, can be intermittent.
If you’re abroad and you need emergency help from the UK government, contact the nearest British embassy, consulate or high commission. Consular support is severely limited in parts across Ethiopia (see above).
