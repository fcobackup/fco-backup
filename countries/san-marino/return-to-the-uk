We recommend that British nationals who wish to leave San Marino contact their travel operator to make arrangements to do so as soon as possible.
British nationals remain able to depart San Marino without restriction with a valid passport and onward ticket. The Italian authorities have advised that tourists already on holiday should end their travel, unless it is necessary, to return to the place where they live.
If you’re returning to the UK from San Marino, consult the latest advice from the Department of Health and Social Care on actions to take.
