This page has information on travelling to Romania. Check what you must do to return to the UK.
This page reflects the UK government’s understanding of current rules for people travelling on a full ‘British Citizen’ passport from the UK, for the most common types of travel.
The authorities in Romania set and enforce entry rules.
All travellers
All passengers who are travelling to Romania must complete a Passenger Locator Form (PLF).
The document should be completed no more than 72 hours before entering the country. It can also be completed at the point of entry into the country.
Requirements are country specific. You may get a minimum fine of €100 if you do not comply with the requirements. See Exemptions
As of 1 February Romania is no longer using a traffic light system to classify countries for travel.
All travellers (Romanians or foreign citizens) entering Romania must follow the same entry requirements.
You do not have to quarantine upon arrival if:
you are fully vaccinated (see “proof of vaccination status” below); or
you can demonstrate that you have recently recovered from COVID-19 in the last 6 months; or
you present a negative PCR test (taken no more than 72 hours ahead of departure). You can use the Green certificate to demonstrate your COVID-19 status, or other compatible official documents.
If you are unable to meet the criteria above, you will be required to observe 5 days quarantine in a location of your choosing upon arrival.
See Exemptions
If you are arriving on public transport (e.g. a flight/coach, etc) and choose to enter Romania with a negative PCR test, this must have been taken no more than 72 hours before boarding your mode of transport.
If you are arriving in a private vehicle the PCR test must have been taken a maximum of 72 hours before arriving at an international point of entry into Romania.
EU citizens and accompanying family members of an EU citizen (including those travelling for tourism purposes), residents of Romania, or those covered by one of the other exemptions listed may present alternative documentation to the vaccine certificate. See Exemptions
If you are travelling to Romania from a third country please check with the Romanian Embassy in that country before you travel. You may be questioned on arrival by Romanian border authorities to ensure you meet the legal entry requirements. Romanian border authorities only allow entry if they are satisfied that you meet the entry requirements, and reserve the right to deny passage.
If you tested positive for COVID-19 (rapid test or RT-PCR), then quarantine is mandatory as follows:
5 days if you are vaccinated, or have recovered in the last 6 months.
7 days if you have not been vaccinated or have not recovered in the last 6 months.
No further negative test is required when exiting quarantine.
Proof of vaccination status
If one of the exemptions listed applies to you, you may be able to present other documentation on entry. See Exemptions
If you’re fully vaccinated
You are considered to be fully vaccinated if at least 10 days have passed since your second dose of the vaccine (or since your first dose of a single-dose vaccine). The vaccine must be approved by the European Medicine Agency or by the World Health Organization.
You are considered to have recently recovered if you present a certificate of recovery dated from at least 11 days and a maximum of 180 days before arrival.
If you can demonstrate either of these – or if you present a negative PCR test taken within 72 hours pre-departure – you do not need to quarantine.
See an overview of the Vaccination Campaign in Romania (in Romanian), including if you qualify as fully vaccinated in Romania.
Romania will accept the UK’s proof of COVID-19 recovery and vaccination record and proof of COVID-19 vaccination issued in the Crown Dependencies. Your final vaccine dose must have been administered at least 10 days prior to travel. Your NHS appointment card from vaccination centres is not designed to be used as proof of vaccination and should not be used to demonstrate your vaccine status.
Documents can be in either English or Romanian and in paper or electronic format. They must specify your name and surname.
If you’re not fully vaccinated
UK tourists entering Romania who are not fully vaccinated will need to show a negative PCR test (taken as above) or proof of recent recovery. If you are unable to meet the criteria above, you will be required to quarantine for 5 days in a location of your choosing upon arrival.
Find out if you qualify as fully vaccinated in Romania (in Romanian).
Romania enforces mandatory self-isolation of 5 days for ALL direct contacts with a confirmed case of COVID-19. This is regardless of the vaccination status, or whether you present a negative PCR test (taken as above). The only exemption from mandatory self-isolation of direct contacts is for persons who were previously infected with COVID-19 and they have no more than 90 days from the end of the last self-isolation.
If you have had COVID-19 in the past year
If you are not fully vaccinated but have tested positive for COVID-19 in the last year you can enter Romania without needing to quarantine. You will need to provide medical documents that attest recovery from COVID-19 and it has to be dated from at least 11 days and a maximum of 180 days before arrival.
You can use the UK’s proof of COVID-19 recovery record to demonstrate proof of COVID-19 recovery when entering Romania.
Children and young people
Children aged 17 and over must follow the general entry requirements for fully vaccinated travellers to enter Romania.
Children aged 13 and under 16 years old, if unvaccinated, will need to present a negative PCR test, taken a maximum of 72 hours.
Children aged 12 and under do not need to show proof of vaccination or a negative PCR test to enter Romania.
If you are transiting through Romania
If you are transiting Romania by air from the UK on the way to your final destination you are not subject to testing requirements. However, everyone (including children under 12 years old) must fill in the Passenger Locator Form (PLF) no more than 24 hours prior to travel. You should check with your travel operator and the authorities at your final destination if a negative test is required on entry.
Transiting through Romania is permitted for travellers who will be in the territory for less than 24 hours. This is regardless of the vaccination status.
Further information about transiting through Romania can be found on the Romanian Border Force (in Romanian).

Check your passport and travel documents before you travel
If you are travelling to Romania for work, read the guidance on visas and permits as the rules have changed since 1 January 2021.
Passport validity
If you are planning to travel to an EU country (except Ireland), or Switzerland, Norway, Iceland, Liechtenstein, Andorra, Monaco, San Marino or Vatican City, you must meet the Schengen area rules.
Your passport must meet 2 requirements. It must be:
less than 10 years old on the day you enter (check the ‘date of issue’)
valid for at least 3 months after the day you plan to leave (check the ‘expiry date’)
We are asking the European Commission to clarify the 10-year rule. Their guidance for Schengen border guards may not be updated until the spring of 2022. Until then, for some Schengen countries your passport may need to be less than 10 years old during your whole visit, and the 3 months at the end of your visit may need to be within 10 years of your passport’s issue date.
Check both the issue date and the expiry date in your passport. If you renewed your passport early, extra months may have been added to its expiry date. This could affect the requirement for your passport to be less than 10 years old.
Contact your travel provider or embassy of the country you are visiting if you think that your passport does not meet both these requirements. Renew your passport if you need to.
Parental consent when travelling with minors
Some British nationals travelling with minors who hold Romanian citizenship (irrespective of whether they hold citizenship of other countries) are prevented from leaving the country without notarised parental consent from the minor’s non-travelling parent/s. While enforcement of this may vary at borders, British nationals travelling with minors who hold Romanian citizenship should obtain notarised parental consent before departure from Romania.
A list of the public notaries can be found on the website of the National Union of Public Notaries from Romania.
Visas
The rules for travelling or working in European countries changed on 1 January 2021:
you can travel to Romania for up to 90 days in any 180-day period without a visa. This applies if you travel as a tourist, to visit for family or friends, to attend business meetings, cultural or sports events, or for short-term studies or training
visits to other EU or Schengen countries do not count towards your 90-day limit in Romania as it is not in the Schengen area. Visits to Romania do not count towards your 90-day visa-free limit in the Schengen area
to stay longer, to work or study, for business travel or for other reasons, you will need to meet the Romanian government’s entry requirements. Check with the Romanian Embassy what type of visa and/or work permit you may need
if you stay in Romania with a residence permit or long-stay visa, this does not count towards your 90-day visa-free limit
Any time you spent in Romania before 1 January 2021 does not count towards the 90-day visa-free limit.
At Romanian border control, you may need to use separate lanes from EU, EEA and Swiss citizens when queueing. Your passport may be stamped on entry and exit.
You may also need to:
show a return or onward ticket
show you have enough money for your stay
