Public spaces and services
The Slovak government has eased many of the restrictions on public life which were imposed to counter the spread of COVID-19.
The measures and restrictions in a given district, including requirements on facemasks and negative COVID-19 testing for certain activities, may change according to the local epidemiological situation, as set out in a colour-coded framework known as the ‘Covid Automat’. Availability of services and rules on events are also covered. Details can be found on the Slovak government website (in Slovak only). You can check the local restrictions in each district by typing its name into the Slovak government’s online search tool. You may wish to use an online translation tool, as the English language pages are not updated regularly. You can also find details of the latest restrictions on the website of the local English-language media, the Slovak Spectator.
For more information check the Slovak Public Health Authority (in Slovak only). The International Organisation for Migration (IOM) also has information in English. You should also monitor developments on local English language media such as Radio Slovakia International and The Slovak Spectator.
Healthcare in Slovakia
If you are in Slovakia and you are concerned that you may have the symptoms of coronavirus, you should follow the advice of the Slovak authorities and contact your usual healthcare provider by telephone or email, not in person. If your symptoms are severe, you should call 155 or 112, where some operators may speak English.
The Slovak government website has information in English and advice on how to get tested for Covid-19 (currently in Slovak only). You can also consult your nearest regional office of the Slovak Public Health Authority on their website.
For contact details of local hospitals visit our list of healthcare providers. UK-issued prescriptions are not accepted at Slovak pharmacies, and you should bring sufficient supplies with you to cover your stay. If you need repeat medication you would need to consult a local doctor to get a Slovak prescription issued.

COVID-19 vaccines if you live in Slovakia
Wherever possible British nationals should aim to be vaccinated in the country where they live. As information is available about the national vaccination programme, this page will be updated. You can sign up to get email notifications.
British residents of Slovakia can take part in the country’s programme of coronavirus vaccination if they are registered for public health insurance through one of Slovakia’s three public health insurance companies (Union, Dovera or Vseobecna zdravotna poistovna) or have registered an S1 form with one of these companies. Unless you qualify under one of these options, it is not currently possible for UK or other non-EU nationals without Slovak public health insurance to pay for or access vaccines in Slovakia. The Slovak vaccination programme is currently open for certain priority groups and by age. Information on the Slovak vaccination programme is available on the Slovak Government website (in Slovak only). You can register for a vaccination by completing and submitting a form (currently in Slovak only). Information and registration is also available by calling 0800 174 174 within Slovakia or +421 222 200 910 from abroad.
As of 24 May, you can apply for a Certificate of Vaccination from the Slovak Health Ministry. This is a temporary certificate, in English and Slovak, for vaccinated people who need to travel abroad and need confirmation of their vaccination. It is for anyone who has been vaccinated with either their first or second dose. You can apply for the certificate around a week after vaccination, to allow for the data to be uploaded by the vaccination centre.
The Medicines and Healthcare Products Regulatory Agency (MHRA) is the UK authority responsible for assessing the safety, quality and efficacy of vaccines. It has authorised the Pfizer/BioNTech, Oxford/AstraZeneca and Moderna vaccines for temporary supply and use in the UK. Find out more about MHRA approval for these vaccines.
British nationals living overseas should seek medical advice from their local healthcare provider in the country where they reside. Information about vaccines used in other national programmes, including regulatory status, should be available from the local authorities. This list of Stringent Regulatory Authorities recognised by the World Health Organisation may also be a useful source of additional information. Find out more about the COVID-19 vaccines on the World Health Organization COVID-19 vaccines page.
