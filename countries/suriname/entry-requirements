The information on this page covers the most common types of travel and reflects the UK government’s understanding of the rules currently in place. Unless otherwise stated, this information is for travellers using a full ‘British Citizen’ passport.
The authorities in the country or territory you’re travelling to are responsible for setting and enforcing the rules for entry. If you’re unclear about any aspect of the entry requirements, or you need further reassurance, you’ll need to contact the embassy, high commission or consulate of the country or territory you’re travelling to.
You should also consider checking with your transport provider or travel company to make sure your passport and other travel documents meet their requirements.
Visas
British passport holders visiting Suriname as tourists and arriving at Johan Adolf Pengel International Airport in Paramaribo are no longer required to obtain a visa before travel. You can now get a single entry tourist card on arrival. If you are travelling to Suriname for other purposes, arriving at another port of entry, or need a multiple entry visa, you should apply for a visa before travel at a Surinamese Consulate. Visa information can be obtained from the Suriname Consulate in Amsterdam. Telephone: (00) (31) 206 426 137; Fax: (00) (31) 206 465 311; email: info@consulaatsuriname.nl
