Crime
There’s a substantial risk of crime. Muggings at gun and knife point, bag snatching, pick-pocketing, burglary, car break-ins, and armed car hijackings have all been reported. Avoid walking in the streets or using public transport after dark, even in Bujumbura city centre, and don’t carry large amounts of money. Take care when withdrawing or exchanging cash, and avoid doing so at night.
Arrange guards for homes and stay at hotels that have good security. Safeguard valuables and cash. Use hotel safes, where possible. Keep copies of important documents, including your passport and visa, separately. Be wary of who you plan to meet and where, and inform colleagues or family members of your plans.
Local travel
The security situation across Burundi remains volatile, especially due to the current political crisis, which included an attempted coup in May 2015.
There have been incursions, mainly from eastern DRC, and clashes between armed groups, including an armed attack on civilian vehicles. The threat of ambush by bandits remains high. You should make contact with your destination before you set off and make sure that you allow enough time to complete your journey during daylight hours.
Road travel
Land border crossings are currently open, but the situation is fluid and they may be closed without advance warning. In July 2016, Burundi banned public transport vehicles from crossing the border with Rwanda and introduced restrictions on Burundian food products being exported into Rwanda.
You can drive in Burundi on a full UK driving licence for the first 6 months after you arrive. You’ll then need to get a Burundi driving licence. There are only a small number of tarmac roads and these are sometimes in poor condition. Driving standards are poor and there are frequent serious accidents. Keep car doors locked and windows closed when driving. Access in to and out of Bujumbura city is controlled by police at night.
Road blocks and document checks are common, and not always official. Carry a copy of your passport and visa, but you may be required to produce the originals. Reports of attempted robberies at fake checkpoints have increased.
Avoid travelling on collective and public transport (buses and motorbike taxis), due to poor vehicle maintenance and low driving standards.
Road infrastructure is poor and roads are frequently blocked or damaged by landslides, especially after heavy rain. Landslides have destroyed road bridges, making some routes impassable. Check local advice on road conditions when planning travel by road and have a contingency plan in case your preferred route is blocked.
Air travel
A number of carriers fly in and out of Burundi including: Rwandair, Ethiopian Airlines, Kenyan Airways and Brussels Airlines.
The EU has published a list of air carriers that are subject to an operating ban or restrictions within the EU.
Political situation
The political situation remains tense since an attempted coup in May 2015, disputed presidential elections in July 2015 and a referendum on constitutional change in May 2018.There have been violent attacks, particularly against those perceived to be against President Nkurunziza’s third term. Sporadic targeted assassinations continue, with an increase in arbitrary arrests, detentions and disappearances of Burundians, most often from civil society, independent media and pockets of society perceived to be anti-government since 2015. The police have used live ammunition and tear gas against demonstrators. Avoid all demonstrations and large gatherings.
The government of Burundi reacted strongly to the United Nations Security Council Resolution 2303 in July 2016, which called for UN police to be deployed to the country. This included demonstrations outside the French Embassy.
Consular assistance
There’s no British Embassy in Bujumbura. Consular support is not available from the British government in Burundi. However, the British High Commission in Kigali, Rwanda can provide consular support to British nationals. The Belgian Embassy in Burundi is also able to provide consular assistance to British nationals. All visitors or long term residents should register with the Belgian Embassy: Boulevard de la Liberté, 9, Bujumbura; telephone: + 257 22 22 32 66 or + 257 22 22 61 76; email: Bujumbura@diplobel.org
