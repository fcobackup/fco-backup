There are currently extremely limited commercial options available to return to the UK from Guyana.
The Government of Guyana has announced the cancellation of all international flights from Cheddi Jagan International Airport at Timehri and the Eugene Correia Airport at Ogle. The closure started on 17 March 2020 and is scheduled to last for the foreseeable future.
The flight which departed on 7 May will be the only UK organised special flight from Guyana.
An Eastern Airlines flight will be leaving Cheddi Jagan International Airport, Georgetown to Miami on Saturday 6 June at 15.30hrs. You can book tickets on the Eastern Airlines website.
No other flights leaving Guyana are planned in the foreseeable future. If you wish to leave Guyana, you should take this flight.
You will not be able to transit the USA if you have been to the UK, European Union Schengen Area or the Republic of Ireland in the last 14 days and you will require an ESTA to travel. Cost of the ESTA is USD14. Visit the ESTA website to apply for an ESTA.
You will need to book onward connection from Miami, in addition to the flights to Miami.
This is a commercial flight. If you have any concerns about delays or cancellations, you should speak to the airline.
The Governments of Brazil and Suriname have both announced the closure of borders with neighbouring countries, including Guyana. There is no exit/entry available to Venezuela.
Future travel options
We know this is concerning for British people trying to leave Guyana. The UK government is working closely with airlines, the Guyana authorities and other governments to make sure commercial options are available for you to return to the UK as soon as possible.
This travel advice will be updated when departure options become available. If you are a British national in Guyana or Suriname and wish to leave, you should contact the British High Commission by email returnfrom.guyana@fco.gov.uk, who will inform you as soon as departure options become available.
