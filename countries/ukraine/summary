See our returning to the UK page for information on exiting Ukraine and onward travel to the UK. Roads, train and bus services are likely to be severely disrupted and there are reports of long queues at the border crossing points. You should check scheduled train and bus services are operating before you travel.
If you are in the vicinity of military activity and you cannot leave safely, you should stay indoors, away from windows, and remain alert to developments that would allow you to leave safely.
If you decide to remain in Ukraine, you should remain vigilant throughout for any potential combat operations, keep your departure plans under constant review and ensure your travel documents are up to date. You should monitor the media and this travel advice regularly, subscribe to email alerts and read our advice on how to deal with a crisis overseas.
You should expect increased documentation checks on people and vehicles, transport restrictions and increased security measures for public buildings and infrastructure. Other measures could include additional border controls, restrictions on large public events, curfews, restrictions on telephones, internet and broadcasting, and evacuations of certain areas. You should follow the restrictions imposed by the local authorities.
Ukrainian males (including dual nationals) aged 18-60 are now prohibited from leaving the country. It is expected that this prohibition will remain in place for the duration of martial law.
