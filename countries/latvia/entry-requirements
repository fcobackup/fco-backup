The information on this page covers the most common types of travel and reflects the UK government’s understanding of the rules currently in place. Unless otherwise stated, this information is for travellers using a full ‘British Citizen’ passport.
The authorities in the country or territory you’re travelling to are responsible for setting and enforcing the rules for entry. If you’re unclear about any aspect of the entry requirements, or you need further reassurance, you’ll need to contact the embassy, high commission or consulate of the country or territory you’re travelling to.
You should also consider checking with your transport provider or travel company to make sure your passport and other travel documents meet their requirements.
Restrictions in response to coronavirus
The State of Emergency was lifted on 10 June 2020 but many of its measures, including restrictions on public events, the maintenance of social distancing, and the mandatory covering of the nose and mouth by passengers on public transport, remain in place.
If you need further information about entry requirements, contact the local immigration authorities or the nearest Latvian embassy/consulate. You should also check with your airline or travel company for the latest information.
Health measures on arrival
From 3 June 2020, citizens of the European Union, the European Economic Area, and the Swiss Confederation, as well as people who are permanently residing in those countries, when travelling from their home countries to Latvia, are no longer required to self-isolate for 14 days upon their arrival in Latvia, as long as their home countries have maintained an incidence of less than 15 COVID-19 cases in 100,000 of population for the previous 14 days. Epidemiological data is updated every Friday and published on the Latvian Centre for Disease Prevention and Control website. Travellers arriving in Latvia from the United Kingdom are currently still required to self-isolate for 14 days.
if you are required to self-isolate you must carefully monitor your health for 14 days after your arrival in Latvia including by taking your body temperature twice a day (in the morning and evening)
if you experience mild flu-like (increased body temperature, cough, sore throat) symptoms for at least two days you should call 8303. The dispatcher will then evaluate on a case-by-case basis and refer you to a testing point or send a medical unit to you if you are unable to travel to a testing point
in case of sudden onset of at least one of the following symptoms – dry cough, fever, shortness of breath – restrict contact with people nearby, but in case this is not possible, keep a distance of at least two metres from them, and call 113 immediately (State Emergency Medical Service)
Keep up to date with information from your tour operator, transport or accommodation provider on the impact on any existing travel plans.
