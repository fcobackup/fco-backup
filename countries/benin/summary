The Foreign, Commonwealth & Development Office (FCDO) advises against all travel to:
the Parc du W National Park and the contiguous hunting zones of Meêkrou and Djona. The Parc is tri-national and shares an open border with Burkina Faso and Niger. There is a risk of terrorist attacks throughout the Parc
the area between the Parc du W and the border with Niger
the Pendjari National Park and adjacent hunting grounds
all other areas within 5km of the border with Burkina Faso
The FCDO advises against all but essential travel to:
the area between the Interstate Highway (RNIE) 2 (Tchaourou to Malanville) and the Nigerian border, due to increasing criminality in that area.
Before you travel, check the ‘Entry requirements’ section for Benin’s current entry restrictions and requirements. Due to COVID-19, these may change with little warning. Monitor this advice for the latest updates and stay in contact with your travel provider.
If you plan to pass through another country on your journey, check the travel advice for the country you’re transiting.
It is more important than ever to get travel insurance and check it provides appropriate cover. See the FCDO’s guidance on foreign travel insurance.
You should avoid any political gatherings or demonstrations and listen to advice from the media and local authorities. See Political situation
Additional checks are in place at the Seme border crossing between Benin and Nigeria. This has caused some disruption and delays. If you’re planning to make a land crossing from Benin to Nigeria, check with local authorities for the latest information before travelling.
Terrorists are very likely to try to carry out attacks in Benin. Attacks could be indiscriminate. You should be vigilant, especially in places visited by foreigners. See Terrorism
If you’re abroad and you need emergency help from the UK government, contact the nearest British embassy, consulate or high commission. Consular support is limited in Benin. British nationals should contact the British High Commission Accra in Ghana who can provide consular support. The Honorary Consular Agent in Benin can offer limited consular assistance.
