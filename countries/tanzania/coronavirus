Tanzania has introduced a number of measures to limit the spread of the virus.
Due to a rise in the number of coronavirus (COVID-19) cases in Tanzania, medical facilities and personnel are under strain throughout the country. The availability of treatment for non-COVID-19 related illnesses, particularly for non-urgent care, has been adversely impacted.

Travel restrictions
Tanzanian authorities have suspended all flights to and from Tanzanian International Airports from 12 April. You should urgently contact your airline if you are due to travel to or from Tanzania.
The Government of Tanzania is implementing mandatory quarantine for anyone arriving from high-risk countries (including the UK), even for those without symptoms. Quarantine will take place at a government designated facilities. Standards within the facilities have been reported as being very poor.
Travellers entering the country should be aware of possible health risks posed by inadequate protocols and facilities within the quarantine locations. You should comply with any additional screening measures put in place by the authorities.
Local measures
The government has also banned public gatherings, closed schools and universities, and suspended sporting competitions. The majority of hotels, bars and restaurants have closed voluntarily, though many restaurants still offer take away service.
