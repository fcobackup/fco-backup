The information on this page covers the most common types of travel and reflects the UK government’s understanding of the rules currently in place. Unless otherwise stated, this information is for travellers using a full ‘British Citizen’ passport.
The authorities in the country or territory you’re travelling to are responsible for setting and enforcing the rules for entry. If you’re unclear about any aspect of the entry requirements, or you need further reassurance, you’ll need to contact the embassy, high commission or consulate of the country or territory you’re travelling to.
You should also consider checking with your transport provider or travel company to make sure your passport and other travel documents meet their requirements.
Restrictions in response to coronavirus
Travel and borders
The Lebanese authorities have closed Lebanon’s borders, including Beirut Rafic Hariri Airport.
There are some exceptions to the closure. Those with Lebanese nationality, Lebanese residency or who are a member of a family of a Lebanese national should contact their nearest Lebanese Embassy.
Beirut’s Rafic Hariri international airport is expected to reopen on 1 July with initially limited capacity of 2,000 passengers daily.
People travelling to Beirut will be required to comply with testing and self-isolation measures to reduce the spread of coronavirus. The following details are yet to be finalised and are subject to change. Check with the airline and Lebanese embassy before booking.
Passengers travelling from countries such as the UK with PCR testing capability will be required to take a PCR test within 72 hours prior to travel and take another test on arrival. If both tests are negative, no self-isolation will be required. (The Middle East Airlines website notes that a PCR test is required within 96 hours prior to travel, whilst other sources indicate 72 hours. We advise testing within 72 hours pending further official confirmation by the Government of Lebanon).
Passengers travelling from countries without PCR test capability will be required to have a test on arrival and then self-isolate followed by another PCR test 72 hours after arrival. If both tests are negative, no further self-isolation will be required.
If they test positive, passengers will have to self-isolate and follow Ministry of Health guidelines.
Passengers who left Lebanon for a period not exceeding one week will be exempt from PCR testing on arrival.
Travellers are required to have insurance for their whole stay in Lebanon which will cover in full the costs of coronavirus medical treatment if they test positive for Covid-19.
Regular entry requirements
Visas
British citizens can normally apply for a free single entry tourist or family visit visa on arrival. British Overseas Citizens and British Protected Persons will need to get a visa before travelling to Lebanon. Persons of Palestinian origin may also require a visa before travelling, or may be required to carry additional documentation with them when travelling. Entry requirements are subject to change, so you should check with the Lebanese Embassy before you travel.
Overstaying without the proper authority is a serious matter. You may be refused permission to leave until a fine has been paid.
Passport validity
Your passport should be valid for a minimum period of 3 months from the date of entry into Lebanon.
UK Emergency Travel Documents
UK Emergency Travel Documents (ETDs) are accepted for entry, transit and exit from Lebanon.
If your passport is stolen, you’ll need to report the theft to the police in the area where it took place and obtain a police report before an ETD can be issued. If your passport has been lost, you’ll need to go to the nearest General Security office and get a certificate of loss before an ETD can be issued. These are mandatory steps in all cases where the original passport showing the entry stamp into Lebanon isn’t available.
Once an ETD has been issued to you, you’ll need to visit the General Security office in central Beirut to obtain an exit visa before you can depart. You should factor the time this will take into any new travel plans.
Previous travel to Israel
If your passport contains an Israeli stamp you may be refused entry to Lebanon even if you hold a valid Lebanese visa.
Stop matches
Lebanese Immigration Authorities check all visitors’ names on arrival against a database of those wanted for, or convicted of, offences in Lebanon. If a name matches against an entry on the database the individual may be detained (or on occasion allowed entry upon surrender of their passport) until they can prove that the record does not relate to them. It’s often possible to do so by producing a copy of a birth certificate or other official documentation that allows parents’ names to be checked against the database. You should consider carrying this kind of supporting documentation.
