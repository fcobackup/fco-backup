The information on this page covers the most common types of travel and reflects the UK government’s understanding of the rules currently in place. Unless otherwise stated, this information is for travellers using a full ‘British Citizen’ passport.
The authorities in the country or territory you’re travelling to are responsible for setting and enforcing the rules for entry. If you’re unclear about any aspect of the entry requirements, or you need further reassurance, you’ll need to contact the embassy, high commission or consulate of the country or territory you’re travelling to.
You should also consider checking with your transport provider or travel company to make sure your passport and other travel documents meet their requirements.
Entry rules in response to coronavirus (COVID-19)
All passengers arriving into Ireland (except those arriving from Northern Ireland) are required to have a negative/’not detected’ result from a pre-departure COVID-19 Reverse Transcription Polymerase Chain Reaction (RT-PCR) test carried out no more than 72 hours prior to arrival in Ireland.
Passengers will be asked to present evidence of their negative/‘not detected’ result before boarding their flight or ferry, and will be required to produce this evidence to Immigration Officers on arrival at points of entry to the State.
Passengers who arrive in an Irish Airport or Sea Port without evidence of a negative/’not detected’ COVID-19 PCR test result will commit an offence and may be subject to prosecution, punishable by a fine not exceeding €2,500 or imprisonment for a term not exceeding 6 months or both. Passengers must also complete mandatory quarantine in a hotel. The period of quarantine will finish once a ‘not detected’ result from a COVID-19 PCR test is returned.
Exemptions are limited to international transport workers, including hauliers, pilots and aviation crew, masters and maritime crew, where they are travelling in the course of their duties. Children under six are also exempt.
Passengers who arrive in Ireland solely for the purpose of travelling onwards to another state and do not leave the airport are also not required to provide evidence of a test.
Passengers whose journey originates in Northern Ireland do not need to provide an RT-PCR test on arrival, but any such travel is subject to the public health restrictions in place in Northern Ireland and Ireland respectively. From Monday 8 February 2021, anyone not ordinarily resident in Ireland, engaging in travel in Ireland “without a reasonable excuse” such as essential work, education, attending a medical appointment or providing care for a vulnerable person, may be liable to receive a fine of €100. Further information is available here.
If a citizen has a genuine humanitarian emergency requiring urgent travel, they should contact the nearest Irish Embassy or Consulate immediately for advice and consular assistance before commencing their journey.

Once you have arrived you must comply with the health restrictions in place in Ireland.
Passengers travelling to Northern Ireland must ensure that they are familiar with the guidance and regulations in place, including the completion of a UK Passenger Locator Form.
Regular entry requirements
ID
Ireland, along with the UK, is a member of the Common Travel Area. British nationals travelling from the UK don’t need a passport to visit Ireland. However, Irish immigration officers will check the ID of all passengers arriving by air from the UK and may ask for proof of nationality, particularly if you were born outside the UK. You are therefore advised to take your British passport with you.
For more information about the types of ID you might be asked to present, see the website of the Ireland Citizens Information Board.
Before travelling, check with your carrier about their ID requirements, as most airlines and other transport providers won’t carry passengers to and from Ireland unless they’ve seen satisfactory photographic ID.
Passport validity
If you’re using a passport to enter Ireland, it should be valid for the proposed duration of your stay; you don’t need any additional period of validity on your passport beyond this.
UK Emergency Travel Documents
UK Emergency Travel Documents (ETDs) are accepted for entry into, transit through, and exit from Ireland.
