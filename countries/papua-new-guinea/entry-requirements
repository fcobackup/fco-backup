Entry rules in response to coronavirus (COVID-19)
Entry to Papua New Guinea
Commercial options for travel to and from Papua New Guinea remain very limited. If transiting through another country, it is important that you also check the latest requirements for transit through that country.
Nobody may enter Papua New Guinea unless they have a written exemption from the National Pandemic Controller or his delegate, and evidence of a negative Polymerase Chain Reaction (PCR) test result for COVID-19 taken within a 7 day period prior to boarding the aircraft bound for Papua New Guinea. You should not use the NHS testing service to get a test in order to facilitate your travel to another country. You should arrange to take a private test.
International visitors should apply for their exemption to enter Papua New Guinea by emailing the National Control Centre Travel Desk at covid19-travel@police.gov.pg with the following documents:
completed International Air Passenger Travel Form (I-APTF)
letter to the National Pandemic Controller, including your reason for travel, visa details, passport details (including the expiry date) and, if applicable, your work permit details (or letter from your employer) and/or resident permit details
copy of your passport biodata page
copy of your visa for Papua New Guinea and, if applicable, a copy of your work permit and/or resident permit
copy of your reservation at a designated hotel for quarantine or home quarantine request (as applicable)
You should submit your completed documents at least two weeks prior to travel.
You will need to show evidence of your approved exemptions, negative COVID-19 test and hotel reservation (if needed) to be allowed to board a flight to Papua New Guinea. You must also complete an online electronic health declaration form prior to departure. The barcode generated should be saved and provided at check-in as evidence of submission of the online form.
Anyone arriving in Papua New Guinea must self-isolate – at their own expense - in a government approved hotel for 14 days unless an exemption has been obtained to quarantine at home. The quarantine period is reduced to 7 days for anyone who has spent the previous 21 days in Australia, Japan, New Zealand, Singapore, South Korea, Sri Lanka or Vanuatu and who has been fully vaccinated. All arrivals will also be subject to monitoring through either an approved tracking device or tracking application at their own cost. Full details are available on the official Papua New Guinea Government COVID-19 website.
Face masks must be worn on all domestic flights. All domestic travellers must submit a health declaration form to the Provincial Health Authority on arrival. Domestic airline travellers may need to be tested for COVID-19. Testing requirements for domestic travel are at the discretion of each province, and travellers should check the latest requirements with their travel agent. Separate arrangements apply for travel to the Autonomous Region of Bougainville
