Entry rules in response to coronavirus
Entry to Bahrain
Bahrain International Airport remains open, including for transit and transfer passengers, and visas on arrival are available for UK nationals. All arrivals aged 7 years and above, except for those who fit the exemptions outlined below, must present an approved negative PCR test certificate with QR code conducted no more than 48 hours prior to departure, and undertake and pay for PCR tests on arrival and on the tenth day of the stay, as well as quarantine for a period of ten days in their residence or at a licensed quarantine facility (proof of residence or hotel booking is required). You will be required to download the “BeAware” app in advance of testing. You should check Bahrain’s visa portal for the most up to date information. All arrivals from Vietnam, India, Pakistan, Sri Lanka, Nepal and Bangladesh must also have Bahraini citizenship or visa residency to be allowed entry to Bahrain. For information on this and other updates please also check Bahrain’s Airport website.
Exemptions
Arrivals who have not been in Bahrain’s ‘red list’ countries (currently Vietnam, India, Pakistan, Sri Lanka, Nepal and Bangladesh) within 14 days of arrival in Bahrain, and can prove official COVID-19 vaccination status from the UK, the EU, the USA, Australia, New Zealand, South Korea, Japan, Singapore or Canada are exempt from quarantine and the need to present a pre-departure PCR test, however will still be required to undergo and pay for the enhanced arrivals testing procedure for COVID-19, which includes the need to self-quarantine until the first test results have been received. Upon proving your vaccination status on arrival you will receive a ‘Vaccination Certification Card’ which will allow you access to indoor public services in-country.
Arrivals who can prove they have been vaccinated or recovered from COVID-19 in Bahrain or a GCC country can show their official COVID-19 vaccination status (Bahrain BeAware App or GCC app) or recovery certificate, or those who can prove vaccinated in a country that has a reciprocal recognition agreement with the Kingdom of Bahrain (currently includes Hungary, Israel, Greece and Cyprus) will be exempt from quarantining and from undergoing the arrivals PCR testing procedure, and will also receive a ‘Vaccination Certification Card’.
Arrivals aged 6 and below are exempt from the enhanced arrivals testing procedure for COVID-19.
Flights may also be subject to suspension or a reduced/changed service. You should check with your airline for the most up to date information before travelling to Bahrain and monitor the Bahrain News Agency for further updates as these restrictions may be subject to change.
In addition to fulfilling visa requirements, those arriving into Bahrain via the King Fahd Causeway are required to provide a negative Polymerase chain reaction (PCR) certificate valid from a test taken up to 72 hours before arrival into Bahrain, if they are unable to prove exempt as set out above. The negative PCR test result required can be provided on any official COVID-19 phone application, such as the “BeAware” app, “Tatamman”, “Sehhaty” and “Alhusen”, as well as others. Travellers can also provide a printed negative PCR certificate containing a QR code. From Sunday 17 January 2021 PCR testing services at the Causeway will no longer be available. You should not use the NHS testing service to get a test in order to facilitate your travel to another country. You should arrange to take a private test.
The King Fahd Causeway reopened on 3 January 2021 to allow travel into Saudi Arabia from Bahrain. Check the latest information on the Saudi Arabia Travel Advice page.
Demonstrating your COVID-19 vaccination status
If you live in England, Bahrain will accept the NHS app or your NHS letter to demonstrate your COVID-19 vaccination status. If you live in Scotland or Wales, Bahrain will accept your respective NHS letter to demonstrate your COVID-19 vaccination status. Your NHS appointment card from vaccination centres is not designed to be used as proof of vaccination and should not be used to demonstrate your vaccine status.
Transiting Bahrain
Transit and transfer passengers are permitted to use Bahrain International Airport without the requirement to undergo testing. You should check Bahrain’s visa portal for the most up to date information.
Testing on arrival
All arrivals into Bahrain aged 7 years and above, must pay for and undergo a coronavirus test on arrival and self-isolate until test results have been received, unless they are able to prove an exemption as set out above. The fixed fee will also cover a further coronavirus test required to be taken on the tenth day after arrival into Bahrain. Those arriving via the King Fahd Causeway will not be tested but unless exempt as above, are required to provide a negative PCR certificate valid from a test taken up to 72 hours before arrival into Bahrain.
Quarantine requirements
All arrivals into Bahrain aged 7 years and above, will be subject to coronavirus testing procedures, and will be required to self-isolate until test results have been received, unless they are able to prove an exemption as set out above. Those who test positive will be subject to further quarantine measures and health treatment, offered free of charge, at hospital or quarantine centres. Those who test positive but are without symptoms may be permitted to self-isolate at home or at their hotel. Two additional coronavirus tests are required five and ten days following arrival, which can be booked through the “BeAware” app or by calling 444.
The Government of Bahrain has stated that anyone subjected to self-isolation/quarantine must comply or face up to three months in jail and a fine of up to 10,000 BHD. Visit the website of the Government of Bahrain’s Ministry of Health for additional information.
Data collection
All arrivals are required to provide contact details and download the “BeAware” Bahrain app, which will be used to monitor compliance during the self-isolation period. The second PCR swab test can be booked through the app or by calling 444.
Regular entry requirements
Visas
Make sure you check the latest entry requirements with the Embassy of the Kingdom of Bahrain before you travel.
The Government of Bahrain reintroduced visas on-arrival across the Kingdom’s entry points from 4 September 2020. Travellers can also get a visa in advance, either online or from the Embassy of the Kingdom of Bahrain in the UK.
On 18 October 2020 the Nationality, Passports and Residence Affairs (NPRA) department announced that all valid and expired visit visas would be extended for an additional three months – from 21 October 2020 to 21 January 2021.
Those visitors intending to stay in Bahrain beyond 21 January 2021 will be allowed to apply through the eVisa portal to renew their visit visas. With effect from 22 July 2020, holders of valid visas can enter Bahrain without the need for a letter of prior permission. This excludes visas issued on arrival at Bahrain’s ports and airports.
Individuals should enquire about their individual circumstances by visiting the NPRA website.
Visitors can be issued visas for various lengths up to 6 months, depending on their need and at the discretion of the Immigration Officer. You may be asked to provide evidence of onward or return travel. If you enter as a visitor you must not take up employment.
In Bahrain you can apply to renew your visa at the NPRA at the Ministry of Interior. You can apply for residency through the Labour Market Regulatory Authority (LMRA).
Business visitors should bring a letter of invitation.
If you are currently a resident of Qatar you require a visa to enter the Kingdom of Bahrain. Visas can be applied for online. You should attach a copy of your Qatari residency card to the application. Failure to obtain a visa in advance will result in a refusal of entry into Bahrain.
Passport validity
Your passport should be valid for a minimum period of 6 months from the date of entry into Bahrain.
UK Emergency Travel Documents
UK Emergency Travel Documents (ETDs) are not valid for entry into Bahrain. However, ETDs are accepted for airside transit and exit from Bahrain. A police report is only needed if the previous passport was lost or stolen.
Once the ETD is issued, an exit stamp is required from the Nationality, Passports and Residence Affairs Agency (NPRA). This is only available via online request due to COVID-19 restrictions, by using the link here. This process requires a copy of the ETD, flight ticket and a complete Service Form which can be found here. This form will need to be completed and stamped by the employer or sponsor (please ensure all sections on the form are completed). Please allow for up to one week for the production of the exit stamp. British Nationals cannot exit Bahrain without the immigration stamp.
Yellow fever certificate requirements
Check whether you need a yellow fever certificate by visiting the National Travel Health Network and Centre’s TravelHealthPro website.
Exit requirements
You must have legal status in Bahrain when you leave. You may be prevented from leaving Bahrain if you are subject to a travel ban, involved in legal proceedings, have unpaid debt, or are a child subject to a custody dispute. You can be fined if you overstay or fail to extend your legal residency.
Previous travel to Israel
Evidence of a previous visit to Israel like an Israeli entry/exit stamp in your passport doesn’t normally cause any difficulties when entering Bahrain. It is, however, for the Bahraini authorities to determine the right of entry into the country. If you have any concerns, you should contact the Embassy of the Kingdom of Bahrain in London.
