Hurricanes
The hurricane season usually runs from June to November. Potential Tropical Cyclone #2 (Bonnie) is expected to reach the Atlantic coast of Costa Rica later on Friday 1st July 2022 and could bring hazardous sea and weather conditions. This may include rainfall in excess of 4 inches and a storm surge of up to 3 feet in coastal areas. There is potential for flash flooding and landslides. You should monitor local and international weather updates from the World Meteorological Organisation and the US National Hurricane Centre. Follow the advice of local authorities, including any evacuation orders. Keep up to date with FCDO travel advice and social media. Plan any local travel carefully.
Hurricanes Eta and Iota, which struck Central America in November 2020, caused flooding and landslides to occur, as well as road closures.
See our tropical cyclones page for advice about what to do if you are caught up in a storm.

Flooding
The rainy season in Costa Rica normally runs from May to November, coinciding with the hurricane season in the Caribbean. Flooding can occur and heavy rains or hurricanes can cause landslides.
Monitor local and international weather updates from the World Meteorological Organisation and the National Hurricane Centre.
Earthquakes and volcanic eruptions
Costa Rica experiences regular seismic activity and earthquakes in excess of strength 6 occur periodically. Local infrastructure is well-prepared and earthquakes of this strength seldom have widespread effects. The US Federal Emergency Management Agency website has advice about what to do before, during and after an earthquake or tsunami.
Costa Rica has 16 volcanoes, several of which are considered active. The possibility of eruptions always exists.
