The information on this page covers the most common types of travel and reflects the UK government’s understanding of the rules currently in place. Unless otherwise stated, this information is for travellers using a full ‘British Citizen’ passport.
The authorities in the country or territory you’re travelling to are responsible for setting and enforcing the rules for entry. If you’re unclear about any aspect of the entry requirements, or you need further reassurance, you’ll need to contact the embassy, high commission or consulate of the country or territory you’re travelling to.
You should also consider checking with your transport provider or travel company to make sure your passport and other travel documents meet their requirements.
Restrictions in response to coronavirus
All incoming flights to Malta have been suspended. If you live in the UK and are currently visiting Malta, you’re strongly advised to return now by commercial means. Don’t run the risk of getting stranded.
The Maltese authorities have introduced a number of measures in response to the coronavirus (COVID-19) pandemic. You should comply with any additional screening measures put in place by the authorities.
On 13 March Malta introduced a mandatory 14 day self-quarantine period for all arrivals into Malta. This affects tourists and returning residents. Asymptomatic visitors can choose to either enter mandatory self-quarantine or to return to their country of origin as soon as possible. If you leave Malta you must travel directly from your accommodation to the airport where you will be thermally screened.
