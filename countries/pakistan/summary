The Foreign and Commonwealth Office (FCO) is advising British nationals against all non-essential international travel at this time. Existing advice for Pakistan remains in place:
The FCO advise against all travel to:
the areas in Khyber-Pakhtunkhwa Province formerly known as the Federally Administered Tribal Areas
the districts of Charsadda, Kohat, Tank, Bannu, Lakki, Dera Ismail Khan, Swat, Buner and Lower Dir in Khyber-Pakhtunkhwa
the city of Peshawar and districts south of the city, including travel on the Peshawar to Chitral road via the Lowari Pass
Balochistan province including the city of Quetta but excluding the southern coast of Balochistan (see below)
the section of the Karakoram Highway (also known as Kara Karam Highway or KKH) from Mansehra to Chilas, via Battagram, Besham City, Dasu and Sazin
the immediate vicinity of the Line of Control
The FCO advise against all but essential travel to:
Arandu town and the road between Mirkhana and Arandu in Khyber-Pakhtunkhwa province
the southern coast of Balochistan, defined as the area south of (and including) the N10 motorway as well as the section of the N25 which runs from N10/N25 intersection to the Balochistan/Sindh border, including the port city of Gwadar
areas of Sindh Province north of, and including, the city of Nawabshah
There are currently limited commercial options available to return to the UK from Pakistan. There are currently no further UK-arranged special charter flights planned from Pakistan. This Travel Advice will be updated as any further departure options become available. See Return to the UK
International air passengers travelling to Pakistan will be subject to thermal screening on arrival. The current Pakistan Civil Aviation Authority (CAA) guidelines include measures to test all symptomatic passengers on arrival. See Entry requirements
Pakistani authorities have announced a helpline (on phone number 1166) for people who have COVID-19 symptoms like fever, cough and difficulty breathing. If you are worried about the virus, suspect you may have contracted it or are having trouble finding emergency healthcare provision, call the helpline and follow the guidance given by the authorities. Many hospitals in Pakistan are facing a high level of demand as the number of COVID-19 cases in Pakistan has increased. See Staying during Coronavirus.
In recent years, the security situation in Pakistan has improved considerably following action by the Pakistan government and security forces. In 2018, there were an estimated 484,000 visits by British nationals to Pakistan. Most visits are trouble-free.
Following a terrorist attack in Pulwama in February 2019, there are heightened tensions between India and Pakistan, particularly across the Line of Control. Certain flight routes or airports continue to experience restrictions. You should check with your airline for the latest information on the status of your flight before travelling to the airport for any flight to and from Pakistan.
Protests can take place throughout Pakistan with little warning and turn violent quickly. You should avoid demonstrations, large crowds of people and public events. See Safety and security
Some periods of the year may pose heightened risks. During holy periods/religious holidays, there is an increased potential for targeted attacks, including on western interests and religious minorities.
Terrorists are very likely to try to carry out attacks in Pakistan. There’s a high threat of terrorism, kidnap and sectarian violence throughout the country, including the major cities of Islamabad, Rawalpindi, Lahore and Karachi. Foreigners, in particular westerners, may be directly targeted. You should be vigilant, try to avoid all crowds and public events including political gatherings and religious events throughout Pakistan, and take appropriate security precautions.
Densely populated and unsecured areas, such as markets, shopping malls, hotels, restaurants, airports, public transport, schools and educational institutions are potential focal points for attacks. You should be extra vigilant at all times in such areas and minimise your exposure to areas that pose a higher risk. See Terrorism
Pakistan is in a major earthquake zone and remains at risk from further earthquakes, aftershocks, landslides and flooding. You should familiarise yourself with safety procedures in the event of an earthquake. See Natural disasters
Consular support is severely limited in parts of Pakistan where the FCO has existing advice against all travel and all but essential travel (as set out above). Consular support is also limited in parts of Pakistan where High Commission officials require travel permission from the Government of Pakistan. Permission is not guaranteed. The British High Commission’s ability to deliver consular assistance, including in an emergency, may be restricted or delayed in these areas.
Please note that due to COVID-19, in-person services are temporarily unavailable at the British Deputy High Commission in Karachi, but please contact us by phone or the online contact form if you need consular assistance.
If you’re abroad and you need emergency help from the UK government, contact the nearest British embassy, consulate or high commission.
The Overseas Business Risk service offers information and advice for British companies operating overseas on how to manage political, economic, and business security-related risks.
Take out comprehensive travel and medical insurance before you travel.
