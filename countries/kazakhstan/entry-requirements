This page reflects the UK government’s understanding of current rules for people travelling on a full ‘British Citizen’ passport, for the most common types of travel.
The authorities in Kazakhstan set and enforce entry rules. For further information contact the embassy, high commission or consulate of the country or territory you’re travelling to. You should also consider checking with your transport provider or travel company to make sure your passport and other travel documents meet their requirements.
Entry rules in response to coronavirus (COVID-19)
Entry to Kazakhstan
UK nationals no longer need a visa to enter Kazakhstan. But this could change at short notice if the COVID-19 situation changes. See the government of Kazakhstan website for further details.
Testing / screening on arrival
UK nationals with certificate proof of vaccination, do not need a PCR test prior to entering Kazakhstan. Other travellers need to show a coronavirus free PCR certificate issued within three days prior to arrival in Kazakhstan.
If you need further information about entry requirements, contact the local immigration authorities or the nearest Kazakh embassy. You should also check with your airline or travel company for the latest information.
Quarantine requirements
Travellers from the UK no longer need to quarantine when arriving in Kazakhstan, if they have a negative PCR test certificate or proof of vaccination.
Travellers entering Kazakhstan who test positive for coronavirus currently need to self-isolate for 10 days. Those needing medical assistance may be confined in state facilities.
Data collection
Travellers need to provide details of where they are staying in Kazakhstan and to confirm they will abide by all coronavirus restrictions.
Testing on departure
Travellers may be screened by having their temperature taken and assessed for other coronavirus symptoms on departure from Kazakhstan.
Regular entry requirements
Visas
You can stay in Kazakhstan without a visa for up to 30 calendar days. A number of visits is unlimited, but a total period of stay without a visa should not exceed 90 calendar days within a 180-day period.
You should contact your nearest Kazakh Embassy for further information.
If you do need a visa, make sure you have the right visa for the purpose of your travel, especially for business visas or work permits. Check the validity dates of your visa and any associated restrictions carefully before you travel.
Registration
Since 10 January 2020, it has been the responsibility of the host person or hotel to notify immigration authorities of a foreigner’s arrival. This should be made within three working days from the date of the guest’s arrival in country and can be done online on the Visa and Migration portal or in writing to the Migration Service.
Passport validity
Your passport should be valid for a minimum period of three months beyond the expiry date of your visa. Your passport should also have at least 1 blank page for your visa.
UK Emergency Travel Documents
UK Emergency Travel Documents (ETDs) are accepted for entry (together with a valid visa), airside transit and exit from Kazakhstan. If using an ETD to leave Kazakhstan, you may need to get an exit visa from the Migration Service (formerly the OVIR). This process can take five working days or longer. Check with the Migration Service for more information before confirming your travel plans.
Dual nationality
Dual nationality is not recognised in Kazakhstan. If you enter Kazakhstan on a Kazakh passport and also hold British nationality the British Embassy can only provide very limited consular assistance. In cases of arrest or detention, consular access is unlikely to be granted.
Customs
The Government of Kazakhstan imposes limits on how much foreign currency can be imported or exported, and certain goods are subject to custom regulations. For further information please visit the website of the Ministry of Foreign Affairs of the Republic of Kazakhstan.
Yellow fever certificate requirements
Check whether you need a yellow fever certificate by visiting the National Travel Health Network and Centre’s TravelHealthPro website.
