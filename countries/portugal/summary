The Foreign, Commonwealth & Development Office (FCDO) advises against all but essential travel to:
mainland Portugal based on the current assessment of COVID-19 risks.
Since 23:59 (GMT) on Sunday 20 December 2020 the Portuguese government has placed restrictions on all passenger travel into Portugal from the UK, with the exception of Portuguese citizens and those legally resident in Portugal (and their family members). If you were due to travel to Portugal you should contact your travel operator. Check our advice on things to consider, and be prepared to stay overseas longer than planned.
If you are travelling to the UK from mainland Portugal, you may need to self-isolate on your return (unless you are exempt). Check the latest guidance for England, Northern Ireland, Scotland and Wales.
The autonomous regions of Madeira and Azores are on the list of countries and territories where self-isolation is not required on return to the UK.
Travel to Portugal is subject to entry restrictions
Until further notice, only Portuguese nationals and foreign nationals legally resident in Portugal (and their family members) are permitted to enter the country if arriving from the UK.
On arrival in Portugal including Madeira, Porto Santo and the Azores, you will be required to provide a certificate confirming a negative test result for SARS/Covid-19 taken in the previous 72 hours.
If you do not have a test certificate, you will be tested by the Portuguese National Health Service at the airport. You will need to pay for this test yourself.
You must remain in isolation at your home or accommodation until the test result is confirmed. If you test positive on arrival, you will have to remain in self-isolation until the health authorities authorise otherwise. This may involve further testing.
See Entry requirements for more information before you plan to travel.
Preparing for your return journey to the UK
If you’re returning to the UK from overseas, you will need to:
