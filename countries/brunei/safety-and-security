Crime
Crime levels are low, but there are occasional incidents of petty crime against tourists as well as house burglaries. Take particular care of your passport, avoid carrying valuables with you and do not leave possessions in unattended vehicles, even if out of sight in a locked boot.
Female visitors and residents should take care when walking or travelling alone. You should remain aware of your surroundings and take sensible precautions. See these travel tips for women travellers.
Road travel
Drivers of vehicles not registered in Brunei can only buy motor fuel at 14 designated filling stations throughout the country, to a maximum of 250 litres. Petrol stations will only sell premium “V-Power” fuel to foreign cars. Cash payments are the norm.
You can drive in Brunei with a valid UK driving licence for up to 90 days after which you will need to apply for a Bruneian licence.
Driving standards differ from the UK. Traffic will not always stop at red lights or pedestrian crossings. Speeding and non-use of seatbelts and infant car seats is common. Road conditions are generally good but you should take extra care while driving through heavy rain as road surfaces are uneven. Be aware that there could be animals such as monitor lizards, snakes and monkeys on the road.
If you’re involved in a road accident as a driver, you should not leave the scene or move the vehicle until the police have attended.
River Travel
Small boats carry passengers across to the water village in Bandar and along the rivers on cruises. Before taking one ensure that they have adequate life jackets for all passengers including children. Keep hands inside the boat – there are crocodiles in the rivers. If taking a longer trip, for example a wildlife cruise, seek local recommendations and prearrange your trip.
Trekking
Police advise individuals against hiking alone in the forest, including at well-known recreation areas. It’s easy to get lost when visiting the rainforest. Use recognised and well-known guides, and stay on the footpaths. Always carry water (heat stroke can be an issue) and emergency sweets with you and consider carrying a whistle (in case you need to attract attention) and a torch if hiking in the afternoon (in case you take longer than you think and it gets dark). Wear closed toe shoes and stick to paths and trails rather than pushing through the undergrowth.
Wildlife
Brunei is home to the saltwater crocodile which grows to a large size and lives in rivers, water ways and estuaries. You should pay attention to signs warning of crocodiles in the area, and stay away from the edge of water. People have been attacked and killed by crocodiles while fishing on river banks around Bandar. Crocodiles have also been seen on beaches and in the ponds of the Panaga Golf Course. If in doubt seek local advice.
There are a number of venomous snakes in Brunei, if you encounter a snake while outdoors, keep your distance and wait for the snake to move away – their instinct is to get away from humans. If you find a snake indoors or outside in a confined space (i.e. garden) call the Fire and Rescue (Bomba) on 995 (they are also able to remove crocodiles if necessary).
Political situation
Demonstrations or large public gatherings are unlikely in Brunei. Keep yourself informed through the local media.
