Coronavirus travel health
Check the latest information on risk from COVID-19 for Chile on the TravelHealthPro website.
See the TravelHealthPro website for further advice on travel abroad and reducing spread of respiratory viruses during the COVID-19 pandemic.
International travel
If you plan to return to the UK, make sure you have not overstayed on your Chilean visa – this could affect your departure. If you have any concerns about visa renewal, visit the Chilean Immigration Office website for further information.
Entry and borders
From 1 December, entry restrictions for travellers who have been in South Africa, Zimbawe, Namibia, Botswana, Lesotho, Eswatini and Mozambique during the last 14 days, will be introduced.
See Entry requirements to find out what you will need to do when you arrive in Chile.
Returning to the UK
Travelling from and returning to the UK
Check what you must do to travel abroad and return to England, Scotland, Wales or Northern Ireland.
If you plan to pass through another country to return to the UK, check the travel advice for the country you’re transiting. If you will pass through a red list country, book your hotel quarantine package before travelling to the UK.
You are responsible for organising your own COVID-19 test, in line with UK government testing requirements. You should contact local authorities for information on testing facilities (in Spanish, under the ‘Laboratories PCR SARS-CoV-2’ tab).
Be prepared for your plans to change
No travel is risk-free during COVID. Countries may further restrict travel or bring in new rules at short notice, for example due to a new COVID-19 variant. Check with your travel company or airline for any transport changes which may delay your journey home.
If you test positive for COVID-19, you may need to stay where you are until you test negative. You may also need to seek treatment there.
Plan ahead and make sure you:
can access money
understand what your insurance will cover
can make arrangements to extend your stay and be away for longer than planned
Travel in Chile
Travellers arriving in Chile should be aware that local authorities frequently move municipalities (comunas) back and forth through the government Stages Plan (Paso a Paso). You should review the Chilean Government Paso a Paso website to check which stage your ‘comuna’ is in.
If you are travelling from or to the airport to catch a flight from or to one of the areas under quarantine, presenting your passport and boarding pass will permit you to cross any checkpoints. Use a recognised taxi service or airport transfer whose driver should have the requisite permissions.
From 1 December, travellers arriving in Chile with further domestic flight connections will no longer be required to quarantine on arrival until they receive a negative PCR test result (carried out by health authorities on arrival). They can continue their trip and quarantine in their final destination until they receive a negative PCR test result.
Mobility Pass for interregional travel
Travellers (including children aged 12 and up) are requested to hold a Mobility Pass for interregional travel. More details on accepted vaccines and the process to apply for the Mobility Pass, including the documents required to validate the vaccination, is available here (in Spanish).
The Chilean government allows Chileans, foreigners resident in Chile and non-resident foreigners who have been vaccinated overseas to register for Chile’s Mobility Pass scheme (‘Pase de Movilidad’). You may obtain a Mobility Pass if you fulfil the eligibility criteria on the Chile Government’s MeVacuno website. This will generate a QR-code after entering your personal information. This permit can only be requested 14-days after completing a full COVID-19 vaccination course in Chile (i.e. after the second dose for a two-dose course COVID-19 vaccine such as AstraZeneca, Pfizer, etc).
Interregional travellers without a Mobility Pass are required to provide proof of a negative PCR-test result given within 72 hours prior to travel. This test must be carried out in Chile. You should be aware that you are not allowed interregional travel if you are in quarantine after arriving in Chile.
Paso a Paso Strategy
The Chilean government’s strategy to manage COVID-19 is called ‘Paso A Paso’. It has five stages:
Stage 1 - Restriction
Stage 2 - Transition
Stage 3 - Preparation
Stage 4 - Initial Reopening
Stage 5 - Advanced Reopening
Individual comunas will move forwards or backwards between these stages, depending on the level of COVID-19 infections in the region. Changes to the stage of a ‘comuna’ can be announced by the government at any time and come into force shortly after. All rules for each Stage (Paso) will apply seven-days a week.
In those areas under Stage 1 ‘Restriction’ you are only allowed to leave your residence under certain circumstances, including for medical reasons, basic services, and public services. If you need to leave your residence for food or medical supplies, you must get a permit from the Comisaria Virtual. Foreigners may use their passport number to access the system. The pages are only in Spanish.
For further detailed information on rules for every Stage, you should review the Chilean Government Paso a Paso website.
Public places and services
Chilean authorities require the use of facemasks in all public spaces, that you keep to social distancing rules; self-isolate immediately if you suspect you have been in contact with a confirmed COVID case irrespective of the ‘Paso a Paso’ stage.

COVID-19 vaccines if you live in Chile
We will update this page when the Government of Chile announces new information on the national vaccination programme. You can sign up to get email notifications when this page is updated.
The Chilean national vaccination programme started in December 2020 and is using the Pfizer-BioNTech, Sinovac, CanSino and AstraZeneca vaccines. The Government of Chile has stated that British nationals resident in Chile are eligible for vaccination if they choose to join the programme, however tourists are not included. Further information is available on the Chilean Government website (in Spanish). Resident Foreign Nationals can apply for their vaccine according to the schedule on the Chilean Government website (key workers, the elderly and those with underlying health conditions have been prioritised). Vaccination in Chile is voluntary and free of charge. Resident foreign nationals must present proof of their resident status.
The Chilean vaccination programme also permits residents aged 12-17 to register for a Pfizer-BioNTech vaccination and those aged 6-11 to register for a SinoVac vaccination.
