Drink and food spiking
Do not leave drinks unattended and be wary of accepting food and drink from strangers in bars, nightclubs and restaurants.
Car theft
Car theft is a problem as well as theft from cars. Park in guarded car parks in cities, especially overnight, and do not leave your luggage in a car for any length of time.

Transport risks
Road travel
You can drive in Lithuania with a UK driving licence. Make sure it’s up to date and has the correct name and address. If necessary renew or update it.
If you are planning to drive a hire car or a UK vehicle, see information on driving abroad and check the rules of the road in the RAC’s Lithuania guide. The guide lists driving regulations and other requirements that you need to be aware of.
Taxis
It is safer to use a recognised taxi app, or phone for a registered taxi that uses a meter. Make sure the meter is switched on to avoid arguments about the fare.
Curonian Spit, Klaipeda
The Spit, a UNESCO World Heritage Site, is divided between Lithuania and Russia – the northern half is in Lithuania and the southern half is part of Kaliningrad. If you intend to walk along the Curonian Spit, be aware that after some distance you will enter the territory of the Russian Federation.
