Turkish Airlines are hoping to run a series of repatriation flights in July. The next flights are provisionally scheduled for:
Wednesday 15 July
Wednesday 22 July
Wednesday 29 July
Due to the high level of interest in these flights, Turkish Airlines have asked for potential passengers to register their interest through their embassies. If you are a British national and wish to register your interest in travelling on one of these flights, please contact Consular.Bishkek@fco.gov.uk and provide us with:
A copy of the information page from your passport
Your contact e-mail address, phone number and WhatsApp Number
Your consent for us to share this information with relevant Airlines, the Turkish Embassy in the Kyrgyz Republic, and Kyrgyz authorities.
These flights are not yet confirmed and registering your interest is not a commitment to travel, or to buying a ticket, neither does it guarantee you will be able to get a ticket on these flights. The Kyrgyz authorities have not yet confirmed the permissions for these flights to go ahead, so cancellation is still possible.
As these are Turkish repatriation flights, Turkish national passengers will be given priority. Any remaining spaces will be opened up to foreign nationals, including British nationals. If you are a European national and wish to register interest in these flights please contact the German Embassy at vw-1@bisc.auswaertiges-amt.de
Once flights are confirmed you will need to make your own arrangements for onward travel from Istanbul. You can find information on options for returning to the UK from Turkey on our travel advice page for Turkey.
The UK government is working closely with airlines, the Kyrgyz authorities and other governments to make sure options are available for you to return to the UK as soon as possible.
If you cannot leave Kyrgyzstan at this time, you should:
follow the advice of local authorities, including local measures to help minimise your risk of exposure to coronavirus
find accommodation that’s suitable for your needs.
keep in regular contact with family and friends at home, so they know you are safe and well

You will need to pay for your return travel to the UK. If you cannot afford the travel costs and have exhausted all other options for getting funds, you may be eligible to apply for an emergency loan from the government. This is a last resort option and you would need to repay the loan when you are back in the UK.
For more information, you should contact Corporate Travel Management (CTM). CTM is a commercial partner of the FCO and authorised to administer such loans on behalf of the FCO.
