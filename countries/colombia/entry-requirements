Entry rules in response to coronavirus
Entry to Colombia
Following an announcement by the Colombian Government, direct flights to/from London have been suspended until further notice. As of 22 December, you also cannot enter Colombia if your journey began in the UK. You will be required to exit Colombia on the next available flight if this is the case. The only exemptions to this are:
Colombians and foreigners with permanent residence in Colombia, that is, holders of a resident visa, (R) and their beneficiaries in the country only. These passengers must comply with the sanitary measures adopted by the Ministry of Health and Social Protection.
people belonging to diplomatic bodies duly accredited in the country;
aircraft crew.
Regulations are subject to change at short notice and you should check with your travel provider before your journey.
Arrivals to Colombia are subject to mandatory entry requirements:
for air travel into Colombia, a negative PCR test issued within 96 hours prior to boarding will be required for all passengers (children included)
travellers without a negative PCR test will need to fill out a written form explaining why they were unable to get a test or the results in time prior to being allowed to board by the airline. Passengers will be required to take the test upon arrival and self-isolate for 14 days or until a negative test result is received
between 24 hours and 1 hour before departure, you must fill out the ‘Check-Mig’ form, available on the Migración Colombia website. You will receive a confirmation email that you will need to present upon arrival in Colombia.
Colombia’s sea borders reopened on 1 December 2020. Land and river borders will remain closed until 31 May. Internal travel within Colombia is permitted.
Departing Colombia
Between 24 hours and 1 hour before departure, you must again fill out the ‘Check-Mig’ form, available on the Migración Colombia website.
Passengers who plan to leave Colombia must enter the airport 3 hours in advance to board the flight, make use of the mask from entering the air terminal, during the flight and at the port of arrival; as well as knowing all the health requirements of the country of destination, such as quarantines or tests.
Regular entry requirements
Visas
British nationals can enter Colombia for up to 90 days as a visitor without a visa at the discretion of the Colombian Immigration Officer on arrival. You may need to provide evidence of return or onward travel. If you’re issued with a Colombian visa with more than 90 days’ validity, you must register the visa at a Migración Colombia office or online within 15 days of arrival in Colombia or face fines. Check the latest entry requirements with the Colombian Consulate General in London before you travel.
You may be able to extend your stay once you are in Colombia by up to 120 days by applying at the immigration office Migración Colombia. As a visitor, you can’t remain in Colombia for more than 180 days in any 12 month period. Don’t overstay your visa, you will be fined or risk deportation at your own cost.
If you’re a British-Colombian dual national, you must enter and leave Colombia using your Colombian passport and Colombian identification card (Cedula).
If you enter Colombia by land you should make sure your passport is stamped by the immigration authorities. Failure to do so may result in a fine on departure. If the immigration office on the border is closed, seek help at the nearest office of Migración Colombia.
Passport validity
Your passport should be valid for a minimum period of 6 months from the date of entry into Colombia.
Departure tax
An airport tax is charged for international departures. The cost is usually included in the price of the airline ticket, but you should check with your airline prior to your travel.
Customs regulations
You can carry up to US$10,000 in cash, or its equivalent in any currency, with you when you enter or leave Colombia. Anything in excess of this amount may be confiscated.
Travelling with children
Children under the age of 18 years who have resident status in Colombia and who are travelling on a British passport will need written permission when leaving the country without both parents. The non-accompanying parent(s) must write a letter giving permission for the child to leave Colombia. The letter must be authenticated by a notary or by a Colombian Consulate. It must mention the proposed destination, the purpose of the trip, the date of departure and the return date. You can get more information about Colombian emigration requirements from Migración Colombia or by contacting the Colombian Consulate in London.
Yellow fever certificate requirements
Check whether you need a yellow fever certificate by visiting the National Travel Health Network and Centre’s TravelHealthPro website. Under International Health Regulations (2005), a yellow fever vaccination certificate is required for travellers aged 1 year or over arriving from Angola, Brazil, Democratic Republic of the Congo, and Uganda and for travellers having transited for more than 12 hours through an airport of a country with risk of yellow fever transmission.
UK Emergency Travel Documents
UK Emergency Travel Documents (ETDs) are accepted for entry, airside transit and exit from Colombia. Your ETD should be valid for a minimum period of 6 months from the date of entry into Colombia. If you are a dual British/Colombian national you must have a valid Colombian travel document (passport) in order to be allowed to depart – a UK Emergency Travel Document cannot substitute this requirement.
San Andres Archipelago
If you’re travelling to the Islands of San Andres, Providencia or Santa Catalina you must purchase a tourist card from the airport you are travelling from, usually at the boarding gate, on the day of the flight. Tourists staying less than 24 hours on the islands, and children under 7 years, are exempt. Check with your airline to confirm the details prior to your travel.
