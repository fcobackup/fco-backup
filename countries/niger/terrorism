Terrorists are very likely to try to carry out attacks in Niger, including in Niamey. There is particular instability in the Tillabéri region of Niger, near the country’s borders with Mali and Burkina Faso. There is also particular instability in Diffa, near the Lake Chad Basin. There is also a threat of retaliatory attacks due to Niger’s participation in the French-led intervention in Mali and due to its involvement in the regional fight to counter violent extremist groups.
UK Counter Terrorism Policing has information and advice on staying safe abroad and what to do in the event of a terrorist attack. Find out more about the global threat from terrorism.
Attacks could be indiscriminate. You should be especially vigilant in places frequented by Westerners such as hotels, restaurants, airports and other transport hubs, places of worship (particularly churches), national parks and nature reserves, and businesses with Western interests. Foreign or local government facilities and large crowds may also be a target. You should monitor developments, be alert to announcements and remain vigilant at all times. Take particular care during religious and public holiday periods.
The government declared a state of emergency on 3 March 2017 in Diffa region, in Ouallam, Ayorou, Bankilare, Abala and Banibongou (Tillabéri region) and Tassara and Tillia (Tahoua region). This was in response to an escalation in terrorist attacks, especially in the Tillabéri region.
There have been multiple recent attacks in Niger, particularly in the Diffa and Tillabéri regions. Notable recent attacks include:
On 16 March 2021 over 58 people were killed in attacks in Chinagodrar and Darey Dey in the Tillabéri region
On 2 January 2021 over 100 people were killed in attacks on two vilages (Tchoma Bangou and Zaroumadareye) in the Tillabéri region
On 21 December 2020, terrorists killed 7 Nigerien soldiers in an encounter in the village of Taroum, in the region of Tillabéri
On 12 December 2020, terrorists killed 35 people in the village of Toumour in the region of Diffa, close to the border with Nigeria.
On 9 August 2020, gunmen killed 8 people, including 6 French nationals, at a giraffe reserve in Kouré
on 9 January 2020, terrorists killed 89 Nigerien soldiers at their base in Chinegodrar, Tillabéri
on 10 December 2019, terrorists killed 71 Nigerien soldiers at their base in Inates
on 1 July 2019, terrorists killed at least 18 Nigerien soldiers at an army base in Tillabéri
on 19 June 2019, gunmen killed 2 police officers at the north Niamey Gates
There is also a risk of terrorist attacks in the Parc du W, which is tri-national and shares an open border with Benin and Burkina Faso. Terrorist activity is increasing in south-eastern Burkina Faso, including confirmed terrorist attacks in the Parc. The Foreign, Commonwealth & Development Office (FCDO) therefore advise against all travel to the Parc plus the contiguous Dosso and Tamou hunting zones.
There’s a heightened threat of terrorist attack globally against UK interests and British nationals from groups or individuals motivated by the conflict in Iraq and Syria.
Kidnap
There are a number of terrorist groups active in the region. These include Jamaat Nusrat al-Islam wal Muslimeen (JNIM), Islamic State West Africa (ISWA), Islamic State Greater Sahara (ISGS), Al Qaeda in the Islamic Maghreb (AQIM), Al Murabitoun, Ansar Dine and Boko Haram. These groups are capable of carrying out attacks and kidnaps over long distances. Kidnapping for ransom is the primary source of finance for Jamaat Nusrat al-Islam wal Muslimeen (JNIM). Criminal gangs also carry out kidnapping for terrorist groups in return for financial rewards. Read more about the threat from terrorism in the Sahel region.
Westerners have been kidnapped in Niger and the wider Sahel region, including in Niamey and the north and west of Niger. In October 2020 an American was kidnapped (and rescued shortly after) in Massalata near the border with Nigeria. In September 2018, a Catholic priest was kidnapped in Makolondi, 125 km southwest of Niamey. An aid worker was kidnapped in the Tillabéri region of Niger in April 2018.
If you’re working or travelling in Niger, you should be aware of the risk of terrorist kidnapping. You should maintain a high level of vigilance at all times, including when travelling, in crowded public places, including camps for displaced people, religious gatherings and insecure spaces like places of worship, markets, shopping malls, hotels, bars, restaurants, nature reserves and national parks, and transport hubs. You should make sure you have carefully considered the threat and have reasonable, proportionate mitigation measures in place.
British nationals are viewed as legitimate targets, including those engaged in tourism, humanitarian aid work, journalism or business sectors. If you’re kidnapped, the reason for your presence is unlikely to serve as a protection or secure your safe release.
The long-standing policy of the British government is not to make substantive concessions to hostage takers. The British government considers that paying ransoms and releasing prisoners builds the capability of terrorist groups and finances their activities. This can, in turn, increase the risk of further hostage-taking. The Terrorism Act (2000) makes payments to terrorists illegal.
