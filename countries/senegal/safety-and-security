Security situation
Since confirmation of cases of Coronavirus (COVID-19) in Senegal, there have been reports of a limited number of incidents of increased hostility towards foreigners. You should be aware of this, take sensible precautions in your daily movements and avoid confrontation.
Crime
Pick pocketing, bag snatching and low level street crime are common in Dakar, particularly around Place de l’Indépendence, the central area of the Plateau and the Western Corniche as well as Gorée Island. This type of crime is more common in the run-up to religious festivals. They can also increase early in the month after salaries are paid. Recent examples of street crime have also included attackers grabbing bags, phones or necklaces whilst driving scooters or motorbikes. You should be vigilant and take sensible precautions: e.g. avoid walking alone in the evening and after dark, be alert if using a mobile phone in public and hold it on the side facing away from the road and avoid carrying valuables and bags in public.
If you’re expecting someone to collect you at the airport, make sure they properly identify themselves before you set off. Officials wear uniforms and have a visible airport pass.
Home robberies and armed robberies are becoming more frequent. Assaults usually take place early in the morning and after dusk.
Be cautious when changing cash given the risk of false money circulating.
British nationals are increasingly being targeted by scam artists operating in West Africa. Scams come in many forms (romance and friendship, business ventures, work and employment opportunities) and can pose a great financial risk to victims. You should be cautious about requests for funds, a job offer, a business venture or a face-to-face meeting from someone you have been in correspondence with over the internet who lives in West Africa. This includes requests from people who claim to be victims of various Western African conflicts (notably refugees from Sierra Leone) or relatives of present or former political leaders.
Political demonstrations
Demonstrations about political issues occur frequently and are likely to increase in the build up to presidential elections in February 2024.
These demonstrations usually take place in Dakar and other cities. They can turn violent.
Protestors sometimes block major roads, including the road between Blaise Diagne International Airport (DSS) and the city of Dakar.
Ahead of big demonstrations, those living in Dakar or other major cities should consider stocking up on food, water and fuel. Once they have begun, you should:
monitor the local media for information about forthcoming protests
follow the instructions of local authorities
avoid areas where demonstrations and large gatherings are taking place and exercise caution.
If you are in doubt about where protests are taking place, or the level of safety of an area, remain at home or in your hotel.
Local travel
The Casamance region, the region south of The Gambia, has suffered for decades from low intensity separatist violence, largely directed at Senegalese security forces.
You should be vigilant when travelling in Casamance, the region south of The Gambia. Where possible you should avoid travelling at night, stick to main roads and travel in a convoy when you can. The Casamance region has suffered from decades of low intensity separatist violence, largely directed at Senegalese security forces. While the security situation has improved significantly since 2012, there are occasionally violent incidents, including armed attacks on travellers. Senegalese Armed Forces conduct small operations near the border with The Gambia to combat wood trafficking.
There is a lower level of risk in the main tourist areas of the Casamance. See Local travel
Most visits to Senegal are trouble-free.
Road travel
You can drive in Senegal with a valid UK driving licence for up to 6 months, or on a valid International Driving Permit. If you’re staying longer or living in Senegal, you’ll need to get a Senegalese driving licence.
While some main roads are of good quality, other roads can be poor especially during the rainy season from June to September. Torrential rains can cause floods and landslides. Monitor local weather reports.
Driving standards are unpredictable. Some taxis and public mini-buses (‘car rapide’) are not roadworthy by UK standards.
Traffic congestion also increases throughout Senegal in the run up to and during religious festivals. You should take particular care and attention to avoid accidents. Driving after dark is more dangerous because of poor street and vehicle lighting. If you do have an accident you must contact the police (dial 17 from a local phone) and wait for them to arrive at the scene. Do not move the car involved in the accident until a police officer gives you permission to do so. In more remote areas you may need to go directly to the nearest police station in order to report the incident.
