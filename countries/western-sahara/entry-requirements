Warning
FCDO advises against all travel to parts of Western Sahara.

This information is for people travelling on a full ‘British citizen’ passport from the UK. It is based on the UK government’s understanding of the current rules for the most common types of travel. 
The authorities in Western Sahara set and enforce entry rules. If you’re not sure how these requirements apply to you, contact the Moroccan Consulate General in the UK.        
COVID-19 rules 
There are no COVID-19 testing or vaccination requirements for travellers entering Western Sahara.  
Passport validity requirements 
Your passport must be valid for the proposed duration of your stay.
Check with your travel provider that your passport and other travel documents meet requirements. Renew your passport if you need to.  
You will be denied entry if you do not have a valid travel document or try to use a passport that has been reported lost or stolen. 
Visa requirements 
You can travel without a visa for visits to the Moroccan-administered parts of Western Sahara and Morocco for up to 90 days.  
Travel is restricted. Organised groups are generally permitted, but independent travellers could be turned back at the border.  
Make sure you get your passport stamped.  
When first arriving in Morocco/Western Sahara, make sure you get a passport stamp from the Moroccan border control authorities. You may have difficulty leaving the country without a stamp.  
Vaccine requirements  
For details about medical entry requirements and recommended vaccinations, see TravelHealthPro’s Western Sahara guide. 
Customs rules 
There are strict rules about goods you can take into or out of Western Sahara. You must declare anything that may be prohibited or subject to tax or duty. Check Moroccan customs rules (in French) for the Moroccan-administered parts of Western Sahara.
