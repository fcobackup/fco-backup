Warning
FCDO advises against all but essential travel to parts of Guatemala.

This information is for people travelling on a full ‘British citizen’ passport from the UK. It is based on the UK government’s understanding of Guatemala’s current rules for the most common types of travel.
The authorities in Guatemala set and enforce entry rules. If you’re not sure how these requirements apply to you, contact the Guatemalan Embassy in the UK.
 Passport validity requirements
To enter Guatemala, your passport must have an ‘expiry date’ at least 6 months after the date you arrive and at least 2 blank pages.
Check with your travel provider that your passport and other travel documents meet requirements. Renew your passport if you need to.
You will be denied entry if you do not have a valid travel document or try to use a passport that has been reported lost or stolen.
Visa requirements
You can visit Guatemala for up to 90 days without a visa.
If you overstay the 90 days, you’ll have to pay a fine before leaving the country. You can pay this fine at the main Institute of Migration (in Spanish) office in Guatemala City. You can also pay fines at the airport or land borders, but administrative processes can cause serious delays.
Applying for or extending a visa
To stay longer than 90 days (to work or study, for business travel or for other reasons), you must meet the Guatemalan government’s entry requirements. Check which type of visa or work permit you need with the Guatemalan Embassy in the UK.
If you want to extend  your visa or permit to stay, you must apply to the Institute of Migration (Spanish language website).
Make sure you get your passport stamped on entry. 
If you do not get your passport stamped when you arrive, you will get a fine and be delayed on your departure. If you notice your passport has not been stamped, return to the immigration desk, or go to the Institute of Migration (in Spanish) offices in Guatemala City as soon as possible.
Immigration declaration form
Before you enter or exit Guatemala, you must complete the online immigration declaration form. Print the confirmation email you receive and carry it with you. Alternatively take a screenshot of the email QR code. If you need more information, contact your travel agent or the Institute of Migration (in Spanish).
Airport tax
You must pay airport departure tax of 30 US dollars (or the same amount in Guatemalan quetzal). This is normally included in the price of your ticket.
Travelling with children 
To enter or exit Guatemala, children aged 17 and under travelling alone or with only one parent or legal guardian must have a notarised letter in Spanish from the parents or guardians not travelling with them. Contact the Guatemalan Embassy, or if you’re in Guatemala the nearest Institute of Migration (Spanish language website), for information about what documents you need. Single parents will need additional documents.
Travelling to El Salvador and Nicaragua 
You can travel between Guatemala, El Salvador and Nicaragua for up to 90 days without a visa. The 90-day period starts when you enter any of these countries and does not restart when you cross borders. You can extend your stay by up to 30 days by paying a fee before the 90 days expires. If you overstay, you may get a fine. 
You’ll have to go through immigration checks at borders. If you’re expelled from one of these countries, you’re also excluded from the other 2.
Illegal entry fees at land borders
Guatemalan customs or immigration officials sometimes ask travellers crossing land borders to pay an ‘entry fee’. This is illegal. If you are asked to pay a fee, ask for an official receipt, and you may find the officials drop the request.
When crossing into Guatemala by the land border at El Carmen, be wary of people offering to help process your entry into the country. They may be trying to overcharge you for unnecessary services.
Vaccine requirements
To enter Guatemala, you must have a certificate to prove you’ve had a yellow fever vaccination if you’re coming from a country listed as a transmission risk.
For details about medical entry requirements and recommended vaccinations, see TravelHealthPro’s Guatemala guide.
Customs rules
There are strict rules about goods you can take into or out of Guatemala. You must declare anything that may be prohibited or subject to tax or duty.
Taking money into Guatemala
It is often not possible to exchange British pounds in Guatemala. It is much easier to exchange US dollars.
