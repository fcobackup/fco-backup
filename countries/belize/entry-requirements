This page has information on travelling to Belize.
This page reflects the UK government’s understanding of current rules for people travelling on a full ‘British Citizen’ passport from the UK, for the most common types of travel.
The authorities in Belize set and enforce entry rules. If you’re unsure how Belize’s entry requirements apply to you, contact its UK embassy, high commission or consulate.
All travellers
British nationals do not need a visa to enter Belize. On arrival, you’ll be allowed to enter for one month. Any extension to remain in the country will incur a fee of BZD$200 for each month’s extension.
There are no direct flights between the UK and Belize. The regulations of countries that you may pass through and / or UK requirements on travel from transit countries may affect your travel. For more information see FCDO Travel Advice on the countries through which you may travel or transit.
There is no longer a requirement to present proof of vaccination against COVID-19 or a negative test and the Belize Travel Insurance is no longer mandatory for foreign tourists.  
You should avoid bringing in home COVID-19 tests; they will be confiscated if found.
Protocols and procedures are subject to change at short notice. Further information is available from the Belize Tourism Board, Travel Belize or Belize Port Authority.
Travelling with children
Single parents or adults travelling with children under the age of 18 are required to provide notarised documentary evidence of parental responsibility, or consent to travel from those with parental responsibility. Such documentation is often required before being allowed to enter Belize and, in some cases, before permitting children to leave the country.
Departure tax
When leaving by air, the departure tax is usually included in the airfare. When leaving by land, the departure tax is BZD$40 or US$20, which must be paid in cash.
