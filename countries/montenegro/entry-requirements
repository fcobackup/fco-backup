This advice reflects the UK government’s understanding of current rules for people travelling on a full ‘British citizen’ passport from the UK, for the most common types of travel.
The authorities in Montenegro set and enforce entry rules. If you’re not sure how these requirements apply to you, contact the Montenegro Embassy, London.
Land and border crossings may close at short notice and entry into neighbouring countries may be subject to entry requirements.
COVID-19 rules
There are no COVID-19 testing or vaccination requirements for travellers entering Montenegro.
Passport validity requirements
To enter Montenegro, your passport must:
have a ‘date of issue’ less than 10 years before the date you arrive
have an ‘expiry date’ at least 3 months after the day you plan to leave
If you hold dual citizenship, the Montenegro authorities will consider you a citizen of the issuing state of the passport you used to enter Montenegro.
Checks at border control
Make sure you get your passport stamped.
The dated entry stamp helps avoid any problems about the length of your stay in the country.
Visa requirements
You can enter Montenegro for a short term stay of up to 90 days without a visa. Under Montenegrin law this means 90 days in total in any period of 180 days, counted from your first entry date.
Applying for a visa
Check which type of visa or work permit you may need with the Montenegro Embassy in the UK.
Vaccination requirements
At least 8 weeks before your trip, check the vaccinations and certificates you need in TravelHealthPro’s Montenegro guide.
Registering with the authorities
You must register with the local tourism office or police in the town or city where you are staying within 24 hours of arrival in Montenegro. If you are staying in a hotel or other commercial accommodation, this is done automatically when you check in.
If you do not register you may be fined, detained or face a court appearance.
Customs rules
There are strict rules about goods that can be brought into and taken out of Montenegro.
You should declare items of value like expensive jewellery, photographic and computer equipment or anything that may be prohibited or subject to tax or duty.
Taking pets into Montenegro
Montenegro accepts pet passports. Pets can be transported non-commercially (up to 5 pets) as long as they meet the medical and other requirements for bringing pets into EU countries.
Taking money into Montenegro
Declare cash or travellers cheques if the value is 10,000 euros or more. You will get a certified declaration to show you brought it in with you. If you do not, your money could be seized when you leave.
