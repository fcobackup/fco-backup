You should contact local authorities for information on testing facilities. A COVID-19 PCR testing portal for travellers in Egypt is available.
Be prepared for your plans to change
No travel is risk-free during COVID-19. Countries may further restrict travel or bring in new rules at short notice, for example due to a new COVID-19 variant. Check with your travel company or airline for any transport changes which may delay your journey home.
If you test positive for COVID-19, you may need to stay where you are until you test negative. You may also need to seek treatment there.
Plan ahead and make sure you:
can access money
understand what your insurance will cover
can make arrangements to extend your stay and be away for longer than planned
Public spaces and services
Everyone should comply with the measures put in place in Egypt to limit the spread of coronavirus (COVID-19).
The Egyptian authorities’ response to the coronavirus is evolving, and local measures may change and new restrictions be introduced at short notice and without warning.
The authorities may announce the closure of public spaces, including parks and beaches at short notice, in particular around public holidays. You should follow the guidance of the local authorities. The wearing of face masks is mandatory in closed public spaces, including government buildings, private offices, malls, retail outlets and public transport including private taxis. Legal penalties could be applied for non-compliance.
Healthcare in Egypt
The Egyptian authorities may impose mandatory quarantine for visitors who test positive for coronavirus in a government isolation hospital. Access for family members could be heavily restricted or impossible. Egyptian state facilities may be below UK standards.
