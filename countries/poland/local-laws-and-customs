Polish police take a strict approach to public drunkenness. You are not allowed to consume alcohol in public places or you may be fined. If you are found drunk in a public place you may be taken to a drying out clinic where a doctor or nurse will medically assess you. You will not be released until you have sobered up and you may need to stay overnight. You will have to pay for the cost of the stay.
You should only cross the road at signposted crossing points like zebra crossings. If you do not cross the road at a signposted point and you are caught by the police you will be fined.
LGBT+
While larger towns and cities in Poland are generally open-minded about LGBT+ issues, smaller towns and rural areas remain conservative and less tolerant towards LGBT+ travellers. There are a number of gay and LGBT-friendly restaurants, clubs and bars in Warsaw, Krakow, Wroclaw, Poznan, Gdansk, and Sopot. Same-sex relationships are legal and same sex partners may live together but same-sex marriages and civil partnerships are not recognised under the Polish law. The age of consent is the same for all people (15). See our information and advice page for the LGBT community before you travel.
