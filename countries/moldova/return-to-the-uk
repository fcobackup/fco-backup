As a consequence of the Moldovan government’s ban on all scheduled flights to/from Moldova, there are currently no scheduled commercial flights available to the UK. This ban will remain in place until further notice. Occasional ad hoc charter flights to UK and other European countries have been organised by the Moldovan authorities. However, it is not possible to predict when such flights will operate.
The Embassy will, based on information made available to it, publicise information about such flights on its Facebook page and via the Twitter account of Her Majesty’s Ambassador. You should be aware that these flights can be scheduled at short notice and are subject to last minute changes. Most of the ad hoc charters have been operated by Air Moldova. As well as following the Embassy’s social media channels, mentioned above, you should consult Air Moldova for information and to make any bookings on their flights.
Travel via Romania
You may wish to consider travelling to the UK via Romania. The road from Chisinau to theborder at Leuseni/Albita is currently the only open border crossing to Romania. Taxis and buses are available. However, on Saturday 4 April the Romanian government announced a ban on flights to several countries, including UK and Ireland, with effect from 2300 on Sunday 5 April. If you plan to take a flight on 5 April, or to travel overland through Romania and from there onwards to UK, you should consult our travel advice for Romania and for all other countries on your route, before setting off. To inform yourself of border crossing restrictions imposed by the Moldovan and Romanian governments, check the Moldovan government and our travel advice for Romania.
