Cases of coronavirus (COVID-19) have been confirmed in Afghanistan. The Afghan authorities have introduced a number of measures to limit the spread of the virus.
Entry and borders
The National Security Council of Afghanistan has announced that all travel to and from Iran has been temporarily banned.
Point of entry screening has been introduced at 3 international airports and 11 international crossings. Not everyone is being screened, but those who are and who show a temperature of more than 38ÂºC may be sent direct to one of 2 national hospitals (Kabul Infectious Disease and Afghan-Japan Communicable Disease Hospital in Kabul) or 5 provincial hospitals for isolation. These hospitals are outside of the Enhanced Security Zone.
