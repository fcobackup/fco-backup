Cases of coronavirus (COVID-19) have been confirmed in Zimbabwe. The Zimbabwean authorities have introduced a number of measures to limit the spread of the virus, including announcing the closure of all borders to non-residents and a countrywide lockdown until 3 May. Commercial airlines have reduced or suspended flights in to and out of Zimbabwe. You should consult your airline and travel insurance company immediately to understand what impact this will have for your travel plans. You should ensure you have accommodation for this entire period as some hotels may close at short notice. If you take regular medication, you should ensure you have a sufficient supply.
