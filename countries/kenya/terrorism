Terrorists are very likely to try to carry out attacks in Kenya. The main threat is from extremists linked to Al Shabaab, a militant group in Somalia opposed to the Somali government. Al Shabaab has issued public threats against Kenya due to Kenya’s military intervention in Somalia. The Kenyan authorities have increased security to counter potential reprisal attacks by Al Shabaab. There’s some evidence of growing support for Daesh (formerly referred to as ISIL) in Kenya.
There have been a number of attacks in Kenya in recent years, particularly in Garissa, Lamu and Mandera counties and other areas close to the Somali border, most of which were attributed to Al Shabaab. These have killed members of the Kenyan security forces as well as civilians. The Kenyan security forces have increased their presence in the affected areas. Armed militia groups operate within the Boni Forest and along the border between Garissa county and Somalia. Further attacks are likely. Methods of attack have included grenades, knife attacks, shootings and bombings, including car bombings, and improvised explosive devices. The FCO advise against all but essential travel to within 60 km of the Kenya-Somali border.
There’s a heightened threat of terrorist attacks in Nairobi and the coast and resort areas of Mombasa and Malindi, and northern border counties. The Inspector General of the Kenyan Police has called on the public to adopt a higher level of vigilance and report any suspicious people or activity straight away.
Attacks could be indiscriminate in places frequented by foreigners including hotels, bars, restaurants, sports bars and nightclubs, sporting events, supermarkets, shopping centres, coastal areas including beaches, airports, buses, trains and other transport hubs. Places of worship including churches and mosques have also been targeted. Be particularly vigilant in these areas.
On 15-16 January 2019, there was a terrorist attack at the 14 Riverside complex in Nairobi, resulting in injuries and loss of life. One British national was killed.
On 14 March 2018, the Inspector General of the Kenyan Police reported that a major terrorist attack, targeting Nairobi, had been prevented by Kenyan police in February 2018.
Six British nationals were killed in the September 2013 attack on the Westgate shopping mall in Nairobi.
Since spring 2017, there have been multiple attacks in Garissa county and mainland areas of Lamu county involving improvised explosive devices, armed militia and fatal knife attacks.
Several terrorist attacks took place in Garissa county in 2015, including an attack on Garissa University College on 2 April 2015 in which at least 148 people were killed. In June and July 2014 attacks in Lamu and Tana River counties on the Kenyan coast are reported to have killed at least 85 people. Al-Shabaab claimed responsibility for the attacks.
Kenyan official buildings such as government offices and law enforcement personnel and facilities have been targeted. Somali government interests in Kenya may also be targeted. Take extra security precautions if you plan on travelling to any of these places.
The authorities in Kenya have successfully disrupted a number of planned attacks and made a number of arrests in recent years. They have also provided extra protection including in areas near to the Somalia border and on the Kenyan coast.
There’s a heightened threat of terrorist attack globally against UK interests and British nationals, from groups or individuals motivated by the conflict in Iraq and Syria. You should be vigilant at this time.

Kidnapping
You should be alert to the threat of kidnapping throughout Kenya. In particular there is a high threat in Northern and Northeastern border regions, including in areas within 60km of the Kenya Somalia border and in coastal areas north of Pate Island. Westerners have been the target of kidnaps and further attacks in these areas are likely. Along these border areas there are also frequent incursions by Somali militants operating against Kenyan defence forces.
A number of kidnaps have occurred in Dadaab refugee camp in north east Kenya. British aid workers and others working at or visiting Dadaab refugee camp should satisfy themselves that those arranging their stay at the camp have sufficient security arrangements in place. If you are kidnapped, the reason for your presence is unlikely to serve as a protection or secure your safe release.
The long-standing policy of the British government is not to make substantive concessions to hostage takers. The British government considers that paying ransoms and releasing prisoners increases the risk of further hostage taking. The Terrorism Act (2000) also makes payments to terrorists illegal.
