In recent weeks several large-scale political demonstrations have taken place around government buildings in the Admiralty and Wan Chai areas on Hong Kong Island, resulting in road closures and disruption to public transport. Violent clashes have also taken place between police and protesters. Further demonstrations remain likely, particularly around government buildings and may take place with little or no notice. Large sections of the city may be closed off and public transport affected. The situation remains unpredictable, so you should remain vigilant and keep up to date with developments. If you’re in and around areas where demonstrations are taking place, you should follow the advice of local authorities and move away quickly to a safe place if there are signs of disorder.
