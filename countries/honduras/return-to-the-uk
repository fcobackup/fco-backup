Honduras has closed its land, air and maritime borders for the transit of people.
UK special flight
On 1 May, the FCO operated a special flight from Honduras to help British tourists, short-term visitors and their direct dependents return to the UK. There are currently no further special flights organised from Honduras. The British Embassy continues to work closely with the Honduran authorities, international governments, and airlines on all possible options for British Nationals still in Honduras who wish to return to the UK.
Your journey home: re-entering the UK
When you return, you must follow the rules for entering the UK. You:
need to provide your journey and contact details up to 48 hours before you’re due to arrive in the UK
are not allowed to leave the place you’re staying for the first 14 days you’re in the UK except in very limited situations (known as ‘self-isolating’)
See also the list of people who are exempt from the border rules.
The National Travel Health Network and Centre (NaTHNaC) also provides advice on how to stay safe as you travel by air.
