This page reflects the UK government’s understanding of current rules for people travelling on a full ‘British Citizen’ passport, for the most common types of travel.
The authorities in Tajikistan set and enforce entry rules. For further information contact the embassy, high commission or consulate of the country or territory you’re travelling to. You should also consider checking with your transport provider or travel company to make sure your passport and other travel documents meet their requirements.
Entry rules in response to coronavirus (COVID-19)
Travellers arriving in Tajikistan must provide confirmation of a negative PCR test, issued within 72 hours of arrival. The test must be a COVID-19 PCR swab test. Other test results including antibody tests are not accepted.
COVID-19 entry requirements may change at short notice, and travellers to Tajikistan are strongly encouraged to check the specifics with their airline, including the timeframes for undertaking COVID-19 PCR tests, before travel.
Entry to Tajikistan
Land border crossings between Tajikistan and Uzbekistan, Kyrgyzstan, China and Afghanistan are closed to travellers. A small number of border points with Uzbekistan are open to Tajik citizens only. Some border points with Uzbekistan, China and Kyrgyzstan are open for cargo only. Flights are operating from several destinations. See International Travel section for further details.
Testing / screening on arrival
Travellers arriving in Tajikistan will be screened and be required to have a PCR test on arrival.
Quarantine requirements
Travellers entering Tajikistan are not currently subject to quarantine but are required to self-isolate for at least three days upon arrival; this may be subject to change.
Testing on departure
Most destinations and transits require travellers to have a negative PCR test before departing Tajikistan. Travellers should check the regulations at their destination and any transit points and obtain the required tests before travel. Travellers may be screened by having their temperature taken and assessed for other COVID-19 symptoms on departure from Tajikistan.
Regular entry requirements
Visas
British nationals require a visa before travel. The Embassy of the Republic of Tajikistan in London offers an online e-visa service.
Tourist visas are valid for a period of up to 45 days.
Make sure you are travelling on the correct type of visa, particularly if staying with friends or family rather than at a hotel. If you have been issued any visa other than a “Tourist” visa, you will be required to register with the Consular Department of the Ministry of Foreign Affairs within 3 days of arrival. Hotels may only carry out registration for the duration of your stay with that particular establishment; if your visit also includes travel to other parts of the country you may need to register again for the remaining part of your travel.
The Embassy of the Republic of Tajikistan in London also processes applications for travel permits to the Gorno-Badakhshan Autonomous Region of Tajikistan. Entry into the region, both from inside and from outside Tajikistan, requires a special permit in advance in addition to a valid Tajik visa. You can also get a permit from the Ministry of Foreign Affairs or Office of Visas and Registrations once in Tajikistan.
Once you arrive in Tajikistan you can apply for visa extensions at the Consular Department of the Tajik Ministry of Foreign Affairs.
Multiple entry and transit visas
If you plan to travel to areas in the Khatlon Region bordering Afghanistan (eg Panj, Kumsangir) you will need to apply for a permit from the Consular Department of the Ministry of Foreign Affairs in Dushanbe prior to travel.
If you are travelling back to Russia, Kazakhstan or Uzbekistan, you should get the relevant re-entry visa before entering Tajikistan. Transit visas for Tajikistan are usually valid for three days. If you wish to stay longer, you must get a longer-term visa through Intourist Tajikistan or at the Ministry of Foreign Affairs after arrival.
Passport validity
Your passport should be valid for a minimum period of 6 months from the date you apply for a visa to enter Tajikistan and must have at least two empty pages.
UK Emergency Travel Documents
You can’t enter Tajikistan with a UK Emergency Travel Document (ETD). If you lose your passport in Tajikistan the British Embassy in Dushanbe can issue an ETD, but you’ll need to get an exit visa from the Ministry of Foreign Affairs or Office of Visas and Registrations before you can travel out of Tajikistan. It can take at least 5 working days to get an exit permit.
