The States of Emergency in the parishes of St James (which includes Montego Bay), Hanover and Westmoreland have been extended to 13 August 2019. A State of Emergency is also in place until 21 July in part of the Parish of St Andrew, which includes areas of Kingston: detailed boundaries are set out by the Government of Jamaica.
As part of these security enhancement measures, the Government of Jamaica has put in place a number of Zones of Special Operations (ZOSOs) which are currently active in:
Denham Town in Kingston (due to expire on 19 August 2019);
Mount Salem in Montego Bay (due to expire on 7 September 2019).
Both the State of Emergency and ZOSO measures allow the military to support the police in joint security operations in response to recent violence and shooting incidents.
Security operations are ongoing and further activity including curfews could occur with little or no notice. You should exercise caution if you’re in the area, particularly if travelling at night, and follow the advice of the local authorities, including any restrictions. These may also result in road closures or travel delays, and the operating hours of some businesses may be subject to change.
