This page gives you guidance on how to stay safely in Bolivia as a visitor, if you are unable to return to the UK.
Everyone should comply with the measures put in place in Bolivia to limit the spread of coronavirus (COVID-19).
Registering with the British Embassy
If you are stuck in Bolivia, send your contact details to the Consular Section at the British Embassy, by email to lapaz.escalations@fco.gov.uk. Note that, owing to travel restrictions, there is limited consular assistance that the Embassy can provide, particularly outside La Paz.
Moving around in Bolivia
The following quarantine measures will apply nationally:
All public gatherings will be prohibited, except religious services fulfilling specific social distancing requirements.
A curfew will apply Monday to Friday between 6pm and 5am.
At weekends, you may go outside on foot between 6am and 2pm, up to 500m from your residence. Vehicles may not be used at weekends.
Schools will remain closed. In public places you must maintain 1.5m distance from other people and use facemasks, including outside.
In La Paz department (including the city of La Paz) from 23 June, weekday movement will be controlled according to the last digit of citizens’ ID cards or passports, with even (“par”) numbers not allowed outside on the same day as odd (“impar”) numbers. You should check with your authorities which days correspond to your own ID. Weekend movement in La Paz department is also currently prohibited, in addition to the national restrictions above.
Penalties for breaching these conditions include fines, public service and imprisonment.
Local authorities may impose further restrictions, including on the movement of people under 12 and over 65 years old, and weekend movement, depending on the risk level of the town or city as assessed by the Bolivian government. Risks levels may be high (“alto”), medium (“medio”) or moderate (“moderado”) and can be found on this Bolivian Government website

Finance
There is a range of financial support from the government that you can access while you are unable to return due to coronavirus restrictions.
If you’re in Bolivia and have exhausted all other options to cover essential living costs while you wait to return home, you could apply for an emergency loan for your living costs from the UK government. You can only apply if you normally live in the UK and you cannot return home. This is a last resort option for those most in need and you would need to repay the loan when you are back in the UK. Apply for an emergency loan.

If you need urgent consular assistance, contact the British Embassy. All telephone numbers are available 24/7.
