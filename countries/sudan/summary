Ongoing protests which broke out across Sudan in December 2018 intensified significantly in Khartoum on 6 April and continued overnight and through Sunday 7 April. These are focused especially around the area to the north of the airport, though are also taking place in the Khartoum 2, Amarat, Bahri and Omdurman areas of Khartoum. Tear gas and, on occasion, live gunfire has been used by the authorities in response. Foreign nationals are not being targeted as part of these protests, but we continue to advise you to monitor developments closely, follow the instructions of local authorities, and limit moves outside of your accommodation. Sudan’s state of emergency remains in effect. It gives security forces increased powers of search and detention.
British Nationals considering travel within Sudan should check the local situation before travelling. In Khartoum, the areas around Omdurman, Burri, Bahri, Haj Yousif and Souq Al-Arabi have seen the most regular protests and security operations, but demonstrations have occurred sporadically across the city, particularly following Friday prayers. Live ammunition and tear gas have been used against protestors. You should exercise vigilance, avoid protests or large gatherings, observe local curfews and follow the instructions of the relevant authorities. You’re advised to: limit travel, including within/around cities; seek information on the situation in districts you propose travelling to or through before departing; and identify and remain in a place of safety if local circumstances dictate. There is currently limited access to several internet-based communications and social media sites without the use of Virtual Private Networks (VPNs), which are not readily available to download in Sudan.
On a number of occasions since the beginning of 2018, there have been shortages of fuel throughout Sudan including in Khartoum. At times these have led to very long queues (several hours or even overnight) at petrol stations (which regularly run dry) and rationing of the commercial supply. Earlier in the year, the shortages had knock on effects, including availability of services and some basic food items. There have been some violent incidents at petrol stations. If you need to travel by road, consider how you will get fuel during your journey and whether you have sufficient fuel for your return trip.
On 31 January 2019 the border between Sudan and Eritrea was reopened, having been closed since January 2018. A heavy security presence remains in the area.
Terrorists are likely to try to carry out attacks in Sudan. Attacks could be indiscriminate, including in places frequented by expatriates and foreign travellers. See Terrorism
Consular support is severely limited in parts of Sudan where we advise against all travel and all but essential travel. The British Embassy no longer registers British nationals in Sudan and the capacity of the British Embassy to help in times of crisis may be limited. You should consider your own travel arrangements carefully and make sure you have up-to-date travel documents and visas in case you need to leave at short notice. In case of a crisis this page outlines the precautions you should take and the help and support the British Embassy can provide.
If you’re abroad and you need emergency help from the UK government, contact the nearest British embassy, consulate or high commission.
The Overseas Business Risk service offers information and advice for British companies operating overseas on how to manage political, economic, and business security-related risks.
Take out comprehensive travel and medical insurance before you travel.
