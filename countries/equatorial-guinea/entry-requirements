Entry rules in response to coronavirus (COVID-19)
Entry to Equatorial Guinea
Equatorial Guinea has reopened its borders to nationals, residents, diplomats and visa holders travelling for business reasons or with government approval.
The Government of Equatorial Guinea has announced that entry into Equatorial Guinea is prohibited for all passenger flights (including stopover flights) from the UK.
On 9 January, the Government of Equatorial Guinea announced the suspension of flights by French airline Air France.
Diplomatic missions and international organisations must submit a list of their personnel and/or family members travelling to Equatorial Guinea in advance of their arrival, to the Ministry of Foreign Affairs and Cooperation confirming the date of arrival, flight number and place of origin.
On arrival, you will be required to provide proof of a negative coronavirus (COVID-19) test, using a polymerase chain reaction (PCR) test, taken within the last 48 hours.
If you do not present a negative COVID-19 test result on arrival, you will be required to undergo a COVID-19 test at the airport at a cost of approximately £200 and must quarantine for 3-5 days in a location approved by Equatorial Guinea authorities at your own expense, while you await the test results. If your test result is returned positive, you must self-isolate for a further 14 days.
You should not use the NHS testing service to get a test in order to facilitate your travel to another country. You should arrange to take a private test.
Screening on arrival
Your temperature will be taken at arrival at airports and ports.
Visas
You will need a visa to visit Equatorial Guinea. Equatorial Guinea diplomatic missions abroad may issue diplomatic and business entry visas to Equatorial Guinea, however this is kept under review.
The Government of Equatorial Guinea has confirmed it will not penalise British nationals whose visas have expired while they are unable to leave the country due to coronavirus restrictions. If this is your situation, you should write a letter to the Ministry of Foreign Affairs (Visa Section) informing them, and keep a copy for future visa applications. You will be allowed to leave the country freely when able to, and this will not affect your chances of being granted a visa in the future.
Regular entry requirements
Passport validity
Your passport should be valid for a minimum period of 6 months from the date of entry.

Check that your passport is properly stamped at the airport, on arrival and departure, before leaving the immigration desk. There have been reports of travellers being delayed or threatened with detention because their passports have not been properly stamped.
If you replace your passport the Equatorial Guinea authorities will require the old passport prior to issuing a replacement visa in your new passport. The authorities will not admit travellers on visas entered into old passports, even if the visa is still valid.
Long-term visitors are required to obtain a residence permit of 1 year validity from the Ministry of National Security. Holders of a residence permit no longer require a visa to exit or enter Equatorial Guinea during the validity of their residence permit.
If you’re arriving by air you may be required to fill in a health questionnaire related to recent travel to Ebola-affected countries (Liberia/Guinea/Sierra Leone).
