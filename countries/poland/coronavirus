Public spaces and services
Masks are no longer compulsory in open public spaces if you are able to maintain 2m distance from others. Children under 4 are not required to wear masks. When outside, you should keep a 2 metre distance from others, unless you are a parent with a child under 13 or the carer of a disabled person.
There are no longer restrictions on the number of people attending religious services and funerals. The government has announced that from 6 June you are allowed to organise wedding receptions and other family celebrations for up to 150 people.
Public transport use is operating with reduced capacity seating to maintain appropriate distance between passengers. Masks must be worn. You can still use taxis.
There are fines between £1000 to £6000 (5000 to 30000 PLN) if you are found breaking these rules.
Some sporting facilities are open with limits on visitor numbers. If you plan to visit a cultural or sports venue we recommend first consulting their website for information about opening. Many have information in English as well as Polish. National Forests, parks and beaches are open.
There are no limits on customer numbers in shops but you must cover your nose and mouth and wear single-use gloves. Restaurants and pubs are permitted to open but you must wear a mask when not seated at the table. Hairdressers may also open by appointment only. Some museums, libraries and cultural venues are open. Cinemas, theatres and concert halls are open with capacity limited to 50% and masks must be worn. Swimming pools, gyms, indoor play centres and theme parks, saunas, tanning salons, massage salons and tattoo parlours are also open, with strict hygiene rules in place. Masks must be worn at massage salons and tattoo parlours.
The above measures may be extended further, in scope and time, at short notice.
The Office for Foreigners allows in-person appointments but you must adhere to strict social distancing guidelines and wear a mask.
