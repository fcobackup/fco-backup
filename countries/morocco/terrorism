Terrorists are very likely to try to carry out attacks in Morocco. You should be vigilant at all times.
The Moroccan authorities have warned of an increased threat linked to the growing number of Moroccans sympathetic or belonging to Daesh (formerly referred to as ISIL) and other extremist groups, and regularly report the disruption of terrorist cells, some of which have intended to carry out attacks in Morocco against government installations, public spaces and tourist sites.
In late January 2017, the Moroccan authorities reported the disruption of a terrorist cell and the arrest of several of its members the coastal town of El Jadida. The cell was operating in several cities and aiming to produce explosive devices to attack political and public figures, diplomatic premises and tourist sites in Morocco.
Attacks could be indiscriminate and could target foreigners. In April 2011, 17 people were killed and 25 injured in a large explosion caused by a bomb in Marrakech at the Argana Restaurant in Djema el-Fna Square.
Protective security measures, including security personnel, may be visible in certain areas including hotels and sites popular with tourists.
Thereâ€™s considered to be a heightened threat of terrorist attack globally against UK interests and British nationals, from groups or individuals motivated by the conflict in Iraq and Syria. You should be vigilant at this time.
