The currency of Mozambique is the Metical (‘meticais’ in plural).
When entering or exiting the country, travellers must declare any physical amount of money above 10,000 meticais or $10,000 US dollars, or equivalent in other foreign currencies.
Make sure you can access money in a variety of ways. Travellers’ cheques are not commonly accepted. US dollars and South African rand are the main exchange currencies.
Credit cards are increasingly accepted in the larger cities. You should tell your bank before using your card in Mozambique.
