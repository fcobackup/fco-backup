The information on this page covers the most common types of travel and reflects the UK government’s understanding of the rules currently in place. Unless otherwise stated, this information is for travellers using a full ‘British Citizen’ passport.
The authorities in the country or territory you’re travelling to are responsible for setting and enforcing the rules for entry. If you’re unclear about any aspect of the entry requirements, or you need further reassurance, you’ll need to contact the embassy, high commission or consulate of the country or territory you’re travelling to.
You should also consider checking with your transport provider or travel company to make sure your passport and other travel documents meet their requirements.

Regular entry requirements
Visas
If you hold a British Citizen passport, you don’t need a visa to enter Liechtenstein. If you’re planning a stay of longer than 3 months, see the Living in Liechtenstein guide and contact the Swiss Embassy in London if you have further questions.
The rules on travel will stay the same until 31 December 2020.
Visas from 1 January 2021
The rules for travelling or working in Europe will change from 1 January 2021:
You will be able to travel to countries in the Schengen area for up to 90 days in any 180-day period without a visa for purposes such as tourism. This is a rolling 180-day period.
Therefore, if you’re travelling to Liechtenstein, previous visits to the Schengen area within the 180 days before your date of travel would count against the 90-day limit.
If you are travelling visa-free to Liechtenstein and to other countries in the Schengen area, make sure your whole visit is within the limit.
To stay for longer, to work or study, or for business travel you will need to meet the entry requirements set out by Liechtenstein. This could mean applying for a visa or work permit. You should check with the Swiss Embassy in London what type of visa, if any, you will need.
Periods of stay authorised under a visa or permit will not count against the 90-day limit.
The European Commission has not yet set out how the limit of 90 days in any 180-day period for visa-free travel will be implemented for those who are already travelling in the EU or Schengen Area on 31 December 2020.
If you are travelling to Liechtenstein before 31 December 2020 and will stay until 1 January 2021 or later, you should check with the Swiss Embassy for information on how the 90-day visa-free limit will apply to you. This also applies if your stay includes travel to other Schengen area countries.
Passport validity
The rules on travel will stay the same until 31 December 2020.
Your passport should be valid for the proposed duration of your stay; you don’t need any additional period of validity on your passport beyond this.
Passport validity from 1 January 2021
From 1 January 2021, you must have at least 6 months left on an adult or child passport to travel to most countries in Europe (not including Ireland).
If you renewed your current passport before the previous one expired, extra months may have been added to its expiry date. Any extra months on your passport over 10 years may not count towards the 6 months needed.
Check your passport is valid for travel before you book your trip. You will need to renew your passport before travelling if you do not have enough time left on your passport.
UK Emergency Travel Documents (ETDs)
UK ETDs are accepted for entry and exit from Liechtenstein.
Working in Liechtenstein
If you intend to work in Liechtenstein, you should get detailed information on employment regulations from the Migration and Passport Office (in German).
