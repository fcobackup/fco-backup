Crime
Most visits to Curaçao are trouble-free. However, petty theft and street crime is a concern. There is violent crime among members of the illegal drugs world, but this rarely affects tourists. The main tourist areas are generally safe, but you should take normal precautions. Avoid remote areas at night. Don’t take valuables to the beach or leave any valuables in your vehicle. Make sure purses and handbags are closed and not easy to snatch.
The islands of the Dutch Caribbean continue to be used to smuggle illegal drugs from South America to Europe and North America. You should have a heightened sense of awareness of this problem and never leave bags unattended. Under no circumstances should you discuss or agree to carry a package for anyone. Some airports have installed body scanners and it is possible you may be required to have a scan. Dutch authorities generally screen all baggage and passengers from the Dutch Caribbean. 
Local travel
When taking a taxi, always check that it is a registered one and negotiate the price before taking the ride. Most taxis do not have meters. Taxis’ number plates will always start with TX.
Road travel
Traffic drives on the right-hand side. Main road conditions are relatively good, but roads can become slippery when wet.
Air travel
You can find a list of recent incidents and accidents on the website of the Aviation Safety network.
The FCDO can’t offer advice on the safety of individual airlines. However, the International Air Transport Association publishes a list of registered airlines that have been audited and found to meet a number of operational safety standards and recommended practices. This list is not exhaustive and the absence of an airline from this list doesn’t necessarily mean that it’s unsafe.
Political situation
Curaçao is now an autonomous country within Kingdom of the Netherlands, together with Aruba and St. Maarten. It has a separate government, and currently shares a central bank with St. Maarten. The island lies within 50 miles of Venezuela.
