Entry and borders
The Government of Equatorial Guinea has announced the suspension of all international flights.
All land, air and sea borders have been closed, however cargo planes and some commercial activities related to the import of food and work materials into the country will be permitted.
Visas
All Equatorial Guinea diplomatic missions abroad are prohibited from issuing entry visas to Equatorial Guinea.
The Government of Equatorial Guinea has confirmed it will not penalise British nationals whose visas have expired while they are unable to leave the country due to coronavirus restrictions. If this is your situation, you should write a letter to the Ministry of Foreign Affairs (Visa Section) informing them, and keep a copy for future visa applications. You will be allowed to leave the country freely when able to, and this will not affect your chances of being granted a visa in the future.
Local measures
Authorities in Equatorial Guinea have announced a state of emergency lasting until at least 15 May.
People are restricted from movement within the country, except for justified reasons. If you are leaving your house for essential travel, you must carry a permission paper issued by the President of your Neighborhood Community, authorising your movement, which will be issued free of charge. Companies have been asked to provide their employees with permission papers justifying their travel to and from work. The Government has forbidden public transport by bus.
The use of masks when moving around has been made obligatory. Authorities have prohibited all mass gatherings over 10 people, including weddings and sporting events. All educational activities have been suspended.
