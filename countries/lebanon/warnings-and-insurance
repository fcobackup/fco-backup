Register your presence
If you are a British national in Lebanon, Register Your Presence to tell the UK government that you are there. If you previously registered your details with us (before 12 September), you will need to register again.
Registering your presence includes providing your up-to-date contact information. You should complete a separate form for each member of your family or group who is a British national.
Your registration will allow us to share any updates.
Conflict affecting Lebanon
FCDO advises against all travel to Lebanon due to risks associated with the ongoing conflict between Israel, Lebanese Hizballah and other non-state actors in Lebanon. There are ongoing mortar and artillery exchanges and airstrikes in Lebanon, primarily on the boundary with Israel but also in parts of the Beqaa Valley and some other locations north of the Litani river.  On 20 September, a targeted strike hit the southern suburbs of Beirut. Reports suggest several people have been killed and more than 50 injured. British nationals should exercise caution and monitor local media for developments. This is the third strike in Beirut in 2024, all in the same location. The Washington Institute’ provides an online map which may be helpful to understand recently affected areas.
Following the start of the conflict in Israel and the Occupied Palestinian Territories, large protests took place in major cities and near the British and other Western embassies. Further protests cannot be ruled out. Exercise caution and avoid demonstrations.
Tensions are high and events could escalate with little warning, which could affect or limit exit routes out of Lebanon. In the event of deterioration in the political or security situation, commercial routes out of Lebanon could be severely disrupted or cancelled at short notice, and roads across the country could be closed. The British embassy may be increasingly limited in the assistance that it can provide. If you are currently in Lebanon, you should leave now. On 30 July the Foreign Secretary reiterated that British Nationals should leave Lebanon while commercial flights are still running.
Check with airlines and travel companies for updates on flight availability. Ensure your travel documents and those of your family’s are current. If the situation deteriorates, it might not be possible to issue a passport in time for any journey you might plan.
Do not rely on FCDO being able to evacuate you in an emergency.
British Nationals should keep up to date with local and international media including TV and radio stations such as Virgin Radio Lebanon (FM 89.5) and Voice of Lebanon / Sawt Lubnan (FM 100.3 - 100.5) which may be useful sources of information on any developments.
You should have a personal emergency plan that does not rely on the UK government. This may include the ability to leave quickly or to shelter in place if you judge it necessary and safe to do so.
Read FCDO advice on what to do if you’re affected by a crisis abroad and how to prepare.
Explosion of communication devices
On 17 September, a number of pagers, allegedly held by members of Lebanese Hizballah, exploded simultaneously in locations across Lebanon. Lebanon’s Health Ministry have reported thousands of injuries and several killed. Hospitals may be very busy as a result, and you should expect an increased presence of Lebanese Armed Forces in affected areas. British Nationals should exercise caution and monitor local and international media, which may be a useful source of information on developments.
Help and support in Lebanon
You can contact the emergency services by calling 112.
If you need urgent help (for example, you’ve been attacked, arrested or someone has died), call +961 (0)1 960 800.
If you’re in Lebanon and you need advice which is not covered by reading our travel advice, you can contact FCDO online.
While 24-hour consular assistance is available by phone or online, in-person consular support is severely limited outside of Beirut.  
Travel insurance 
If you choose to travel, research your destinations and get appropriate travel insurance. Insurance should cover your itinerary, planned activities and expenses in an emergency.
