The FCDO advises against all but essential travel to:
the whole of Germany based on the current assessment of COVID-19 risks.
The German Government has banned all air passenger flights between the UK and Germany from 2300 (UK time) on Sunday 20 December to 2300 (UK time) on Thursday 31 December. Travellers should consult their airline operator before traveling. The ban does not currently apply to other forms of transport, though further restrictions may be introduced with little notice. All those arriving in Germany from the UK are currently required to self-isolate for ten days.
If you are returning to the UK from Germany on or after 4am on 7 November, you will need to self-isolate on your return (unless you are exempt). Check the latest guidance for England, Northern Ireland, Scotland and Wales.
The FCDO is not advising those already travelling in Germany to leave at this time. Travellers should follow the advice of the local authorities on how best to protect themselves and others, including any measures that they bring in to control the virus. You should contact your tour operator or airline if you have any questions about your return journey.
Travel is subject to possible quarantine
There are COVID-19-related testing and quarantine requirements on arrival into Germany from any part of the UK. See Entry requirements for more information before you plan to travel.
