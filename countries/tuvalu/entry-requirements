This page reflects the UK government’s understanding of current rules for people travelling on a full ‘British Citizen’ passport, for the most common types of travel.
The authorities in Tuvalu set and enforce entry rules. For further information contact the embassy, high commission or consulate of the country or territory you’re travelling to. You should also consider checking with your transport provider or travel company to make sure your passport and other travel documents meet their requirements.
Entry rules in response to coronavirus (COVID-19)
There are limited commercial flights to Tuvalu from Fiji. Your airline or travel agent will be able to provide advice on the latest requirements for travel to Tuvalu, which currently include pre-departure testing and seven-day quarantine on arrival in Tuvalu.
Regular entry requirements
Passport validity
Your passport should be valid for a minimum period of six months from the date of entry into the country.
In the event of a lost or stolen passport, the Tuvalu authorities can issue emergency travel documents which will allow you to travel as far as Fiji. If you need to travel within the minimum full validity passport processing time of 3-4 weeks, you should contact the British High Commission in Suva. You may be eligible for an Emergency Travel Document (ETD).
Keep a photocopy of the relevant pages of your passport to avoid any complications.
Visas
Visas are not required for British nationals visiting for periods of up to one month. An extension of stay for a maximum period of three months is available from the Department of Immigration.
