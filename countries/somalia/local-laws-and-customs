Drug and alcohol offences, including consumption, possession and trafficking, are treated seriously in Somalia (including Somaliland) and are punishable by law. Punishments in Somaliland were tripled in January 2021 and includes the possibility of a lengthy prison sentence without bail.
Khat is a legal drug in Somalia (including Somaliland) but it is an offence to take it out of the country. Bags are regularly searched at Hargeisa and Mogadishu airports and anyone found to be in possession of khat is likely to face criminal prosecution. In Somaliland you must declare to customs officials on entry or exit any cash in excess of $10,000 US dollars (or the equivalent) in foreign currencies.
