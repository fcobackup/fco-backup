This page has information on travelling to Poland. Check what you must do to return to the UK.
This page reflects the UK government’s understanding of current rules for people travelling on a full ‘British Citizen’ passport from the UK, for the most common types of travel.
The authorities in Poland set and enforce entry rules.
All travellers
You will need to fill in a passenger locator form to enter or travel through Poland as a visitor.
All travellers arriving from non-Schengen countries, which includes the UK, who are aged five years and older must present evidence of a negative pre-departure test (PCR or antigen/lateral flow) taken within 24 hours before arrival. The certificate of your test result must be in English or Polish. See information on getting a test before entry. If you do not do so, you will have to quarantine on arrival, whether or not you have been vaccinated, unless you are exempt - see the Polish government’s guidance on possible exemptions.
You may also be able to do test at some airports no later than 3 hours after arrival – check the airport’s website for this service before you travel.
Due to the military conflict in Ukraine, the obligation to quarantine on arrival from Ukraine is suspended for all travellers.
If you’re travelling from an EU member state please see the latest guidance.
Dual nationals
If you are a Polish passport holder you will be treated as a Polish national while in Poland, even if you hold a passport from another country. If you are a dual Polish-British national you must enter and exit Poland with a Polish passport or Polish national identity card. Check with the Polish Embassy in London if in doubt.
If you’re fully vaccinated
If you’re fully vaccinated, you can enter Poland without needing to quarantine on arrival if you present proof that you have been fully vaccinated and evidence of a negative pre-departure test (PCR or antigen/lateral flow) taken within 24 hours before arrival. At least 14 days must have passed since your second dose of a vaccination approved for use in the EU (or complete dose of a single-dose vaccine e.g. Janssen).
Proof of vaccination status
You must present proof that you have been fully vaccinated to avoid needing to quarantine on arrival.
Poland will accept the UK’s proof of COVID-19 recovery and vaccination record. Both digital and paper versions of the certificate are acceptable. Your NHS appointment card from vaccination centres is not designed to be used as proof of vaccination and should not be used to demonstrate your vaccine status.
If you’re not fully vaccinated
On arrival in Poland from the UK or other non-Schengen countries, you must undergo 7 days of mandatory quarantine, unless you are transiting through Poland within 24 hours of arrival (see below.)
You will be registered by border guards in the quarantine database if you do not meet one of the exemptions listed on the Polish border guards’ website (scroll down for English). Please check the Polish government’s website before you travel.
If you’ve had COVID-19 in the past year
If you are not fully vaccinated but have tested positive for COVID-19 in the last 180 days you can enter Poland and be exempt from quarantine if you can present on arrival evidence of your recovery from infection no older than 180 days from the first day of a recognised positive test result. You can use the UK’s proof of COVID-19 recovery record to demonstrate proof of COVID-19 recovery when entering Poland.
Children and young people
Children under 12 years travelling with fully vaccinated adults are exempt from the mandatory quarantine upon arrival in Poland from the UK and other non-Schengen countries. If children under 12 years are travelling with adults who are not fully vaccinated, they are also required to quarantine.
Children 12 years and older are subject to the same rules as adults, set out above. This includes if they are travelling with fully vaccinated parents or guardians. If a child of 12 years or older cannot demonstrate that they are fully vaccinated or have recovered from COVID-19 within 180 days from the first day of a recognised positive test result, they will have to complete mandatory quarantine on arrival in Poland.
If you’re transiting through Poland
Transiting is when you pass through one country on the way to your final destination. If you arrive in Poland by air and are transiting through Poland on your way to another country, you are not required to undergo mandatory quarantine so long as you transit within 24 hours, present evidence of a negative pre-departure test (PCR or antigen/lateral flow) taken within 24 hours before arrival or be tested on arrival, and have a plane ticket which confirms your departure from Poland within 24 hours.
Due to the military conflict in Ukraine, the obligation to quarantine on arrival from Ukraine is suspended for all travellers.
If you arrive in Poland by rail or road from a country other than Ukraine you must present evidence of a pre-departure test (PCR or antigen/lateral flow) taken within 24 hours before arrival to avoid mandatory quarantine.
Exemptions
Some individuals may be exempt from testing or quarantine in Poland on arrival. See exemptions listed on the Polish border guards’ website, (scroll down for English).

Check your passport and travel documents before you travel
Passport validity
If you are planning to travel to an EU country (except Ireland), or Switzerland, Norway, Iceland, Liechtenstein, Andorra, Monaco, San Marino or Vatican City, you must meet the Schengen area rules.
Your passport must meet 2 requirements. It must be:
less than 10 years old on the day you enter (check the ‘date of issue’)
valid for at least 3 months after the day you plan to leave (check the ‘expiry date’)
We are asking the European Commission to clarify the 10-year rule. Their guidance for Schengen border guards may not be updated until the spring of 2022. Until then, for some Schengen countries your passport may need to be less than 10 years old during your whole visit, and the 3 months at the end of your visit may need to be within 10 years of your passport’s issue date.
Check both the issue date and the expiry date in your passport. If you renewed your passport early, extra months may have been added to its expiry date. This could affect the requirement for your passport to be less than 10 years old.
Contact your travel provider or embassy of the country you are visiting if you think that your passport does not meet both these requirements. Renew your passport if you need to.
Visas 
You can travel to countries in the Schengen area for up to 90 days in any 180-day period without a visa. This applies if you travel as a tourist, to visit family or friends, to attend business meetings, cultural or sports events, or for short-term studies or training.
If you are travelling to Poland and other Schengen countries without a visa, make sure your whole visit is within the 90-day limit. Visits to Schengen countries within the previous 180 days before you travel count towards your 90 days.
To stay longer, to work or study, for business travel or for other reasons, you will need to meet the Polish government’s entry requirements. Check with the Polish Embassy what type of visa and/or work permit you may need.
If you are travelling to Poland for work, read the guidance on visas and permits.
If you stay in Poland with a residence permit or long-stay visa, this does not count towards your 90-day visa-free limit.
Passport stamping
Check your passport is stamped if you enter or exit the Schengen area through Poland as a visitor. Border guards will use passport stamps to check you’re complying with the 90-day visa-free limit for short stays in the Schengen area. If relevant entry or exit stamps are not in your passport, border guards will presume that you have overstayed your visa-free limit.
You can show evidence of when and where you entered or exited the Schengen area, and ask the border guards to add this date and location in your passport. Examples of acceptable evidence include boarding passes and tickets.
You may also need to:
show a return or onward ticket
show you have enough money for your stay
If you are resident in Poland, read our Living in Poland guide for passport stamping information.
Residents
There are separate requirements for those who are resident in Poland. If you are resident in Poland, you should carry proof of residence as well as your valid passport when you travel. For further information on these requirements, see the Polish Border Guards guidance (in Polish) and our Living in Poland guide.
UK Emergency Travel Documents
You can use a UK Emergency Travel Document to enter, airside transit and exit from Poland.
