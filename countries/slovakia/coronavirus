Be prepared for your plans to change
No travel is risk-free during COVID-19. Countries may further restrict travel or bring in new rules at short notice, for example due to a new COVID-19 variant. Check with your travel company or airline for any transport changes which may delay your journey home.
If you test positive for COVID-19, you may need to self-isolate in your accommodation until you test negative. You may also need to seek treatment. See the Slovak government COVID-19 website for advice in English on “What to do if I am COVID-19 positive”.
Plan ahead and make sure you:
can access money
understand what your insurance will cover
can make arrangements to extend your stay and be away for longer than planned
Public spaces and services
On 14 March, the Slovak government lifted most of the restrictions placed on public life to counter the spread of COVID-19. You should check the Slovak government COVID-19 website (Slovak only) for the latest restrictions and exemptions as these can change at short notice. You may wish to use an online translation tool as the pages in English are not always updated regularly. There is also information on the latest measures in English on the IOM Migration Information Centre, Slovak Spectator and Radio Slovakia International websites.
It is only compulsory to wear facemasks when visiting healthcare facilities.
Shops, restaurants, hotels and services no longer require you to show proof of vaccination, recovery or a negative COVID-19 test.
Healthcare in Slovakia
If you are in Slovakia and you are concerned that you may have the symptoms of coronavirus, you should follow the advice of the Slovak authorities and contact your usual healthcare provider by telephone or email, not in person. If your symptoms are severe, you should call 155 or 112, where some operators may speak English.
The Slovak government website has information in English and advice on how to get tested for Covid-19 (currently in Slovak only). You can also consult your nearest regional office of the Slovak Public Health Authority on their website.
If you test positive for COVID-19
The period of self-isolation is 5 days if you test positive for COVID-19. The 5 day period begins from the day you first display symptoms or when your test was taken. You should inform anyone that you have been in close contact with during the previous 2 days. For the Slovak government’s definition of ‘close contact’, see the next section. If you display no symptoms during the final 24 hours of the 5-day quarantine period, you may end your self-isolation after the 5th day. If you continue to display symptoms, your doctor will advise when you can end your self-isolation. You should continue to wear an FFP2-standard facemask for an additional 5 days following the end of your self-isolation.
For more information, see the Slovak Spectator website in English or the Slovak Public Health Authority website (in Slovak only).
If you are in contact with somebody who tests positive for COVID-19
If you have been in close contact with a person who has tested positive for COVID-19, not required to self-isolate, unless advised otherwise by a doctor.
The Slovak Public Health Authority defines you as having come into close contact with someone who tested positive if you were not wearing an FFP2-standard facemask and:
were in direct physical contact
or spent more than five minutes at a distance of less than two metres
or spent more than five minutes inside or in an enclosed space
or travelled on the same means of transport for more than five minutes
For more information, see the Slovak Public Health Authority website (in Slovak only) or the Slovak Spectator website (in English).
