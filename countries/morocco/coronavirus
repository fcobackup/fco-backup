State of Health Emergency
A state of health emergency has been in place in Morocco since 20 March 2020.
A vaccine pass is required to enter public places including hammams, gyms, cafes, restaurants, hotels, shops and sports halls. A vaccine pass will also be required to access public administration buildings.
People who have received two or more vaccine shots through Morocco’s national vaccination scheme are able to download a vaccine pass. The document contains a QR code, which can be stored in digital format or printed.
Morocco will accept the UK’s proof of COVID-19 vaccination record. Your NHS appointment card from vaccination centres is not designed to be used as proof of vaccination and should not be used to demonstrate your vaccine status.
The wearing of face masks in public spaces remains mandatory.
Further local restrictions may be applied by local authorities in cities/prefectures/provinces or in some cases in certain neighbourhoods.
Failing to respect the rules can lead to a prison sentence of up to three months or a fine of up to MAD 1300.
