The final round of Guatemala’s Presidential Elections were held on 20 August. However, the electoral process has been contested by Guatemala’s Public Ministry, leading to public protests and roadblocks across the country including some zones of Guatemala City (zones 1, 2 & 4), Sololá (Lake Atitlan), Totonicapán, Alta Verapaz, San Marcos, Quetzaltenango, Sacatepéquez (close to Antigua), Quiché and the north of Petén. Guatemalan authorities have increased the presence of police officers in key locations, such as the airport, to limit the impact that the protests may have on services.
