Public spaces and services
The Slovak government has imposed restrictions on public life to counter the spread of COVID-19.
There are nationwide restrictions on movement outside the home. A nationwide curfew with stricter lockdown measures in place for a 20 hour period each day from 5am to 1am the following day has been extended to 7 February. Current exemptions to the curfew (but see below) include:
Going to a food shop or chemist
For medical appointments including C19 testing, care of relatives and of pets
Attending the funeral, marriage or christening of a close relative
Walking a dog or cat within a distance of 1000 metres
Following a nationwide Covid-19 screening programme different restrictions will apply from 3 February within those districts with higher infection prevalence, where the screening is being repeated. In these districts (marked in red on the Slovak Ministry of Health website’s colour-coded map or detailed in a Slovak government resolution in Slovak only) either a negative test result, proof of recovery from C19 within the last 3 months, or a course of vaccination completed at least 14 days previously will be required for the following activities:
Travel to work where working from home is not possible
Travel to or from abroad
Accessing those services that remain open, such as post offices, banks, opticians and filling stations
Taking children to school
Walking or exercising outdoors
Despite being marked red in the Health Ministry’s map, Bratislava and Nitra have been exempted from the above additional requirements. For Bratislava, Nitra and the areas not marked in red in the Health Ministry map, the above activities are permitted without negative test certificates.
Nationwide, the following restrictions remain in force:
Facemasks must be worn outdoors in all built-up areas, such as towns and villages. The wearing of facemasks remains compulsory indoors, including on public transport and in shops. Masks are not required in the countryside if you are with others from the same household or can maintain a five-metre distance
Visits to and meetings with other households are no longer allowed
Restaurants, bars and cafés may only operate a takeaway service
Ski resorts and hotels are closed
The number of people in shops is restricted and temperature checks may be carried out at the entrances. You must maintain a two metre distance when queuing. Supermarkets and chemists have reserved shopping hours between 9am and 11am for those over 65
Walking or exercising is only permitted areas of countryside within your local district. In the case of Bratislava and Kosice, this restriction applies within the city boundary
Full details of the curfew and its exemptions (in Slovak only) are on the Slovak Government website.

Healthcare in Slovakia
If you are in Slovakia and you are concerned that you may have the symptoms of coronavirus, you should follow the advice of the Slovak authorities and contact your usual healthcare provider by telephone or email, not in person. If your symptoms are severe, you should call 155 or 112, where some operators may speak English.
The Slovak government website has information in English and advice on how to get tested for Covid-19 (currently in Slovak only). You can also consult your nearest regional office of the Slovak Public Health Authority on their website.
For contact details of local hospitals visit our list of healthcare providers. UK-issued prescriptions are not accepted at Slovak pharmacies, and you should bring sufficient supplies with you to cover your stay. If you need repeat medication you would need to consult a local doctor to get a Slovak prescription issued.
