This page gives you guidance on how to stay safely in Singapore as a visitor, if you are unable to return to the UK.
Everyone should comply with the measures put in place in Singapore to limit the spread of coronavirus (COVID-19).
Moving around in Singapore
Until at least 1 June all but essential workplaces, including most shops, are closed, as are all schools and education institutions.
You should not socialise with anyone outside your immediate household. Unless your workplace is deemed essential you should stay in your place of residence other than for essential journeys within your neighbourhood for food, medical needs and exercise, and stay at least 1 metre away from anyone when out. If you have to go out, you should go alone unless unavoidable. Read about the restrictions on the Singapore Ministry of Health website. The wearing of facemasks is compulsory for everyone when leaving their place of residence, except children under 2 or those engaged in strenuous exercise.
Those who do not comply with these measures will be fined. Repeat offenders will face further fines and/or prosecution. Be aware that restrictions and penalties are subject to change at short notice.
