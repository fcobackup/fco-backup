Coronavirus guidance is being updated.
Read what you can and cannot do

India’s land borders are closed and international flights are currently suspended. There is no guarantee that flights will begin straight away once the lockdown is lifted, so if you have booked a flight with a commercial airline during May 2020 you should be prepared for the possibility that the flight will not operate.
UK special flights
There are currently no further UK Government flights planned from India.
If you’re in India and need consular assistance, contact your nearest British high commission or consulate.
