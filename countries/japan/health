Before you travel check that:
your destination can provide the healthcare you may need
you have appropriate travel insurance for local treatment or unexpected medical evacuation
This is particularly important if you have a health condition or are pregnant.
Emergency medical number
Dial 119 and ask for an ambulance.
Contact your insurance company promptly if you’re referred to a medical facility for treatment.

Healthcare facilities in Japan
Medical facilities in Japan are of a high quality, but treatment is expensive. You should expect to pay the whole cost of any treatment you receive. Delays may occur while medical facilities check your insurance.
Make sure you have adequate travel health insurance to cover treatment of new or existing medical conditions and accessible funds to cover the cost of treatment and repatriation.
