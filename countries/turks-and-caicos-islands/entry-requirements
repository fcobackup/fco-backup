Entry rules in response to coronavirus (COVID-19)
Entry to Turks and Caicos Islands
Anyone arriving to the Turks and Caicos Islands is required to obtain pre-travel authorisation via the Turks and Caicos Islands Assured Portal. With effect from Wednesday 1 September all travellers to Turks & Caicos aged 16 and above must be fully vaccinated and all travellers aged 10 and above (including those fully vaccinated) will be required to upload on to the TCI Assured Portal, one of the following professionally administered test results for entry to the TCI:
Reverse Transcription Polymerase Chain Reaction Tests result (RT-PCR);
Nucleic Acid Amplification test result (NAA);
RNA or molecular test results; or
an Antigen test result
Tests and results need to have been completed within three days of the date of arrival into Turks and Caicos.
Travellers will also be required to provide proof of health/travel insurance with COVID-19 cover and a completed health screening questionnaire. From 1 September 2021, all visitors aged 16 and above will also need to provide evidence of full vaccination against COVID-19 on arrival to TCI. NHS vaccine cards and/or a letter from your GP or professional body where you were fully vaccinated will be accepted as proof of your vaccination in the UK.
From 1 September 2021, any fully vaccinated tourist testing positive whilst in TCI must self-isolate at their own expense for a period of ten days (10) and undergo a COVID-19 mandatory test on day seven (7) prior to being released.
Any returning resident that is not fully vaccinated must submit a negative, pre-arrival Covid-19 test, and self-quarantine for a period of seven (7) days, including their household, and undergo a mandatory test (required to be negative) on day five (5) prior to being released.
You should not use the NHS testing service to get a test in order to facilitate your travel to another country. You should arrange to take a private test. All visitors will be required to wear masks on arrival to the Turks and Caicos Islands. More information on pre-travel authorisation to the Turks and Caicos Islands is available online.
