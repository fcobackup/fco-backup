The Foreign and Commonwealth Office (FCO) continues to advise against all travel to Libya, and for British nationals still in Libya to leave immediately by commercial means. Local security situations are fragile and can quickly deteriorate into intense fighting and clashes without warning.
Terrorists are very likely to try to carry out attacks in Libya. There remains a high threat throughout the country of terrorist attacks and kidnap against foreigners, including from Daesh-affiliated extremists (formerly referred to as ISIL) and Al Qaida, as well as armed militias. Daesh and Al Qaeda have attacked a number of oil and gas installations and killed or kidnapped workers, including foreign nationals. See Safety and security and Terrorism.
Fighting has caused the temporary suspension or closure of airports, closed roads and led to the closure of some border crossings. All airports are vulnerable to attack. Tripoli International Airport has been closed since 13 July 2014. On 15 January 2018, there were at least 20 fatalities and 60 wounded after clashes around Mitiga airport in Tripoli, temporarily closing the airport. Limited commercial departure options are sometimes available, but you should check with your airline.
If you choose to travel to Libya against FCO advice, you should consider your security arrangements carefully and take all necessary security precautions, including contingency plans. You should also take out comprehensive travel and medical insurance before you travel. If you’re entering Libya as a media representative, you should get press accreditation from the relevant Libyan authorities.
You must get permission before taking any photographs or interviewing at or near military facilities. If you choose to travel to Libya against FCO advice, you should get the right visa, or risk deportation. See Entry Requirements
The British Embassy in Tripoli remains temporarily closed. The British government cannot provide consular assistance, including any form of assisted departure, to British nationals in Libya. If you’re in Libya (against FCO travel advice) and need urgent help from the UK government (eg if you have been arrested), you should contact the consular section at the British Embassy in Tunis. If you’re in the UK and are concerned about a British national in Libya, call the FCO on 020 7008 1500.
