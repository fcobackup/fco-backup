Crime
Be aware of the risk of street crime and take sensible measures to protect yourself and your belongings. Take particular care of your passport, bankcards, bags, jewellery, laptop and mobile, especially on public transport, when travelling to and from the airport and in crowded areas including markets. There is an active black market in forged and stolen passports. Credit card fraud is common.
British nationals of Pakistani origin have been targeted by criminals, including kidnappers, as they are often perceived as being wealthier than locals.
Much of Balochistan, rural Sindh and Khyber-Pakhtunkhwa, including the Federally Administered Tribal Areas and Agencies, have a high level of lawlessness.
Political situation
National and provincial elections took place on 25 July 2018. In the run-up, political rallies were the target of terrorist attacks. On 10 July, 21 people were killed in a terrorist attack on an event in Peshawar. On 13 July, bombings occurred at campaign events in Mastung (Baluchistan), killing over 150 people, and in Bannu (Khyber Pakhtunkhwa). Some polling stations were targeted on election day, including a bomb attack outside a polling station in Quetta which killed 33 people. It’s possible that there may be further violence in the aftermath of the polls. More generally, public demonstrations and civil disorder are common in Pakistan. Protests can occur with little warning and while most remain peaceful, they can turn violent quickly. You should avoid demonstrations, large crowds of people and public events.
Local travel
The Pakistan authorities currently advise that “all foreigners, including diplomats may not move out of their city of residence without proper security and without prior co-ordination with the law enforcement agency”. This requirement has not been rigorously enforced, but you should consider informing local authorities of any travel plans, and be prepared to be stopped and challenged by officials, who may instruct you to turn around.
If you travel to any of the regions listed below, you or your travel company should contact the local authorities in advance to check the local security situation. They may arrange police protection as necessary and will advise whether you need a No Objection Certificate issued by the Pakistani Ministry of Interior.
Border areas
Except for official border crossing points, foreigners aren’t allowed to travel within 10 miles of Pakistan’s international borders and the Kashmir Line of Control, or within 30 miles of the Afghan border in Gilgit-Baltistan.
Balochistan
There is a heightened risk from kidnapping and militant activity in much of Balochistan. There are frequent sectarian attacks in and around Quetta. If you intend to visit these areas, make sure you have the necessary permission from the authorities and proper security arrangements in place.
Gilgit-Baltistan
On 3 August, militants attacked around a dozen schools in the Chilas, Darel and Tangir areas of Daimer District. In security operations that followed, 2 militants were killed and over 30 arrested. Further attacks on schools and security operations in response are possible. You should seek and follow the advice of the local authorities.
The terrain in Gilgit-Baltistan is mountainous, with remote and isolated locations that are difficult to police effectively. You are strongly advised to obtain and follow local security advice and make appropriate personal security arrangements in advance of any visit. There are also occasional outbursts of sectarian violence in and around Gilgit.
All foreign nationals must register with the local authorities when visiting Gilgit-Baltistan. You may need a permit for mountaineering or trekking, in particular for mountains over 6,000 metres. The process can take up to 2 months and is best organised through a travel company. The validity of your travel insurance policy may be affected if you don’t have the correct permits.
Use reputable trekking agencies, stay on established routes, and always walk in groups. Don’t trek alone. Be aware of the risks of altitude sickness.
Karachi
Karachi has seen an improvement in the overall security situation in recent years, however is still prone to high levels of violence, and the safety of daily activity can be unpredictable. The city is vulnerable to serious violent ethnic conflict between different communities. Criminal and political violence is also common including armed carjacking, robbery, kidnap and murder. Strikes called by various religious and political parties are capable of causing significant disruption across the city and can occasionally lead to violent civil unrest. Smaller scale strikes, attributed to domestic services and pay, are also a common occurrence and cause regular disruptions on a more localised scale.
Terrorist related activity continues in Karachi. In 2018, there were a number of targeted assassinations against law enforcement officers and political figures, and a series of IED explosions. The Chinese Consulate was also attacked in November 2018. Public service and health officials have been subject to attacks in the past whilst delivering health programmes.
There is a particular risk of violence following Friday prayers and in areas such as Lyari, Malir, Quaidabad and Orangi Town. You should carefully plan any travel within the city, take advice from hosts or trusted contacts, abide by direction from law enforcement officers and be prepared to cancel or curtail your plans.
Karakoram Highway
The Karakoram Highway runs from Hasan Abdal in north Punjab towards Gilgit and the Chinese border. The FCO advise against travel on the Highway between Islamabad and Gilgit. You should avoid travelling on the Highway at night - the road can be narrow with sudden steep drops. All sections of the Highway north of Batagram up to the Chinese border have experienced landslides.
Khyber-Pakhtunkhwa
There is regular military or militant activity in the districts of Swat, Buner, Malakand, Nowshera, Swabi and Lower Dir. Localised curfews may be imposed at short notice.
The Kalesh Valley, Bamoboret Valley and Arandu District to the south and west of Chitral in Khyber-Pakhtunkhwa have seen an increase in militant activity, which has included abductions, violent armed robbery and murder.
Pakistan-administered Kashmir
Make sure you have the necessary permissions to travel. Specific requirements can change and you should check the latest requirements before travelling. A No Objection Certificate is always required for foreign nationals to travel within 10 miles of the Line of Control or to enter Pakistan-administered Kashmir via Muzaffarabad.
Punjab
If you travel to southern Punjab take advice about the local security situation in advance. There are frequent reports of criminality and public order incidents.
Sindh
There is a very high risk from crime and kidnapping in Interior Sindh. There are reports of increased criminality in Hyderabad.
Air travel
The new airport in Islamabad started operations on 3 May, with flights switching across from the old (Benazir Bhutto) facility. You should check details with your airline prior to travel, and be prepared for potential delays or disruption. Public transport from the new site is limited, but taxi services are available.
Security was tightened at Pakistan’s airports following a number of terrorist attacks on key airports and aircraft in 2014. Allow yourself enough time to get through enhanced security checks, but don’t linger unnecessarily at airports. Be vigilant, follow instructions from security and airport personnel, and contact your airline in the event of any disruption.
Rail travel
Avoid using the railway network, which has been subject to frequent attacks and derailments. There have been attacks on railway stations in Punjab, and militants have planted bombs on the rail network in Balochistan and Sindh.
Road travel
From 28 March 2019, you should have a 1968 International Driving Permit (IDP) to drive in Pakistan. 1926 IDPs previously issued by the UK may no longer be accepted after this date. From 1 February 2019, you can only get IDPs over the counter from 2,500 UK Post Offices. You will not be able to buy an IDP outside the UK, so get one before you travel. If you’re planning to hire a car, check with your car hire company for information on their requirements before you travel.
Take particular care on long road journeys and when travelling cross-country. Local driving standards are erratic, especially at night. Road conditions are poor and there is a risk of carjacking.
Avoid using street taxis. Only use taxis from reputable companies which are radio-controlled.
For security reasons, you should avoid using public transport, including the Metro Bus which operates between Rawalpindi and Islamabad.
Sea travel
The threat from piracy within 12 nautical miles of the Pakistani coastline is low, but you should be aware of the significant threat piracy poses in the Gulf of Aden and Indian Ocean.
