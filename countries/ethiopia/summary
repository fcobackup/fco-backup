The Ethiopian Federal government has declared a State of Emergency in Tigray Regional State, following military clashes in Tigray and northern Amhara. The FCDO is now advising against all travel in Tigray and within 30km of its borders with Amhara and Afar regional states. Flights to northern Ethiopia have been suspended, including to Mekelle, Shire and Axum. Explosions have been reported at military sites and airports in Gonder, Bahir Dar and Lalibela. Exercise extreme caution in these areas; stay away from military sites and airports wherever possible and comply with the instructions of the authorities. Mobile networks and internet connections are not operating in Tigray. If you’re a British national in Tigray and you wish to leave or cannot contact the British Embassy in Addis Ababa, you should register with the UNICEF office in Mekelle, where safe to do so.

There are frequent incidences of civil unrest in Ethiopia, including protests and strikes. Some of these can cause temporary closure of roads, internet and mobile networks or disruption to local businesses and transport. In the past some protests have escalated into serious violence, including in Addis Ababa and parts of Oromia region during June 2020. Further protests are possible. See Local travel
Tensions are raised in the Somali Regional State and on the border between the Somali and Oromia Regions following clashes in a number of locations, including in the East and West Harerge zones and in the areas surrounding the town of Moyale on the border with Kenya. These clashes have led to a number of deaths. Although there are no reports of foreign nationals being targeted, you should exercise caution and follow the advice of local authorities.

Terrorists are likely to try to carry out attacks in Ethiopia. Attacks could be indiscriminate, including in places visited by foreigners. You should be vigilant at all times, especially in crowded areas and public places like transport hubs, hotels, restaurants, bars and places of worship and during major gatherings like religious or sporting events. There is a threat of kidnapping in Ethiopia’s Somali region, and on the southern border with Kenya, particularly in the eastern areas to which the FCDO advise against all travel. See Terrorism
Internet connections in Ethiopia, including mobile data, can be intermittent.
