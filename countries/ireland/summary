Travel to Ireland is subject to entry restrictions
There is a legal requirement for all travellers to quarantine on arrival for 14 days, with limited exceptions. For more information please go to the entry requirements section of the travel advice.
All passengers must complete a 14 day mandatory hotel quarantine if you have travelled from any country deemed high risk by the Irish government. This also includes travelling through an airport or port in a high risk country and for those without a negative/not detected PCR test. (Travellers whose journey originates from Northern Ireland are outside the scope of quarantine schemes unless you have been overseas 14 days prior to your arrival in Ireland.)
All passengers arriving at Irish ports and airports will be required to have evidence of a negative/ ‘not detected’ test from a pre-departure Reverse Transcription Polymerase Chain Reaction (RT-PCR) COVID-19 test taken no more than 72 hours prior to arrival in Ireland.
People arriving in Ireland without evidence of a negative/‘not-detected’ test result will be committing an offence and may be subject to prosecution, punishable by a fine not exceeding €2,500, or imprisonment for a term not exceeding 6 months, or both. Passengers whose journey originates in Northern Ireland are not in scope of this announcement but any such travel is subject to the public health restrictions in place in Northern Ireland and Ireland respectively.
All passengers arriving in Ireland must complete a Covid-19 Passenger Locator Form. If you don’t fill out this form you can be fined up to €2,500 or get a prison sentence of up to 6 months.
