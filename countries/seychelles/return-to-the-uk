Flights
Many airlines are cancelling, changing or reducing their inward and outward flight schedules. You should urgently contact your airline or tour operator to confirm travel arrangements if you are due to travel to or from Seychelles.
You will need to pay for your return travel to the UK. If departure options are available but you cannot afford the travel costs and have exhausted all other options for getting funds, you may be eligible to apply for an emergency loan from the government. This is a last resort option and you would need to repay the loan when you are back in the UK. For more information, you should contact Corporate Travel Management (CTM). CTM are a commercial partner of the FCO and are authorised to administer such loans on behalf of the FCO.
Arrival in the UK
When you arrive back in the UK, follow the guidance for when you return to the UK on steps you should take to protect yourself and others.
Help and support
The British High Commission team is available to offer advice between 07.30 and 19.30 (local time, Seychelles) every day of the week on a dedicated extended telephone service which can be reached on +248 260 0451.
