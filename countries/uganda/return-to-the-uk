There are currently no commercial options to return to the UK from Uganda. Since the 22 March, all international flights to and from Uganda have been suspended. Cargo flights are permitted, but crew must observe strict guidelines. Land borders and lake ports are also closed, except for truck drivers and a crew of up to three people.
We continue to work with the Government of Uganda, other Embassies and airlines to determine options for helping British Nationals who wish to return home. However, you should not expect any additional flights immediately.
What to do
If you cannot leave Uganda at this time, you should:
Follow the advice of the local authorities, including local measures to help minimise your risk of exposure to coronoavirus (COVID-19);
