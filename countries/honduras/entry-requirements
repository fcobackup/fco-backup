Regular entry requirements
Visas
British nationals don’t need a visa to visit Honduras. You can get a 30 day visit entry stamp on arrival. If you wish to extend this you can do so up to a maximum of 90 days by applying at an Immigration Office.
If you overstay your visa then expect to pay a fine at the Immigration Office when you apply to extend your stay or before departure. For information on which office to go to and how to follow this process contact the National Institute of Migration (Facebook).
For more information on entry requirements for other purposes, like voluntary work, contact the Honduran Embassy in London hondurasuk@lineone.net.
Children travelling with only one parent or without both parents or legal guardians must present a notarised letter of consent from the non-travelling parent(s) or legal guardian(s) to enter and exit Honduras. Contact the nearest Embassy or Consulate of Honduras, or if you’re in Honduras the nearest National Institute of Migration (Facebook), for information about the process and language requirements for consent documents.
Passport validity
Your passport should be valid for a minimum period of 6 months from the date of entry into Honduras.
Central America Border Control Agreement
Honduras is party to the Central America Border Control Agreement (CA-4). Under the terms of this agreement, British tourists can travel within any of the CA-4 countries (Honduras, Nicaragua, El Salvador and Guatemala) for a period of up to 90 days without completing entry and exit formalities at border immigration checkpoints. This period begins at the first point of entry of any of the CA-4 countries. Fines are applied for travellers who exceed this 90-day limit, although a request for an extension can be made for up to 30 days by paying a fee before the 90 day limit expires. If you are expelled from any of the four countries you are also excluded from the entire CA-4 region.
