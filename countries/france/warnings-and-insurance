Travel insurance
If you choose to travel, research your destinations and get appropriate travel insurance. Insurance should cover your itinerary, planned activities and expenses in an emergency.
Summer travel
If you are travelling between the UK and France during the peak period of July and August, you may experience longer than usual queues at ports and terminals. Monitor your travel operatorâ€™s website and social media, and follow the advice of the authorities, and ensure you are prepared for potential delays with enough food and water.
