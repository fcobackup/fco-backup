Be prepared for your plans to change
No travel is risk-free during COVID-19. Countries may further restrict travel or bring in new rules at short notice, for example due to a new COVID-19 variant. Check with your travel company or airline for any transport changes which may delay your journey home.
If you test positive for COVID-19, you may need to stay where you are until you test negative. You may also need to seek treatment there.
Plan ahead and make sure you:
can access money
understand what your insurance will cover
can make arrangements to extend your stay and be away for longer than planned
Public spaces and travel within Italy
Public spaces and services
If you are visiting a healthcare facility such as a hospital ward, care home, or doctorâ€™s office, you must wear a FFP2 mask.
You may be asked to provide a negative test result. This can be either a rapid antigen test taken within the previous 48 hours, or a PCR test taken within the previous 72 hours. Self-tests are not accepted. Check with the local health authority or healthcare facility before visiting.
Regional and local authorities in Italy are empowered to adjust these measures where required, which may occur at short notice. You should consult the websites for the regions in which you are travelling for the latest information.
Healthcare in Italy
COVID-19 testing is widely available at private clinics. Rapid testing is also available in many pharmacies. You should contact local authorities for information on testing facilities.
Developing symptoms of COVID-19 while in Italy
If you think you have symptoms, you should take a test at a local pharmacy. You can call your regional hotline for advice. Most of the regional hotlines listed have English speaking staff. You can also call your local ASL (Azienda Sanitaria Locale).
You can find details of English speaking doctors on our list of healthcare providers.
EHIC or GHIC covers state healthcare only, not private treatment. You will be responsible for the cost of any treatment provided by a private doctor or private clinic.
Close contact
If you come into close contact with someone who tests positive, you will need to self-monitor and wear a FFP2 mask for 5 days from the last contact. If you develop symptoms you should take a test when the symptoms occur and, if symptoms remain, test again on the fifth day after being in contact with the positive person. Local health authorities have now indicated you can test in a private facility. If you do so, you must send a digital copy of your negative test certificate to the local ASL office.
For further details please see Ministry of Health website (only in Italian).
Testing positive for COVID-19 while in Italy
If you are tested and the result is positive, you must self-isolate for 5 days. A negative test is no longer required at the end of the 5 day self-isolation period, except in certain cases (e.g. health workers, immunocompromised individuals, travellers from China). If you are asymptomatic, or have been symptom-free for at least 2 days, you must produce a negative PCR or antigen test to be released from the self-isolation period early. The local health authority determines the type of test they will use and the pattern of testing.
Once you have completed the period of self-isolation, you must continue to wear a FFP2 mask for at least 10 days after the onset of symptoms or the first positive test result until you have a negative antigen or molecular test result.
You should follow the advice of the local health authorities at all times as regional variations may apply.
Local health authorities have now indicated you can test in a private facility. If you do so, you must send a digital copy of your negative test certificate to the local ASL office.
