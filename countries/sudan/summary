the southern area of West Kordofan state that was previously part of South Kordofan, as shown on the map
within 50km of the border with South Sudan in White Nile and Sennar states
within 200km of the border with Libya
The FCO advise against all but essential travel to:

within 20km of the border with Eritrea
areas of North Kordofan and West Kordofan states south of the Kost-El Obeid-En Nahud road
Cases of coronavirus (COVID-19) have been confirmed in Sudan. The Sudanese authorities have introduced a number of measures to limit the spread of the virus, including the closure of all borders. However, the Sudanese Civil Aviation Authority has allocated a 48-hour window from 2000 local time (1800 GMT) on Thursday 19 March until 2000 local time (1800 GMT) on Saturday 21 March for international commercial passenger airlines to operate flights into and out of Sudan. See Health
The Sudanese authorities have closed all borders. The Sudanese Civil Aviation Authority has closed all airports including Khartoum International Airport and suspended all international commercial passenger flights.
While the broader political and security situation in Sudan has stabilised since April 2019, you should continue to maintain a high level of vigilance across the country, avoid all protests and large gatherings, monitor developments closely and follow the instructions of local authorities and security services. See Political situation
Consular support is severely limited in parts of Sudan where the FCO has existing advice against all travel and all but essential travel (as set out above). The British Embassy no longer registers British nationals in Sudan and the capacity of the British Embassy to help in times of crisis may be limited. You should consider your own travel arrangements carefully and make sure you have up-to-date travel documents and visas in case you need to leave at short notice. See this crisis guidance page for more information about the precautions you should take in the event of a crisis and the help and support the British Embassy can provide.
Terrorists are likely to try to carry out attacks in Sudan. Attacks could be indiscriminate, including in places frequented by expatriates and foreign travellers. See Terrorism
You will need a visa to visit Sudan. See Visas
If youâ€™re abroad and you need emergency help from the UK government, contact the nearest British embassy, consulate or high commission.
The Overseas Business Risk service offers information and advice for British companies operating overseas on how to manage political, economic, and business security-related risks.
Take out comprehensive travel and medical insurance before you travel.
