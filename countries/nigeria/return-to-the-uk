Financial support for a flight
If you have exhausted all other options available to you for getting funds, you may be eligible to apply for an emergency loan from the government to cover the cost of the ticket.
You would need to repay the loan when you are back in the UK.
CTM is authorised to administer such loans on behalf of the FCO and details will be available when you are asked to pay.
Travel to the airport
You will need to make your own way to the airport. Please plan your journey in advance. After your seat is confirmed you will receive an email containing documents to help you pass through any check points you encounter. You should not go to the airport unless your seat has been confirmed by email.
Your journey home
The National Travel Health Network and Centre (NaTHNaC) provides advice on how to stay safe as you travel by air.
If you’re returning to the UK before 8 June, follow the current guidance for when you return to the UK on steps you should take to protect yourself and others. From 8 June there will be new rules for entering the UK. If your flight arrives on or after 8 June, you will need to follow the latest government guidance.
