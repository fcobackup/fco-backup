Death from COVID-19 in Indonesia
If COVID-19 is given as cause of death and you would like to arrange a local cremation and repatriation of ashes, you will need to make contact with a local undertaker within 4 hours of the death registration to give your instructions. If you do not do this, it is likely that a local burial will take place.
You will also require a letter of no objection from the Embassy. This will be issued on the next working day.
Testing positive for COVID-19 in Indonesia and isolation
If you test positive for COVID-19 during your stay in Indonesia you will be required to take the following action:
Without follow-up PCR test: Isolate for 10 days. Isolation can be at your home or hotel. At the end of 10 days you are deemed recovered.
With follow-up PCR test: Isolate at your home or hotel and take a second PCR test 5 days after your positive test. If this is negative, your Peduli Lindungi App certification will become green and you are deemed to be recovered and can leave isolation.
Travel
Passengers travelling on domestic flights, trains or ferries
If you have been fully vaccinated and boosted you can travel without PCR or antigen test, but must provide proof of vaccination status in hard copy (e.g. NHS Vaccine certificates) and via the Peduli Lindungi App at your check in.
If you have received a booster along with the two initial vaccinations, you can travel without showing a negative COVID 19 test result.
Travellers who have received two vaccinations must show a negative antigen test taken within 1x24 hours or a negative RT-PCR test obtained 3x24 hours prior to departure. You may be offered a booster on-site before departure. Travellers who have received a first dose of vaccine must show a negative RT-PCR test taken 3x24 hours prior to departure. Travellers who are unable to be vaccinated due to a medical condition must show a negative PCR test taken 3x24 hours prior to departure. You will need a doctor’s letter specifying why you cannot be vaccinated.
Travellers under the age of 6 are exempt from vaccination and negative COVID-19 test requirement, however they must travel with an adult who meets all the vaccination and covid19 test requirements.
Children aged 6-17 are excluded from testing, but will be required to provide proof of complete dose of vaccine.
The test certificate should have a readable barcode or QR code and must be issued by a Ministry of Health approved health facility, a list of which can be found here
If the test certificate does not have a QR code an additional PCR test may be required
A completed airline travel declaration form where required
A completed domestic electronic health alert card (e-HAC) which can be found on the Peduli Lindungi app here
Travellers who are 12 and above are required to show proof of full vaccination in the form of a certificate on the Peduli Lindungi app. Proof of vaccination for children between the ages of 12 and 16 can be integrated within their parents app
We recommend all passengers check with their airline for the latest information before travelling
For international air passengers
Passengers who are leaving Indonesia via Jakarta are exempt from showing proof of COVID-19 vaccination if they have no previous travel connection and are leaving directly from Jakarta. Any other passenger must show evidence of COVID-19 vaccination if they have received the vaccine.
Any passengers who have not received a vaccine, intend to leave Indonesia and need to travel domestically to do so, are exempt from showing vaccine certification subject to the following conditions:
they do not leave the airport area during transit
they obtain clearance from the Port Health Office at the point of first departure
they show a full and valid flight itinerary showing all departure and arrival points
Travel requirements change frequently, sometimes at short notice. Please consult the Garuda Indonesia website for up to date information on testing requirements.
Travellers are required to install the Peduli Lindungi app.

Be prepared for your plans to change
No travel is risk-free during COVID-19. Countries may further restrict travel or bring in new rules at short notice, for example due to a new COVID-19 variant. Check with your travel company or airline for any transport changes which may delay your journey home.
Plan ahead and make sure you:
can access money
understand what your insurance will cover
can make arrangements to extend your stay and be away for longer than planned

Healthcare in Indonesia
For contact details for English speaking doctors, visit our list of healthcare providers.
The standard of local medical care in Indonesia can be poor and some medical tests cannot be done reliably. As the government of Indonesia announces rising numbers of COVID-19 cases, there is an increasing risk that the healthcare system will come under significant further strain. Access to routine and emergency healthcare may be limited.
