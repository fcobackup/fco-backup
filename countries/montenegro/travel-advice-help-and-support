Foreign travel checklist
Read our foreign travel checklist to help you plan for your trip abroad and stay safe while you are there.
Travel safety
The FCO travel advice helps you make your own decisions about foreign travel. Your safety is our main concern, but we cannot provide tailored advice for individual trips. If you are concerned about whether or not it is safe for you to travel, you should read the travel advice for the country or territory you are travelling to, together with information from other sources you have identified, before making your own decision on whether to travel. Only you can decide whether it is safe for you to travel.
When we judge the level of risk to British nationals in a particular place has become unacceptably high, we will state on the travel advice page for that country or territory that we advise against all or all but essential travel. Read more about how the FCO assesses and categorises risk in foreign travel advice.
Our crisis overseas page suggests additional things you can do before and during foreign travel to help you stay safe.
Refunds and cancellations
If you wish to cancel or change a holiday that you have booked, you should contact your travel company. The question of refunds and cancellations is a matter for you and your travel company. Travel companies make their own decisions about whether or not to offer customers a refund. Many of them use our travel advice to help them reach these decisions, but we do not instruct travel companies on when they can or cannot offer a refund to their customers.
For more information about your rights if you wish to cancel a holiday, visit the Citizen’s Advice Bureau website. For help resolving problems with a flight booking, visit the website of the Civil Aviation Authority. For questions about travel insurance, contact your insurance provider and if you are not happy with their response, you can complain to the Financial Ombudsman Service.
Registering your travel details with us
We are no longer asking people to register with us before travel. Our foreign travel checklist and crisis overseas page suggest things you can do before and during foreign travel to plan your trip and stay safe.
