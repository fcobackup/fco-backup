The information on this page covers the most common types of travel and reflects the UK government’s understanding of the rules currently in place. Unless otherwise stated, this information is for travellers using a full ‘British Citizen’ passport.
The authorities in the country or territory you’re travelling to are responsible for setting and enforcing the rules for entry. If you’re unclear about any aspect of the entry requirements, or you need further reassurance, you’ll need to contact the embassy, high commission or consulate of the country or territory you’re travelling to.
You should also consider checking with your transport provider or travel company to make sure your passport and other travel documents meet their requirements.
Entry rules in response to coronavirus (COVID-19)
Entry to Hong Kong
Travellers arriving in Hong Kong on flights from overseas countries/territories, who are not Hong Kong residents, will be denied entry to Hong Kong. Non-Hong Kong residents travelling to Hong Kong from mainland China, Macao or Taiwan will also be denied entry if they have been to any overseas country/territory in the past 14 days. Spouses and minor children of Hong Kong residents are exempt from the above restrictions.
All travellers entering Hong Kong, including Hong Kong residents, will have to take a mandatory medical test for coronavirus on arrival and need to undergo 14-day compulsory quarantine. Arrivals may be placed in a Hong Kong government quarantine centre.
From 13 November, travellers arriving at Hong Kong International Airport (with the exception of those travelling from mainland China, Macao and Taiwan) will need to provide confirmation of a hotel room reservation in Hong Kong for no less than 14 days, starting on the day of their arrival. Travellers will then be subject to 14 days compulsory quarantine at that hotel.
On 1 October, the UK was added to the list of “specified high risk places” under the Hong Kong SAR government’s Prevention and Control of Disease Regulation (Cap. 599H). Travellers who have visited these places (United States, Kazakhstan, Bangladesh, Belgium, Ethiopia, France, India, Indonesia, Nepal, Pakistan, the Philippines, Russia, South Africa and Turkey) within the past 14 days, will need to provide a negative nucleic acid test result for COVID-19, taken no more than 72 hours prior to their departure. You should check Hong Kong SAR government’s website for important details about the needed documents. There are additional requirements for children travelling alone, as some hotels do not accept minors without an accompanying adult. Further details can be found on the Hong Kong SAR government’s website.
You should not use the NHS testing service to get a test in order to facilitate your travel to another country. You should arrange to take a private test.
All passengers, including departing, arriving and transfer/transit passengers need to wear face masks in all passenger accessible areas of Hong Kong International Airport.
An Air Travel Bubble (ATB) between Hong Kong and Singapore will launch on 22 November. The ATB will facilitate quarantine-free travel between Hong Kong and Singapore via designated flights. Additional COVID-19 testing is needed. Further information can be found on the Hong Kong Tourism Commission’s website.
For up-to-date advice on entry requirements and restrictions, visit the Hong Kong SAR government coronavirus website.
Transiting Hong Kong
Transit services at Hong Kong International Airport resumed on 15 June for passengers who can be checked through from port of origin to final destination. Transiting between flights operated by different airlines is now allowed. Transiting through Hong Kong from, but not to, mainland China is now allowed. You should check with your travel agent or airline before travelling and check the Hong Kong International Airport website.
There is a risk you will be placed into 14 days government quarantine. All passengers able to transit Hong Kong International Airport will be subject to advanced screening measures, including temperature checks. Those passengers not displaying a high temperature will be allowed to connect to their next flight. But passengers deemed to have a high temperature will undergo further checks by the Port Health Office at the airport. If you meet further risk criteria, you will be transferred to a Hong Kong public hospital for mandatory checks/treatment, where it is highly likely you will be asked to complete a mandatory COVID-19 test. If you successfully pass health screening you need to sit in designated areas at boarding gates and use designated queues in dining facilities and shops, in line with Hong Kong International Airport anti-virus measures.
Travel between Hong Kong, Macao and mainland China
All border crossings with mainland China remain closed indefinitely, with the exception of the Shenzhen Bay Checkpoint and the Hong Kong-Zhuhai-Macau Bridge. All passengers wanting to board a shuttle bus to cross the bridge departing from Hong Kong to Macau must present a certificate confirming that they have tested negative for COVID-19 within seven days of their departure. The special ferry service between Taipa Ferry Terminal in Macao and Hong Kong International Airport has now ceased operations. All ferry crossings between Hong Kong and mainland China are currently not in operation. Kai Tak Cruise and Ocean Terminals are also closed to passengers indefinitely.
Certain groups of people travelling from mainland China, Taiwan and Macao may be granted an exemption from quarantine requirements by applying in advance to the Chief Secretary of the Administration. These groups include people involved in receiving or providing education and those travelling for purposes relating to manufacturing operations, business activities or the provision of professional services in the interest of Hong Kong’s economic development.
Health declaration form
All inbound travellers via Hong Kong International Airport need to submit a health declaration form.
Testing / screening on arrival
All arrivals (including transit passengers) will be subject to advanced screening measures, including temperature checks. Those deemed to have a high temperature will undergo further checks by the Port Health Office at the airport. If they meet further risk criteria, they will be transferred to a Hong Kong public hospital for mandatory checks/treatment.
All asymptomatic arrivals ending their journey at Hong Kong International Airport will have to provide a saliva sample which will be tested for coronavirus. After collecting baggage, travellers will be taken by shuttle bus to the designated location. Travellers will have to wait for test results, before proceeding to their mandatory quarantine location.
Passengers arriving on morning flights must proceed to the Temporary Specimen Collection Centre located in the Midfield Concourse (MFC) in the restricted area of Hong Kong International Airport. You will receive test results on the same day. This could take 8 or more hours. Passengers arriving in the afternoon and evening will need to wait for test results overnight, and will be temporarily accommodated in the Department of Health Holding Centre for Test Results (HCTR) set up in the Rambler Hotel in Tsing Yi. Further information is available on the Centre for Health Protection’s website.
Children travelling to Hong Kong on their own must be met by an adult for checking in to the HCTR whilst they await test results. Please contact the Port Health Authority for the latest guidance (+852 3904 9333).
If the sample tests positive, the Hong Kong authorities will notify you and arrange for admission to a public hospital. All arrivals, including those who test negative for coronavirus, need to undergo 14-day compulsory quarantine. See “Quarantine requirements” below.
Quarantine requirements
Quarantine is usually spent at a hotel, but arrivals may be placed in a Hong Kong government quarantine centre. Family members of someone who tests positive, or those who have been in close contact, need to go in to a government quarantine centre.

For all quarantine arrangements in Hong Kong:
you’re not allowed to leave your designated quarantine location for 14 days. This means you’re also unable to leave Hong Kong for the duration of the quarantine
if you’re allocated a government quarantine centre, you may be asked to contribute around £20 (HK$200) per night towards the cost
items that can be taken in to government quarantine are restricted. There is no smoking allowed and no alcohol. Depending on your centre, facilities may be basic: there may be no fridge and no air-conditioning
you will be issued with a bluetooth-enabled wristband which will be activated at the airport and linked to a mobile app ‘StayHomeSafe’ on your phone. The bluetooth-enabled wristbands will alert the authorities if the wearer leaves their registered address with or without their phone
Failure to comply with the quarantine conditions may result in you being immediately taken to government quarantine facilities. You could face a 6-month prison sentence and a substantial fine. You should comply with the requirements of your quarantine arrangements.
See the Hong Kong government coronavirus website for further information.

While the Hong Kong-Zhuhai-Macao bridge will remain open for some private vehicles between 0600 - 2200, only a limited number of vehicles with specific licenses are permitted to use the crossing.
The Macao government has announced that all travellers arriving in Macao, who are not residents of Macao, Hong Kong, Taiwan or mainland China, will be denied entry. Residents of Hong Kong, Taiwan or mainland China who have travelled overseas in the 14 days prior to their arrival will also be denied entry. Residents of Hong Kong, Taiwan or mainland China who have visited Hong Kong or Taiwan in the 14 days prior to entry will be subject to 14 days of medical surveillance in a designated centre. Macao residents who have been overseas or to Hong Kong or Taiwan in the 14 days prior to entry will be subject to 14 days of medical surveillance in a designated centre. For further information, see Macao travel advice.
There are reports of greater scrutiny from mainland authorities at border crossings between the mainland and Hong Kong and Macau at this time, including checks on travellers’ electronic devices. You should be aware that the thresholds for detention and prosecution in China differ from those in Hong Kong.
Bringing restricted items into Hong Kong
According to Hong Kong law, it’s illegal for visitors travelling to or transiting through Hong Kong International Airport to carry certain items including stun guns, objects with sharp points or edges (eg samurai swords) and martial arts equipment (eg knuckledusters).
