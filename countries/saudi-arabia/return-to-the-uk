There are still commercial options to return to the UK from Saudi Arabia.
If you live in the UK and are currently visiting Saudi Arabia, you’re strongly advised to return now by commercial means. Don’t risk getting stranded.
UK special charter flights will only operate for priority countries where commercial flights are not possible. You should not assume that these flights will become available in Saudi Arabia because commercial routes are operating. Please do not contact the contracted travel management company if no flight is advertised here.
Flights
Flights will only go to London Heathrow: there are no plans to arrange flights to regional airports. Flights will depart from Riyadh and Jeddah. As there will not be flights from Dammam Airport, we will arrange transport to Riyadh for British nationals in the Eastern Province.
What to do
The British Embassy has been working closely with airlines and the Saudi authorities to arrange a regular commercial flight option to the UK as soon as possible. The British Embassy Riyadh is issuing regular updates on Twitter and Facebook with the latest available information on flight departure options for British nationals wishing to leave Saudi Arabia. It is also possible to sign-up for travel advice email alerts here.
British nationals and residents should book tickets directly via commercial channels once flights are announced on our social media channels. We will provide further information about permissions and transportation to the airport when we publish details of each flight.
We are working hard to ensure that there are more opportunities to purchase tickets for flights in the coming months. However, it is not possible to say when flights will depart. Depending on demand, it may not be possible for all Britons to purchase tickets when they wish to travel. If you need to return to the UK, please purchase a ticket for the next available flight.
If you are a British national or resident and require particular assistance (for example, if you are in Saudi Arabia on a short-stay visa; are particularly at risk from the effects of Coronavirus; are an NHS worker; or need to return home for an emergency reason), please email KSA.Info@fco.gov.uk with your phone number, location, visa type, and details.
This email address is not for consular assistance. For consular assistance please call +966 (0) 11 481 9100, or use the forms available for the British Consulate in Riyadh and British Consulate in Jeddah
You will need to pay for your return travel to the UK. If departure options are available but you cannot afford the travel costs and have exhausted all other options for getting funds, you may be eligible to apply for an emergency loan from the government. This is a last resort option and you would need to repay the loan when you are back in the UK. Please contact us by using the form available at for more information on how to apply.
If you cannot leave at this time, you should:
follow the advice of local authorities, including local measures to help minimise your risk of exposure to coronavirus (COVID-19)
find accommodation that’s suitable for your needs
keep in regular contact with family and friends at home, so they know you are safe and well
See more information and advice about staying where you are if you cannot return to the UK.

When you arrive back in the UK, follow the guidance for when you return to the UK on steps you should take to protect yourself and others.
