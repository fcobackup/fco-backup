On 7 January 2021, the President introduced a national curfew in response to outbreaks of violence, following presidential and legislative elections. This curfew comes into effect at 6pm and ends at 5am. You should follow the government’s instructions and avoid travel around Bangui during these hours. Tensions remain high following presidential and legislative elections on 27 December. There is potential for further violence during this period, across the country. Violence has been concentrated in towns and cities, linked to elections. Attacks on individuals and groups, including car-jackings, are likely and unpredictable. You should take extreme care, and take personal security precautions, if possible. There are armed patrols that have set up several roadblocks across the country. Detention by police forces and armed groups is a common occurrence, primarily for CAR nationals, but also for expatriates.
On 13 January 2021, the US Embassy instructed its staff to shelter in place due to reports of violent clashes between PK11 and PK12 areas of the capital, Bangui, and into Bimbo area. You should avoid these areas.
Terrorist attacks in the CAR cannot be ruled out. See Terrorism
