This advice reflects the UK government’s understanding of current rules for people travelling on a full ‘British citizen’ passport from the UK, for the most common types of travel.
The authorities in Australia set and enforce entry rules. If you’re not sure how these requirements apply to you, contact Australia’s High Commission in the UK.
COVID-19 rules
You do not need a pre-departure COVID-19 test to enter or transit Australia regardless of your COVID-19 vaccination status. See the Australian government’s website for advice on COVID-19 and travelling.
COVID-19 quarantine requirements
Each state and territory determines its own quarantine rules. You should check requirements for specific states and territories.
Passport validity requirements
For entry into Australia, your passport should be valid for the proposed duration of your stay. If you’re transiting another country on your way to or from Australia, check the entry requirements for that country. Many countries will only allow entry if you have at least 6 months validity remaining on your passport.
Visa requirements
British citizens can usually get the following types of electronic visitor visa:
eVisitor visa. There is no visa application charge or service fee
Electronic Travel Authority (ETA) via the iOS App or Android App. There is no visa application charge, but a service fee of A$20 may apply
Information on all other types of visa is available from the Department of Home Affairs.
Working holiday visa
Thousands of Britons travel to Australia each year on a working holiday visa and the vast majority have no issues. Working conditions, accommodation and medical facilities are generally of a good standard.
You can find information about your rights as an employee in Australia and how to report any concerns about unfair or unlawful treatment on the Fair Work Ombudsman website, or by calling 131 394.

Dual nationals
If you’re a British national living in Australia with Australian citizenship, or a dual national, it is best to leave and enter Australia on your Australian passport. You could face difficulties and delays if you do not. See Australian government advice for dual nationals.
Vaccination requirements (other than COVID-19)
At least 8 weeks before your trip, check the vaccinations and certificates you need in TravelHealthPro’s Australia guide.
Quarantine of goods
Australia has strict quarantine rules to keep out pests and diseases that could affect plant, animal or human health.
You must fill out an Incoming Passenger Card and either:
declare any risk goods including food, animal products and plant material (including wooden articles)
dispose of any risk goods in the bins at the airport or sea port
All luggage is x-rayed on arrival. Any items of concern are further inspected, treated and if necessary confiscated and destroyed. You can be heavily fined for breaches of quarantine regulations.
You can find more information on the Department of Agriculture website.
You will also be asked to declare whether you have ‘visited a rural area, or been in contact with, or near, farm animals outside Australia in the past 30 days’.
