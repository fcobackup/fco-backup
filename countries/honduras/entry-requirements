Check your passport and travel documents before you travel
You should check with your transport provider or travel company to make sure your passport and other travel documents meet their requirements.
Passport validity
Your passport should be valid for a minimum period of 6 months from the date of entry into Honduras.
Visas
British nationals do not need a visa to visit Honduras. You can get a 30 day visit entry stamp on arrival. You must ensure that you get your passport stamped on arrival to avoid complications on departure. If you wish to extend this you can do so up to a maximum of 90 days by applying at an Immigration Office.
If you overstay you should expect to pay a fine at the Immigration Office when you apply to extend your stay or before departure. For information on which office to go to and how to follow this process, contact the National Institute of Migration.
For more information on entry requirements for other purposes, such as voluntary work, contact the Honduran Embassy in London at hondurasembassyuk@gmail.com.
Travelling with Children
Children travelling with only one parent or without either parents or legal guardians must present a notarised letter of consent from the non-travelling parent(s) or legal guardian(s) to enter and exit Honduras. Contact the Honduran Embassy in London, or if you are in Honduras the nearest National Institute of Migration, for information about the process and language requirements for consent documents.
Central America Border Control Agreement
Honduras is party to the Central America Border Control Agreement (CA-4). Under the terms of this agreement, British tourists can travel within any of the CA-4 countries (El Salvador, Guatemala, Honduras, Nicaragua) for a period of up to 90 days which starts at the first point of entry of any of the CA-4 countries. They will be subject to immigration checks at the border (which does not interrupt or restart the 90-day count). Fines are applied for travellers who exceed this 90-day limit, although a request for an extension can be made for up to 30 days by paying a fee before the 90 day limit expires. If you are expelled from any of the four countries you are also excluded from the entire CA-4 region.
Land borders
If you arrive or depart at a land border, the immigration authorities may charge you a fee of US$3 at the border crossing. Keep the receipt until you leave the country and make sure your passport is stamped.
You may experience some disruptions at the land border crossings between Honduras and Guatemala, due to the passage of migrant caravans.
