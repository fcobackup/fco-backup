Following measures taken by the authorities in Kosovo, there are no commercial options for returning to the UK directly from Kosovo.
As restrictive measures ease, there may be options to return to the UK from neighbouring countries. You should check FCO travel advice for the relevant country for options. If you are considering departing via a neighbouring country, you should contact the British Embassy in Pristina via pristina.consular@fco.gov.uk, more than three days in advance to discuss crossing the border.
This travel advice will be updated if direct departure options become available.
Future travel options
This travel advice will be updated if departure options become available. Sign up for travel advice email alerts and follow the British Embassy on Twitter and Facebook.
If you cannot leave Kosovo at this time, see advice on staying in Kosovo during coronavirus.
Your journey home
The National Travel Health Network and Centre (NaTHNaC) provides advice on how to stay safe as you travel by air.
When you arrive back in the UK, follow the guidance for when you return to the UK on steps you should take to protect yourself and others.
Help and support
If you need consular assistance, you can contact the British Embassy in Pristina on +383 (0) 38 254 700 or pristina.consular@fco.gov.uk.
The Embassy cannot provide further information or advice about departure options over the phone. This page will be updated if departure options become available. To get the latest information, sign up for travel advice email alerts.
You will need to pay for your return travel to the UK. If departure options are available but you cannot afford the travel costs and have exhausted all other options for getting funds, you may be eligible to apply for an emergency loan from the government. This is a last resort option and you would need to repay the loan when you are back in the UK.
