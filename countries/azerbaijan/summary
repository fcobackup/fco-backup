The Foreign and Commonwealth Office (FCO) advise against all travel to:
Nagorno-Karabakh and the military occupied area surrounding it

Tensions between Azerbaijan and Armenia over Nagorno-Karabakh continue. Several ceasefire violations along the Line of Contact separating the opposing forces and elsewhere on the inter-state border between Azerbaijan and Armenia have taken place in 2017, resulting in a number of deaths and casualties.

Anyone who has visited Nagorno-Karabakh without the permission of the Azerbaijani authorities will be refused entry to Azerbaijan.
Presidential elections will take place on 11 April 2018. The campaign period begins on 12 March. The political situation in Azerbaijan is generally calm, but demonstrations and opposition rallies do take place from time to time. You should stay away from large gatherings and remain vigilant.
