Terrorism
There is a high threat of terrorist attack globally affecting UK interests and British nationals, including from groups and individuals who view the UK and British nationals as targets. Stay aware of your surroundings at all times.
UK Counter Terrorism Policing has information and advice on staying safe abroad and what to do in the event of a terrorist attack. Find out how to reduce your risk from terrorism while abroad.
Terrorism in Tajikistan
Terrorists are likely to try and carry out attacks in Tajikistan.
Attacks could be indiscriminate and occur at any time, including in places frequented by foreign nationals, such as:  
transport hubs 
embassies 
religious sites and places of worship  
sporting and cultural events  
shopping centres and crowded places
Examples of previous significant attacks include:
In 2019, it was reported that 17 people were killed in an armed attack on a Tajik security checkpoint on the Tajikistan-Uzbekistan border. Islamic State Khorasan Province (ISKP) claimed responsibility
There are infrequent incursions by armed criminal and terrorist groups across the Afghanistan Border into Tajikistan, mainly at night. In August 2023, 3 terrorists were reportedly killed by Tajik border forces
Political situation
Avoid any demonstrations or large gatherings of people and remain vigilant in public places. Be alert to any security announcements by the Tajik authorities.     
Crime
Protecting your belongings
Dushanbe is relatively safe, but there have been occasional muggings and petty crime against foreigners. Take the same precautions you would in the UK.
Rape and sexual assault
There have been cases of sexual assault, including rape, reported to the British Embassy. This includes suspected use of ‘date rape’ drugs targeting foreigners. Alcohol and drugs can lead to you being less alert, less in control and less aware of your environment. You should:
not leave drinks unattended
not accept drinks from strangers
be aware of how much you are drinking
not accept lifts from strangers or acquaintances at any time
Intimidation at Dushanbe International Airport
There have been cases of harassment by officials at Dushanbe International Airport. This includes requests for payment for allegedly incorrect documentation or other offences. Check with your hotel that your documentation and papers are in order before passing through border control at the airport. If you’re harassed or intimidated, report it to your travel agent or the consular bureau at the airport.
Laws and cultural differences
Tajikistan has a secular constitution. (A secular state claims to treat all its citizens equally regardless of religion.) Most Tajik citizens are Muslims. Some, particularly in rural areas, may be conservative in outlook. Be aware of local traditions, customs, laws and religions at all times.
Personal ID
Always carry a copy of your passport’s photo page, as officials often ask for ID. You can present a copy rather than an original passport if a police officer asks you on the street.
Smoking ban
Although rarely enforced, smoking while walking on the street is illegal and punishable by a fine.
Illegal drugs and prison sentences
Possession and use of drugs is illegal. If found guilty, you could get a lengthy prison sentence in very basic conditions.
Woman travelling alone
Women travelling alone in Tajikistan may receive unwanted attention, harassment or difficulties based on gender. Consider not going out alone at night. See advice for women travelling abroad.
Using cameras in secure areas
Taking photos of anything related to the military or security may get you into trouble with the authorities.
LGBT+ travellers
Same-sex sexual activity is not illegal under Tajik law. However, local attitudes are conservative and the levels of tolerance and acceptance in society may vary, particularly outside the main cities. Take care about showing affection in public. Read more advice for LGBT+ travellers.
Money
Tajikistan is mainly a cash-only economy. Very few businesses accept credit cards and none accept travellers cheques.
Only change money at officially authorised currency exchanges. US dollars are the most widely accepted foreign currency. Euros or Russian roubles are also easy to exchange. It may be difficult to exchange other currencies.
There is an increasing number of ATMs in Dushanbe and other larger towns, but none in rural areas. Most ATMs only accept Visa cards.
Transport risks
Road travel
If you are planning to drive in Tajikistan, see information on driving abroad.
You’ll need to have both the 1968 version of the international driving permit (IDP) and your UK driving licence with you in the car. You cannot buy an IDP outside the UK, so get one before you travel. You can buy an IDP in person from some UK post offices – find your nearest post office branch that offers this service.
Driving standards
Vehicles in Tajikistan are often poorly maintained and driving standards are basic. Petrol stations are rare outside towns and there are no breakdown companies. Make sure you take all you need for your journey and allow for delays. Consider bringing a satellite phone for travel outside towns to use in an emergency. Neighbouring countries may close borders temporarily.
Roads outside the main towns are poorly maintained and often only accessible by 4-wheel-drive vehicles. Conditions are particularly dangerous in spring due to the risk of avalanches and landslides.
Many interior roads are only open in the summer months. It is possible to drive from Dushanbe to the north and Tajikistan’s second city, Khujand, using a tunnel. This road is particularly dangerous in winter due to icy conditions. Drivers can be trapped for a long time if caught in an avalanche due to the remote location.
Flooding in the spring and winter often damages and closes roads in areas of the Gorno-Badakhshan Autonomous Region and other parts of the country. Many roads, including the Pamir Highway, are open but not fully repaired.
Air travel
In 2022, the UK sanctioned Aeroflot, Rossiya Airlines and Ural Airlines. It is now illegal under UK law for any British national or British company to do business with these airlines. This includes the purchasing of flight tickets.
Extreme weather and natural disasters
Earthquakes
Earthquakes are a risk in Tajikistan. Most are small and affect remote areas of the country, particularly the east in the Gorno-Badakhshan Autonomous Region. Avalanches and landslides often block roads in the spring and early summer. Learn earthquake safety procedures and follow the advice of the local authorities. The US Federal Emergency Management Agency website has advice about what to do before, during and after an earthquake.
Flooding
In late spring and summer, there can be seasonal flooding and mudslides caused by melting glaciers. Take care, follow local advice and be aware that conditions can change suddenly.
Snow
Heavy snowfall in winter can cause delays and cancellations at airports and disrupt travel, particularly in mountainous regions where there’s an increased risk of avalanches. Take local advice on road conditions during or following severe weather.
