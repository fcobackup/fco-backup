Cases of coronavirus (COVID-19) have been confirmed in Ghana. The Ghanaian authorities have introduced a number of measures to limit the spread of the virus.
Local measures
The Government of Ghana has set out guidance to curb the spread of coronavirus. Schools, universities and social venues (for example, restaurants) are closed and large public gatherings of over 25 people (e.g. concerts, religious ceremonies, sporting events) are prohibited. People are strongly advised to wash their hands, use hand sanitiser and avoid shaking-hands with one another. People are advised to adhere to strict social distancing.
On 20 April, the Government of Ghana lifted the movement restrictions in Greater Accra and Greater Kumasi. It is now mandatory for the general public to wear face masks in the Greater Accra Region. Notices of “no mask, no entry” will be displayed at vantage points including offices, shops, markets, malls, banks and pharmacies.
Entry and borders
Given the rise of the number of cases of coronavirus in Ghana, on 21 March the Government of Ghana announced the closure of the country’s borders until further notice. International flights into Ghana and all international flights out of Ghana are suspended. This means British Nationals cannot enter Ghana at the current time.
Domestic flights are permitted to fly - contact your local airline for details. International flights remain suspended. See the Ministry of Information website for full details on the restriction of movement, including a list of affected areas.
