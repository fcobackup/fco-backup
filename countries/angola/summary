For security reasons, the FCDO advises against all but essential travel to:
the province of Cabinda (but not including Cabinda city)
within 1km of the border with the Democratic Republic of Congo in Lunda Norte province, except at official border crossings and their access roads.
Before you travel, check the ‘Entry requirements’ section for Angola’s current entry restrictions and requirements. Due to COVID-19, these may change with little warning. Monitor this advice for the latest updates and stay in contact with your travel provider.
If you plan to pass through another country on your journey, check the travel advice for the country you’re transiting.
It is more important than ever to get travel insurance and check it provides appropriate cover. See the FCDO’s guidance on foreign travel insurance.
There is a high level of crime in Luanda. Be particularly careful when withdrawing money from banks and ATMs. Don’t walk around the city after dark. See Crime
