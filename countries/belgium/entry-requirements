The information on this page covers the most common types of travel and reflects the UK government’s understanding of the rules currently in place. Unless otherwise stated, this information is for travellers using a full ‘British Citizen’ passport.
The authorities in the country or territory you’re travelling to are responsible for setting and enforcing the rules for entry. If you’re unclear about any aspect of the entry requirements, or you need further reassurance, you’ll need to contact the embassy, high commission or consulate of the country or territory you’re travelling to.
You should also consider checking with your transport provider or travel company to make sure your passport and other travel documents meet their requirements.
Entry rules in response to coronavirus (COVID-19)
Entry to Belgium from the UK
The Belgian Government has extended the suspension of passenger travel from the UK for a further 24 hours until 23:59 on 22 December. This follows the announcement on 20 December that from 00:01 on 21 December, borders between the UK and Belgium will be closed for at least 24 hours. This is a precautionary measure to prevent spread of a more contagious variant of the coronavirus. If you are due to travel during this period, you should not travel to the airport/station and should contact your operator.
From 23 December, only those travelling from the UK who have permanent residency in Belgium (or are Belgian nationals) will be able to enter. You should ensure you carry a Belgian ID card or other documentation to prove your Belgian residency.
Those arriving from the UK without permanent Belgian residency will not be able to enter Belgium until midnight on 31 December. From 1 January, non-residents will be able to enter if they provide evidence of a negative COVID-19 test upon check-in at the airport or Eurostar terminal. This test should be taken no more than 48 hours prior to arrival in Belgium.
All travellers from the UK must complete the Belgian Passenger Locator Form before travel. You will be required to self-isolate for at least seven days on arrival, after which you should take a Covid-19 test. You should follow closely the instructions you receive via SMS after submitting your Passenger Locator Form.
Entry to Belgium from countries other than the UK
The Belgian Government has introduced a traffic light system of high, medium and low risk regions. You should check the map on the Belgian Ministry of Foreign Affairs website (in English) for the latest information on affected regions. Check the map frequently, including both before and during your travel, as the zones are updated regularly.
From 25 December 2020, those who are not resident in Belgium will need to provide evidence of a negative Covid-19 test in order to enter Belgium. This test should be taken no more than 48 hours prior to arrival in Belgium.
If you are travelling to Belgium from a high-risk (red) zone you will be required to self-isolate for at least seven days on arrival, after which you should then take a Covid-19 test. If your test is negative you will be able to leave self-isolation. You should follow closely the instructions you receive via SMS after submitting your Passenger Locator Form. Further information can be found on the Belgian Ministry of Foreign Affairs website and the Passenger Locator Form FAQs.
Regular entry requirements
Visas
If you hold a British Citizen passport, you don’t need a visa to enter Belgium. If you’re planning a stay of longer than 3 months, see our Living in Belgium guide and contact the Belgian Embassy if you have further questions.
The rules on travel will stay the same until 31 December 2020.
Visas from 1 January 2021
The rules for travelling or working in Europe will change from 1 January 2021:
you will be able to travel to countries in the Schengen area for up to 90 days in any 180-day period without a visa as a tourist, to visit family or friends, to attend business meetings, cultural or sports events, or for short-term studies or training
if you are travelling to Belgium and other Schengen countries without a visa, make sure your whole visit is within the limit. Visits to Schengen countries within the previous 180 days before you travel would count towards the 90-day limit
To stay for longer, to work or study, for business or for other reasons, you will need to meet the entry requirements set out by Belgium. This could mean applying for a visa and/or work permit. You should check with the Belgian Embassy what type of visa and/or work permit, if any, you will need.
if you are in Belgium with a visa or permit, your stay will not count towards the 90-day limit.
The 90-day limit for visa-free travel will begin on 1 January 2021. Any days you stay in Belgium or other Schengen countries before 1 January 2021 will not count towards the 90-day limit.
At border control for Belgium, you may need to:
show a return or onward ticket
show you have enough money for your stay, and
use separate lanes from EU, EEA and Swiss citizens when queueing
Your passport may be stamped on entry and exit.
Passport validity
The rules on travel will stay the same until 31 December 2020.
Your passport should be valid for the proposed duration of your stay; you do not need any additional period of validity on your passport beyond this.
Passport validity from 1 January 2021
From 1 January 2021, you must have at least 6 months left on an adult or child passport to travel to most countries in Europe (not including Ireland).
If you renewed your current passport before the previous one expired, extra months may have been added to its expiry date. Any extra months on your passport over 10 years may not count towards the 6 months needed.
Check your passport is valid for travel before you book your trip. You will need to renew your passport before travelling if you do not have enough time left on your passport.
UK Emergency Travel Documents
UK Emergency Travel Documents (ETDs) are accepted for entry, airside transit and exit from Belgium.
