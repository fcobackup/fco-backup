If you test positive for COVID-19 you will need to self-quarantine either at home if you are resident in Malawi, or a Government Treatment Centre if you are a visitor. You will be responsible for paying any costs. If self-isolating at home, government officials will regularly check that you are not breaking the terms of self-isolation.
