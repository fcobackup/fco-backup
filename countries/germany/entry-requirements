This page has information on travelling to Germany. Check what you must do to return to the UK.
This page reflects the UK government’s understanding of current rules for people travelling on a full ‘British Citizen’ passport from the UK, for the most common types of travel.
The authorities in Germany set and enforce entry rules.
All travellers
Germany uses a two-tier system of risk categories (virus variant areas and high risk areas), with distinct rules on entry and quarantine for each tier. See the complete list of designated areas.
From 23:00 GMT on 3 January 2022 the UK is designated a high risk area. You may enter Germany from the UK for any travel purpose if you are fully vaccinated.
All travellers entering Germany from the UK are required to complete pre-departure digital registration, regardless of vaccination status.
Testing Requirements
All permitted travellers aged six or over from the UK arriving in Germany need either a negative PCR test result that is no more than 48 hours old at the point of departure, if travelling to Germany via plane, train, bus or ferry. If you are travelling independently, such as in a car, the PCR test can only be 48 hours old at entry into Germany. The result of the test required by the authorities can be either in paper or electronic form in German, English, French, Italian, or Spanish.
Border officials and local public health authorities will not accept a negative test result if there is justified doubt about whether the test meets the minimum performance requirements.
The Federal Health Ministry also provides information under the heading “What tests are recognised?” on this page.
Quarantine after travel from high risk area
From 23:00 on 3 January 2022, the UK is designated as a high risk area by Germany. This means that travellers arriving from the UK, who are not fully vaccinated, are subject to 10-day quarantine, and test and release is available after 5 days. Fully vaccinated and recovered individuals are exempt from this requirement, once they have uploaded their proof of status on the pre-departure digital registration portal .
If, in the 10 days before you travel to Germany, you have been in an area designated at the time of entry as presenting an increased risk of infection, you must register online in advance of travelling to Germany. On arrival, you must travel to your accommodation and quarantine there for up to 14 days. If you are travelling from a high risk area, you can be released from quarantine immediately if you provide one of the following with the pre-departure digital registration:
A negative C-19 test (only available after 5 days for travel from high risk areas such as the UK)
Proof that you are fully vaccinated (this means that you have taken the last of the recommended doses of a C-19 vaccine authorised in the EU more than 14 days ago)
Proof that you have recently recovered from a C-19 infection. Proof of recovery is a positive PCR test no older than six months, but older than 28 days
If you are travelling from a virus variant area, you must quarantine for the full 14 days, and do not have access to early test to release.
For travel from designated high risk areas there are some exemptions from the quarantine requirement, including for cross-border workers and individuals deemed to be providing essential activities. For precise details please consult the Federal Health Ministry website under the rubric, “What are the exemptions from the obligation to quarantine on entry?”
If you have specific questions about the quarantine requirements which apply in your particular case, you should contact the local public health authority in your place of residence. Please also contact your local public health authority for further details on test and release. You can identify the relevant authority here.
Children and young people
Children five years of age and under are allowed to enter Germany from the UK without a negative test as long as they as they travel with at least one fully vaccinated parent. These children are not obliged to provide any kind of evidence (no COVID test, etc.), but have to quarantine on arrival unless they are entering Germany to visit first-degree relatives and have spent less than 72 hours in a high risk area like the UK or will spend less than 72 hours in Germany. For all other children under six, quarantine ends automatically 5 days after entry.
If you’re transiting through Germany
For further information about transiting Germany, please consult the Federal Interior Ministry website, under the heading “When is transit through Germany permitted?” The Federal Health Ministry has a definition of transit under the question “What are the exemptions from the obligation to register?” on this page.
Exemptions
Information about possible exceptions for non-residents is on the Federal Interior Ministry website, under “What constitutes an urgent need for travel”. The decision on whether to allow entry in such circumstances is at the discretion of border guards.
HGV Drivers and Transport Personnel
HGV drivers and other transport personnel, such as persons who enter the country on business for the purpose of international transportation of people, goods or merchandise by land, sea or air are generally exempt from the requirement to possess a negative COVID-19 test, proof of vaccination or proof of recovery. They are also exempt from a requirement to quarantine when entering Germany, provided they were not in the previous 10 days in an area designated at the time of entry into Germany as a virus variant area.
Passport validity
If you are planning to travel to an EU country (except Ireland), or Switzerland, Norway, Iceland, Liechtenstein, Andorra, Monaco, San Marino or Vatican City, you must meet the Schengen area rules.
Your passport must meet 2 requirements. It must be:
less than 10 years old on the day you enter (check the ‘date of issue’)
valid for at least 3 months after the day you plan to leave (check the ‘expiry date’)
We are asking the European Commission to clarify the 10-year rule. Their guidance for Schengen border guards may not be updated until the spring of 2022. Until then, for some Schengen countries your passport may need to be less than 10 years old during your whole visit, and the 3 months at the end of your visit may need to be within 10 years of your passport’s issue date.
Check both the issue date and the expiry date in your passport. If you renewed your passport early, extra months may have been added to its expiry date. This could affect the requirement for your passport to be less than 10 years old.
Contact your travel provider or embassy of the country you are visiting if you think that your passport does not meet both these requirements. Renew your passport if you need to.
Visas
The rules for travelling or working in European countries changed on 1 January 2021:
you can travel to countries in the Schengen area for up to 90 days in any 180-day period without a visa. This applies if you travel as a tourist, to visit family or friends, to attend business meetings, cultural or sports events, or for short-term studies or training
if you are travelling to Germany and other Schengen countries without a visa, make sure your whole visit is within the 90-day limit. Visits to Schengen countries within the previous 180 days before you travel count towards your 90 days
to stay longer, to work or study, for business or for other reasons, you will need to meet the German government’s entry requirements. Check with the German Embassy what type of visa and/or work permit, if any, you will need
if you stay in Germany with a residence permit or long-stay visa, this does not count towards your 90-day visa-free limit
Any time you spent in Germany or other Schengen countries before 1 January 2021 does not count towards your 90-day visa-free limit.
Check your passport is stamped if you enter or exit the Schengen area through Germany as a visitor. Border guards will use passport stamps to check you’re complying with the 90-day visa-free limit for short stays in the Schengen area. If relevant entry or exit stamps are not in your passport, border guards will presume that you have overstayed your visa-free limit.
You can show evidence of when and where you entered or exited the Schengen area, and ask the border guards to add this date and location in your passport. Examples of acceptable evidence include boarding passes and tickets.
You may also need to:
show a return or onward ticket
show you have enough money for your stay
If you are resident in Germany your passport should not be stamped. You should proactively show your proof of residence as well as your valid passport at German control. For further information, see our Living in Germany guide.
Proof of residence
UK nationals resident in Germany must demonstrate proof of residence. If you are not yet in possession of a residence card, you will be required to provide credible evidence that you are resident in Germany.
This could include an address registration certificate (Meldebescheinigung), a tenancy agreement, a utility bill in your name, or a certificate of application (Fiktionsbescheinigung).
The German authorities have confirmed that individuals who are registered at a German address in the population register (Melderegister), who can present identification (including residence documents) displaying a German address, or documents (paper or electronic) issued in their name by third parties stating an address in Germany, may be presumed to be resident in Germany. A document which has been left in Germany but which can be accessed by someone else may be photographed or scanned and sent to the traveller abroad by email or via cloud for presentation at the border. See the guidance from the German Federal Ministry of the Interior, Building and Community.
If you are resident in Germany, please carry proof of your residence when travelling. If you were living in Germany before 1 January 2021, you should carry your residence document (Aufenthaltsdokument-GB), as well as your valid passport when you travel. If you have applied but not yet received your document, carry your certificate of application (Fiktionsbescheinigung).
If you cannot show that you are resident in Germany, you may be asked additional questions at the border to enter the Schengen area, and your passport may be stamped. This will not affect your rights in Germany.
UK Emergency Travel Documents
UK Emergency Travel Documents (ETDs) are accepted for entry, airside transit and exit from Germany.
Working in Germany
If you intend to work in Germany, you should get detailed information on employment regulations from the German Embassy.
