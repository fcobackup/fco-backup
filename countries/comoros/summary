Foreign, Commonwealth and Development Office (FCDO) advises against all but essential travel to the whole of Comoros.
Clashes between protestors and security forces are ongoing in Moroni following presidential elections on 14 January 2024. Travel in Moroni and between the international airport and the city may be difficult. An overnight curfew has been declared across the country and flights between the three islands have been temporarily suspended. If in Comoros, you are advised to avoid crowds and demonstrations. See Political situation
Before you travel, check the ‘Entry requirements’ section for Comoros’ current entry restrictions and requirements. These may change with little warning. Monitor this advice for the latest updates and stay in contact with your travel provider.
If you plan to pass through another country to return to the UK, check the travel advice for the country you’re transiting.
It is more important than ever to get travel insurance and check it provides sufficient cover. See the FCDO’s guidance on foreign travel insurance.
You will need a visa to enter Comoros. Visas are available on arrival at the airport or other points of entry. See Visas.
