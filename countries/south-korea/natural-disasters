Typhoons
The Korean Metereological Administration issued a forecast on Monday 20 August that Typhoon Soulik will pass over the Korean peninsula later this week and that serious damage from heavy rain or strong winds could be triggered by the typhoon. The weather agency advises that on its current pathway, the typhoon will make landfall south of Seogimpo on Jeju Island on Wednesday and is expected to reach north-northeast Mokpo, in South Jeolla Province before moving south eastwards.
The typhoon season normally runs from June to November. You should monitor the progress of approaching storms on the Korean Meteorological Administration website and follow any advice given by the local authorities.
