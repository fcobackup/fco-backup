The Foreign, Commonwealth & Development Office (FCDO) advises against all travel to Yemen. This includes the mainland and all islands. If you’re in Yemen, you should leave immediately. If you choose to remain in Yemen, you should minimise movement around the country and within cities and towns, monitor developments in the local security situation and follow other precautions in this travel advice.
Before you travel, check the ‘Entry requirements’ section for Yemen’s current entry restrictions and requirements. These may change with little warning. Monitor this advice for the latest updates and stay in contact with your travel provider.
If you plan to pass through another country to return to the UK, check the travel advice for the country you’re transiting.
It is more important than ever to get travel insurance and check it provides sufficient cover. See the FCDO’s guidance on foreign travel insurance.
Consular support is not available from the British government within Yemen, as all services of the British Embassy in Sana’a are suspended and all diplomatic and consular staff have been withdrawn. If you need to speak to a consular officer in the UK, call the FCDO in London on +44 (0)20 7008 5000.
The FCDO can’t offer advice on the safety of travelling to any potential departure point. You should therefore consider carefully whether you want to pursue any options that become available. You should use your own judgement to move towards a departure point only if and when you judge it is safe to do so. The British government’s ability to facilitate onward travel from countries in the region is limited and you’ll be expected to cover the cost of visas, accommodation, insurance and onward travel yourself. Any travel options you pursue are taken at your own risk.
Following the attack on the coalition base at Taji in Iraq on 11 March 2020, and subsequent US airstrikes, tensions may be raised across the region. There is a possibility of an increased threat against Western interests, including against UK citizens. You should remain vigilant and keep up to date with the latest developments, including via the media and this travel advice.
The security situation in Yemen remains unstable. Fighting continues across the country, which has exacerbated the humanitarian crisis and damaged key infrastructure. Access to food, clean water, fuel and medical supplies is difficult throughout Yemen. There is a high risk of being caught in indiscriminate gunfire or shelling. See Safety and security
Terrorists are very likely to try to carry out attacks in Yemen. There is a very high threat of kidnap and unlawful detention from militia groups, armed tribes, criminals and terrorists such as Al-Qaida in the Arabian Peninsula (AQAP) and Daesh’s official branch in Yemen, IS-Y. See Terrorism
Tropical cyclones sometimes affect parts of the country. You should monitor local and international weather updates. See our tropical cyclones page for advice about how to prepare effectively and what to do if you’re likely to be affected by a tropical cyclone.
