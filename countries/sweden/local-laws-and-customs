The purchase of sex has been a criminal offence in Sweden since 1999.
All forms of physical punishment of children have been outlawed since 1979 in Sweden. Sweden was the first country in the world to introduce legislation of this kind.

Taking food and drink into the EU
You cannot take meat, milk or products containing them into EU countries. There are some exceptions for medical reasons, for example certain amounts of powdered infant milk, infant food, or pet food required for medical reasons. Check the rules about taking food and drink into the EU on the European Commission website.
