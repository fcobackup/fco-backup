The Foreign, Commonwealth & Development Office (FCDO) advises against all travel to:

The rayons of Zengilan, Jabrayil, Qubadli, Lachin and Kelbajar. Western areas of Khojavand, Fuzuli and Aghdam rayons

A ceasefire agreement was signed between Armenia and Azerbaijan in November 2020 to end the military action in the Nagorno-Karabakh conflict zone. Some territory under Azerbaijani control post-conflict is currently closed to the general public and may contain high amounts of unexploded ordnance (UXO) and landmines. As part of the ceasefire agreement a Russian peacekeeping operation has been deployed to the area to monitor Armenian populated areas of Nagorno-Karabakh and the Lachin Corridor.
Several other civilian areas were affected by the conflict and could also contain UXO. These areas include, but are not limited to, the towns and rayons of Barda, Tartar, Ganja, Beylagan and Aghjabadi. The Azerbaijani authorities are working to remove UXO. However if you come across UXO do not approach it, or touch it. Make a note of where it was spotted, and notify the authorities on 102 or 112. Be aware that there may be more UXO nearby.

Consular support is not available in areas of Nagorno-Karabakh region not under Azerbaijani control. Tensions between Azerbaijan and Armenia over Nagorno-Karabakh remain. There have previously been military actions in Nagorno-Karabakh and the surrounding areas, particularly from September to November 2020, and on the inter-state border between Azerbaijan and Armenia. Civilian areas were hit, resulting in deaths and casualties. Anyone who has previously visited areas of Nagorno-Karabakh without the permission of the Azerbaijani authorities will be refused entry to Azerbaijan. See Local travel
