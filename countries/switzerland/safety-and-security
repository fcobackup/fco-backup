Terrorism
There is a high threat of terrorist attack globally affecting UK interests and British nationals, including from groups and individuals who view the UK and British nationals as targets. You should stay vigilant.
UK Counter Terrorism Policing has information and advice on staying safe abroad and what to do in the event of a terrorist attack. Find out how to reduce your risk from terrorism while abroad
Terrorism in Switzerland
Terrorist attacks in Switzerland cannot be ruled out.
Crime
There is a low rate of serious crime in Switzerland. However, there have been increased reports of theft, especially in larger cities, at Geneva airport and on trains to and from Geneva.
Protecting your belongings
Take sensible precautions to avoid mugging, bag snatching and pickpocketing. Be particularly vigilant at airports, railway stations and crowded public gatherings. Do not leave your valuables unattended.
Laws and cultural differences
Public offences
Covering your face in public places in the Swiss cantons of Ticino and St Gallen is illegal, including for tourists. This includes balaclavas, full veils or any other garment or mask that is used to hide the face. You could be fined 100 to 10,000 Swiss francs if you don’t comply.
Outdoor activities and adventure tourism
Trekking, mountaineering and extreme sports
Hiking, mountaineering and other adventure sports can be risky. Visitors can get into difficulty and need the help of the emergency services when hiking and mountaineering. British visitors have been involved in accidents, been hospitalised or have died.
Check the company you are using is well-established and that you’ve arranged for your travel insurance to cover specific activity.
For sports activities like skiing, potholing and mountaineering, and for sports classed as particularly dangerous (for example off-piste skiing, mountain biking, climbing, paragliding or BASE jumping), your insurance should include:
mountain rescue services
helicopter costs
repatriation to your country of residence or possible transfer to neighbouring countries for treatment
Read FCDO advice about staying safe while skiing and preparing for winter sports abroad.
Extreme weather
Check weather forecasts and conditions and make sure you’re properly equipped for the worst-case scenario. A map, compass, GPS and telecommunication equipment should always be used when travelling outside urban areas. Don’t undertake any activity alone and consider hiring a guide for expert advice. Always leave copies of your itinerary with someone.
These alpine hazards exist throughout the year:
avalanches and snow drifts
landslides and flooding
glacial crevasses and hollows
rockfall
thunderstorms and lightning
altitude sickness
sun exposure
sudden weather changes
Forest fires
There are a number of ongoing forest fires in Switzerland. There is more information on the Federal Government’s Natural Hazards Portal. Check with your travel provider before travelling and follow the advice of local authorities at all times.
Forest fires can lead to rockfall in mountainous areas. Official advice on the safety measures currently in place can be found on the Federal Office for the Environment’s website. You should:
take care when visiting or driving through woodland areas
make sure cigarette ends are properly extinguished
not light barbecues
take care when you are travelling or hiking in a mountainous area
Causing a forest fire when a ban on open fire is in place is illegal, even if unintentional, and can lead to fines of up to 20,000 Swiss francs.
If you see a forest fire, call the fire department on 118.
Forest fires can also cause travel disruption in wider areas.
Avalanches
Avalanches are a risk, particularly during heavy snow. Off-piste skiing is very dangerous due to the risk of avalanches. Follow safety instructions and warnings. Consider carrying search equipment. Avalanche beepers (receivers) are the most common rescue devices and when properly used, are the fastest way of locating an avalanche victim.
Conditions on roads in mountainous areas can quickly become difficult in winter. Carry water, food, warm clothing and medicines in your vehicle.
Check the latest avalanche risk at the Federal Office of Meteorology and Climatology.

Transport risks in Switzerland
Road travel
If you are planning to drive in Switzerland, see information on driving abroad and read the RAC Switzerland guide.
Licences and documents
If you are visiting Switzerland, you can drive on a full, valid UK driving licence, insurance and vehicle documents. If you’re living in Switzerland, check the Living in Switzerland Guide for information on requirements for residents.
Driving a British car abroad
You may need a UK sticker to drive your car outside the UK. UK stickers have replaced GB stickers. Check the government guidance on displaying number plates for more information on what to do if you are driving outside the UK.
Driving regulations
Road users have to comply with Switzerland’s traffic laws, such as speed limits, rules on alcohol intake and child security. Traffic regulations are strictly enforced. Any serious breach of the regulations can result in heavy fines or imprisonment.
Motorways
You must buy and display a vignette (sticker) to travel on Swiss motorways or face large fines. You can buy a vignette at most border crossings, petrol stations, post offices, by phone (+800 1002 0030) or buy a vignette online.
If you’re involved in a car accident, use the orange emergency phones to ask for help.
Road conditions
Roads outside urban areas are narrow and winding. Road conditions can deteriorate fast (even in summer) especially during heavy rainfall and snowfall at higher altitudes. Reduce your speed significantly to suit the conditions.
Alpine winters make driving difficult. Equip your car with winter tyres and snow-chains. Check road conditions before you depart. Carry water, food, warm clothing and medicines in your vehicle.
See the latest information on road conditions on the cantons website.
Accessibility
The official Switzerland Tourism website has useful information for travellers in wheelchairs or with impaired mobility.
