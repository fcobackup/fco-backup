Terrorism
There is a high threat of terrorist attack globally affecting UK interests and British nationals, including from groups and individuals who view the UK and British nationals as targets. You should remain vigilant at all times.
UK Counter Terrorism Policing has information and advice on staying safe abroad and what to do in the event of a terrorist attack. Find out how to reduce your risk from terrorism while abroad.
Terrorism in Kyrgyzstan
Terrorists are likely to try to carry out attacks in Kyrgyzstan. 
Attacks could be indiscriminate, including in places visited by foreigners. There has been some terrorist activity and armed violence, particularly south and west of Osh. A suicide bomb attack against the Chinese Embassy on the outskirts of Bishkek on 30 August 2016 was reportedly carried out by the Turkestan Islamic Party.
You should maintain a high level of vigilance in public spaces and near to public buildings, and pay attention to any security announcements by the Kyrgyz authorities.
Political situation
Demonstrations happen regularly in Bishkek and elsewhere across the country. Most demonstrations are peaceful but occasionally turn violent, sometimes with little or no warning. On 17 and 18 May, 41 people were injured in Bishkek in protests against South Asian workers and students.
You should avoid all crowds and demonstrations, check for updates on local media and follow the advice of local authorities.
Crime
Protecting your belongings
Muggings (sometimes violent) and theft happen regularly. Take care if you go out after dark.
Do not show large amounts of money and be wary of strangers offering help or being over-friendly.
Be careful when using currency exchange offices and visiting the bazaars in Bishkek, particularly Osh Bazaar, where pickpockets target tourists.
Sexual assault
There have been cases of sexual assault and harassment, including on public transport. See advice for women travelling abroad.
Drink and food spiking
Drink spiking can happen in nightclubs and bars. Don’t leave your drink or food unattended. See TravelAware ‘Stick with your mates’ for tips and advice.
Laws and cultural differences
Kyrgyzstan has a secular constitution. (A secular state claims to treat all its citizens equally regardless of religion.) Most Kyrgyz people are Muslims. You should always respect local traditions, customs, laws and religions. Make sure your actions do not offend other cultures or religious beliefs, especially during the holy month of Ramadan or if you intend to visit religious areas.
Be careful how you use social media. Take care of the context in which you use images so that they do not offend. Take particular care with any images and comments that show the Kyrgyz flag and national food to avoid fines and detention.
Personal ID
You must always carry your passport, or a notarised copy of it. The police can arrest you if you do not carry ID. You can get a copy of your passport notarised in the UK and translated into Kyrgyz or Russian, or use a copy notarised in Kyrgyzstan.
Illegal drugs and prison sentences
It is illegal to possess or use drugs. You can get a lengthy prison sentence if convicted. Prison conditions are basic.
The police conduct regular drug raids in bars and night clubs. Police will be masked and armed. Stay calm and follow instructions. If you are not carrying, and have not taken drugs you are normally asked for identification and then allowed to leave.
Using cameras and drones in secure areas
It is illegal to take photos of anything related to the military or security, including border checkpoints, military barracks and police stations. Check carefully that you are not near any military/security facilities.
Check if you can import and use your model of drone with the nearest Embassy of Kyrgyzstan.
LGBT+ travellers
Same-sex relationships are legal but not often discussed or recognised publicly. Showing affection in public could result in a violent attack or unwanted attention. Same sex marriages are not recognised in Kyrgyz law.
Read more advice for LGBT+ travellers.
Power cuts
There are frequent power cuts throughout Kyrgyzstan during the winter, due to high consumption and lack of water for power generation.  
Outdoor activities and adventure tourism
Trekking and mountaineering
Trekking in Kyrgyzstan often involves travelling to very remote areas. There is a high risk of avalanches, landslides and rockfalls. Weather can change very quickly, and heavy snowfall can block roads and trekking routes, particularly in the autumn and winter.
At higher altitudes there is a possibility of snow in the summer months. Sunstroke and serious sunburn can also cause problems, particularly in mountainous areas.
You should:
get adequate insurance, including for any activity at high altitude
use a reputable trekking agency
let someone know when you plan to return
not trek alone
adapt your plans to reflect local conditions and advice
In remote areas, mobile phone coverage is extremely limited, and medical facilities are basic. Some Kyrgyz mobile phones have difficulties connecting to satellite phones. The difficult terrain can make access impossible in some cases.
There is a limited mountain rescue service staffed by volunteers. The rescue equipment they have is limited. Mountain rescue 24-hour emergency number: +996 312 651 404   
Transport risks
Road travel 
If you’re planning to drive a hire car or a UK vehicle, see information on driving abroad. 
You can use a UK photocard driving licence to drive in Kyrgyzstan for up to 30 days. If you still have a paper driving licence, you may need to update it to a photocard licence or get the correct version of the international driving permit (IDP) as well.
You’re legally required to have mandatory third-party motor vehicle insurance. This is in addition to any other motor vehicle insurance. For more information, contact insurance companies in Kyrgyzstan.
Hire car companies often have stricter requirements for their customers, such as a year of driving experience, a higher minimum age and holding an IDP. 
Petrol stations are limited in rural areas and diesel is often unavailable. Make sure you take all you need for your journey.
If the police stop you and issue a fine, they should give you a paper copy with instructions on how to pay. You can pay fines through a payment terminal or in a bank. Do not pay cash directly to the police officers, although some may have a payment terminal you can use. Some fines may be reduced if you pay quickly. Payment terminals are available on streets and other places such as malls, grocery stores, kiosks and restaurants.
Driving safety
Many roads are poorly lit and maintained with road works or damaged roads often not clearly signposted. There is currently no MOT and no legal requirement for vehicles to be insured. Pedestrians often have a low awareness of road safety. Roads outside of Bishkek are often blocked by snow in winter.
Take extra care when driving, particularly over long distances and avoid giving lifts to hitchhikers. Drivers have been robbed by people they picked up.
Wherever possible use main roads when travelling in and around Bishkek. 
Drink-driving is a serious offence in Kyrgyzstan. If you are tested and found to have any alcohol in your system, you may get a 17,500 Kyrgyz som fine and have your licence revoked for 1 year.
Taxis and buses
You should avoid flagging down taxis. Use telephone, text messaging, or taxi services, which are more reputable and have English-speaking dispatchers.
Avoid using local buses and minibuses if possible. They are not always maintained properly and pickpockets operate on them.
Air travel   
In May 2022, the UK sanctioned Aeroflot, Rossiya Airlines and Ural Airlines. It is now illegal under UK law for any British national or British company to do business with these airlines. This includes buying flight tickets.
The UK Air Safety List (ASL) lists all known airlines in Kyrgyzstan that do not meet international safety standards and are banned from operating commercial air services to, from, and within the UK. Check the UK Air Safety List when considering which airlines to fly with. The list is maintained by the Department for Transport, based on advice from the UK Civil Aviation Authority.
Check whether your tour operator has concerns about airlines in Kyrgyzstan.
Extreme weather and natural disasters
Earthquakes
There is a high risk of earthquakes and tremors are frequent. Familiarise yourself with safety procedures and follow advice from local authorities. The US Federal Emergency Management Agency has information about what to do before, during and after an earthquake.
Avalanches and landslides
In the mountains, avalanches and landslides often block roads, particularly in the spring.
