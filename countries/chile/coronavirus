International travel
All non-resident foreign nationals - who have been in the United Kingdom during the last 14 days – are not currently permitted to enter Chile. Direct UK-Chile flights have been suspended until further notice.
From Thursday, 25 March at 0500, all travellers (including Chileans, resident and non-resident foreign nationals) must complete a mandatory 10-day quarantine on arrival in Chile. There is no way to shorten this, even with a negative PCR test result. Additionally, any traveller who tests positive for COVID within the first 14 days from arrival must complete a further period of 11 days in a quarantine hotel.
Furthermore, any traveller at an arrival point in Chile who presents one or two COVID symptoms will have to enter a quarantine hotel until local health authorities give the all clear.
From 7 January 2021, all travellers (including Chileans, resident and non-resident foreign nationals) require a negative PCR test (rapid PCR tests will not be accepted) taken within 72-hours of boarding the flight to enter Chile. The mandatory 10 day quarantine will remain in place.
From 11 March 2021, all passengers arriving from Brazil, or who have visited Brazil during the last 14 days, will be transferred to a ‘transitory’ hotel, and will have to take a PCR test. They must remain there for at least 72 hours, even if the PCR test result is negative. After staying at the ‘transitory’ hotel for 72 hours and having obtained a negative PCR test result, passengers are allowed to leave the hotel to continue to their final destination where they will have to complete a 10-day mandatory quarantine. If the PCR test result is positive, the passenger will have to remain in a quarantine hotel. All costs related to transfer, transitory hotel and PCR test must be paid by the passenger prior to boarding the flight to Chile when filling in the ‘Pasaporte Sanitario’.
You should be aware that Chilean health authorities at Santiago Airport are selecting passengers on arrival for random PCR testing, even when passengers have complied with the requirement to hold a negative PCR test on arrival.
Airlines may require all passengers to have filled-in a “Pasaporte Sanitario” to be allowed to board their flights. This government form requests information on recent countries visited and coronavirus-related health. Once submitted, you will receive a PDF of the completed form that you can store on your phone or print.
If you plan to return to the UK make sure you have not overstayed on your Chilean visa – this could affect your departure. If you have any concerns about visa renewal, visit the Chilean Immigration Office website for further information.

Travel in Chile
Travellers arriving in Santiago should be aware that local authorities are frequently moving municipalities (comunas) back and forward through the quarantine Stages Plan (Paso a Paso). You should check on the Chilean Government Paso a Paso website.
If you are travelling from or to the airport to catch a flight from or to one of the areas under quarantine or curfew, presenting your passport and boarding pass will permit you to cross any checkpoints. Use a recognised taxi service or airport transfer whose driver should have the requisite permissions. The government has introduced a special holiday permit (Permiso de vacaciones) (until 31 March 2021) for residents in comunas in ‘Transition’ or Stage 2. This does not apply to tourists or non-resident foreign nationals, only to Chileans and foreign residents. For more information, please see the official Chilean advice.
Chilean authorities require the use of face masks in all public spaces / public transport, including the airport. You risk a significant fine for not wearing a mask in public.
Quarantine orders and sanitary cordons are in place in Santiago and in other parts of the country. There is currently a nationwide curfew (between 10pm and 5am, seven days a week). If you have a medical emergency or funeral during curfew times, you must issue a permit (Salvoconducto) online.
Be aware that if you wish to travel to Magallanes Region, you will need to provide proof of a negative PCR-test result given within 72 hours prior to travel.
Chile is deploying a flexible approach to bringing municipal areas (called comunas) in and out of quarantine/sanitary cordons. New measures can be announced by the government at any time and come into force shortly after.
On 28 July, local areas (“comunas”) in Chile that were under lockdown, as part of the Chilean government’s 5stage plan, began to move from quarantine (Stage 1) into less restrictive stages. The rules on mobility in each stage are as follows:
Stage 1: Quarantine. Restricted mobility; permits required for essential activity only from Monday to Friday; Evening curfew between 2200-0500, social distancing and cordon sanitaire in place; obligatory quarantine for those over 75, except on Mondays, Thursdays and Saturdays between 0900-1100 for 60 minutes or between 1600-1800; prohibition of movement to secondary home. Outdoor exercise activities are allowed from Monday to Friday between 0700-0830. On weekends and bank holidays between 0600-0900
Stage 2: Transition. Quarantine remains in place at weekends and bank holidays social gatherings of no more than 5 people allowed inside; Evening curfew between 2200-0500, social distancing and cordon sanitaire in place and a prohibition on movement to other regions.. You are allowed to travel to other regions or ‘comunas’ only with a special holiday permit until 31 March 2021. Outdoor exercise activities are allowed from Monday to Friday. On weekends and bank holidays between 0600-0900.
Stage 3: Preparation. Under this stage there are no mobility restrictions within the comuna; social gatherings capped at 15 people; Evening curfew between 2200-0500, social distancing and cordon sanitaire in place; and interregional travel is only allowed to regions in Stage 3, 4 and 5. You require a special holiday permit if you are travelling to a secondary home located in a region in Stage 2. In/Outdoor activities are allowed.
Stage 4: Initial opening. Significant step that aims to re-open certain low risk activities and to avoid crowds and physical contact. Establishment of a new way of living: COVID MODE. Social gatherings with no more than 30 people permitted; cinemas, theatres, restaurants and cafes allowed to function at 25% capacity; restaurants and cafés allowed to open to the public at 25% capacity; Evening curfew between 2200-0500, social distancing still required; pubs and clubs remain closed; over 75’s allowed to leave their homes for 60 minutes per day;. Interregional travel is only allowed to regions in Stage 3, 4 and 5. You require a special holiday permit if you are travelling to a secondary home located on a region in Stage 2.
Stage 5: Advanced opening. This step relies on the population becoming accustomed to activities in COVID MODE. Social gatherings with no more than 150 people permitted; cinemas, theatres, restaurants and cafes allowed to function at 75% capacity; gyms, pubs and clubs can function at 50% capacity; gradual return to physical classes in education establishments. Social distancing of 1 metre; free movement for those over 75 and movement to secondary homes allowed.
The Government’s ‘Paso a Paso’ website outlines which phase-out stage each comuna of Chile is under the heading (‘Situación Comunal’).
In areas in quarantine you are only allowed to leave your residence under certain circumstances, including for medical reasons, basic services, and public services. If you need to leave your residence for food supplies or medical reasons, you must get a permit from the Comisaria Virtual. Foreigners may use their passport number to access the system. The pages are only in Spanish.
The government has introduced a special holiday permit (until 31 March 2021) for residents in comunas in ‘Transition’ or Stage 2. This does not apply to tourists or non-resident foreign nationals, only to Chileans and foreign residents. For more information, please see the official Chilean advice
Individuals that wish to pass the sanitary cordons must obtain a “Salvoconducto” permit and a “Health Passport” (“pasaporte sanitario”) (under “viajeros regionales” for residents or “viajeros regionales” for foreign visitors), at least 24 hours before.
Information on the areas of Chile that have sanitary cordons is available on the Government’s ‘Plan de Acción’.
Checkpoints for health inspections are in force at various points around Santiago and elsewhere. In addition to checking the health of persons passing through, these checkpoints will be used to confirm that specific individuals who have been ordered to quarantine by medical authorities are not violating their quarantine. You will need to get a “Health Passport” prior to travel and present it at any checkpoint.
Public places and services
Chilean authorities require the use of face masks in all public spaces, irrespective of what stage of the quarantine phase-out a comuna is in.
