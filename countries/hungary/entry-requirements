This page has information on travelling to Hungary. Check what you must do to return to the UK.
This page reflects the UK government’s understanding of current rules for people travelling on a full ‘British Citizen’ passport from the UK, for the most common types of travel.
The authorities in Hungary set and enforce entry rules.
All travellers
Due to the coronavirus pandemic there are some restrictions on entering Hungary.
However, you can enter Hungary by road, rail and waterway from all the countries neighbouring Hungary (Croatia, Austria, Romania, Serbia, Slovakia, Slovenia and Ukraine) without any epidemiological restrictions, regardless of your nationality and coronavirus immunity.
During the COVID-19 pandemic, it is more important than ever to get travel insurance and check it provides sufficient cover. See the FCDO’s guidance on foreign travel insurance.
If you’re fully vaccinated
If you’re fully vaccinated, you can enter Hungary without needing to test or quarantine.
At least 14 days must have passed since your final dose of the vaccine (second dose if a two-dose vaccine, or one dose of a single-dose vaccine).
You qualify as fully vaccinated if you have received all required doses of one of the following vaccines: Pfizer-Biontech, Moderna, AstraZeneca, Sputnik, Sinopharm or Janssen.
Proof of vaccination status
Hungary will accept the UK’s proof of COVID-19 recovery and vaccination record and proof of COVID-19 vaccination issued in the Crown Dependencies. Your final vaccine dose must have been administered at least 14 prior to travel. Your NHS appointment card from vaccination centres is not designed to be used as proof of vaccination and should not be used to demonstrate your vaccine status.
The EU Covid certificate is also accepted for entry.
Residents of Hungary
If you are a resident you can enter Hungary if you possess a Hungary issued Immunity Certificate or an EU certificate.
If you’re not fully vaccinated
If you are not fully vaccinated, a negative PCR test conducted in the previous 72 hours of arrival is required for entry into Hungary. For the negative PCR test to be accepted, the document proving the PCR test result should be either in Hungarian or English and should contain the following data:
date;
type;
result of test; and
evidence of where the test was performed.
If you’ve had COVID-19 in the past year
If you’re not fully vaccinated but have tested positive for COVID-19 more than 15 days and less than 180 days ago you can enter Hungary. You’ll need to show evidence of a positive PCR test or a positive rapid antigen test acceptable for certification under Article 7 of the EU Regulation. You will not need to take an additional COVID-19 test.
Children and young people
Children aged 17 and under can enter Hungary without certification and are exempt from any COVID-19-related measure if travelling under the supervision of an adult carrying the UK’s proof of COVID-19 vaccination.
If you’re transiting through Hungary
Transiting is when you pass through one country on the way to your final destination.
If you are transiting through Hungary through travel corridors you can enter without any epidemiological restrictions.
You must provide proof that you are entering Hungary for the purposes of travelling directly to another destination outside Hungary; you must also explain the reason you are travelling and demonstrate that you are able to transit to your final destination, providing, for example, a hotel reservation or proof of address in another country, a travel ticket, or similar evidence.
Exemptions
Exemptions to the rules may apply for UK Nationals who are unvaccinated and who are:
arriving for the purpose of business or trade activity
transiting through Hungary through travel corridors – see above
operating cargo transport
travelling as part of a military convoy
travelling on diplomatic or official passports
If you are unvaccinated, but one of the above applies to you, you will need proof of an essential business requirement for entering Hungary, e.g. an official letter from your company that includes contact details for verification purposes, or an invitation to a business event. You can provide this on paper or electronically.
Check your passport and travel documents before you travel
If you are visiting Hungary, your passport should be valid for at least 3 months from the date you arrive.
If you are a resident in Hungary, your passport must be valid for at least 3 months from the date you arrive.
Check with your travel provider to make sure your passport and other travel documents meet their requirements.
Passport validity
If you are planning to travel to an EU country (except Ireland), or Switzerland, Norway, Iceland, Liechtenstein, Andorra, Monaco, San Marino or Vatican City, you must meet the Schengen area rules.
Your passport must meet 2 requirements. It must be:
less than 10 years old on the day you enter (check the ‘date of issue’)
valid for at least 3 months after the day you plan to leave (check the ‘expiry date’)
We are asking the European Commission to clarify the 10-year rule. Their guidance for Schengen border guards may not be updated until the spring of 2022. Until then, for some Schengen countries your passport may need to be less than 10 years old during your whole visit, and the 3 months at the end of your visit may need to be within 10 years of your passport’s issue date.
Check both the issue date and the expiry date in your passport. If you renewed your passport early, extra months may have been added to its expiry date. This could affect the requirement for your passport to be less than 10 years old.
Contact your travel provider or embassy of the country you are visiting if you think that your passport does not meet both these requirements. Renew your passport if you need to.
Visas
You can travel to countries in the Schengen area for up to 90 days in any 180-day period without a visa. This applies if you travel as a tourist, to visit family or friends, to attend business meetings, cultural or sports events, or for short-term studies or training.
If you are travelling to Hungary and other Schengen countries without a visa, make sure your whole visit is within the 90-day limit. Visits to Schengen countries within the previous 180 days before you travel count towards your 90 days.
To stay longer, to work or study, for business travel or for other reasons, you will need to meet the Hungarian government’s entry requirements. Check with the Hungarian Embassy what type of visa and/or work permit you may need.
If you are travelling to Hungary for work, read the guidance on visas and permits.
If you stay in Hungary with a residence permit or long-stay visa, this does not count towards your 90-day visa-free limit.
Passport stamping
Check your passport is stamped if you enter or exit the Schengen area through Hungary as a visitor. Border guards will use passport stamps to check you’re complying with the 90-day visa-free limit for short stays in the Schengen area. If relevant entry or exit stamps are not in your passport, border guards will presume that you have overstayed your visa-free limit.
You can show evidence of when and where you entered or exited the Schengen area, and ask the border guards to add this date and location in your passport. Examples of acceptable evidence include boarding passes and tickets.
You may also need to:
show a return or onward ticket
show you have enough money for your stay
If you are resident in Hungary, read our Living in Hungary guide for passport stamping information.
Fines
Entry into Hungary can be barred if you have failed to pay a previous fine in Hungary. Contact the Hungarian Embassy in London for guidance on paying any outstanding fines before you next enter Hungary.
Customs regulations
Community regulations ensure the free movement of goods between EU member states. This means that no customs procedures are required for exporting goods from Hungary to another EU member state and/or for importing goods from a member state to Hungary. The export and import of goods purchased for non-commercial purposes (for personal use or as gifts) while travelling is not restricted, however, the transport of certain goods (such as: pets, hunting weapons, alcohol and tobacco products, medicines containing drugs, etc.) within the European Union is restricted or subject to special permissions.
Check the customs regulations before entering or leaving Hungary on the National Tax and Customs Administration of Hungary website.
UK Emergency Travel Documents
UK Emergency Travel Documents are accepted for entry, airside transit and exit from Hungary.
