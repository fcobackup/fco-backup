This information is for people travelling on a full ‘British citizen’ passport from the UK. It is based on the UK government’s understanding of the current rules for the most common types of travel.
The authorities in Iceland set and enforce entry rules. If you’re not sure how these requirements apply to you, contact the Icelandic Embassy in the UK.
Passport validity requirements
Iceland follows Schengen area rules. Your passport must: 
have a ‘date of issue’ less than 10 years before the date you arrive – if you renewed your passport before 1 October 2018, it may have a date of issue that is more than 10 years ago
have an ‘expiry date’ at least 3 months after the day you plan to leave the Schengen area (the expiry date does not need to be within 10 years of the date of issue)
Check with your travel provider that your passport and other travel documents meet requirements. Renew your passport if you need to.
You will be denied entry if you do not have a valid travel document or try to use a passport that has been reported lost or stolen.
Visa requirements
You can travel to the Schengen area, which includes Iceland, for up to 90 days in any 180-day period without a visa. This applies if you travel:
as a tourist
to visit family or friends
to attend business meetings, cultural or sports events
for short-term studies or training
The requirements for working in Iceland are different.
If you’re travelling to other Schengen countries as well, make sure your whole visit is within the 90-day visa-free limit. Visits to Schengen countries in the 180 days before you travel count towards your 90 days. If you overstay the 90-day visa-free limit, you may be banned from entering Schengen countries for up to 3 years.
Make sure you get your passport stamped on entry and exit. 
If you’re a visitor, border guards will look at your entry and exit stamps to check you have not overstayed the 90-day visa-free limit for the Schengen area.  
If your passport is missing a stamp, show evidence of when and where you entered or left the Schengen area (for example, boarding passes or tickets) and ask the border guards to add the date and location in your passport.
At Icelandic border control, you may also need to:
show a return or onward ticket
show you have enough money for your stay
Staying longer than 90 days in a 180-day period 
To stay longer, to work or study, or for other reasons, you must meet the Icelandic entry requirements. Check what type of visa or work permit you need with the Icelandic Directorate of Immigration.
If you‘re in Iceland with a residence permit or long-stay visa, this does not count towards your 90-day visa-free limit.

New Schengen entry requirements
From 12 October 2025, the European Union’s (EU) new Entry/Exit System (EES) will begin. When travelling into and out of the Schengen area, for short stays, you may need to:
have you fingerprints and your photo taken
answer the Schengen Border Code questions 
If you enter the Schengen area through the Port of Dover, Eurotunnel at Folkestone or St Pancras International, this information will be taken at the border, before you leave the UK. You may also need to provide either your fingerprint or photo when you leave the Schengen area.
EES may take each passenger a few extra minutes to complete so be prepared to wait longer than usual at the border once the system starts. 
Read more information on the EU Entry/Exit System and to understand which countries are in the Schengen area.

Customs rules
There are strict rules about goods that can be brought into and taken out of Iceland. You must declare anything that may be prohibited or subject to tax or duty.
Whale products
It is illegal to import whale products from Iceland into the UK. You could get a fine of up to £5,000 or a prison sentence.
Taking money into or out of Iceland
You must declare if you’re carrying any currency worth 10,000 euros or more.
Taking food and drink into Iceland    
You cannot take meat, milk or products containing them into Iceland. There are some exceptions such as powdered baby milk, baby food and special foods or pet feed required for medical reasons.
