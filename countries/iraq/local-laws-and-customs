Local laws reflect that Iraq is a predominantly Islamic country. You should respect local traditions, customs, laws and religious customs at all times, especially during the holy month of Ramadan or when visiting places of religious significance.
Although homosexuality is not illegal under Iraqi law, the LGBT community generally keeps a low profile, making it difficult to assess its size or relative freedoms. Local attitudes towards LGBT people may be hostile. There are also reports that LGBT people experienced discrimination, harassment and violence at the hands of state authorities. Youâ€™re advised to exercise discretion. See our information and advice page for the LGBT community before you travel.
Iraq continues to practise the death penalty for a range of crimes. This includes for murder, espionage, rape, kidnapping, terrorism, war crimes, smuggling antiquities and drug trafficking.
On 20 February, 2023, the Iraqi national gazette published the new Municipalities Income law, which includes a provision prohibiting the import, manufacture, and selling of alcoholic beverages of all sorts, punishable by fines of up to IQD 25m. This is being challenged in the Iraqi courts. We are not aware of any instances of Iraqi officials stopping travellers carrying alcohol for personal use.
