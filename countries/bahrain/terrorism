On 10 November 2017, an oil pipeline exploded in the village of Buri, with no reported casualties.
On 27 October 2017, Shia militants detonated an Improved Explosive Device along a major highway targeting a Ministry of Interior police bus killing one officer and injuring eight others.
Terrorists continue to issue statements threatening to carry out attacks in the Gulf region. These include references to attacks on western interests, including residential compounds, military, oil, transport and aviation interests as well as crowded places, including restaurants, hotels, beaches, shopping centres and mosques. You should maintain a high level of security awareness and vigilance, including around significant high profile occasions and events, particularly in such public places and report anything suspicious to the local authorities.
