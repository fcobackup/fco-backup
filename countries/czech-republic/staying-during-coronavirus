Moving around in Czech Republic
For information on entering Czech Republic, see Entry Requirements
There are various measures in place to control the spread of the virus. The details of these measures can be found in the sections below.
From 18 March, anyone leaving their homes must have their mouth and nose covered. This should be done using a face mask if available, although scarves are allowed if a face mask cannot be obtained. Individual outdoor sport activities may be undertaken without a face mask, as well as eating and drinking, but you must keep a distance of two metres from other people.
The insides of restaurants, bars and pubs are closed, but they can sell food and drink to take away or to consume in outdoor areas. From 11 May, shops are permitted to reopen.
Schools and universities are now slowly re-opening. UK nationals in need of specific information on education are advised to contact their local Czech authority.
On 14 April, the Czech Government announced plans for a phased re-opening of businesses and services from 20 April, dependent on infection rates. For further information, follow local media and the British Embassy in Prague’s twitter page.

Finance
There is a range of financial support from the government that you can access while you are unable to return due to coronavirus restrictions.
If you’re in Czech Republic, and have exhausted all other options to cover essential living costs while you wait to return home, you could apply for an emergency loan for your living costs from the UK government. You can only apply if you normally live in the UK and you cannot return home. This last-resort option is for those most in need, and you would need to repay the loan when you are back in the UK. Apply for an emergency loan.
