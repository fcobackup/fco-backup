There remain commercial options to leave Malaysia.
If you live in the UK and are currently travelling in Malaysia, you are strongly advised to return home now. Don’t run the risk of getting stranded.
UK special charter flights will only operate for priority countries where commercial flights are not possible. You should not assume that these flights will become available in countries where commercial routes are operating. Please do not contact the contracted travel management company if no flight is advertised here.
There are no immigration restrictions preventing foreign nationals leaving Malaysia.
Flights
Qatar Airways is operating three scheduled flights from Kuala Lumpur to the UK via Doha each week. If you do not have any onward travel booked, you should urgently look to do so by contacting the following:
Qatar Airways on +974 4023 0000 or +974 4023 0090
Other airlines may resume flights as quarantine and other restrictions are lifted, however all future schedules are liable to change at short notice. If you live in the UK, you are strongly advised to take the earliest possible flight.
Limited internal flights to Kuala Lumpur International Airport (KLIA) continue to operate for essential travel. If you are unable to secure a flight to KLIA, you can fly to Sultan Abdul Aziz Shah Airport (also known as Subang Airport) and travel by taxi to KLIA (60km).
If you are flying from Sabah or Sarawak, you will only be allowed to board a flight to KLIA if it is linked to an onward international flight. You must stay airside at KLIA, so please ensure that your luggage is checked through to your final destination.
Passengers looking to travel by air domestically within Malaysia in order to use KLIA to transit onwards to the UK are encouraged to check with their airline and choose a route which enables travel from Malaysia to the UK on one ticket. This allows direct transit to the international flight at KLIA.
Some airlines require passengers to bring their own face mask to be worn in the airport and throughout the flight. Please check with your airline. If you do not have a face mask, you may not be allowed to fly.
You will need to pay for your return travel to the UK. If departure options are available but you cannot afford the travel costs and have exhausted all other options for getting funds, you may be eligible to apply for an emergency loan from the government. This is a last resort option and you would need to repay the loan when you are back in the UK. For more information, you should contact Corporate Travel Management (CTM). CTM are a commercial partner of the FCO and are authorised to administer such loans on behalf of the FCO.
Travelling to the airport
If you are currently in the Kuala Lumpur area, you can get to the airport by taxi. The KLIA express train from Sentral station is not currently operating. A bus service does operate from Sentral, but infrequently. You should be prepared to show your passport and airline ticket at each police checkpoint.
Please ensure you set aside sufficient time for your journey, as there can be long queues at each checkpoint. Taxis are not permitted to operate from 10pm until 6am, so you may need to get to the airport earlier than usual. Note that your taxi may want to return home before 10pm, necessitating an earlier drop off at the airport.
If you are travelling inter-state by road to get to KLIA, you will require a written movement permit from the nearest police station. The police will inspect the passport and airline ticket of each traveller in the party, and may check everyone’s health. The police also require a letter from the British High Commission confirming your departure.
If there are any other nationalities in your party, or you are a dual-national who entered on a non-British passport you will need to request a similar letter from the relevant Embassy/High Commission. The British High Commission will issue the letter electronically. Please contact us on +60 3 2170 2200. We need the full names and passport numbers of each British National returning to the UK and an email address.
Note that the police travel permit is only required for inter-state travel by road. Travelling from the Kuala Lumpur area to KLIA does cross state boundaries, but the permit is not required in this case. Inter-state air travel does not require a permit.
Transit via Malaysia
If you are currently in another country in the region and travelling through Kuala Lumpur International Airport (KLIA) as part of a route back to the UK, you will be permitted to transit through KLIA.
You will not be able to enter Malaysia to stay in a hotel or travel to any other airport (including KLIA2, the low-cost airline airport) unless you meet the strict immigration criteria.
Residents
If you currently live in Malaysia and are considering travelling to the UK, you should carefully consider your personal circumstances and the fast-moving situation. Remaining in your home is likely to be the best option for many residents. You will not currently be permitted to re-enter Malaysia while the Movement Control Order remains in place, unless you meet the strict immigration criteria. For information on the criteria, see Coronavirus.
Your journey home
The National Travel Health Network and Centre (NaTHNaC) provides advice on how to stay safe as you travel by air.
When you arrive back in the UK, follow the guidance for when you return to the UK on steps you should take to protect yourself and others.
