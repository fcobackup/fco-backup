If youâ€™re visiting or living in Cambodia and intend to leave, you should do so as soon as possible. The number of international flights out of Cambodia is reducing rapidly. The Cambodia-Vietnam land border is closed and the Cambodia-Thailand land border is closing. Contact your airline or travel company and your insurance provider as soon as you are able, and keep up to date with the latest developments.
