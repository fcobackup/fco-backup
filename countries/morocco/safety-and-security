Terrorism
There is a high threat of terrorist attack globally affecting UK interests and British nationals, including from groups and individuals who view the UK and British nationals as targets. Stay aware of your surroundings at all times.
UK Counter Terrorism Policing has information and advice on staying safe abroad and what to do in the event of a terrorist attack. Find out how to reduce your risk from terrorism while abroad.
Terrorism in Morocco
Terrorists are very likely to try to carry out attacks in Morocco.
Terrorism attacks could be indiscriminate, including in places visited by foreign nationals, such as:   
transport hubs
locations popular with tourists and foreigners
government buildings
crowded places
businesses with western interests
There is an increased threat linked to the number of Moroccans sympathetic or belonging to Daesh (formerly ISIL) and other extremist groups. Authorities regularly disrupt terrorist cells.
In some places, including hotels and tourists sites, there may be protective security measures, including security guards.
Regional risks
Ongoing hostilities in the region and between Israel and Iran could escalate quickly and pose security risks for the wider region. 
You should:
monitor local and international media for the latest information
be vigilant and follow the instructions of local authorities
Political situation
Protests and demonstrations could occur across the country, particularly in large cities, often without warning. These events are typically monitored closely by law enforcement. While authorised protests are generally peaceful, unauthorised ones have sometimes led to clashes between protesters and police. Such gatherings can cause travel disruption in the affected areas. Avoid political gatherings and demonstrations and follow local news and directions from security officials.
Crime
Protecting yourself and your belongings
There can be occasional violent crime in Morocco. Criminals have used knives against tourists in street attacks, thefts and burglaries in major cities and along beaches. To reduce your risk:
avoid quiet areas, particularly after dark
do not carry large amounts of money or valuables
Petty crime is common in tourist areas, especially in historical districts (medina quarters) and on beaches. Crimes include:
pickpocketing
bag-snatching
drive-by motorcycle theft of visible jewellery and handbags
Be cautious when asking for directions and using ATMs – aggressive begging is common.
Scams
Credit card fraud and scams are common. Beware of scammers substituting inferior goods for the ones you bought. Remain alert to potential confidence tricks.
Bogus tourist guides
It is common for people posing as official tourist guides to harass tourists.
If you use a guide in a historical district (medina quarter), make sure they have an official badge and permission from the local authority.
Marriage fraud
Be cautious if you travel to Morocco for a relationship or to find someone you met on the internet. Incidents of marriage fraud and attempted extortion have affected British nationals. Make sure you keep your return ticket, passport and personal belongings safe.
Laws and cultural differences
Morocco’s laws and customs are very different to those in the UK and reflect the fact that Morocco is an Islamic country. Always respect local traditions, customs, laws and religions. Make sure your actions do not offend, especially during the holy month of Ramadan or if you plan to visit religious areas.
Sexual relations outside of marriage
Sexual activity between unmarried people and adultery are illegal for Moroccan nationals – this includes sharing a hotel room, particularly with foreign nationals.
The law regarding unmarried people sharing a hotel room does not generally apply to visiting foreign nationals, particularly in popular tourist areas.
Showing affection in public
Avoid showing affection in public, particularly in tourist areas and near religious sites.
Ramadan
Ramadan is a holy month for Muslims. The dates vary by year and country, check when Ramadan is in Morocco before you go. During this time, do not:
eat, drink, smoke or chew gum in public in the daytime, including in your car
play loud music or dance
swear in public
Get more advice when you arrive from your tour guide, hotel or business contacts.
You should also:
check opening hours of shops and restaurants
be aware that if hotels and restaurants are providing food or drink in fasting hours, they may separate you from Islamic guests, for example with screens
follow local dress codes – clothing that doesn’t meet local dress codes may cause more offence at this time
be aware that driving may be erratic, particularly when people are trying to get home at dusk
LGBT+ travellers
Same-sex sexual relations are illegal in Morocco. Avoid showing affection in public – complaints can lead to prosecution. See more advice for LGBT+ travellers.
Women travellers
Women may receive unwanted attention in Morocco, especially when travelling alone. Consider wearing loose-fitting clothing which cover the arms, legs and chest. See advice for woman travellers abroad.
Alcohol laws
Licensed hotels and bars in tourist areas serve alcohol. Drinking alcohol in the street and anywhere other than a licensed restaurant or bar is illegal and can lead to arrest.
Illegal drugs and prison sentences
Possessing, using or trafficking illegal drugs is a serious offence and can result in a lengthy prison sentence and a heavy fine.
Sending passports by post
It is illegal to send passports by post in Morocco. The authorities will confiscate British passports sent to or through Morocco by post or courier. 
Laws against religious conversion
It is illegal to attempt to convert any Muslim to another faith and to distribute evangelical literature (such as Arabic-language bibles). Attempting to convert a Muslim to another faith is punishable by small fines up to 3 years’ imprisonment.
Criticism of Islam on public platforms, in print or online media, or in public speeches is punishable by heavy fines and up 2 years’ imprisonment.
Using cameras
It is illegal to take photographs near sensitive political or military sites.
Pornography
It is illegal to possess pornographic material. This includes printed material, cassettes and videocassettes and any type of material contrary to morality and public order.
Flying drones
You must get permission from the Directorate General for Civil Aviation (in French) to fly a drone. If you do not, you risk fines and confiscation of your equipment.
Transport risks
Road travel
If you are planning to drive in Morocco, see information on driving abroad.
You’ll need to have both the 1968 version of the international driving permit (IDP) and your UK driving licence with you in the car. You cannot buy an IDP outside the UK, so get one before you travel. Morocco no longer accepts the 1949 version of the IDP.
If you stay longer than one year, you need a Moroccan driving licence.
You must get a green card from your insurer and carry it with you to prove you have the minimum insurance cover in Morocco.
Hire car companies often have stricter requirements for their customers, such as a year of driving experience and a higher minimum age. 
Drink-driving is a serious offence in Morocco. If you are tested and found to have any alcohol in your system, you will get a fine and possible imprisonment.
Driving conditions
Poor lighting can make it dangerous to drive at night. When weather conditions are poor, secondary routes and mountain roads can be especially hazardous. Be cautious of overloaded lorries and trucks overtaking when there is no hard shoulder
Road accidents
If you’re involved in a road accident, complete a form (‘constat amiable’), to be signed by both parties. Blank forms are available from insurance company booths in Tangier Port and tobacconists in all cities.
If you’re involved in a fatal road accident, and the Moroccan authorities think you’re responsible, they may detain you before a trial hearing.
Vehicle documentation
The authorities will record your registration number when you drive into Morocco. If you’re not in the same vehicle when you try to leave the country, they will detain you and refuse to let you exit.
You’ll need to show evidence of motor insurance when entering and exiting Morocco. Always carry your insurance, licence and registration documents with you.
Taxis
Many taxis booked through phone apps may be unregulated and unlicensed. Drivers may not be registered with the authorities and their vehicles may not be insured to carry passengers. The police may tell you to get out of an unlicensed taxi if they stop it. You should:
think carefully before using unregulated or unlicensed taxis
avoid sharing taxis with strangers – if your driver tries to pick up other passengers, insist they do not do this
Drivers of ‘petits’ or ‘grands taxis’ sometimes speed and do not follow other driving rules, particularly in big cities.    
Outdoor activities and adventure travel
Hiking in the Atlas Mountains
If you’re planning to hike in the Atlas Mountains:
research trails and how much experience you’ll need
pack essentials such as water, sunscreen and appropriate clothing
hire a professional guide
get comprehensive travel insurance and make sure it covers your planned activities
Extreme weather and natural disasters
Find out what you can do to prepare for and respond to extreme weather and natural hazards. 
Earthquakes
Earthquakes are a risk in Morocco. The last major earthquake, in 2023, killed almost 3,000 people. There are occasional minor earthquakes. Familiarise yourself with earthquake safety procedures and any instructions in hotel rooms.
The US Federal Emergency Management Agency website has advice about what to do before, during and after an earthquake.
Flooding
Heavy rain can cause flash flooding in some areas, particularly in the mountains or near rivers during winter months. Walking and driving can be dangerous in flooded areas. If you’re near a flood, monitor local media and follow instructions from local authorities.
