The Foreign and Commonwealth Office (FCO) advise against all travel to Donetsk oblast, Luhansk oblast and Crimea.
From 9am local time on 28 November until 27 December 2018, Ukraine is imposing martial law in parts of the country bordering Russia, the Sea of Azov, the Black Sea and the Transnistria region of Moldova. The oblasts affected are: Chernihiv, Donetsk, Kharkiv, Kherson, Luhansk, Mykolayiv, Odesa, Sumy, Vinnytsia and Zaporizhia.
Martial law provisions announced on 26 November include:
adjusting the mobilisation plan of the Armed Forces and calling up a number of reserves
organising the defence of government structures, industrial areas, administrative centres and vital infrastructure, and measures to ensure public order
strengthening protection of the border with Russia and the administrative boundary with Crimea
As a result, you may see increased numbers of security forces on the streets of Ukraine’s cities, more frequent checkpoints, and increased checks if you are crossing to/from Crimea, or between Ukraine and Russia. No curfew has been imposed. You should remain vigilant and follow the advice of local authorities. Remember that it is a requirement of Ukrainian law that you should carry your passport with you at all times as proof of ID.
Events in Ukraine are fast moving. You should remain vigilant throughout Ukraine, monitor the media and this travel advice regularly, subscribe to email alerts and read our advice on how to deal with a crisis overseas.

It’s illegal under Ukrainian law to enter internationally recognised Ukrainian territory through a border point that isn’t currently controlled by the Ukrainian authorities. If you do so, you risk arrest or a fine, and you may be subject to a travel ban. International border crossings that aren’t currently under the control of the Ukrainian authorities include all land border crossings into Donetsk oblast, many of the land border crossings into Luhansk oblast, all air and sea ports in Crimea and the Kerch Bridge road and rail crossing into Crimea. Information on border crossing procedure, entry/exit regulations and checkpoints are provided at the State Border Guard Service of Ukraine website.
The situation in Kyiv and other areas outside Donetsk and Luhansk is generally calm. However, public demonstrations do regularly take place. Policing of these events may include road closures. You should avoid all demonstrations and take extra care at public gatherings. In Kyiv, the areas around Maydan Nezalezhnosti (Independence Square) and government buildings such as the Verkhovna Rada (parliament building) and the National Bank of Ukraine are most frequently affected.
