Terrorists are very likely to try to carry out attacks in Algeria, including kidnappings. Terrorist attacks have focused on the Algerian state, but attacks could be indiscriminate and include foreigners. There’s also a risk that lone actors could target foreigners. You should be vigilant at all times and take additional security precautions, especially in: towns and cities; the southern, Libyan and Tunisian border areas; rural and mountainous areas in the north; and the Sahara.

The Algerian authorities devote considerable resources to the safety of foreign visitors. If you’re travelling independently, you should notify the Ministry of Foreign Affairs or local authorities of your plans. See Local travel
When moving around Algiers and the other main cities, avoid areas that you don’t know, especially after dark. Travelling in rural areas and at night is particularly risky and it’s always advisable to travel with a reputable guide or companion in these areas. Avoid travel by road at night outside the major cities and motorways. See Crime and Local travel
