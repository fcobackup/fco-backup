This page gives you guidance on how to stay safely in Argentina as a visitor, if you are unable to return to the UK.
Everyone should comply with the measures put in place in Argentina to limit the spread of coronavirus (COVID-19).
Moving around in Argentina
In Argentina, measures to control the spread of COVID-19 are ongoing. The entire country is in a phase of mandatory social distancing. Additional restrictions may vary between jurisdictions.
In all parts of Argentina you must cover your nose and mouth with a face mask or other garment whenever you go out in public.
Free movement is allowed within each jurisdiction as long as social distancing rules are adhered to. A night-time curfew from midnight to 6am has been introduced in all jurisdictions deemed high risk by the authorities. You should make sure you understand and comply with the measures in place in the province/jurisdiction you are in. The use of public transport within jurisdictions remains restricted to essential workers and those in need of medical treatment.
Movement between jurisdictions is permitted, provided you meet the requirements of the specific jurisdiction/province you plan to visit. Requirements might include taking a COVID-19 PCR test and applying for a permit to circulate (Certificado Único de Circulación) or a permit for tourism purposes (Certificado Turismo).
You should check what measures apply in your location and any other location you might qualify to travel to or transit through on the Ministry of Health website (in Spanish). You could be subject to a financial penalty if you do not abide by local regulations.
All arrivals into the City of Buenos Aires must take a COVID-19 test within 72 hours of arriving. Online booking is required. Children under the age of 12 are exempt. Full details on this requirement including information on where you can take the test and how to book are available on the City of Buenos Aires website(in Spanish).

COVID-19 vaccines if you live in Argentina
We will update this page when the Government of Argentina announces new information on the national vaccination programme. You can sign up to get email notifications when this page is updated.
The Argentinian national vaccination programme started in December 2020 and is using the AstraZeneca, Covishield, Sinopharm and Sputnik V vaccines (please delete or amend as applicable). British nationals resident in Argentina are eligible for vaccination if they choose to join the programme.
Vaccination is occurring in priority phases and is voluntary and free of charge. You must hold a DNI (national ID) to qualify for a vaccine. Each province/jurisdiction is responsible for the distribution of the vaccines in their area. Further information on Argentina’s national vaccination programme, including priority lists, the status of the rollout in each province and enrolment details are available on the Argentine Ministry of Health website (in Spanish).
