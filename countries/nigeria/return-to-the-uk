There are currently no commercial options available to return to the UK from Nigeria. All airports in Nigeria are closed to international commercial flights until at least 4 June.
UK Special Flights
The UK will operate special flights from Nigeria to the UK on the following dates:
29 May: Lagos - London
1 June: Lagos - London
6 June: Abuja - London
On Saturday 6 June a UK organised special internal charter flight will travel from Port Harcourt to Abuja to enable British nationals based in, or near, Port Harcourt to join the 6 June flight from Abuja to London.
The cost of the flight is £445.85 per person from Lagos and £600 per person from Abuja. The flight from Port Harcourt to London, via Abuja, also costs £600. Children under the age of 2 years old travel free of charge.
Eligibility
These flights are for:
British nationals, normally resident in the UK
Dependants travelling with a British national normally resident in the UK
Vulnerable British nationals will be prioritised.
Vulnerable non-British UK residents with Indefinite Leave to Remain, and other foreign nationals, may be accommodated if there is sufficient capacity.
Your eligibility will be checked before your tickets are issued.
How to book
Our commercial partner, Corporate Travel Management (CTM), is working on behalf of the FCO to manage bookings for these special flights.
Links to booking portals will be added to these Travel Advice pages when booking opens from the afternoon of 24 May.
Sign up for travel advice email alerts and follow the British High Commission on Twitter and Facebook: @UKinNigeria and @DFIDNigeria.
To book flights through the CTM portal, you will need:
Full passport and contact details for each traveller
Your UK home address and postcode
Your means of payment, such as credit or debit card details
If you are already registered with the British High Commission as someone who is vulnerable and would like to return to the UK, you will be invited to book by email.
Seats on flights will be assigned on a first come first served basis, with priority given to vulnerable travellers and those already on the waitlist. If you have been assigned a seat, we will contact you to confirm your booking, between 48-72 hours before your flight. Anyone not assigned a seat on any of these flights will get a full refund.
Tickets will not be on sale at the airport. Do not travel to the airport unless you have been told your seat is confirmed.
Please refer to our guide to eligibility and the booking process for special charter flights.
Financial support for a flight
If you have exhausted all other options available to you for getting funds, you may be eligible to apply for an emergency loan from the government to cover the cost of the ticket.
You would need to repay the loan when you are back in the UK.
CTM is authorised to administer such loans on behalf of the FCO and details will be available when you are asked to pay.
Travel to the airport
You will need to make your own way to the airport. Please plan your journey in advance. After your seat is confirmed you will receive an email containing documents to help you pass through any check points you encounter. You should not go to the airport unless your seat has been confirmed by email.
Your journey home
The National Travel Health Network and Centre (NaTHNaC) provides advice on how to stay safe as you travel by air.
