Before you travel check that:
your destination can provide the healthcare you may need
you have appropriate travel insurance for local treatment or unexpected medical evacuation
This is particularly important if you have a health condition or are pregnant.
Emergency medical number
Dial 995 and ask for an ambulance.
Contact your insurance company promptly if you’re referred to a medical facility for treatment.
Vaccinations and health risks
At least 8 weeks before your trip check:
the latest information on vaccinations and health risks in TravelHealthPro’s Singapore guide
where to get vaccines and whether you have to pay on the NHS travel vaccinations page
Dengue fever, zika and chikungunya virus occur all year round. You should take precautions to avoid being bitten by mosquitoes.
Hand, Foot and Mouth Disease is common in Singapore with more serious outbreaks from time to time. Young children are particularly at risk.
Air quality
From June to October Singapore can experience high levels of pollution (haze) from land clearance fires in Indonesia. The haze can cause disruption to local and regional air travel, and may have an impact on public health. Monitor the Pollutant Standards Index (PSI) updates and health advisories from the Singapore government.
Medication
The legal status and regulation of some medicines prescribed or bought in the UK can be different in other countries.
Check to see whether you need approval from the Health Sciences Authority to bring in medication from the UK.
Not all medicines from the UK are available in Singapore. Make sure you have a prescription from your GP, and check with a doctor in Singapore who may be able to issue a prescription for a local equivalent. See the HCI Directory for a listing of licensed healthcare institutions.
