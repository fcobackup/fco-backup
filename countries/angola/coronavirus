Be prepared for your plans to change
No travel is risk-free during COVID. Countries may further restrict travel or bring in new rules at short notice, for example due to a new COVID-19 variant. Check with your travel company or airline for any transport changes which may delay your journey home.
Plan ahead and make sure you:
can access money
understand what your insurance will cover
can make arrangements to extend your stay and be away for longer than planned
If you test positive for COVID-19 in Angola before returning to the UK, you must self-isolate in private accommodation or in a hotel, for 10 days. If you are visiting and staying in a hotel, you may be asked to self-isolate in your room.
If you test positive, the Angolan authorities may occasionally conduct wellbeing checks during the period of quarantine, to ensure self-isolation compliance. You are not permitted to leave your accommodation during self-isolation. Food and household essentials can be ordered online and will be delivered to your hotel room or private accommodation.
