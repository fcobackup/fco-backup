Cases of coronavirus (COVID-19) have been confirmed in Costa Rica. The Costa Rican authorities have introduced a number of measures to limit the spread of the virus.
Entry and borders
On 16 March 2020 the Costa Rican government announced a state of emergency and that from midnight on Wednesday 18 March 2020 until midnight on Sunday 12 April 2020 only Costa Rican citizens and legal residents will be allowed entry to the country by land, sea or air. This restriction period has been extended to 30 April. These categories of people, entering during this time, will be required to self-isolate for 14-days.
On 23 March, the Costa Rican government announced that any legal resident who left Costa Rica on or after 24 March would automatically lose their current legal migratory status. This would also preclude their re-entry until 30 April, the end of the period specified above. The authorities have announced restrictions on the use of private vehicles between 10pm and 5am (and between 8pm and 5am from Friday to Sunday), except those used by officials, diplomats or people categorised as “essential workers”.
The government has imposed further restrictions to prevent travel over the Easter period. From 3 – 7 April, where vehicles will only be allowed to circulate between 05:00-17.00, according to registration plate; and from 8 – 12 April, movement of vehicles will be suspended, except for visits to supermarkets, pharmacies and medical centres, depending on registration plate. Please check for further details. We advise British nationals in Costa Rica to follow the advice of the local authorities. The supply of hire cars may be reduced as rental companies have been asked to lend their vehicles for deliveries of medical equipment and goods.
