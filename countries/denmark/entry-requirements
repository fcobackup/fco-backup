Entry rules in response to coronavirus (COVID-19)
Entry to Denmark

If you are not a Danish national and/or resident in Denmark, the rules on entry into Denmark depend on whether you are arriving from an ‘open’ country or a ‘banned’ country. A country’s status can change dependent on its infection rate for COVID-19. The status is updated weekly on Thursdays. You can check whether the UK is ‘open’ or ‘banned’ on the Danish government’s Coronavirus website.
Open country status
The UK is an ‘open’ country. This means that you can enter Denmark without having to go into a quarantine if you are arriving into Denmark from the UK.
