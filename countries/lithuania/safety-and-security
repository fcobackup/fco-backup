There is a high threat of terrorist attack globally affecting UK interests and British nationals, including from groups and individuals who view the UK and British nationals as targets. Stay aware of your surroundings at all times.      
UK Counter Terrorism Policing has information and advice on staying safe abroad and what to do in the event of a terrorist attack. Find out how to reduce your risk from terrorism while abroad.
Terrorism in Lithuania
Terrorist attacks in Lithuania cannot be ruled out.
Crime
Protecting your belongings
Petty crime is common. To reduce your risk:
beware of pickpockets in busy locations and on public transport
avoid unlit streets and parks at night
be cautious if you’re walking alone
do not leave coats and handbags unattended in bars, pubs and clubs
Drink and food spiking
There have been instances of drink spiking in Vilnius and at festivals and events elsewhere in Lithuania. Do not leave drinks unattended and be wary of accepting food and drink from strangers in bars, nightclubs and restaurants.   
Car theft
Car theft is a problem as well as theft from cars. Park in guarded car parks in cities, especially overnight. Do not leave your luggage in a car for any length of time.
Laws and cultural differences
Illegal drugs and prison sentences
Possessing even very small quantities of drugs can lead to imprisonment or heavy fines.
LGBT+ travellers
While there are some LGBT+ friendly venues in larger cities, small towns and rural areas can be less accepting of LGBT+ travellers.
Same-sex relationships are legal and same-sex partners can live together, but same-sex marriages and civil partnerships are not recognised under Lithuanian law.

Transport risks
Road travel
If you are planning to drive in Lithuania, see information on driving abroad and check the rules of the road in the RAC’s Lithuania guide. The guide lists driving regulations and other requirements that you need to be aware of.
You can use a UK photocard driving licence to drive in Lithuania. Make sure it has the correct name and address. Renew or update your licence if necessary.
If you still have a paper driving licence, you may need to update it to a photocard licence or get the correct version of the international driving permit (IDP) as well.
Hire car companies often have stricter requirements for their customers, such as a year of driving experience and a higher minimum age.   
Drink-driving is a serious offence in Lithuania, and the legal limits are stricter than in the UK. If you are tested and have over the legal limit for alcohol in your system, you may face a heavy fine and imprisonment.        
Check if you need a UK sticker to drive your car outside the UK.
Taxis
It is safer to use a recognised taxi app or to phone for a registered taxi that uses a meter. Make sure the meter is switched on to avoid arguments about the fare.
Curonian Spit, Klaipeda
The Spit, a UNESCO World Heritage Site, is divided between Lithuania and Russia – the northern half is in Lithuania and the southern half is part of Kaliningrad, Russia. Visitors should be aware that the walk along the Curonian Spit in Lithuanian territory will eventually reach Russian territory. See Russia travel advice.
