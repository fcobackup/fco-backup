The Foreign, Commonwealth & Development Office (FCDO) advises against all travel to Afghanistan. You should not travel to Afghanistan. The security situation in Afghanistan remains extremely volatile. There is an ongoing and high threat of terrorist attack.
The potential for terrorist attacks, particularly around the airport, remains very high. All travel throughout Afghanistan is extremely dangerous, and border crossings may not be open. British nationals remaining in Afghanistan need to consider carefully the risks should they attempt to leave over land. You should shelter in a safe location and move towards a departure point only if and when you judge it is safe to do so.
The UK evacuation operation has ceased. The British Embassy in Kabul has suspended in-country operations. All UK diplomatic and consular staff have been temporarily withdrawn.
If you are a British national and need to speak to a consular officer, call the FCDO on +44 (0) 1908 516666 (or 01908 516666 in the UK). The FCDO cannot offer advice on the safety of travelling to any alternative departure point. If you are still in Afghanistan, you are strongly encouraged to register your presence so that you will receive important updates.
If you are an Afghan national and are eligible or have been approved for assistance under the Afghan Relocations and Assistance Policy (ARAP) or you are at serious risk and fall within a priority group please monitor our support page for further updates and information, or call +44 2475 389 980 (or 02475 389 980 in the UK).
