There are currently no other commercial options available to return to the UK from Paraguay. Paraguay’s borders remain closed for non-resident foreigners until further notice.
If you cannot leave Paraguay at this time, see advice on staying in Paraguay during coronavirus.
Future travel options
The Paraguayan government announced on 24 March that all passenger flights have been suspended until further notice, with occasional repatriation/charter flights.
We know this is concerning for British people trying to leave Paraguay. The UK government is working closely with airlines, the Paraguayan authorities and other governments to make sure options are available for you to return to the UK as soon as possible.
If you are interested in returning to the UK, register your details with us at UKinParaguay@fco.gov.uk. You should also sign up for travel advice email alerts and follow the British Embassy Asuncion on Twitter and Facebook.
You will need to pay for your return travel to the UK. If departure options are available but you cannot afford the travel costs and have exhausted all other options for getting funds, you may be eligible to apply for an emergency loan from the government. This is a last resort option and you would need to repay the loan when you are back in the UK. For more information, contact Corporate Travel Management (CTM). CTM are a commercial partner of the FCO and are authorised to administer such loans on behalf of the FCO.
Your journey home: re-entering the UK
When you return, you must follow the rules for entering the UK. You:
need to provide your journey and contact details up to 48 hours before you’re due to arrive in the UK
are not allowed to leave the place you’re staying for the first 14 days you’re in the UK except in very limited situations (known as ‘self-isolating’)
See also the list of people who are exempt from the border rules.
The National Travel Health Network and Centre (NaTHNaC) also provides advice on how to stay safe as you travel by air.
Help and support
If you need urgent consular assistance, you can contact the British Embassy 24/7 on +595 21 614 588.
The Embassy cannot provide further information or advice about departure options over the phone. This page will be updated when departure options become available.
