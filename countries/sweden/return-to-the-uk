Commercial options to return to the UK from Sweden are significantly reduced. At present there are no scheduled direct flights from Sweden to the UK, although some indirect routes remain available. There are no direct flights from Denmark or Norway to the UK.
If you live in the UK and are currently visiting Sweden, you’re strongly advised to return now by commercial means. Don’t run the risk of getting stranded. You should contact your travel operator or travel agent for flight availability. Flight schedules may change at short notice.
UK special charter flights will only operate for priority countries where commercial flights are not possible. You should not assume that these flights will become available in countries where commercial routes are operating. Please do not contact the contracted travel management company if no flight is advertised here.
You will need to pay for your return travel to the UK. If departure options are available but you cannot afford the travel costs and have exhausted all other options for getting funds, you may be eligible to apply for an emergency loan from the government. This is a last resort option and you would need to repay the loan when you are back in the UK.
For more information on obtaining an emergency loan, you should contact Corporate Travel Management (CTM). CTM is a commercial partner of the FCO and is authorised to administer such loans on behalf of the FCO.
Travel via Denmark
If you are in southern Sweden, you may be considering returning to the UK via Denmark. This would require you to cross the Oresund Bridge or use the Helsingborg – Helsingör ferry route, and therefore cross Danish border controls. You should inform the Danish border officials that you are returning to the UK, and be prepared to provide evidence to support this, for example a flight ticket. Please see travel advice for Denmark.
Your journey home
The National Travel Health Network and Centre (NaTHNaC) provides advice on how to stay safe as you travel by air.
