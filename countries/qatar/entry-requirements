Entry rules in response to coronavirus
Entry to Qatar
From 1 August 2020, British nationals currently outside of Qatar and holding a Qatar residence permit are allowed to enter the country, subject to receiving prior approval.
From 29 November 2020, any resident leaving Qatar will automatically receive their Exceptional Entry Permit, and there will no longer be a need to apply through the Qatar Portal website. This permit will be available to print from the Ministry of Interior website once the resident’s departure has been registered. Please ensure you have a printed copy with you when you travel.
For residents returning to Qatar after 29 November 2020, the quarantine period will be for 7 days. For those returning from a country not included on the Qatar Ministry of Public Health’s ‘Green List’, a mandatory 7 day hotel quarantine will apply. This will be at a government-approved hotel and must be booked through the Discover Qatar website.
From 22 December 2020, all residents arriving on flights originating in the UK will be required to stay at a designated hotel for their quarantine period. These must be booked through the Discover Qatar website.

Transit passengers travelling on to another destination can still transfer through Qatar, and many flights continue to operate. You should check with your airline or travel company for the latest information if you are planning to leave or transit through Qatar. Flights are subject to change or cancellation at short notice.
Whilst in transit at Hamad International Airport, you will receive regular thermal screening and temperature checks.

Visas
You can get a free 30-day tourist visa-waiver on arrival in Qatar. If you’re travelling for any purpose other than tourism, and/or hold one of the other types of British passport, you must get a visa before you travel.
If you need to stay longer than 30 days, you must extend your visa waiver before it expires through the Ministry of Interior. If you fail to do so, you may receive an overstay fine, which must be paid before leaving Qatar.
You can find further information on visa requirements and extensions on the Qatar Ministry of Interior website
Passport validity
Your passport should be valid for a minimum period of 6 months from the date of entry into Qatar.
UK Emergency Travel Documents
UK Emergency Travel Documents (ETDs) are not valid for entry into Qatar. However, ETDs are accepted for airside transit and exit from Qatar. If you are exiting Qatar on an ETD because your full validity passport has been lost or stolen, you must obtain a police report in order to exit Qatar. These reports can be obtained at any police station in Qatar. You should allow sufficient time to collect this report as they can take up to 2 days to be processed. Without this report you may experience difficulties at the airport. If the holder of the ETD is a new-born child with no previous passport or identification, an exit permit is required before exiting Qatar. These can be obtained from the Immigration Office in Al Gharrafa.
Living and working in Qatar
If you’re applying for a residence permit, you will have to undergo a medical test including blood tests and a chest X-ray. The tests screen for diseases including, but not restricted to, HIV/AIDS, Tuberculosis, Hepatitis B and C. Testing positive may lead to further tests and possible deportation.
