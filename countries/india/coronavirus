Entry and borders
To curb the spread of COVID-19, the Government of India announced that all scheduled international and domestic commercial passenger air services will remain suspended until at least 17 May 2020. All passenger train services are also suspended until at least 17 May 2020.
All land borders with Bangladesh, Bhutan, Myanmar and Nepal in East and North East India are closed.
Visas
The Government of India previously announced that all regular and e-visas which have expired or are due to expire between February 1 and 3 May 2020 will be extended until 3 May 2020 on gratis basis once an online application is submitted. Foreign nationals can also leave India up to 14 days beyond 3 May 2020 (i.e. 17 May 2020) without an overstay penalty.
Please check the validity of your Indian visa. If it has expired, or is due to expire, you will need to apply for a visa extension via the FRRO website. We are aware that there are currently issues with the FRRO website – we are working with the relevant authority to rectify. Try at off-peak times if you are experiencing problems. Visa free travel for Overseas Citizens of India (OCI) is also suspended.
The Government of India has published FAQs for foreigners currently in India who are worried about overstaying their visa. Visit the FRRO website if you have any visa-related queries.
Travel within India
On 1 May, the Government of India extended the lockdown across India until 17 May.
No flights, trains or any form of interstate public transport are operational. Inter-district and inter-state movement, except for medical purposes, is prohibited. All essential services (including groceries, pharmacies, ATMs) continue to function. The wearing of facial/cloth masks is now compulsory in all public places. There are strict restrictions on large gatherings. You may be penalised if you violate movement restrictions.
Local measures
The Indian Ministry of Home Affairs has issued new guidelines to regulate activities in this period. All districts of India have been divided into ‘Green’, ‘Amber’ and ‘Red’ zones, based on the level of infection. The level of restrictions vary between these zones.
Restrictions may vary between states. Some states are not allowing foreign nationals to either enter or exit. Hotels in some states have been instructed to refuse entry to foreign nationals. British Nationals opting for repatriation through special flights are being allowed to travel with special permission obtained by the British High Commission from the Indian Ministry of External Affairs.
Health
It is a mandatory requirement in a number of states for foreign nationals to complete a health declaration. You may be liable for prosecution if you are symptomatic or a confirmed case and deliberately attempt to hide symptoms and/or travel history.
The Indian Government has expanded testing, including through private laboratories, though testing is still available only on the prescription of a registered medical practitioner. A Government supported central help line number +91-11-23978046 can be used to re-direct you to a medical practitioner.
