The Rwandan authorities have introduced a number of measures to limit the spread of coronavirus (COVID-19), including suspending all flights to and from Kigali International Airport from 23:59 local time on 20 March, for an initial period of 30 days. Emergency Flights are the only exceptions. All land borders are also closed.
You should urgently contact your airline or tour operator if you are due to travel to or from Rwanda. The closure of borders and restrictions on movement outside of residences, including travel between cities and districts, was introduced at 23.59 on 21 March for an initial two week period.
The British High Commission is in contact with airlines and local authorities where there is the possibility of an Emergency Flight out of Rwanda.
If you wish to leave Rwanda, please get in touch with the British High Commission via our Kigali Enquiries mailbox.
