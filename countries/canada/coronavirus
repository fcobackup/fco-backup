Travel in Canada
To help curb the spread of coronavirus, provincial governments have introduced a number of measures. There are some regional variations, but they generally include:
a ban on social gatherings
closure of schools, colleges and many public facilities, museums, cinemas and theatres
closure of bars, restaurants and non-essential stores in many cities and regions
some public transport offering only a limited service
The authorities are urging people to stay at home where possible, and many businesses are closed.
Public spaces and services
Anyone showing symptoms associated with coronavirus will be barred from domestic flights and some inter-city train services. From 20 April, non-medical face masks or face coverings are required for all flights to and from Canadian airports.
The Canadian authorities recommend the use of non-medical masks/facial coverings when it is not possible to consistently maintain a 2-metre physical distance from others, including on public transportation. Some local transport authorities are making this a mandatory requirement. You should ensure that you are in possession of a mask/facial covering when using public transport in the event you are requested by transport operators to wear one.
Both the federal and provincial governments may introduce further restrictions at short notice, including closing provincial borders, internal travel restrictions, a provisional ban on temporary foreign workers, or mandatory self-isolation for people arriving from other provinces. You should comply with the rules and advice of local authorities in relation to coronavirus. Check guidance for each province.
