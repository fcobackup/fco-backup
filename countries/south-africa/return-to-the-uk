South African airspace is closed to commercial airlines as part of efforts to contain the spread of coronavirus (COVID-19). International commercial passenger flights are unlikely to resume for some time.
Land borders to neighbouring countries are closed except for trade.
UK special flights
Between 23 May and 4 June, the UK government in partnership with British Airways will operate 10 repatriation charter flights for remaining British travellers in South Africa to return to the UK.
We do not plan any further UK government repatriation flights from South Africa after 4 June. Commercial international passenger flights are unlikely to be permitted by the South African government for some time.
Locations
There will be 7 flights from Cape Town and 3 flights from Johannesburg. British travellers in Kwa-Zulu Natal or in East London should book from Johannesburg. British travellers in the Western Cape or Port Elizabeth should book from Cape Town. Escorted buses will be provided to transfer passengers from Durban, Port Elizabeth and East London.
Eligibility
These flights are for:
British nationals, normally resident in the UK
dependants travelling with a British national normally resident in the UK
Vulnerable British nationals will be prioritised for these flights.
Vulnerable non-British UK residents with Indefinite Leave to Remain, and other foreign nationals, may be accommodated if there is sufficient capacity.
These flights cannot be used by South African passport holders for short-term visits, or emigration to the UK. Eligibility, including your address in the UK, will be checked before tickets are issued.
The South African government has issued guidance governing who may currently leave the country. If you are a South African who normally lives in the UK, the South African authorities have said you will be permitted to leave South Africa only if you:
have dual UK-South African citizenship; or
are married to a British national; or
have proof of permanent residence in the UK
Cost
The cost of the flight is £693.89 per person from Cape Town and £668.55 per person from Johannesburg.
You will need to pay for your return travel to the UK. If you cannot afford the travel costs and have exhausted all other options for getting funds, you may be eligible to apply for an emergency loan from the government. This is a last resort option only available to British nationals and you would need to repay the loan when you are back in the UK.
Our partner CTM is also authorised to administer such loans on behalf of the FCO and details will be available when you are asked to pay.

You may find it helpful to read our guide to eligibility and the booking process for special charter flights.
Paying for a ticket does not guarantee a seat, and you cannot choose which date to fly. Seats on these flights will be assigned on the basis of priority needs. When you have been assigned a seat, we will contact you to confirm your booking, at least 72 hours ahead of your flight. Anyone not assigned a seat on any of these flights will get a full refund.
Travel to the airport
You should not go directly to the airport. We will arrange assembly points where passengers will meet and then be transferred to the airport by bus.
After your seat is confirmed you will receive an email explaining where your assembly point is and how you should get there. There will be a contact number in case you need additional assistance.
Ahead of your flight, the High Commission will issue a letter which you can use to travel to the assembly point. You should not go to an assembly point without a flight ticket.
Your journey home
The National Travel Health Network and Centre (NaTHNaC) provides advice on how to stay safe as you travel by air.
When you arrive back in the UK, follow the guidance for when you return to the UK on steps you should take to protect yourself and others.
Future options
Thank you to everyone who registered their details via our Travel Advice. Your information helped us plan for these special flights. The registration page has now been closed and all British travellers wanting to return to the UK should apply for flight tickets using the process above.
International commercial passenger flights are unlikely to resume for some time. This travel advice will be updated with any information on resumption of commercial passenger flights. In the meantime, you should continue to follow any regulations set out by the South African government during the lockdown.
