This page has information on travelling to Portugal. Check what you must do to return to the UK.
This page reflects the UK government’s understanding of current rules for people travelling on a full ‘British Citizen’ passport from the UK, for the most common types of travel.
The authorities in Portugal set and enforce entry rules.
All travellers
A passenger locator form is no longer required for entry to mainland Portugal, Madeira and the Azores.
Entry to mainland Portugal and the Azores
If you’re fully vaccinated
If you’re fully vaccinated, you can enter mainland Portugal and the Azores without needing to test.
To qualify under the fully vaccinated rules, you must have a vaccination certificate which shows you have had either:
a full course, as described below, of a vaccine approved by the European Medicines Agency, at least 14 days and no more than 270 days before you arrive, or
a full course of a vaccine, as described below, plus a booster vaccine approved by the European Medicines Agency at least 14 days before you arrive
You will be considered fully vaccinated if you have had:
both doses of a 2-dose vaccine, or a combination of two different vaccines, or
an approved one-dose vaccine, or
a full course of a vaccine, plus a booster vaccine, or
if you caught COVID-19 after just one dose of a 2-dose vaccine and your certificate shows that your vaccination course is complete after the administration of just one dose of the vaccine
Proof of vaccination status
You must present proof that you have been fully vaccinated when you check-in for your flight to mainland Portugal and the Azores.
You can use your UK COVID Pass (paper or digital format) to demonstrate your vaccination record. The NHS vaccination card is not accepted for travel.
If you’re fully vaccinated and your airline allows you to travel to mainland Portugal or the Azores without proof of your vaccination status, you will have to take a COVID-19 test at your own expense at the airport or port on arrival. You will also be fined unless you can prove you are legally resident in Portugal.
If you’re not fully vaccinated
If you’re not fully vaccinated, you’ll need to show proof of a negative PCR test (taken no more than 72 hours before boarding), a rapid lateral flow test (taken no more than 24 hours before boarding) or valid evidence of recent recovery from COVID-19 (see below) on departure to mainland Portugal and the Azores. See information on getting a test before you travel
Make sure your test is carried out by a trained healthcare professional. Self-administered tests are not acceptable. If you take a rapid lateral flow test, check it meets the standards set out in the EU common list of Rapid Antigen Tests.
If you’ve tested positive for COVID-19 in the last year, you can enter mainland Portugal and the Azores with a COVID-19 recovery certificate showing you recovered from COVID-19, no less than 11 days and no more than 180 days before you travel. You will not need to take a test. You can use your UK COVID Pass to demonstrate proof of COVID-19 recovery when checking in for your flight.
If you’re not fully vaccinated and your airline allows you to travel to mainland Portugal or the Azores without a negative test or valid recovery certificate, you will have to take a COVID-19 test at your own expense at the airport or port on arrival. You will also be fined unless you can prove you are legally resident in Portugal.
For further information, check the Portuguese Airport authority passenger guide and Visit Portugal website.
For further information about entering the Azores, see the regional government’s website.
Entry to Madeira and Porto Santo
There are no requirements for entry to Madeira and Porto Santo.
Children and young people
Children aged 11 and under do not need to take a test or show proof of vaccination or recovery to enter mainland Portugal and the Azores.
If you’re transiting through Portugal
If you’re transiting through Portugal on your way to another country, you’ll need to follow the rules that apply to your vaccination status, even if you’re arriving by air and are staying in the airport (airside).
Travelling through Spain and France to Portugal
Check the requirements for entering and transiting France and Spain on FCDO Travel Advice, before you travel.
Check the requirements for crossing the land border into Portugal from Spain.
Check your passport and travel documents before you travel
Passport validity
If you are planning to travel to an EU country (except Ireland), or Switzerland, Norway, Iceland, Liechtenstein, Andorra, Monaco, San Marino or Vatican City, you must follow the Schengen area passport requirements.
Your passport must be:
Issued less than 10 years before the date you enter the country (check the ‘date of issue’)
valid for at least 3 months after the day you plan to leave (check the ‘expiry date’)
You must check your passport meets these requirements before you travel. If your passport was issued before 1 October 2018, extra months may have been added to its expiry date.
Contact the embassy of the country you are visiting if you think that your passport does not meet both these requirements. Renew your passport if you need to.
Visas
You can travel to countries in the Schengen area for up to 90 days in any 180-day period without a visa. This applies if you travel as a tourist, to visit family or friends, to attend business meetings, cultural or sports events, or for short-term studies or training.
If you are travelling to Portugal and other Schengen countries without a visa, make sure your whole visit is within the 90-day limit. Visits to Schengen countries within the previous 180 days before you travel count towards your 90 days.
To stay longer, to work or study, for business travel or for other reasons, you will need to meet the Portuguese government’s entry requirements. Check the Portuguese Immigration Service (scroll to the bottom of the page) and check with the Portuguese Embassy what type of visa and/or work permit you may need.
If you are travelling to Portugal for work, read the guidance on visas and permits.
If you stay in Portugal with a residence permit or long-stay visa, this does not count towards your 90-day visa-free limit.
Passport stamping
Check your passport is stamped by the border officer when you enter and exit Portugal as a visitor.
You can use the staffed immigration booths or, if you are aged 18 and over, the e-gates designated for UK and some other non-EU nationals. Hand your passport for stamping to the border officer after you have passed through the e-gate.
Border guards use passport stamps to check you’re complying with the 90-day visa-free limit for short stays in the Schengen area. If relevant entry or exit stamps are not in your passport, a border officer may presume that you have overstayed your visa-free limit.
If you are missing entry/exit stamps, you can show evidence of when and where you entered or exited the Schengen area and ask the border officer to add this date and location in your passport. Examples of acceptable evidence include boarding passes and tickets.
Residents of Portugal
If you are resident in Portugal, your passport should not be stamped. You should proactively show proof of residence, as well as your passport, at Portuguese border control. For further information, see our Living in Portugal guide.
Other evidence
On entry to Portugal, you may also need to:
show a return or onward ticket
show you have enough money for your stay
Travelling with children
Children aged 17 and under travelling to Portugal alone or in the company of a person who is not their parent or legal guardian, must either:
be met at the airport or point of entry by their parent or guardian, or
carry a letter of authorisation to travel from their parent or guardian. The letter should name the adult in Portugal who will be responsible for them during their stay and the identification and contacts details of the parent or guardian.
If you travel with a child without consent from their parent or guardian, you may be questioned on arrival and your entry to Portugal may be delayed until further checks are made.
Teenagers aged 17 and under who travel alone or with friends of the same age, and who are not being met by a parent or guardian on arrival, may be refused entry if they do not have a letter of authority as described above.
For more information, check the Portuguese government portal.
Resident children leaving Portugal
A child aged 17 and under who is resident in Portugal must carry a notarised letter of authority from their parent or guardian if they’re travelling out of the country alone or in the company of a person who is not their parent or legal guardian. The letter of authority can be issued by:
one of the child’s parents (if the parents are married)
the parent the child lives with (if the parents are separated or divorced)
one of the adoptive parents (if the child is adopted) or
the child’s legal guardian
Further information is available on the Portuguese immigration service website.
UK Emergency Travel Documents
UK ETDs are accepted for entry, airside transit and exit from Portugal.
