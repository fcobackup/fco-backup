Terrorism in Ireland
Terrorist attacks in Ireland cannot be ruled out.
Protests
Following a knife attack on 23 November, there has been unrest around the centre of Dublin. There has been, and may continue to be, some disruption, including to traffic and public transport. You should avoid any protests and follow advice of local authorities.
Crime
Take precautions to reduce the risk of bag snatching or pickpocketing. Avoid carrying valuables and large amounts of money. Lock your vehicle and park where possible in a secure car park. Most incidents occur in the larger cities.
You can get free support from the Irish Tourist Assistance Service (ITAS) as a victim of crime. Report any incident in person to the nearest Garda (police) station. They will contact ITAS if needed.
