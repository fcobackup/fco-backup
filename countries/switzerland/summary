The Swiss Government has announced that the country is implementing “extraordinary measures” with effect from 17 March due to coronavirus (COVID-19). All shops, restaurants, bars, leisure and entertainment facilities will be closed until at least 19 April 2020 with exemptions for essential outlets such as grocery stores, pharmacies, health facilities and public transport. The public are strongly advised to stay at home and employers urged to allow staff to work from home. See Health
Border crossings between Switzerland and Austria, France, Germany, and Italy are subject to controls and inspections. Entry into Switzerland via the border crossings with Austria, France, Germany and Italy will now only be possible for Swiss citizens, residents, cross-border workers, those transiting and those with “compelling reasons” also being allowed entry. Goods traffic is also still permitted. Secondary customs posts are closed at all borders so that traffic can be channelled through the main border crossings. See Entry requirements.
