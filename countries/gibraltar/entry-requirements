Entry rules in response to coronavirus (COVID-19)
From 17 May, the rules for people arriving in Gibraltar have changed. Requirements upon arrival depend on the countries you have visited in the 14 days prior to your arrival, and whether they are on the green, amber or red lists.
If you have only been in countries or territories on the green list in the 14 days preceding your arrival in Gibraltar, you must book a free COVID-19 lateral flow test before arriving in Gibraltar. The test must take place within 24 hours of your arrival. If you are remaining in Gibraltar for more than 7 days, you must also take a second test on day 5. You do not need to provide evidence of vaccination, or self-isolate.
However if you have been to a country on the amber or red list in the previous 14 days, you must book your COVID-19 tests before your arrival, and if you have not been fully vaccinated, you will need to self-isolate on arrival in Gibraltar. In all instances you must complete a Passenger Locator Form.
Please see the official Gibraltar Tourist Board website which provides comprehensive information about the requirements in respect of COVID-19 for travelling to Gibraltar, including information on how to book your COVID-19 tests before you arrive.
Demonstrating your COVID-19 vaccination status
If you live in England, Gibraltar will accept the NHS app or your NHS letter to demonstrate your COVID-19 vaccination status. You cannot use a handwritten NHS COVID card as proof of vaccination for travel purposes.
