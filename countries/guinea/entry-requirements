Testing / screening on arrival and departure
All passengers arriving in Conakry must show a COVID-19 certificate with a negative polymerase chain reaction (PCR) result from a test taken within 72 hours of arrival, and departing passengers within 72 hours of leaving. Following the identification of a new strain of COVID-19, travellers from the UK must also take a supplementary PCR test on arrival at the airport. Travellers will remain at the Onomo hotel in Conakry until the test result, which could take between 48 and 72 hours. Food and lodging will be paid by the Government of Guinea until the test result is received. Travellers will only be able to leave the hotel with a negative certificate. Those testing positive will be taken to a government treatment centre.
You should not use the NHS testing service to get a test in order to facilitate your travel to another country. You should arrange to take a private test.
Masks are mandatory and travellers must have at least three for the trip. There will be controlled disembarkation of planes.
Temperature checks and health controls are in place on departure and arrival at the airport for all passengers.
You may have to follow special requirements set out by your airline.
