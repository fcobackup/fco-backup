The information on this page covers the most common types of travel and reflects the UK government’s understanding of the rules currently in place. Unless otherwise stated, this information is for travellers using a full ‘British Citizen’ passport.
The authorities in Lebanon are responsible for setting and enforcing the rules for entry. If you’re unclear about any aspect of the entry requirements, or you need further reassurance, you’ll need to contact the Lebanese embassy in the UK.
You should also consider checking with your transport provider or travel company to make sure your passport and other travel documents meet their requirements.
Entry rules in response to coronavirus (COVID-19)
Entry to Lebanon
Beirut’s Rafik Hariri international airport re-opened on 1 July with initially limited capacity of 2,000 passengers daily and limited flights.
All passengers travelling to Lebanon must fill this health declaration form online before departure, as required by the Lebanese Ministry of Public Health.
Passengers travelling to Lebanon, except military personnel, diplomats, members of international organizations, UNIFIL and members of the Lebanese National Social Security Fund or staff cooperative, need to possess an insurance policy that is valid for the duration of their stay in Lebanon, covering all costs of treatment for Coronavirus on Lebanese territory. Alternatively, the policy can be obtained at the insurance counters upon their arrival at Rafik Hariri International Airport-Beirut
Testing and screening on arrival
People travelling to Beirut will be required to comply with testing and self-isolation measures to reduce the spread of coronavirus. Check with the airline and Lebanese embassy before booking. Any passenger who shows symptoms of illness including COVID-19 will not be allowed to board the aircraft.
All travellers arriving in Lebanon are required to take a PCR test at a laboratory certified by local authorities within 96 hours prior to travel, and to show the result at check-in before proceeding to immigration. Passengers not having a negative PCR test result within this time frame and in an approved form (paper or email, not SMS) will not be allowed to board planes departing to Lebanon.
Upon arrival at Rafik Hariri International Airport, all passengers will be required to take another PCR test. Certain airlines are covering the cost of this test whilst others may not. Travellers should check with their airline.
Passengers travelling from countries where the Government of Lebanon considers PCR tests to be accurate must then proceed to their accommodation and adhere to home quarantine until receiving the result (up to 48 hours). The UK is considered by the Government of Lebanon as a country where PCR tests are accurate.
Passengers travelling from countries where PCR tests are considered inaccurate must then proceed to self isolate for 48 hours in one of the hotels selected by the Ministry of Tourism, until they receive the results of the test conducted at the airport. Passengers are required to book a 48 hour stay at one of these hotels before boarding their plane.
Such travellers will then have to take a second test after 72 hours at their own expense at an accredited laboratory in accordance with the instructions of the Lebanese Ministry of Public Health. Passengers will not be allowed to leave their quarantine hotel until informed of their second test result.
Passengers who left Lebanon for a period not exceeding one week are not required to do a PCR test before departure but will be subject to a PCR test on arrival.
For further information, please contact your airline or the Lebanese Ministry of Public Health.
Quarantine requirements
If you test positive for COVID-19 after entering Lebanon, you will have to follow Ministry of Health directives until you recover.
Transit Passengers
There are no testing or additional COVID-19 related procedures required for transiting travellers. Passengers with a short transit time will be allowed to proceed directly to their gate, those with a longer transit time will have to wait at a designated gate where a cafeteria is available.
Regular entry requirements
Visas
British citizens can normally apply for a free single entry tourist or family visit visa on arrival. British Overseas Citizens and British Protected Persons will need to get a visa before travelling to Lebanon. Persons of Palestinian origin may also require a visa before travelling, or may be required to carry additional documentation with them when travelling. Entry requirements are subject to change, so you should check with the Lebanese Embassy before you travel.
Overstaying without the proper authority is a serious matter. You may be refused permission to leave until a fine has been paid.
Passport validity
Your passport should be valid for a minimum period of 3 months from the date of entry into Lebanon.
UK Emergency Travel Documents
UK Emergency Travel Documents (ETDs) are accepted for entry, transit and exit from Lebanon.
If your passport is stolen, you’ll need to report the theft to the police in the area where it took place and obtain a police report before an ETD can be issued. If your passport has been lost, you’ll need to go to the nearest General Security office and get a certificate of loss before an ETD can be issued. These are mandatory steps in all cases where the original passport showing the entry stamp into Lebanon isn’t available.
Once an ETD has been issued to you, you’ll need to visit the General Security office in central Beirut to obtain an exit visa before you can depart. You should factor the time this will take into any new travel plans.
Previous travel to Israel
If your passport contains an Israeli stamp you may be refused entry to Lebanon even if you hold a valid Lebanese visa.
Stop matches
Lebanese Immigration Authorities check all visitors’ names on arrival against a database of those wanted for, or convicted of, offences in Lebanon. If a name matches against an entry on the database the individual may be detained (or on occasion allowed entry upon surrender of their passport) until they can prove that the record does not relate to them. It’s often possible to do so by producing a copy of a birth certificate or other official documentation that allows parents’ names to be checked against the database. You should consider carrying this kind of supporting documentation.
