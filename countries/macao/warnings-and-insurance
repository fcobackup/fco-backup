This travel advice covers the Macao Special Administrative Region (SAR). For mainland China, see travel advice for China.
Dual Chinese-British nationality  
Macao does not recognise dual nationality. If you have both British and Chinese nationality, the local authorities may treat you as a Chinese citizen, even if you enter Macao on a full “British citizen” passport. If this is the case, the British Consulate-General may not be able to offer you consular help.      
If you have formally renounced Chinese citizenship, carry evidence that you have done so.
See guidance on nationality in China.
