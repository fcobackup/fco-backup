Crime
There is a low rate of crime, but petty crime does occur and you should take the usual precautions to avoid becoming a victim. Don’t leave valuables unattended. Be vigilant in busy tourist areas and safeguard your valuables against pickpockets.
Road travel
For the latest traffic conditions, check the PIC Traffic Information Centre website. Travel updates and information on border crossings and international rail journeys can be found at the Slovenian Traffic Information Centre and Slovenian Automobile Association.
In 2019 there were 102 road deaths in Slovenia (source: Department for Transport). This equates to 4.9 road deaths per 100,000 of population and compares to the UK average of 2.6 road deaths per 100,000 of population in 2019.

Licences and documents
You can drive in Slovenia on your UK driving licence.
If you’re living in Slovenia, check the Living in Guide for information on requirements for residents.
Driving a British car abroad
You may need a UK sticker to drive your car outside the UK. From 28 September 2021 UK stickers have replaced GB stickers. Check the GOV.UK Displaying number plates website for more information on what to do if you are driving outside the UK.
Tolls
If you drive on Slovenian motorways, you must buy a “e-vignette”. Slovenia has an e-vignette system, which replaces the previous ‘sticker’ vignette. E-Vignettes are available for weekly, monthly or yearly periods, and can be purchased at petrol stations, post offices and DARs (the Slovenian Motorway Company) offices in Slovenia as well as outlets in neighbouring countries near the Slovene border. The vignette is compulsory for all vehicles under 3.5 tonnes in weight. Instead of a sticker displayed in your windscreen, vignettes are linked to the vehicle registration number plate and the toll system will be enforced through automatic number plate recognition cameras. When buying an e-vignette you will be asked for your vehicle registration number. You will be given a proof of purchase which you should retain for future reference. E-vignettes can also be purchased online at the DARs website including in advance of arrival in Slovenia (it is possible to specify a future start date for the vignette). More information on vignettes is available at the DARs website. If you are purchasing an e-vignette online you should only do so from the official DARs website.
Slovenia has a free-flow electronic tolling system on motorways and expressways for vehicles over 3.5 tonnes, meaning drivers of such vehicles no longer have to stop at toll stations. You’ll need to register your vehicle under the DarsGo system and acquire the DarsGo unit at a DarsGo service point upon entering Slovenia for the first time. You can find more information and registration details on the DarsGo website.
Driving in winter
Winter equipment is mandatory from 15 November until 15 March and whenever there are winter weather conditions (for example, at times of snowfall, blizzards or black ice).
Private cars and vehicles up to 3.5 tonnes must be equipped with winter tyres on all 4 wheels, or summer tyres on all 4 wheels plus snow chains in the car boot. The minimum tyre tread depth must be 3mm. Vehicles over 3.5 tonnes must have winter tyres on the driving wheels or summer tyres on all 4 wheels plus snow chains in the car boot.
You can be fined 125 Euros for not having this equipment, or 417 Euros if you cause a delay on the road for the same reason. The regulations apply to all vehicles. For more information, please see the website of the Automobile Association of Slovenia, under touring information, special regulations.
Driving regulations
By law, you must have your headlights on at all times, while driving in Slovenia. You are also required to carry a reflective jacket, a warning triangle and a first aid kit in the vehicle. If you intend to hire a car and drive it into Slovenia you must declare this to the car hire company first, as you must have adequate car insurance cover.
The police are empowered to impose on-the-spot fines for offences including speeding, driving under the influence of alcohol and for using mobile phones without properly installed wireless headsets (Bluetooth). If you cannot pay the on-the-spot fine the police or authorities can confiscate documents (including but not exclusively a passport or driving licence) or assets until the fine is paid. If after 6 months the fine remains unpaid, confiscated documents will be sent back to the authority that issued them, and assets will be disposed of.
See the European Commission, AA and RAC guides on driving in Slovenia.
Skiing/mountaineering
Ski resorts are open. If you are planning a skiing or mountaineering holiday, contact the Slovenian Tourist Board in the UK (telephone: (+44) (0)207 227 9713) for advice on weather and safety conditions before travelling. Off-piste skiing is highly dangerous. Follow all safety instructions meticulously. There is a danger of avalanches in some areas.
Accommodation
Ljubljana is a small capital city and an increasingly popular destination. You should arrange accommodation before travelling.
