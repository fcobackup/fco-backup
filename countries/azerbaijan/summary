The FCDO advises against all but essential travel to the whole of Azerbaijan based on the current assessment of COVID-19 risks
A ceasefire agreement has been signed between Armenia and Azerbaijan to end the military action in the Nagorno-Karabakh conflict zone. Some territory under Azerbaijani control post-conflict is currently closed to the general public and may contain high numbers of unexploded ordnances (UXOs) and landmines. As part of the agreement a Russian peacekeeping operation has been deployed to the area and will monitor Armenian populated areas of Nagorno-Karabakh and the Lachin Corridor.
Several other civilian areas were affected by the conflict and could also contain UXOs. These areas include, but are not limited to, the towns and rayons of Barda, Tartar, Ganja, Beylagan and Aghjabadi. The Azerbaijani authorities are working to remove UXOs, however if you come across an UXO do not approach it, or touch it. Make a note of where it was spotted, and notify the authorities on 102 or 112. Be aware that there may be more UXOs nearby.

Civilian areas have been hit resulting in deaths and casualties. Anyone who has previously visited areas of Nagorno-Karabakh without the permission of the Azerbaijani authorities will be refused entry to Azerbaijan. See Local travel
