This page has information on travelling to Japan.
This page reflects the UK government’s understanding of current rules for people travelling on a full ‘British Citizen’ passport from the UK, for the most common types of travel.
The authorities in Japan set and enforce entry rules. If you’re unsure how Japan’s entry requirements apply to you, contact its UK embassy, high commission or consulate.
All travellers
The Japanese Ministry of Health, Labour and Welfare, and Ministry of Foreign Affairs websites have further details on the entry requirements for all travellers to Japan (including on ‘Fast Track’ procedures). Rules may be subject to change at short notice.
Due to the COVID-19 pandemic Japan has suspended its visa waiver system and all British Citizen and British National (Overseas) passport holders who do not already hold a valid re-entry permit must obtain a visa by applying in advance. The visa application process for business study or tourism must be initiated by the sponsor in Japan using the Entrants, Returnees Follow-up System ERFS online system and the traveller must then apply to the Japanese Consulate-General for a visa. Note that tourists are allowed to enter from the UK and other ‘blue list’ countries (see below) only in limited circumstances, where they are on package tours and sponsored on (ERFS) by an approved Japanese travel agency. Independent tourism is not permitted. Applications for visas for family reunion visits to family members resident in Japan should be made directly to the Consulate-general and not through EFRS.
You should note that bookings on some flight routes have been restricted or suspended due to COVID-19. Flight length and routing may also be impacted by the current situation in Ukraine.

As part of travelling to Japan, you must:
Complete information on the MySoS app or website, including signing a written pledge to abide by the Japanese rules on self-isolation and other COVID measures and generating a QR code. You will need to show this at check-in and on arrival in Japan. For arrivals after 7 September 2022, there is no longer a requirement to have a COVID-19 test before you fly.
Some airlines may require these documents to be shown before boarding as part of their internal rules.
Japan operates a red, yellow and blue ‘traffic light’ system and testing an isolation on arrival are no longer required for travellers on the ‘blue list’. Travellers from the UK are on the blue list.
Quarantine and other requirements may vary. Further details can be found in the section on vaccination status below, in the Ministry of Health, Labour and Welfare Q&A and on the Ministry of Foreign Affairs website.
Failure to comply with the regulations could lead to detention under the Quarantine Act, the publication of your name and information related to reducing the spread of infection, and possible revocation of your Status of Residence or deportation.
It is illegal to work in Japan without the correct visa, however informal or temporary the work. You shouldn’t overstay your permission to remain in the country, as you risk arrest, detention and a heavy fine.
Vaccination requirements
There is no requirement to be vaccinated in order to enter Japan, however if you cannot prove you are triple-vaccinated with two doses of AstraZeneca, Pfizer or Moderna vaccines (or one of Johnson & Johnson) and an additional booster shot from Pfizer or Moderna, then you will be unable to use the ‘fast track’ MySos system. Note that AstraZeneca is not accepted as a valid booster.
Proof of vaccination status
You can use the UK COVID Pass to demonstrate your vaccination record to the Japanese authorities. Your NHS appointment card from vaccination centres is not designed to be used as proof of vaccination and should not be used to demonstrate your vaccination status. Residents in Japan should obtain a letter from the city or ward office before travelling.
If you’ve had COVID-19 in the past year
Proof of prior infection does not afford exemptions. You must follow the rules and regulations outlined above.
Children and young people
For children under 18, provided they are accompanied by a triple-vaccinated parent (who has received their booster shot) who supervises their activities, they may follow the same rules as their parent even if the child is not fully-vaccinated.
If you’re transiting through Japan
Transiting is when you pass through one country on the way to your final destination.
The COVID-19 regulations and requirements outlined above do not apply to passengers who are transiting through one Japanese airport and do not go through immigration. However, transit may be precluded by airport closures, movement between terminals and delays between arriving and departing flights. Check with your airline whether your connection is feasible before boarding a flight to Japan.
When transiting through Japan, you should comply with any additional screening measures put in place by the authorities. You should also check the latest entry requirements for your final destination.
Exemptions
You should contact your nearest Japanese Embassy for more information on exemptions.
Check your passport and travel documents before you travel
If you are visiting Japan, your passport should be valid for the duration of your stay. No additional period of validity beyond this is required.
Check with your travel provider to make sure your passport and other travel documents meet their requirements.
UK Emergency Travel Documents
UK Emergency Travel Documents are accepted for entry, airside transit and exit from Japan.
Medication
The use or possession of some common prescription and over-the-counter medicines is banned under Japan’s strictly enforced anti-stimulant drugs law. This includes Vicks inhalers, medicines for allergies and sinus problems, cold and flu medication containing Pseudoephedrine and even some over-the-counter painkillers like those containing codeine. Foreign nationals have been detained and deported for offences. You should check the status of your medication with the nearest Japanese Embassy or Consulate before you travel.
If you are travelling with prescription medication that is permitted under Japanese law, you are normally allowed to bring in up to one month’s supply. You are advised to bring a copy of your prescription and a letter from your doctor stating the medical condition that the medication has been prescribed to treat. For more guidance on travelling with medication, check information pages from NHS Choices and the National Travel Health Network and Centre (NaTHNaC) in our foreign travel checklist.
If you need prescription medicine for long-term use, you may need to provide extra paperwork, such as an import licence. The Japanese Ministry of Health, Labour and Welfare website provides information about bringing medication for personal use.
