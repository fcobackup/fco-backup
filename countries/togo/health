Medication
The legal status and regulation of some medicines prescribed or bought in the UK can be different in other countries.
Read best practice when travelling with medicines on TravelHealthPro.
You’ll need to go to a pharmacy to buy most over-the-counter medicines. They are not sold in supermarkets in Togo. Where possible, buy known brands. Pharmacies are widely available and are usually identified by a green cross. They will usually accept prescriptions from the UK.
Healthcare in Togo
Medical facilities are poor. Emergency facilities are extremely limited. For serious medical treatment, medical evacuation may be necessary.
Make sure you have adequate travel health insurance and accessible funds to cover the cost of any medical treatment abroad and repatriation.
