The Foreign, Commonwealth & Development Office (FCDO) advises against all non-essential travel to:
Lithuania, based on the current assessment of COVID-19 risks in the country.
If you are returning to the UK from Lithuania, you will need to self-isolate on your return (unless you are exempt). Check the latest guidance for England, Northern Ireland, Scotland and Wales.
Travel may be subject to entry restrictions
Lithuania lifted the ban on flights from the UK on 1 January 2021. You should check with your travel company for the latest information on their services.
British nationals travelling to Lithuania from the UK are required to self-isolate for 10 days or provide evidence of a negative COVID-19 PCR test result, taken no earlier than 48 hours before arrival in Lithuania. If you arrive without a negative PCR test result, you can register for a PCR test at any point during the 10 day isolation period and leave isolation as soon as you receive a negative result.
Failure to comply with isolation requirements could result in a fine of between 60 and 1,500 Euros. Check our advice on things to consider, and be prepared to stay overseas longer than planned.
British nationals may leave Lithuania before the end of their isolation period in order to return to the UK/their country of residence.
On 16 December, Lithuania entered a nationwide lockdown. Movement within Lithuania will be restricted.
See Entry requirements for more information before you plan to travel.
