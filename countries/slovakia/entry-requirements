This information is for people travelling on a full ‘British citizen’ passport from the UK. It is based on the UK government’s understanding of Slovakia’s current rules for the most common types of travel. 
The authorities in Slovakia set and enforce entry rules. If you’re not sure how these requirements apply to you, contact the Slovak Embassy in the UK.
Passport validity requirements
Slovakia follows Schengen area rules. Your passport must: 
have a ‘date of issue’ less than 10 years before the date you arrive – if you renewed your passport before 1 October 2018, it may have a date of issue that is more than 10 years ago
have an ‘expiry date’ at least 3 months after the day you plan to leave the Schengen area (the expiry date does not need to be within 10 years of the date of issue)
Check with your travel provider that your passport and other travel documents meet requirements. Renew your passport if you need to.  
You will be denied entry if you do not have a valid travel document or try to use a passport that has been reported lost or stolen.
Visa requirements
You can travel without a visa to the Schengen area, which includes Slovakia, for up to 90 days in any 180-day period. This applies if you travel:
as a tourist
to visit family or friends
to attend business meetings, cultural or sports events
for short-term studies or training
If you’re travelling to other Schengen countries as well, make sure your whole visit is within the 90-day limit. Visits to Schengen countries in the 180 days before you travel count towards your 90 days.
Staying longer than 90 days in a 180-day period  
To stay longer, to work or study, for business travel or for other reasons, you must meet the local foreigner residence requirements and the recent changes to this made on 1 July 2025.
If you’re in Slovakia with a residence permit or long-stay visa, this does not count towards your 90-day visa-free limit. 
You could get a fine of up to 1,600 euros if you stay longer than legally allowed.    
Read about passport stamping if you live in Slovakia.
Make sure you get your passport stamped on entry and exit.
If you’re a visitor, border guards will look at your entry and exit stamps to check you have not overstayed the 90-day visa-free limit for the Schengen area. 
If your passport is missing a stamp, show evidence of when and where you entered or left the Schengen area (for example, boarding passes or tickets) and ask the border guards to add the date and location in your passport. 
At border control in Slovakia, you may also need to:
show a return or onward ticket
prove you have enough money for your stay
show proof of your accommodation, for example, a hotel booking confirmation or proof of address for a second home
New Schengen entry requirements
The EU’s Entry/Exit System (EES) is expected to start in October 2025. It is not currently in operation. The European Union will inform about the specific start date of the EES before its launch.
Read more information on the EU Entry/Exit System.
Registering with the police
As a visitor to Slovakia, you must report where you are staying to the nearest Foreigners Police Department. If you stay at a hotel, the hotel will do this for you. If you are in private accommodation, you must notify the police by letter, email or in person within 3 working days of your arrival.
If you plan to stay in Slovakia for a longer period, you must apply for a residence permit.
Customs rules
There are strict rules about goods you can take into or out of Slovakia. You must declare anything that may be prohibited or subject to tax or duty.
Taking food into Slovakia
You cannot take meat, milk or products containing them into EU countries. There are some exceptions such as powdered baby milk, baby food and special foods or pet feed required for medical reasons.
Taking money into Slovakia
Declare cash or travellers cheques if the value is 10,000 euros or more. You will get a certified declaration to show you brought it in with you. If you do not, your money could be seized when you leave.
