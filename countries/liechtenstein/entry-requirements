This page has information on travelling to Liechtenstein.
This page reflects the UK government’s understanding of current rules for people travelling on a full ‘British Citizen’ passport from the UK, for the most common types of travel.
The authorities in Liechtenstein set and enforce entry rules. If you’re unsure how Liechtenstein’s entry requirements apply to you, contact its UK embassy, high commission or consulate.
All travellers
Switzerland handles immigration and customs matters for Liechtenstein. Entry requirements for all travellers are the same as for Switzerland. There is an open border between Switzerland and Liechtenstein. The Swiss Embassy in London handles consular issues on behalf of Liechtenstein in the UK.
It is no longer necessary to provide proof of vaccination, recovery or a negative test or complete an entry form to enter Liechtenstein.
Further information is available on the Swiss Federal Office of Public Health and State Secretariat for Migration websites.

Check your passport and travel documents before you travel
Passport validity
If you are planning to travel to an EU country (except Ireland), or Switzerland, Norway, Iceland, Liechtenstein, Andorra, Monaco, San Marino or Vatican City, you must follow the Schengen area passport requirements.
Your passport must be:
issued less than 10 years before the date you enter the country (check the ‘date of issue’)
valid for at least 3 months after the day you plan to leave (check the ‘expiry date’)
You must check your passport meets these requirements before you travel. If your passport was issued before 1 October 2018, extra months may have been added to its expiry date.
Contact the embassy of the country you are visiting if you think that your passport does not meet both these requirements. Renew your passport if you need to.
Visas
You can travel to countries in the Schengen area for up to 90 days in any 180-day period without a visa. This applies if you travel as a tourist, to visit family or friends, to attend business meetings, cultural or sports events, or for short-term studies or training.
If you are travelling to Liechtenstein and other Schengen countries without a visa, make sure your whole visit is within the 90-day limit. Visits to Schengen countries within the previous 180 days before you travel count towards your 90 days.
To stay longer, to work or study, for business travel or for other reasons, you will need to meet the Liechtenstein government’s entry requirements. Check with the Swiss Embassy in London what type of visa and/or work permit you may need.
If you are travelling to Liechtenstein for work, read the guidance on visas and permits. You can get detailed information on employment regulations from the Migration and Passport Office (in German).
If you stay in Liechtenstein with a residence permit or long-stay visa, this does not count towards your 90-day visa-free limit.
Passport stamping
Check your passport is stamped if you enter or exit the Schengen area through Liechtenstein as a visitor. Border guards will use passport stamps to check you’re complying with the 90-day visa-free limit for short stays in the Schengen area. If relevant entry or exit stamps are not in your passport, border guards will presume that you have overstayed your visa-free limit.
You can show evidence of when and where you entered or exited the Schengen area, and ask the border guards to add this date and location in your passport. Examples of acceptable evidence include boarding passes and tickets.
You may also need to:
show a return or onward ticket
show you have enough money for your stay
If you are resident in Liechtenstein, read our Living in Liechtenstein guide for passport stamping information.
