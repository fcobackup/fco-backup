There are still commercial options to return to the UK from Switzerland.
If you live in the UK and are currently visiting Switzerland, you’re strongly advised to return now by commercial means. Don’t risk getting stranded.
UK special charter flights will only operate for priority countries where commercial flights are not possible. You should not assume that these flights will become available in Switzerland because commercial routes are operating. Do not contact the contracted travel management company if no flight is advertised here.
If you’re trying to get back to the UK and need financial help, see the FCO’s guide on financial assistance.
Flights
SWISS and Edelweiss are operating direct commercial flights to the UK. Flights to London are available from Zurich and Geneva. Flights to Edinburgh, Manchester and Dublin are available from Zurich.
You should check the carrier’s website for the latest flight schedule and availability.
Transit
If you are transiting Switzerland from elsewhere in the world, you are strongly advised to have your onward travel booked in advance.
You should also check the travel advice for any country that you will transit on the way back to the UK.
Travelling to the airport
Rail
Swiss Federal Railways (SBB / CFF/ FFS) are operating standard timetables, including to airports. The Swiss Government strongly recommends wearing face masks when travelling on public transport, if it is not possible to maintain a distance of 1.5 metres from other travellers.
International rail services from Switzerland to neighbouring countries have been suspended until further notice. You may be able to take cross-border regional connections as an alternative.
Road
If you plan to return to the UK by road, it is possible to transit through neighbouring countries.
Travel via France
If you are planning on travelling through France to return to the UK, the French government have implemented their own measures and you should check the latest travel advice for France ahead of your journey.
As with other forms of transport, many cross-Channel operators are operating substantially reduced services for passenger traffic. Passengers should check with their operator before departing, and may still be subject to severe disruption.
Future travel options
You will need to pay for your return travel to the UK. If departure options are available but you cannot afford the travel costs and have exhausted all other options for getting funds, you may be eligible to apply for an emergency loan from the government. This is a last resort option and you would need to repay the loan when you are back in the UK.
For more information, you should contact Corporate Travel Management (CTM). CTM are a commercial partner of the FCO and are authorised to administer such loans on behalf of the FCO.
Your journey home: re-entering the UK
When you return, you must follow the rules for entering the UK. You:
need to provide your journey and contact details up to 48 hours before you’re due to arrive in the UK
are not allowed to leave the place you’re staying for the first 14 days you’re in the UK except in very limited situations (known as ‘self-isolating’)
See also the list of people who are exempt from the border rules.
The National Travel Health Network and Centre (NaTHNaC) also provides advice on how to stay safe as you travel by air.
