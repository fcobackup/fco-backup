The FCDO advises against all but essential travel to:
the whole of Botswana based on the current assessment of COVID-19 risks.
Travel to Botswana is subject to entry restrictions
Entry to Botswana is open only to Botswana nationals and foreign nationals with valid residency permits.
Those eligible for entry will be subject to a 14-day mandatory quarantine period in government facilities at their own expense and compulsory COVID-19 testing.
See Entry requirements for more information before you plan to travel.

During the COVID-19 pandemic, it is more important than ever to get travel insurance and check it provides sufficient cover. See the FCDO’s guidance on foreign travel insurance.
Around 42,000 British nationals visit Botswana every year. Most visits are trouble free.
Wildlife and livestock on roads are a hazard, particularly at night. See Road travel
Carry some form of identification with you at all times. A photocopy of your passport is sufficient.
Attacks on tourists are rare, but you should take sensible precautions to protect yourself from petty and violent crime. See Crime
Although there’s no recent history of terrorism in Botswana, attacks can’t be ruled out. See Terrorism
If you’re abroad and you need emergency help from the UK government, contact the nearest British embassy, consulate or high commission.
