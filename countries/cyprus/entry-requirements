The information on this page covers the most common types of travel and reflects the UK government’s understanding of the rules currently in place. Unless otherwise stated, this information is for travellers using a full ‘British Citizen’ passport.
The authorities in the country or territory you’re travelling to are responsible for setting and enforcing the rules for entry. If you’re unclear about any aspect of the entry requirements, or you need further reassurance, you’ll need to contact the embassy, high commission or consulate of the country or territory you’re travelling to.
You should also consider checking with your transport provider or travel company to make sure your passport and other travel documents meet their requirements.
Passport validity
Your passport should be valid for the proposed duration of your stay in Cyprus; you don’t need any additional period of validity on your passport beyond this.
However, if you’re travelling to the north of Cyprus, their administration advises that your passport should be valid for at least 6 months from your date of entry to the north.
UK Emergency Travel Documents
UK Emergency Travel Documents are accepted for entry, airside transit and exit from Cyprus.
Visas
You don’t need a visa to enter Cyprus. If you intend to stay for longer than 3 months, you should check entry requirements with the Republic of Cyprus High Commission in London.
Travelling with Children
See this leaflet on travelling with children produced by the British High Commission in Nicosia.
