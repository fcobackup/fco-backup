This page reflects the UK government’s understanding of current rules for people travelling on a full ‘British Citizen’ passport, for the most common types of travel.
The authorities in New Caledonia set and enforce entry rules. For further information contact the embassy, high commission or consulate of the country or territory you’re travelling to. You should also consider checking with your transport provider or travel company to make sure your passport and other travel documents meet their requirements.
Restrictions in response to coronavirus
Only travellers who can prove that entry is for essential reasons will be allowed to enter, and they will be expected to fill in a travel certificate or ‘attestation’ and provide proof.
All travellers over the age of 11 must undertake a test for COVID-19 within 72 hours before departure for their destination. The test is obligatory and the traveller must show proof of a negative result before embarking.
Travellers may also need to produce a self-certified document affirming that they have no COVID symptoms and that to their knowledge they have not been in contact with any person confirmed positive within the last 14 days. Most travellers will be required to complete 14 days of quarantine in a hotel requisitioned by the government.
You should check with your travel operator and the New Caledonian government’s website ahead of travel.
These entry requirements are subject to change. For further information on the entry restrictions in place for French Overseas Territories, see the French government’s website before travelling.

Visas
