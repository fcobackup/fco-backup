The information on this page covers the most common types of travel and reflects the UK government’s understanding of the rules currently in place. Unless otherwise stated, this information is for travellers using a full ‘British Citizen’ passport.
The authorities in the country or territory you’re travelling to are responsible for setting and enforcing the rules for entry. If you’re unclear about any aspect of the entry requirements, or you need further reassurance, you’ll need to contact the embassy, high commission or consulate of the country or territory you’re travelling to.
You should also consider checking with your transport provider or travel company to make sure your passport and other travel documents meet their requirements.
Passport validity
Your passport should be valid for the proposed duration of your stay; you don’t need any additional period of validity on your passport beyond this.
Visas
If your passport describes you as a British Citizen, you don’t need a visa to enter Luxembourg. Other British passport holders should check the current entry requirements with the Embassy of Luxembourg.
You can stay in Luxembourg for up to 90 days as long as you have a valid identity card or passport.
If you plan to stay in Luxembourg for more than 90 days, you must make a declaration of arrival (déclaration d’arrivée) at the Municipal Office in your locality within 8 days. Within 3 months of arrival, you must get an address registration certificate (attestation d’enregistrement) from the Municipal Office.
UK Emergency Travel Documents
UK Emergency Travel Documents are accepted for entry and exit from Luxembourg.
