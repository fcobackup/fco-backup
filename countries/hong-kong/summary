In recent weeks, several large-scale political demonstrations have taken place throughout Hong Kong. Unauthorised protests have become more frequent and widespread, affecting many areas across Hong Kong, including some areas popular with tourists on Hong Kong Island, in Kowloon and on Lantau Island (where Hong Kong International Airport is located). Clashes have taken place between police and protesters following otherwise peaceful protest activities. These have involved significant violence. Reports indicate protests are likely to continue, including:
a protest on the evening of Friday 6 September at Chater Garden in Central
potential disruption to traffic to and from Hong Kong International Airport on Saturday 7 September. Passengers should allow extra time to travel to the airport.
You should be prepared that the situation around protests and public gatherings could change quickly, with the potential for significant violence, especially during unauthorised protests. Protests can deviate from planned routes or rally locations and spill over into nearby public spaces, such as shopping centres, housing estates and metro (MTR) stations. Unauthorised protests have been met by a more rapid and severe police response, including heavy use of tear gas, bean bag rounds and “sponge grenades”. Police have also deployed water cannon and, occasionally, rubber bullets.
If you’re in and around areas where any demonstrations are taking place, you should remain vigilant, follow the advice of local authorities and move away quickly to a safe place if there are signs of disorder.
Demonstrations may lead to sections of the city being closed off and significant disruption to transport. During recent protests, local buses, MTR and Airport Express services and the Hong Kong Macao Ferry Terminal have temporarily suspended operations without warning. Hundreds of flights were cancelled at Hong Kong International Airport on 12 and 13 August due to protests and violent clashes in the terminal buildings. Further disruption is possible if protests return to the airport or its transport links. If you’re due to travel, check your flight status regularly on the airport website, keep up to date with the latest developments via local media and consider allowing extra time to travel to the airport and complete check-in procedures.
In light of ongoing protests and demonstrations in Hong Kong, there are reports of greater scrutiny from mainland authorities at border crossings between the mainland and Hong Kong. This includes reports that travellers’ electronic devices have been checked at border crossings. You should be aware that the thresholds for detention and prosecution in China differ from those in Hong Kong.
