Moving around in Slovenia
For information on entering Slovenia, see Entry Requirements
The Slovene government has implemented measures to restrict the spread of coronavirus. Further measures may follow at short notice.
The Slovene government has introduced restrictions on “non-essential services”, including tourist and visitor accommodation. Grocery stores, pharmacies, banks, post offices, petrol stations, newsstands and stores selling agricultural products remain open. Libraries, galleries, insurance companies and estate agents are permitted to open.
Protective masks (or other material covering the nose and mouth) must be worn in indoor public areas, including shops.
Restaurants and bars are permitted to open, if they are able to serve customers outside their venues, whilst observing social distancing requirements.
From 11 May, public transport (buses and trains) will gradually resume service. You are required to wear a protective mask, sanitise your hands with the supplied hand cleaner and maintain a safety distance of at least 1.5m.
Wherever possible, tickets should be bought in advance (online, ticket machines and at sales counters). Taxi services continue to be available. The Slovene government have enacted additional measures to stem the spread of coronavirus.
These include temporary banning of public gatherings. You must respect social distancing requirements at all times.
The Slovene government provides English-language coronavirus guidance and updates.

Finance
There is a range of financial support from the government that you can access while you are unable to return due to coronavirus restrictions.
If you’re in Slovenia, and have exhausted all other options to cover essential living costs while you wait to return home, you could apply for an emergency loan for your living costs from the UK government. You can only apply if you normally live in the UK and you cannot return home. This last-resort option is for those most in need, and you would need to repay the loan when you are back in the UK. Apply for an emergency loan.
