The Law on Safeguarding National Security (NSL) entered into force in Macao in March 2009 and was further amended in May 2023. This law includes offences of treason, secession and subversion against the Central Government, as well as “preparatory acts” leading to any of the three acts. Under the NSL, an individual may face criminal proceedings if they engage in activities that are deemed to endanger national security in Macao. This could apply to activities both inside and outside of the Macao SAR, which in practice could include activities conducted in the UK.
The Legal Regime for the Interception and Protection of Communications (enabling the judicial police in Macao to collect evidence via telecommunications and social media) came into effect in August 2022.
Do not become involved with drugs of any kind. Possession of drugs can lead to imprisonment.
Do not take photographs of military installations.

The Macao authorities consider the taxi service Uber to be illegal, and the Macao Police has recently been taking enforcement action against both the drivers and passengers of unlicensed taxi services, including Uber.
