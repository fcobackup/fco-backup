Road travel
From 1st January 2022, you will be able to exchange your UK driving licence for a Taiwan driving license at your nearest Motor Vehicles Office under the provisions of a new Licence Exchange Arrangement between the UK and Taiwan.
From 1st January 2022 there will be three options for holders of a UK driving licence to drive in Taiwan. You may wish to compare each option to decide which route is more appropriate to your personal needs and circumstances.
Please visit our Living in Taiwan page for application guidance and FAQs. Before 1st January 2022, to drive in Taiwan you will need to get an International Driving Permit (IDP). You can get the IDP over the counter from 2,500 UK Post Offices. You will not be able to buy an IDP outside the UK, so get one before you travel. Once in Taiwan, you will need to take your passport, IDP and a passport photograph to the nearest Vehicle Registration Department and apply for a driver’s licence visa, which will then be secured in your IDP.
If you’re staying in Taiwan longer term and wish to drive, you may need to get a local driving licence in order to comply with local laws and regulations. Until the new License Exchange Arrangement comes into effect on 1st January 2022, , it’s not possible to exchange a UK driving licence for a local driving licence. Do not drive a vehicle without a valid licence.
The alcohol limit for drivers in Taiwan is lower than in the UK. The current legal limit is 0.15 micrograms of alcohol per 1000 millilitres of breath or 0.03% blood alcohol concentration (BAC). Driving while over the limit can result in heavy fines and imprisonment. Passengers may also be fined.
Be alert crossing roads, even on protected crossings.
Advance fee frauds
Individuals and companies in the UK (and elsewhere) often receive letters, faxes and e-mails, offering them large sums of money provided they send various ‘advance fees’ to Taiwanese bank accounts. Fraudsters obtain contact details from telephone or commercial directories, so recipients are not being specifically targeted.
The National Crime Agency (NCA) investigates advance fee frauds in the UK. Do not reply to these types of communication. The NCA website contains more information on this type of fraud.
Consular assistance
The UK does not have diplomatic relations with Taiwan. The British Assistance and Services Section of the British Office Taipei can provide certain limited consular assistance. In cases of genuine emergency, the British Office may be able to issue you with an emergency travel document.
