International travel
Travel restrictions have been put in place on travellers arriving in the UK from South Africa. British and Irish citizens, and third country nationals with residence rights in the UK, are allowed to enter the UK but must follow rules for people arriving from red-listed countries. The following categories are also still permitted to enter the UK from South Africa, subject to quarantine and immigration controls:
Holders of Indefinite Leave to Remain
Holders of existing leave to enter or remain (i.e. those with a valid Biometric Residence Permit) or an entry clearance/visa that grants such leave, e.g. students, workers, etc (excluding visit visas)
Holders of EU Settlement Scheme (“EUSS”) status
Those with a valid pending EUSS application (evidenced by a certificate of application) – those who have applied as a joining family member must also hold a UK-issued Biometric Residence Card, an EUSS Family Permit or an EEA Family Permit, even if this document has since expired
Holders of an EUSS Family Permit or an EUSS Travel Permit
Holders of a Frontier Worker Permit
Those who are transiting through England
Those exempt from immigration control
Those who have transited South Africa without entering the country
Other travellers are likely to be denied entry if they have been in South Africa within the past 10 day, unless there are compelling or compassionate reasons for your journey or you are covered by a relevant exemption under the health regulations governing travel to the UK.
You should check the Gov.uk website for further guidance about restrictions for people travelling from red-list countries.
Some third countries have placed additional entry restrictions on people travelling from South Africa. If you are travelling from South Africa, you should check the entry requirements published by your destination country to make sure you understand any specific restrictions. Airline schedules may change at short notice, and airlines may have additional requirements in place, for example specifying the type of face mask that must be worn on board. If you have a flight booked, you should read their requirements in detail and check with your airline before travelling.
PCR (polymerase chain reaction) COVID-19 tests are widely available from private medical facilities and some chemists in South Africa. If you need help finding a COVID-19 PCR test provider you should call The National Institute for Communicable Diseases helpline of (+27) 0800 029 999 for advice on possible testing facilities.
Entry and borders
There are additional entry requirements in place during the coronavirus pandemic. See Entry requirements to find out what you will need to do before and when you arrive in South Africa.
Returning to the UK
Travelling from and returning to the UK
Check what you must do to travel abroad and return to England, Scotland, Wales or Northern Ireland.
If you plan to pass through another country to return to the UK, check the travel advice for the country you’re transiting. If you will pass through a red list country, book your hotel quarantine package before travelling to the UK.
You are responsible for organising your own COVID-19 test, in line with any UK government testing requirements. You should contact local authorities for information on testing facilities. See International travel for further information.
Be prepared for your plans to change
No travel is risk-free during COVID. Countries may further restrict travel or bring in new rules at short notice, for example due to a new COVID-19 variant. Check with your travel company or airline for any transport changes which may delay your journey home.
Plan ahead and make sure you:
can access money
understand what your insurance will cover
can make arrangements to extend your stay and be away for longer than planned
If you think you have COVID-19 symptoms, you should contact your health insurer for advice. You should also call the South African government local emergency hotline (0800029 999) or consult the online advice. South Africa’s detailed guidance on coronavirus testing, self-isolation and contact tracing can be found on their dedicated website, https://sacoronavirus.co.za/.

Travel in South Africa
Internal flights are operating. You are required to wear a face mask on flights.
Public transport is operating with reduced passenger numbers. You must wear a face mask if using public transport.
Children aged six years or younger are not required to wear a face mask.
Failure to comply with South African government regulations could result in a fine or arrest.
Accommodation
Hotels, guest houses and private rental accommodation are open, with protective measures in place. Upon arrival at your accommodation, you will normally be subject to a temperature test and asked to complete a health questionnaire. Some accommodation providers will request your travel history. You should contact your accommodation provider for more information.
Public spaces and services
The South African authorities have published COVID-19 guidelines and advice and have introduced a number of measures to limit the spread of the virus. Failure to comply could result in a fine or arrest.
South Africa has introduced a risk-based, five-level approach to lockdown restrictions. Level one restrictions are currently in place across the country.
National restrictions
Level one lockdown restrictions are in place across the country. There is a curfew between midnight and 4am. All non-essential businesses are required to close by 11pm. You are legally required to wear a face mask when in public and may face a fine or imprisonment for breaking this rule. You should ensure you are in your accommodation before the curfew begins. Road blocks are used to enforce curfew in some places. International travel is permitted subject to COVID-19 precautions.
You should comply with the regulations set out by the South African government.
Healthcare in South Africa
If you take regular medication, make sure you can access a repeat prescription if you need to. Most medicines that require a prescription from a doctor in the UK will require a script in South Africa (‘script’ is the widely used term in South Africa for ‘prescription’). If you need a prescription in advance, you can visit a local doctor. The doctor might prescribe on the basis of your visit, or they may ask you to obtain an electronic prescription from your medical practitioner in the UK to allow them to write a script. Pharmacies are readily available, with larger pharmacy groups Dis-Chem and Clicks having stores across the country. Some (but not all) of these stores have medical practitioners on site who can write prescriptions.
Most medical practitioners speak English, particularly in major cities and tourist areas. Visit our list of doctors.
If you think you have COVID-19 symptoms, you should contact your health insurer for advice. You can also call the South African government local emergency hotline (0800029 999) or consult the online advice. There is more information about what to expect if you test positive for COVID-19 under the Coronavirussection.
