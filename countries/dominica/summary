Hurricane Maria passed over Dominica on 19 September 2017, causing widespread damage to communications, buildings and infrastructure. Life in Dominica continues to return to a state of normality. Mains water has been restored to 85% of the population, and bottled water and communal tanks are available. Electricity has been restored to Roseau and Portsmouth, and for all essential services.
Local communications and access are improving, and public and private sector businesses have reopened. All main roads in Dominica have been cleared, although heightened care is needed when navigating some roads affected by the hurricane.
Commercial flights are operating from the airport and ferry options are also available. While many hotels have reopened, and the number of serviceable rooms continues to increase, demand remains high, so if you’re considering travelling to Dominica, you should make firm arrangements for accommodation in advance.
If you’re in Dominica, you should continue to exercise caution and follow the advice of the local authorities.
