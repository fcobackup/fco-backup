Travel in Turkey
A reduced schedule of domestic flights has been operating since 4 June.
Train services between (Ankara-Konya, Ankara-Istanbul, Ankara-Eskisehir and Konya-Istanbul) are operating on a reduced timetable. Inter-city coach services are operating on a reduced schedule. Check with travel providers before booking.
Anyone wishing to undertake intercity travel using public transport is required to obtain an “HES” (“Hayat Eve Sığar”) code. This can be done through the e-Devlet system, the ‘Hayat Eve Sığar’ smartphone application and by SMS.
Non-Turkish nationals with a domestic flight connecting to/from an international flight which is booked on the same ticket, do not currently require an HES code. Where a domestic flight is booked separately or with a different airline, an HES code is required.
For international travel, Turkish nationals are required to obtain an HES code, however this does not apply to non-Turkish nationals, including British visitors to Turkey.
For intercity travel, British nationals without a residence card can obtain a HES code by sending their passport details by SMS to 2023 in the following format: HES [space] Nationality (GBR) [space] passport number [space] year of birth [space] surname. Example: HES GBR 123456789 1980 SMITH. You will need to use the passport which you entered Turkey on, and the SMS message must be sent from a mobile phone registered on a Turkish mobile network.
If you are over 65, and a visitor to Turkey, you no longer require a permit to travel between cities. A permit is still required if you are a Turkish resident and you must remain at your destination for a minimum of 30 days unless travelling for an international flight. Individuals under 18 no longer require a permit to either travel within the same city, or undertake intercity travel. When travelling they must, however, be accompanied by a parent or guardian, aged below 65 years of age.

Given the lifting of this restriction for visitors, we will no longer be providing supporting letters for travel permits.
