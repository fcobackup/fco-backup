Réunion is a French Overseas Territory. There is no formal British diplomatic representation on the island. If you need consular assistance you should contact the British Embassy in Paris.
The French government have confirmed that individuals will need to complete a travel certificate to enter the French Overseas Territories. They will also be subject to a health check upon arrival, which may result in a period of quarantine for the individual concerned. Like mainland France, individuals travelling within or transiting through French Overseas Territories will also need to carry an attestation certifying the reason for travel.
On 8 April 2020, French authorities introduced a requirement to complete a travel certificate to enter the Overseas Territories. Depending on your point of departure, you should complete a Trip from Mainland France to French overseas territories or an International travel from abroad to French overseas territories travel certificate, which is listed on the French Ministry of Interior webpage. This travel certificate should be completed before departing for France Overseas Territories, in order to be shown to French border authorities on entry and, where appropriate, transportation companies prior to boarding. If you are travelling from the French Overseas Territories to mainland France, you will need to complete a separate travel certificate; please see France Travel Advice.
In order to travel within or to transit through French Overseas Territories, you should complete an Attestation de déplacement dérogatoire to certify your reason for travel. You can carry a physical copy or an electronic version of this “attestation” (declaration). This declaration should be completed before starting your journey. For French Overseas Territories, this declaration does not replace the requirement for an travel certificate, detailed above. Further information, including links to both these documents, is available on the Ministry of Interior webpage.
The French Government outlined new measures on 16 March 2020 to stem the spread of coronavirus, which also apply to the French Overseas Territories.

On 27 March 2020, the French government extended the confinement period for at least a further two weeks, until 15 April. The local Prefecture website will have details of any further local restriction. Please see the Travel Advice for France for more information on Covid-19.
