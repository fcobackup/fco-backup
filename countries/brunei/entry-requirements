The information on this page covers the most common types of travel and reflects the UK government’s understanding of the rules currently in place. Unless otherwise stated, this information is for travellers using a full ‘British Citizen’ passport.
The authorities in the country or territory you’re travelling to are responsible for setting and enforcing the rules for entry. If you’re unclear about any aspect of the entry requirements, or you need further reassurance, you’ll need to contact the embassy, high commission or consulate of the country or territory you’re travelling to.
You should also consider checking with your transport provider or travel company to make sure your passport and other travel documents meet their requirements.
Visas
British citizens may enter Brunei for up to 90 days without a visa. Those with other types of British nationality should check with Brunei immigration authorities about visa requirements. Those who overstay their visa face strict penalties. Make sure the entry stamp in your passport indicates the validity of your stay. Visas for longer stays or for non-tourist purposes must be obtained from the nearest Brunei diplomatic mission before you travel.
Passport validity  
Your passport should be valid for a minimum period of 6 months from the date of entry into Brunei. 
Departure tax
A departure tax (five Brunei Dollars for travel to Indonesia, Malaysia and Philippines and 12 Brunei Dollars for all other destinations) is payable in local currency at the airport check in desk on departure from Brunei International Airport.
Dual nationality
Brunei does not recognise dual nationality. You can be refused entry if you are found to be holding two passports of different nationality. If you are a dual national, it is advisable to enter Brunei on the passport on which you exited your last country of departure. While in Brunei your nationality will be deemed to be that shown on the passport which you used to enter the country. This may affect the consular assistance that you receive in Brunei.
