There are no confirmed cases of coronavirus (COVID-19) in Lesotho. However, the authorities have introduced a number of precautionary measures in response to the coronavirus pandemic. These include wearing face masks anytime you are outside your place of residence. See Coronavirus
Given the rapidly changing situation in the region we are temporarily withdrawing a limited number of UK staff and their dependents. The British High Commission in Lesotho will continue to carry out essential work. The British High Commission in Pretoria provides consular support to British nationals in Lesotho. If you are in Lesotho and need urgent help from the UK Government call +27 12 421 7500. If you are in the UK and worried about a British national in Lesotho call 020 7008 1500.
Visitors to Lesotho must travel or transit via South Africa. South Africa has put in place travel restrictions on individuals from countries affected by coronavirus (COVID-19), including the United Kingdom and has closed its airspace to commercial airlines. Follow our travel advice for South Africa and consult your nearest South African High Commission. See Return to the UK.
Most visits to Lesotho are trouble free.
There are ongoing political tensions and occasional spontaneous political demonstrations in Maseru. On 18 April, the military were briefly deployed in Maseru. You should avoid demonstrations, rallies and large public gatherings and stay at home if there is any unusual activity by the security forces.
There is often an increase in criminal activity, especially property crimes, leading up to the holiday season. Take extra care and be vigilant during this period. See Crime
Although there is no recent history of terrorism in Lesotho, attacks canâ€™t be ruled out. See Terrorism
