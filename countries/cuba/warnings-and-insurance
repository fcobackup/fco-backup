Nationwide power outage
Cuba is experiencing a nationwide electrical grid shutdown following the failure of a major power plant on 10 September. The authorities are working to restore the grid but this is likely to be a gradual process.
There continues to be lengthy electricity outages across the country. Emergency services are expected to continue operating but there are likely to be internet and mobile outages.
You should take precautions such as conserving fuel, water, food and mobile phone charge, particularly if travelling outside Havana. Transport may be affected due to fuel shortages and the inability to refuel during power outages. Ensure you have enough fuel before setting off on your journey.
