The FCDO advises against all but essential travel to:
the whole of Slovakia based on the current assessment of COVID-19 risks.
If you are returning to the UK from Slovakia, you will need to self-isolate on your return (unless you are exempt). Check the latest guidance for England, Northern Ireland, Scotland and Wales.
Travellers should follow the advice of the local authorities on how best to protect themselves and others, including any measures that they bring in to control the virus. See Coronavirus
Travel to Slovakia is currently subject to entry restrictions
Slovakia has announced that from 00:01 22 December, direct passenger flights from the UK will be suspended for an initial period of 72 hours.
If you decide to travel to Slovakia, you must register in advance with the Slovak Public Health Authority, enter self-isolation on arrival and take a RT-PCR test for COVID-19 no earlier than 5 days after arrival.
If you have spent the previous 14 days solely in an EU or EEA country or Switzerland, you are exempt from the above requirement if you can show a negative test result no older than 72 hours. This can be either an RT-PCR test from a laboratory outside Slovakia, or an Antigen test from Austria or the Czech Republic.
See Entry requirements for more information before you plan to travel.
