This page reflects the UK government’s understanding of current rules for people travelling on a full ‘British Citizen’ passport, for the most common types of travel.
The authorities in Greece set and enforce entry rules. For further information contact their embassy, high commission or consulate. You may also check with your transport provider or travel company to make sure your passport and travel documents meet their requirements.
If you are travelling to Greece for work, read the guidance on visas and permits as the rules have changed since 1 January 2021.
Entry rules in response to coronavirus (COVID-19)
Entry to Greece
If you’re travelling from the UK, you will need:
To have completed a Passenger Locator Form (PLF) before arrival in Greece. The form is required regardless of the means of transport you use to travel to Greece (including by ferry, road, rail or air);
You will also need one of the following:
Proof of a negative COVID-19 PCR test, undertaken within the 72 hour period before arrival into Greece; or
Proof of a negative COVID-19 rapid antigen test from an authorised laboratory, undertaken within the 48 hour period before your arrival into Greece; or
Proof of being fully vaccinated against COVID-19 at least 14 days before travel (see Demonstrating your COVID-19 status);
Greece will also accept proof of recovery from COVID-19 for entry purposes. Evidence of a positive COVID-19 PCR test result taken between 30 to 180 days of your travel dates can be used and can be demonstrated via the NHS COVID Pass.
These requirements are compulsory for all travellers above the age of 12. In addition, arrivals into Greece may be required to undergo a rapid COVID-19 test on arrival. If you test positive on arrival in Greece, you (and those you are travelling with) will have to self-isolate in quarantine hotels provided by the Greek state. The length of time you need to self-isolate depends on your vaccination status. See ‘Coronavirus’ page for details of what to do if you test positive for COVID-19 while in Greece. You should also be aware that if other passengers on your flight, bus, train or ferry later test positive, you may be subject to self-isolation requirements. These will be mandatory and you should comply with the Greek authorities’ requirements.
Check Greek authorities’ advice for further information, including guidance on filling out the Passenger Locator Form and the latest list of countries from which travel to Greece is permitted.
Additionally, further to discovery of the omicron variant, if you are travelling from Botswana, Eswatini, Lesotho, Malawi, Mozambique, Namibia, South Africa, Zambia, and Zimbabwe, you will only be allowed to enter Greece for essential reasons, and if you:
Present a negative PCR test taken within 72 hours of arrival;
Secure approval from the Greek Embassy/Consulate in (or that covers) the country you are travelling from.
Additionally you will have to take a rapid test on arrival, and complete 10 days compulsory quarantine, which will conclude upon completion of a further PCR test (with a negative result).
Demonstrating your COVID-19 status
Greece will accept the UK’s proof of COVID-19 recovery and vaccination record and proof of COVID-19 vaccination issued in the Crown Dependencies. Your final vaccine dose must have been administered at least 14 days prior to travel. If you are travelling with a printed PDF proof of vaccination status, it must date from 1 November 2021 to ensure that the certificate can be scanned successfully. Your NHS appointment card from vaccination centres is not designed to be used as proof of vaccination and should not be used to demonstrate your vaccine status.
Additional restrictions on entry by air
Air connections with Greece are liable to suspension or amendment, sometimes at short notice. If you are due to fly to or from Greece, you should contact your airline or operator for the latest information.
Additional restrictions on entry by land borders
Greece’s land borders are subject to restrictions at present. Monitor official information from the Greek authorities on any changes to border arrangements. Arrivals must have completed a Passenger Locator Form prior to travel. You should also refer to the ‘Coronavirus’ pages for details of how local or national measures may affect travel across land borders.
Passenger Locator Form
You must complete an online Passenger Locator Form (PLF) before arriving in Greece. The form is in English, and is required whichever way you travel to Greece (including by ferry, road, rail or air). Failure to do so in advance may result in your carrier not allowing you to travel, a 500 Euro fine on arrival or the Greek authorities not allowing you to enter or re-enter the country.
Every traveller, including children, must have their details included on a PLF. If you’re travelling with others outside of your household, you should all complete your own form. If you’re travelling together as a household, the Greek authorities ask for you to complete one form with all adults and children included. You can add additional members of your household at the top of the form before you submit.
Some airlines may require individual PLFs for every traveller over the age of 18 within the same household. Check directly with your airline what you will need to show to be allowed boarding.
Once you have completed the form, you will receive an email with a QR code. When you receive your code, make sure you either print it, or can show it on your mobile phone. If you are travelling by air to Greece, your airline will ask you to prove that you have completed the PLF form. You should print or show (e.g. on your phone) your email with the QR code you have received. Failure to do so could result in you being refused boarding to the flight.
If you are travelling by ferry to or from Greece, the ferry operator will ask you to complete an additional form (‘Pre Boarding Information’), alongside your PLF. This additional form will be provided by the ferry operator, either via their website, or at booking offices: you should contact them directly if you need further information. Temperature checks may also be carried out before boarding; and it is obligatory to wear masks on all ferries, where capacity is limited to allow for social distancing.
On arrival in Greece, you will need to show your QR code to the Greek authorities. Make sure you have either a printed copy of the code, or can show it on your phone. Failure to provide your PLF form/ QR code will result in a fine or you may be refused entry to Greece.
Regular entry requirements
Visas
The rules for travelling or working in European countries changed on 1 January 2021:
you can travel to countries in the Schengen area for up to 90 days in any 180-day period without a visa. This applies if you travel as a tourist, to visit family or friends, to attend business meetings, cultural or sports events, or for short-term studies or training
if you are travelling to Greece and other Schengen countries without a visa, make sure your whole visit is within the 90-day limit. Visits to Schengen countries within the previous 180 days before you travel count towards your 90 days
to stay longer, to work or study, for business or for other reasons, you will need to meet the Greek government’s entry requirements. Check with the Greek Embassy what type of visa and/or work permit, if any, you may need
if you stay in Greece with a residence permit or long-stay visa, this does not count towards your 90-day visa-free limit
Any time you spent in Greece or other Schengen countries before 1 January 2021 does not count towards your 90-day visa-free limit.
At Greek border control, you may need to queue in separate lanes from EU, EEA and Swiss citizens.
Check your passport is stamped if you enter or exit the Schengen area through Greece as a visitor. Border guards will use passport stamps to check you’re complying with the 90-day visa-free limit for short stays in the Schengen area. If relevant entry or exit stamps are not in your passport, border guards will presume that you have overstayed your visa-free limit.
You can show evidence of when and where you entered or exited the Schengen area, and ask the border guards to add this date and location in your passport. Examples of acceptable evidence include boarding passes and tickets.
You may also need to:
show a return or onward ticket
show you have enough money for your stay
If you are resident in Greece your passport should not be stamped. You should proactively show your proof of residence as well as your valid passport at Greek border control. For further information, see our Living in Greece guide.
Passport validity
Check your passport is valid for travel before you book your trip, and renew your passport if you do not have enough time left on it.
Make sure your passport is:
valid for at least 3 months after the day you plan to leave Greece, or any other Schengen country
less than 10 years old
The 3 months you need when leaving a country must be within 10 years of the passport issue date.
If you renewed your current passport before the previous one expired, extra months may have been added to its expiry date. Any extra months on your passport over 10 years may not count towards the minimum 3 months needed.
Travelling with medication
According to Greek law, a visitor can bring up to 5 different prescribed medicines for personal use, with a maximum of 2 boxes of each medicine.
Some prescribed and over-the-counter medicines available in the UK, including medication containing codeine, are considered controlled substances in Greece. A doctor’s prescription is required in all cases, which should mention your details, the types of medicine and the condition treated. On arrival, Greek Customs may in some cases require you to obtain permission from the Greek National Organisation of Medicines - if you need to carry more than the permitted number of boxes, for example. The National Organisation of Medicines examines these requests on a case by case basis.
For more information on controlled medicines, contact the Greek National Organisation of Medicines (telephone: 0030 213 2040 285 / 307 / 225, open Monday to Friday, 12pm to 3pm Greece time, or email: relation@eof.gr).
UK Emergency Travel Documents
UK Emergency Travel Documents are valid for entry, airside transit and exit from Greece.
