Entry rules in response to coronavirus (COVID-19)
Entry to the Czech Republic
Entry to the Czech Republic by direct flight from the UK is permitted only for passengers who are either Czech citizens or those who hold residency or a long-term valid visa for the Czech Republic. You must present a negative RT-PCR or antigen test that has been taken in the UK and is no older than 72 hours. Without Czech citizenship, proof of residency or a long-term visa, you will not be permitted to enter the Czech Republic.
On arrival in the Czech Republic, you must self-isolate for at least 5 days, before undertaking a further RT-PCR or antigen test between 5-7 days after arrival. A negative test result ends this period of self-isolation. You are also required to fill in the Passenger Locator Form and present it upon arrival. You should consult your airline operator before travelling.
Details on regulations in place for travellers and more information on entry requirements and local restrictions can be found on the website of the Czech Ministry of Interior.
You should not use the NHS testing service to get a test in order to facilitate your travel to another country. You should arrange to take a private test.
Regular entry requirements
The information on this part of the page covers the most common types of travel and reflects the UK government’s understanding of the rules currently in place. Unless otherwise stated, this information is for travellers using a full ‘British Citizen’ passport.
The authorities in the country or territory you’re travelling to are responsible for setting and enforcing the rules for entry. If you’re unclear about any aspect of the entry requirements, or you need further reassurance, you’ll need to contact the embassy, high commission or consulate of the country or territory you’re travelling to.
You should also consider checking with your transport provider or travel company to make sure your passport and other travel documents meet their requirements.
Visas
If you hold a British Citizen passport, you don’t need a visa to enter Czech Republic. If you’re planning a stay of longer than 3 months, see our Living in Czech Republic guide and contact the Embassy of the Czech Republic if you have further questions.
The rules on travel will stay the same until 31 December 2020.

Passport validity
The rules on travel will stay the same until 31 December 2020.

Passport validity from 1 January 2021
From 1 January 2021, you must have at least 6 months left on an adult or child passport to travel to most countries in Europe (not including Ireland).
If you renewed your current passport before the previous one expired, extra months may have been added to its expiry date. Any extra months on your passport over 10 years may not count towards the 6 months needed.
Check your passport is valid for travel before you book your trip. You will need to renew your passport before travelling if you do not have enough time left on your passport.
