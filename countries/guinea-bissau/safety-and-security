Crime
Crime rates in Guinea-Bissau are low but Guinea-Bissau is an extremely poor country. You should take sensible precautions, and avoid carrying valuables in public.
Local travel
Land mines remain a problem in parts of the country and de-mining operations are continuing. The capital city of Bissau was declared mine-free in June 2006 by the national de-mining centre (CAAMI), which is responsible for de-mining operations and maintains lists of known minefields. Outside of the capital city, you should take local advice and stick to paved roads.

Road travel
Traffic is generally light but road conditions (including in the capital) and driving standards are poor. You should avoid road travel at night and take suitable precautions in the rainy season (June to October) when road and driving conditions can become particularly poor.
Political situation
Guinea-Bissau is a country in which political instability can, and does, occur without warning. On 18 June 2019, José Mário Vaz, President of Guinea-Bissau, announced his intention to hold Presidential elections on 24 November 2019. In the run up to the elections, there may be an increase in protests, demonstrations and large public gatherings, which you should avoid. In the event of any political unrest you should follow the advice of local authorities.
Successful and internationally recognised elections (legislative and presidential) were held in 2014. However, a political crisis ongoing since August 2015 has resulted in further political instability.
