Warning
FCDO advises against all travel to parts of Cameroon.

This guide also has safety advice for regions of Cameroon.
Terrorism
There is a high threat of terrorist attack globally affecting UK interests and British nationals, including from groups and individuals who view the UK and British nationals as targets. Stay aware of your surroundings at all times.    
UK Counter Terrorism Policing has information and advice on staying safe abroad and what to do in the event of a terrorist attack. Find out how to reduce your risk from terrorism while abroad.
Terrorism in Cameroon
Terrorists are very likely to try to carry out attacks in Cameroon. 
Terrorist attacks could be indiscriminate, including in places visited by foreigners such as:
restaurants
bars
markets
hotels
shopping centres
places of worship
parks
sporting venues
The terrorist groups Boko Haram and Islamic State West Africa (ISWA) are mainly active in the Far-North Region but attacks could occur anywhere, including major towns and cities such as Yaoundé and Douala. There was an increase in the use of improvised explosive devices by violent extremist organisations in the Far-North Region in 2023. Stay aware of your surroundings, keep up to date with local media reports and follow the advice of local authorities.
Political situation
There are occasional isolated incidents of political unrest around the country. You should stay alert, avoid large gatherings and monitor local media.
Presidential elections will be held on 12 October 2025 in Cameroon. Exercise vigilance in crowded areas and near polling stations, and avoid rallies. Protests and unrest can occur without warning and the situation could change quickly.
Political developments and increased tensions related to the English-speaking North-West and South-West regions could lead to isolated incidents of violence in other parts of the country. This could affect western interests, as well as places frequented by foreigners. You should plan your movements carefully. In November 2020, a threat by non-state armed groups was made against diplomatic missions in Yaoundé, including the British High Commission.
Bomb attacks   
Non-state armed groups are increasingly using improvised explosive devices (IEDs) to target civilians in the North-West and South-West regions and against government forces in the Far-North Region. IEDs have also been seen in the capital Yaoundé.
There could be more attacks in urban areas, or other locations around the country. Stay alert and keep up to date with developments through the media and local authorities.
Crime
Armed robbery
There is risk of armed robbery and mugging throughout Cameroon, particularly in the cities Yaoundé, Douala, Ngaoundere and Bafoussam.
Avoid isolated or less developed areas of towns for example, Briqueterie and Mokolo market in Yaoundé and Nkololun, New Bell, Akwa, Bonaberi and Village in Douala. Be cautious at all times when walking, particularly alone, and avoid walking at night.  
Burglary and petty theft
Close and lock all doors and windows, particularly at night. Make sure burglar proof metal bars are installed. Identify callers through spy holes before opening doors, especially late at night.
Petty theft is common on trains, coaches and bush taxis and around bus stations and hotels. Be particularly careful with your belongings.
Unofficial taxis
Taxis in cities operate like buses, picking up passengers while there is still room in the car. They often take indirect routes, and many do not meet basic safety requirements. There have been violent assaults and robberies on taxi passengers. Do not hail taxis from the roadside (these are yellow in Yaoundé and Douala). Only use trusted, pre-arranged taxis, and preferably book one from your hotel or restaurant.
Violent crime near borders and roads
There are incidents of carjacking, criminal kidnapping and armed robbery along roads close to the borders with Central African Republic, Chad and Nigeria:
Bamenda-Banyo road
Bafoussam-Banyo road
Bafoussam-Doula road
Yaoundé-Garoua road
Boulai-Ngaoundere road
Keep car doors locked and windows closed. Avoid wearing jewellery, keep mobile phones out of sight and only carry small amounts of cash and valuables.
Criminal kidnapping
There have been incidents of kidnapping and hostage taking for ransom by large gangs in the Far-North, North, Adamawa, East, North-West and South-West regions of Cameroon.
The long-standing policy of the British government is not to make substantive concessions to hostage takers. The British government considers that paying ransoms and releasing prisoners increases the risk of further hostage taking.
Adoption scams
Scam artists often target foreign visitors and residents. The scams come in many forms and can cause significant financial loss. Scammers also use websites, chatrooms and email to target people and companies in the UK.
Advance fee scams are common in Cameroon. Criminals use child adoption to persuade victims to pay large amounts of money before they suspect anything. Be very cautious about sending money or travelling to Cameroon to adopt a child where the information has come from a website or through emails. Cameroon does not have adoption agencies.
Laws and cultural differences
Personal ID
Always carry ID, either a residence permit or a certified copy of your passport showing a valid visa. The police can detain you if you do not have ID.
Camouflage clothing
It is illegal to wear camouflage clothing unless you are in the armed forces. Penalties may include a fine and detention.
Illegal drugs and prison sentences
Penalties for using and possessing drugs are severe and usually include a prison sentence.
Using cameras in secure areas
It is illegal to photograph military sites, government buildings, airports and ports. While photography elsewhere is not illegal, communities can be sensitive to people taking photos or may ask for money in return. Officials may also ask you for money, perhaps suggesting that you need to pay for a ‘permit’ to photograph certain places.
LGBT+ travellers
Same-sex relationships are not widely accepted in central African society, and same-sex sexual acts are illegal in Cameroon. Same-sex partners have been arrested and prosecuted.
Read more advice for LGBT+ travellers.
Wildlife, animal products and souvenirs
It is illegal to buy, sell, kill or capture any protected wild animal or trade its parts without a licence. If you are caught buying or trafficking these goods, you’ll be prosecuted and could get a prison sentence or a fine.
Money
It is difficult to exchange sterling travellers cheques in Cameroon. Many banks will only allow you to exchange travellers cheques if you hold an account with them. Euros and US dollars are the most widely accepted foreign currency.
Shops usually require small notes, which can be difficult to obtain.
You must pay heavy fees to make cash withdrawals from UK bank accounts and ATMs. ATMs are not often available outside of large towns.
Transport risks
Road travel
If you are planning to drive in Cameroon, see information on driving abroad.
You can use a UK photocard driving licence to drive in Cameroon for up to 6 months. If you still have a paper driving licence, you may need to update it to a photocard licence or get the correct version of the international driving permit (IDP).
If you are staying for more than 6 months, you must get a Cameroonian licence from the Delegation of Transport as soon as possible.
Make sure any car you hire is adequately insured, preferably by written confirmation from the insurance company (rather than the car hire firm). If you’re hiring a driver and car, make sure you’re not liable for accidents or damage.
Driving standards
Driving standards are poor in Cameroon.
Roads are generally in poor condition. Many are heavily potholed and are unlit at night. Pedestrians and stray animals are a hazard. Many vehicles have poor-quality lights.
Avoid travelling at night in Cameroon, particularly in rural areas. Accidents are common on the Yaoundé-Douala road.
If you’re travelling between cities, consider taking a VHF radio or satellite phone, as mobile phone coverage is limited. Plan your journey carefully, and travel in convoy if possible.
Roadblocks
Police and gendarmerie roadblocks are common in Cameroon. You may need to show your passport, driving licence or vehicle registration documents.
Uniformed members of the security forces stop motorists for minor or non-existent violations of vehicle regulations to extort small bribes. Do not pay bribes – instead ask the officer for a ticket setting out the alleged offence, so you can pay at a local court.
Air travel
Camair-Co is the only local airline operating between some of the major cities. Scheduled flights are often delayed or cancellations. Due to aviation safety standards, we advise against taking flights that use the XIAN MA-60, which is used occasionally for internal flights.   
Check whether your tour operator has concerns about airlines in Cameroon.
