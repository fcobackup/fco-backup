Ireland is exempt from the Foreign, Commonwealth & Development Office (FCDO) advice against all non-essential international travel.
Travel to Ireland is subject to entry restrictions
Ireland is implementing the new EU ‘traffic lights’ approach to travel, which applies to countries in the EU / EEA. A combined indicator map will be published each week by the European Centre for Disease Prevention and Control (ECDC). There will be no entry restrictions on passengers travelling from green regions. For all others, including arrivals from Great Britain:
All arrivals, including Irish residents, are asked to restrict their movement for 14 days on arrival. Arrivals from Northern Ireland are exempt.
All arrivals, including Irish residents, arriving from overseas must complete a Public Health Passenger Locator Form prior to arriving in Ireland. The form may be used by health authorities to contact you in order to verify your location in the country.
