The information on this page covers the most common types of travel and reflects the UK government’s understanding of the rules currently in place. Unless otherwise stated, this information is for travellers using a full ‘British Citizen’ passport.
The authorities in the country or territory you’re travelling to are responsible for setting and enforcing the rules for entry. If you’re unclear about any aspect of the entry requirements, or you need further reassurance, you’ll need to contact the embassy, high commission or consulate of the country or territory you’re travelling to.
You should also consider checking with your transport provider or travel company to make sure your passport and other travel documents meet their requirements.
Entry rules in response to coronavirus (COVID-19)
All land borders are open. However neighbouring countries may have different entry and exit restrictions on their side of the border. You should check before travelling.
If you are a British national with a Greek residence permit and are travelling to Greece from Albania you must complete an online Passenger Locator Form (PLF) (in English) at least 48 hours before your arrival in Greece. A negative PCR test is required up to a maximum of 72 hours prior to your arrival in Greece. In the event of a negative test result you will still be required to self-isolate for three days. If the result is positive, the Greek authorities will ask you to quarantine until advised otherwise.
If you are a British national travelling to Kosovo from Albania, you will be required to self-isolate for 14 days. A negative RT-PCR test is required for all other foreign nationals entering Kosovo from countries with a high number of COVID-19 cases, marked as red or orange (more than 60 cases per 100,000) on the official ECDC map. You should not use the NHS testing service to get a test in order to facilitate your travel to another country. You should arrange to take a private test.
If you are travelling to Montenegro you will need a negative PCR test taken within the previous 72 hours. You will not be allowed entry without a valid PCR test. Children under the age of 5 are not required to be tested. This entry requirement applies to all foreign nationals seeking entry to Montenegro. If you are travelling to North Macedonia but have arrived from the UK after 20 December, you are required to self-isolate on entry to North Macedonia.
Keep up to date with information from your tour operator, transport or accommodation provider on the impact on any existing travel plans. If you need further information about entry requirements, contact the local immigration authorities or the nearest Albanian Embassy/Consulate. You should also check with your airline or travel company for the latest information.
