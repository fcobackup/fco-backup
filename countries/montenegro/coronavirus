International travel
There are currently no direct flights available between the UK and Montenegro. A number of airlines are operating a reduced schedule of indirect flights to the UK due to low passenger numbers. You should contact your airline before you travel to confirm your flight is going ahead as scheduled.
For more information about your rights, visit the Citizen’s Advice Bureau website. For help resolving problems with a flight booking, visit the website of the Civil Aviation Authority. For questions about travel insurance, contact your insurance provider and if you are not happy with their response, you can complain to the Financial Ombudsman Service.
Entry and borders
See Entry requirements to find out what you will need to do when you arrive in Montenegro.
Everyone should comply with the measures put in place in Montenegro to limit the spread of coronavirus (COVID-19).
Land border crossings may close at short notice and entry to neighbouring countries may be subject to entry requirements.
Returning to the UK
When you return, you must follow the rules for entering the UK.
You are responsible for organising your own COVID-19 test, in line with UK government testing requirements. You should contact the Ministry of Health for information on testing facilities.
Be prepared for your plans to change
No travel is risk-free during COVID. Countries may further restrict travel or bring in new rules at short notice, for example due to a new COVID-19 variant. Check with your travel company or airline for any transport changes which may delay your journey home.
If you test positive for COVID-19, you may need to stay where you are until you test negative. You may also need to seek treatment there.
Plan ahead and make sure you:
can access money
understand what your insurance will cover
can make arrangements to extend your stay and be away for longer than planned
Travel in Montenegro
For information on entering Montenegro, see Entry Requirements. A number of restrictions to prevent the spread of the virus have been put in place by the Montenegrin Government, on the advice of the Institute for Public Health.
Public spaces and services
Wearing facemasks or coverings is mandatory in indoor public spaces throughout Montenegro, and outdoors where it is not possible to keep a physical distance of at least 2 metres. Children 5 years old and younger are exempt from this requirement. Non-compliance is punishable by law and subject to fines ranging from €100 to €2,000.
Visiting people in healthcare institutions remains banned. Visits to those in custody or serving prison sentences are only permitted for lawyers and immediate family members. Visits to persons accommodated in social and child protection institutions are allowed, in accordance with the current epidemiological measures.
Gatherings and mass participation events must be held in line with guidance set out by the Institute of Public Health (available here), which includes limits on number of attendees and requirements for social distancing.
Renting private houses or flats is banned for groups of more than 2 people, except if they are from the same household.
Working from home is recommended wherever possible. Otherwise flexible working hours and reduced physical contact between employees is recommended, especially for those facing greater risks should they contract COVID-19.
The full list of measures is available in English on the Montenegrin government website and in Montenegrin at the specialised COVID response website. The latest information on case numbers is available on the website for the Institute of Public Health.
Quarantine requirements
If you have had contact with someone diagnosed with coronavirus, or suspected to be infected with coronavirus, you will be subject to quarantine.
All those who were quarantined or self-isolating and who test positive for the coronavirus and are unable to continue self-isolation in their place of residence will be subjected to compulsory institutional isolation. The same rule applies for those who have received hospital treatment for coronavirus and recovered but have not passed two sequential negative coronavirus results; and to those who arrived in Montenegro from abroad and subsequently tested positive for the coronavirus.
Violation of these measures is a criminal offence.

Call handlers will be able to assess the risks you have been exposed to and provide further recommendations and instructions.
You may be advised to go to a COVID health centre will perform an initial check and decide whether you will be tested for COVID-19 immediately or referred to a local specialist clinic.

COVID-19 vaccines if you live in Montenegro
We will update this page when the Government of Montenegro announces new information on the national vaccination programme. You can sign up to get email notifications when this page is updated.
The Montenegrin national vaccination programme started in March 2021 and is using the Sinopharm, AstraZeneca, Pfizer-BioNTech, and Sputnik V vaccines. The Government of Montenegro has stated that British nationals resident in Montenegro are eligible for vaccination if they choose to join the programme. This is not dependent on citizenship or whether you are insured with the Montenegrin Health Fund.
The Montenegrin authorities have created an e-portal with information about the local COVID-19 vaccination programme (only available in Montenegrin). Vaccination in Montenegro continues at vaccination centres across the country. Residents of Montenegro can attend with their identity documents without a need for advance registration, every day from 8am to 8pm.
