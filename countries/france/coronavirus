Travel in France
France has put measures in place to limit the spread of COVID-19.
There has been a sharp rise in the number of COVID-19 cases in France during recent weeks, with a significant number of French departments now at ‘heightened alert’. In a number of areas, including many of France’s largest cities, the Government has brought in further restrictive measures. Check local guidance for more information.
Public spaces and services
Wearing face masks in enclosed public spaces has been compulsory since 20 July. This applies to those aged 11 and over. Local authorities in an increasing number of cities and regions (including Paris), have extended this to also include outdoor public spaces. Failure to comply with these restrictions may result in a fine. Please refer to local guidance for more information.
Since 11 May, wearing masks on public transport has been compulsory for all users aged 11 and over, with fines for those who are not compliant. Masks are also compulsory in taxis and private hire vehicles without a plexiglass screen.
