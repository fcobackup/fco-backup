Travel in New Zealand
The whole of New Zealand is at Alert Level 1. You can find detailed information on the alert levels and the measures introduced from the New Zealand government.
From 11:59pm on Wednesday 18 November, you legally must wear a face covering when you’re travelling to, from or through Auckland on public transport. This includes on long-distance bus and train journeys.
You also legally must wear a face covering when you’re travelling on a domestic flight anywhere in New Zealand. This does not include private flights.
Drivers of taxis and ride-shares in Auckland legally must wear a face covering from Thursday. If you’re a passenger in a taxi or ride-share, you’re strongly encouraged to wear a face covering.
While not mandatory at Alert Level 1, government advice for everyone outside of Aucklandencourages the use of face coverings on public transport and where it is not possible to maintain physical distance from people who you do not know, for example in supermarkets. The government also encourages people to keep track of their movements and who they have seen to help with contact tracing. The NZ COVID Tracer app is available to download for this purpose with all shops and businesses displaying their QR codes for scanning. Detailed information on face coverings is available from the New Zealand government.
Travellers may continue to undertake domestic travel by plane or road in order to connect with international flight departures from Auckland or Christchurch.
New Zealand’s border restrictions remain in place and public health measures remain unchanged (wash hands and high-touch surfaces regularly, stay home if sick, and get tested if symptomatic).
