The hurricane season in Martinique normally runs from June to November. Monitor local and international weather updates from the US National Hurricane Centre website and check with local authorities or your tour operator for any changes to your onward travel plans.  
The Montagne Pel√©e volcano is dormant; it is monitored by a local observatory and there would be warning well in advance from the local authorities of any imminent volcanic activity.
