Warning
FCDO advises against all but essential travel to parts of Laos.

Before you travel check that:
your destination can provide the healthcare you may need
you have appropriate travel insurance for local treatment or unexpected medical evacuation
This is particularly important if you have a health condition or are pregnant.
Emergency medical numbers
Dial 1195 or 030 525 7239 and ask for an ambulance.
Voluntary ambulance services also operate in Vientiane free of charge.
Vientiane Rescue: 1623 or (0)20 5666 8825
Lao Red Cross Rescue: (0)20 5996 6111 or (0)20 2200 5563
Make sure anyone attending an accident is wearing a uniform marked ‘Vientiane Rescue’ or ‘Lao Red Cross’. There have been reports of bogus companies attending accidents and trying to charge fees.
Contact your insurance company quickly if you’re referred to a medical facility for treatment.
Vaccine recommendations and health risks
At least 8 weeks before your trip:
check the latest vaccine recommendations for Laos
see where to get vaccines and whether you have to pay on the NHS travel vaccinations page
See what health risks you’ll face in Laos.
Mosquito-borne diseases
The rainy season sees an increase in dengue cases, which have been getting more severe. Dengue and malaria are endemic, so you should increase precautions to avoid being bitten by mosquitoes.
Anthrax
Anthrax has been found in cattle and buffalo near the tourist areas of 4,000 Islands, Pakse and the Bolaven Plateau. Anthrax is a serious disease that can be transmitted to humans. Avoid contact with cattle and buffalo and make sure meat is thoroughly cooked. Seek medical attention if you are exposed to infected animals or show symptoms.
Air pollution
Regional air pollution can be a problem in some cities in Laos and may aggravate heart, lung or respiratory conditions. Children, the elderly and those with pre-existing medical conditions may be especially affected. You can read guidance on how to cope with air pollution.
Medication
International clinics, large hospitals and larger pharmacies in Laos can supply most prescription medication. In remoter areas this may be more difficult.
The legal status and regulation of some medicines prescribed or bought in the UK can be different in other countries.

Healthcare in Laos
Medical care in Laos is basic and outside the capital there are no reliable facilities to deal with medical emergencies. Medical evacuation is difficult to organise and very expensive. Make sure you have adequate travel health insurance and accessible funds to cover the cost of any medical treatment abroad and repatriation.
You may be asked to pay for an ambulance and any treatment you need in advance. Make sure you get a receipt to use for insurance claims.
FCDO has a list of medical providers in Laos where some staff will speak English.
There is also guidance on healthcare if you’re living in Laos.
