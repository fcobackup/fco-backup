Strict currency controls are in place in Venezuela. There are currently two official exchange rates (as well as a black-market rate). Bureaux de change will exchange US dollars and US dollar travellers’ cheques for Bolivars.
Use official currency exchange booths only, which should change money at the higher of the two official rates (DICOM). It’s illegal to change money on the black market. There are no facilities for visitors to change bolivares to US dollars, or any other currency, when leaving Venezuela.
Debit and credit cards are widely used in Venezuela and have the advantage of removing the need to carry large amounts of cash. However, international credit cards aren’t always accepted by point of sale machines and you’ll have to enter your passport number. ATMs have extremely low limits for cash withdrawals on international cards and queues at ATMs are frequently targeted by criminals. You shouldn’t rely on ATMs as your main way to access money in Venezuela.
There’s a serious problem with credit card fraud and cards being cloned. Take care whenever you’re using your credit or debit cards.
100-bolivar bank notes will be phased out progressively; higher-value bank notes are being introduced, but supplies are limited and it is difficult to get cash. Venezuela experienced high levels of inflation in 2017.
Banknote shortages mean that more people have to pay by card. This has put pressure on Venezuela’s card payment processing infrastructure. Debit or credit card transactions may take longer than expected, or several attempts, to clear through points of sale nationwide.
If you run out of money and discover that your bank cards do not work, you can arrange with friends and family overseas to deposit funds into any Western Union branch, and pick up the deposited funds at any Grupo Zoom branch nationwide.
