Cases of coronavirus (COVID-19) have been confirmed in Cameroon. The Cameroon authorities have introduced a number of measures to limit the spread of the virus.
Entry and borders
The Cameroon authorities have announced the closure of all its land, sea and air borders, effective from the 18 March. All international flights have been suspended. All entry visas have been suspended.
If you arrived in Cameroon from countries at risk of coronavirus before 17 March, the Cameroon authorities recommend that you self-isolate for 14 days before any activity or contact with others. The authorities have been placing those arriving in Cameroon from abroad since the 17 March under quarantine for at least 14 days.
You should comply with additional screening measures put in place by the authorities. Keep up to date with information from your tour operator, transport or accommodation provider on the impact on any existing travel plans.
If you need further information about entry requirements, contact the local immigration authorities or the nearest Cameroonian Embassy/High Commission. You should also check with your airline or travel company for the latest information.
Travellers should be prepared for additional travel restrictions to be put in to effect with little or no advance notice.
Local Measures
The Government of Cameroon has prohibited gatherings of over 50 people. Bars, restaurants and entertainment spots now must close from 6pm daily.
Travel within the country should be limited to essential travel only. The authorities are enforcing measures limiting the number of passengers taxis, buses and motorbikes can take.
Visits to public institutions, including government buildings, have been limited.
Additional measures, introduced from 13 April, include the requirement to wear face masks in public spaces and a systematic sanctioning of those people found to have breached restriction and confinement measures imposed on them.
Schools and other educational establishments have been shut down and all exams and competitions cancelled.
