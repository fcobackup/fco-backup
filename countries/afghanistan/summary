The Foreign, Commonwealth & Development Office (FCDO) advises against all travel to Afghanistan.
You should not travel to Afghanistan.
The security situation in Afghanistan remains extremely volatile. There is an ongoing and high threat of terrorist attacks through Afghanistan, including around the airport. There is a heightened threat of terrorist attacks in or around religious sites and during religious festivals, such as the month of Ramadan. Travel throughout Afghanistan is extremely dangerous, and border crossings may not be open. See ‘Safety and security’.
There are currently no British consular officials in Afghanistan and our ability to provide consular assistance is severely limited and cannot be delivered in person within Afghanistan.
If you choose to travel to or stay in Afghanistan against FCDO advice, you should keep a low profile. Be vigilant, try to avoid all crowds and public events including religious events, and take appropriate security precautions.
There is a heightened risk of detention of British nationals. The British Government may not be notified about such detentions; communications with next of kin may not be guaranteed; and detention may be lengthy.
If you are a British national in Afghanistan and need to speak to a consular officer, you can:
call the FCDO on +44 (0)1908 516666 (or 01908 516666 in the UK) (available 24 hours a day)
submit an enquiry
contact us on Twitter or Facebook.
British nationals may access consular services at our diplomatic missions in neighbouring countries.
The FCDO cannot offer advice on the safety of travelling to any departure point within Afghanistan.
