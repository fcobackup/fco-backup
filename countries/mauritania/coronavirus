Be prepared for your plans to change
No travel is risk-free during COVID-19. Countries may further restrict travel or bring in new rules at short notice, for example due to a new COVID-19 variant. Check with your travel company or airline for any transport changes which may delay your journey home.
If you test positive for COVID-19, you should immediately isolate in your accommodation for 10 days. You will need to make your own arrangements if you cannot stay in your accommodation for the full isolation period. There are no state-run quarantine facilities in Mauritania. You should take a test after the 10-day period; if this is negative, you may end your isolation.
Plan ahead and make sure you:
can access money
understand what your insurance will cover
can make arrangements to extend your stay and be away for longer than planned
