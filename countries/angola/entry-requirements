The information on this page covers the most common types of travel and reflects the UK government’s understanding of the rules currently in place. Unless otherwise stated, this information is for travellers using a full ‘British Citizen’ passport.
The authorities in the country or territory you’re travelling to are responsible for setting and enforcing the rules for entry. If you’re unclear about any aspect of the entry requirements, or you need further reassurance, you’ll need to contact the embassy, high commission or consulate of the country or territory you’re travelling to.
You should also consider checking with your transport provider or travel company to make sure your passport and other travel documents meet their requirements.
Visas
On 30 March, Angola announced changes to its visa regime to enable those applying for tourist visas to submit documentation online in advance of travel and be granted a pre-approval that will allow visitors to receive their physical visa on entry into Angola, without the need to submit documentation to an Angolan Embassy. This process is currently being implemented. The online application portal can be found here. You should check all entry requirements with the Angolan Embassy in London.
You must apply for a valid visa and/or work permit before travelling to Angola otherwise you will be detained at the airport and then deported. The process can take a long time. You should apply at least 8 weeks in advance. Visas cannot be obtained on arrival at any airport, unless you have applied online for a tourist visa and had a pre-approval granted by Angola’s immigration authorities (SME) in advance.
You’ll be fined 15,000 Kwanzas (Angolan currency) per day if you overstay your visa. You won’t be allowed to leave the country until your fine has been paid. Legal action will be taken against you if you don’t pay your fine. This may include being detained, deported or not being allowed to re-enter Angola.
Fines are in place for a wide range of visa offences including working, studying or residing without the correct visa, changing employment without notifying the authorities, employing staff with incorrect visas, failing to renew residence cards, or changing address without notifying the authorities.

Your passport should be valid for a minimum period of 6 months from the date of entry into Angola.
