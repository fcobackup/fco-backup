Visas
The Kyrgyz government has announced that foreign citizens and stateless persons can currently stay in Kyrgyzstan indefinitely without a visa, even if registration has expired.
If you need to extend your period of stay on the basis of obtaining a visa (work permit, family ties, or other grounds) the visa centre is willing to consider the possibility of obtaining visas without leaving the Kyrgyz republic.
You should be aware that under the current circumstances visa processing is likely to face significant delays. See Entry requirements for more information on visas.
Health
The number of coronavirus cases in Kyrgyzstan has increased significantly in recent weeks. You should consider ensuring you have a sufficient supply of medications and how you will access healthcare if you need it. If cases continue to rise significantly British Embassy Bishkek’s ability to help may become severely impaired.
You should consider making arrangements for provisions if you are unable or unwilling to leave your home for an extended period of time. You should also consider any medical arrangements that you will need to have in place including access to medicines. Medical facilities in Kyrgyzstan are not as developed as those in the UK, and services are facing significant strain. In some areas access to hospital and ambulance services may be difficult.
If you are unwell and suspect you have symptoms of Coronavirus you can call Kyrgyzstan’s medical hotline (112, 103, 118), or the hotlines of local medical services. Mobile medical teams can provide an initial diagnosis but are no longer equipped to conduct COVID-19 tests. If you are required to enter a state quarantine centre, facilities are likely to be basic.
In Bishkek and some other cities additional temporary day care centres and night centres have opened to treat those with symptoms of pneumonia.
Some foreign nationals may be eligible to pay for and join the state medical insurance scheme. For more details see Health.

Finance
There is a range of financial support from the government that you can access while you are unable to return due to coronavirus restrictions.
If you’re in Kyrgyzstan, and have exhausted all other options to cover essential living costs while you wait to return home, you could apply for an emergency loan for your living costs from the UK government.
You can only apply if you normally live in the UK and you cannot return home. This last-resort option is for those most in need, and you would need to repay the loan when you are back in the UK. Apply for an emergency loan.
