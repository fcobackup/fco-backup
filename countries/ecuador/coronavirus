If you plan to pass through another country to return to the UK, check the travel advice for the country you’re transiting. If you will pass through a red list country, book your hotel quarantine package before travelling to the UK.
You are responsible for organising your own COVID-19 test, in line with UK government testing requirements. You should contact local authorities for information on testing facilities (available in Spanish only).
Be prepared for your plans to change
No travel is risk-free during COVID. Countries may further restrict travel or bring in new rules at short notice, for example due to a new COVID-19 variant. Check with your travel company or airline for any transport changes which may delay your journey home.
If you test positive for COVID-19, you may need to stay where you are until you test negative. You may also need to seek treatment there.
Plan ahead and make sure you:
can access money
understand what your insurance will cover
can make arrangements to extend your stay and be away for longer than planned

COVID-19 vaccines if you live in Ecuador
We will update this page when new information is announced. You can sign up to get email notifications when this page is updated.
The Ecuador national vaccination programme started in February 2021 and uses the AstraZeneca, Pfizer-BioNTech, Sinovac and CanSino vaccines. British nationals resident in Ecuador are eligible for the vaccine.
Currently, anyone eligible for the vaccine can approach their nearest health centre (Centro de Salud), any authorised vaccination centre or mobile brigade to receive the COVID-19 vaccination nationwide.
If you live in Ecuador, and for any reason you do not have an Ecuadorean Identity Document (“cédula”), you can approach the nearest health centre (Centro de Salud) with a valid passport.
Vaccination for 5-11 year olds began in October 2021. Public and private schools began the vaccination roll-out for the corresponding age groups and asked parents to sign a consent form. 5-11 year olds can also approach their nearest health centre (Centro de Salud) for the COVID-19 vaccination.
As of December 2021, COVID-19 booster vaccines are available for those who completed their vaccination course at least 6 months ago, or 5 months ago for over 65s. You can approach the nearest health centre or vaccination establishment throughout the country.
COVID-19 vaccinations are now mandatory for all people above the age of 5 in Ecuador, including foreign residents (Health Law Article 6.4). However, people with a certified medical condition or dispensation are exempt, with an official and valid medical certificate.
In addition to the vaccination card provided by the Ministry of Public Health (MSP), there is an online application form through which you can access your vaccination certificate.
Find out more, including about vaccines that are authorised in the UK or approved by the World Health Organisation, on the COVID-19 vaccines if you live abroad.
If you’re a British national living in Ecuador, you should seek medical advice from your local healthcare provider. Information about COVID-19 vaccines used in the national programme where you live, including regulatory status, should be available from local authorities. Check the Ministry of Public Health (MSP) social media channels.
