This page has information on travelling to Ireland.
This page reflects the UK Government’s understanding of current rules for people travelling on a full ‘British Citizen’ passport from the UK, for the most common types of travel.
The authorities in Ireland set and enforce entry rules. If you’re unsure how Ireland’s entry requirements apply to you, contact its UK embassy, high commission or consulate.’
All travellers
All COVID-19 travel restrictions for travellers to Ireland have been lifted. If you are travelling to Ireland, you do not need to show any proof of vaccination, proof of recovery, proof of negative test or Irish passenger locator form receipt.
There are no post-arrival testing or quarantine requirements for travel to Ireland.
Check your passport and travel documents before you travel
ID
Ireland, along with the UK, is a member of the Common Travel Area. British nationals travelling from the UK don’t need a passport to visit Ireland. However, Irish immigration officers will check the ID of all passengers arriving by air from the UK and may ask for proof of nationality, particularly if you were born outside the UK. You are therefore advised to take your British passport with you.
For more information about the types of ID you might be asked to present, see the Ireland Citizens Information Board website.
Before travelling, check with your carrier about their ID requirements, as most airlines and other transport providers won’t carry passengers to and from Ireland unless they’ve seen satisfactory photographic ID, and some airlines (e.g. Ryanair) will insist that passengers travel with a valid passport on their services.
Passport validity
If you’re using a passport to enter Ireland, it should be valid and in date. You should also check your air or sea carrier’s terms and conditions of travel. For journeys on the island of Ireland, British and Irish citizens do not require any travel documents when crossing the land border.
Travelling with pets
Read the Irish government’s entry requirements for your pet.
If you wish to travel with a pet to the EU, read our guidance.
If your pet passport was issued in an EU Member State it remains valid for travel to Ireland.
