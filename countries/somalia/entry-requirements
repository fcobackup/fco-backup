Warning
FCDO advises against all travel to parts of Somalia.

This information is for people travelling on a full ‘British citizen’ passport from the UK, who choose to travel despite FCDO advice. It is based on the UK government’s understanding of Somalia’s current rules for the most common types of travel. 
The authorities in Somalia set and enforce entry rules. If you’re not sure how these requirements apply to you, contact the Somalian Embassy in the UK.
COVID-19 rules
There are no COVID-19 testing or vaccination requirements for travellers entering Somalia, including Somaliland.
Passport validity requirements
To enter Somalia, including Somaliland, your passport must have an ‘expiry date’ at least 6 months after the date you arrive.
Check with your travel provider that your passport and other travel documents meet requirements. Renew your passport if you need to.
You will be denied entry if you do not have a valid travel document or try to use a passport that has been reported lost or stolen.
Visa requirements
You must have a visa to enter Somalia, including Somaliland.
You can get a single-entry visa, valid for one month, for 60 US dollars when you arrive at:
Mogadishu International Airport
Hargeisa International Airport
It is not clear if you’ll be given a visa on arrival at other points of entry. Get confirmation from local authorities or your sponsoring organisation.
You may also need to provide a letter of invitation when you arrive, outlining the reason for your visit. You can usually get this from your place of work. Without this letter, you may not be allowed to enter.
Vaccine requirements
For details about medical entry requirements and recommended vaccinations, see TravelHealthPro’s Somalia guide. 
Customs rules
There are strict rules about goods you can take into or out of Somalia, including Somaliland. You must declare anything that may be prohibited or subject to tax or duty.
Khat is a legal drug in Somalia, but it is an offence to take it out of the country. Officials regularly search bags at Hargeisa and Mogadishu airports, and anyone found to be in possession of khat is likely to face criminal prosecution.
Taking money into and out of Somalia (including Somaliland)
In Somaliland you must declare cash or travellers cheques if the value is 10,000 US dollars or more.
