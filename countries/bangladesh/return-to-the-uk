There are currently no commercial options available to return to the UK from Bangladesh, due to flight restrictions announced by the Government of Bangladesh.
Biman Airlines has extended the suspension of its domestic and international flights, including flights to and from the UK until 30 May. China Southern and US Bangla airlines are still operating flights to China, but these are for Chinese nationals only.
If you cannot leave Bangladesh at this time, see more about staying in Bangladesh during coronavirus.
UK special flights
We have announced special flights from Dhaka to London Heathrow on 20, 26 and 31 May to return British travellers to the UK from Bangladesh. There are two transfer flights from Sylhet on each of these days. These flights are for British visitors to Bangladesh who have registered to return to the UK but were not accommodated on previous repatriation flights. The registration for these flights is now closed.
There are currently no further special flights to the UK planned from Bangladesh, but we will keep this under review. This travel advice will be updated with further information on options to return to the UK as soon as this is available
Financial support for a flight
If you have exhausted all other options available to you for getting funds, you may be eligible to apply for an emergency loan from the government to cover the cost of the ticket.
You would need to repay the loan when you are back in the UK.
Our partner CTM is also authorised to administer such loans on behalf of the FCO.
If you cannot pay the cost of the ticket, send an SMS text message containing ONLY your full name to +44 7860 093 014 and someone from the CTM team will get in touch.
Travel to the airport
Due to government restrictions public transport has been suspended. British nationals travelling to Dhaka or Sylhet Airport are advised to carry hard copies of their flight confirmation and have their passports easily to hand. Those with confirmed bookings will also be issued with an official British High Commission document to show the authorities at any check points should that be necessary.
Your journey home
The National Travel Health Network and Centre (NaTHNaC) provides advice on how to stay safe as you travel by air.
