There are currently no scheduled commercial flight options available to return to the UK from Cuba. The last scheduled commercial flight to Europe left Cuba on 1 April 2020. From midnight on 1 April 2020, the arrival of all commercial and charter flights is suspended by Cuban authorities until further notice.
We know this is concerning for British people trying to leave Cuba. The UK government is working closely with airlines, the Cuban authorities and other governments to make sure options are available for your return to the UK as soon as possible.
What to do
You should follow our Embassy Facebook page and Embassy Twitter account where we are publishing any announcements on repatriation flights that are arranged and the latest information we have on local measures to be followed until you can leave Cuba. We are in regular contact with the various local authorities during this time. When flights resume, if you are taking a flight via another country, check the latest FCO travel advice for that country to be sure you can transit or enter that country.
If, for whatever reason, you did not leave Cuba before the last flight service you should:
follow the advice/ instructions of Cuban authorities, including local measures to help minimize your risk of exposure to coronavirus (COVID-19). Your safety and security is their responsibility;
contact your insurance provider;
find accommodation that is suitable for your needs, being aware that the Cuban authorities may designate where tourists can stay during this period;
keep up-to-date with the latest information from transport providers and local authorities on your future departure options, and our travel advice, Facebook and Twitter accounts.
keep in regular contact with family and friends at home, so they know you are safe and well.
Cubans who are dual nationals should check with local immigration authorities on whether they will be able to leave Cuba when flights resume and while the other current Government of Cuba measures for COVID-19 are in place.
