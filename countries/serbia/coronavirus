Healthcare in Serbia
The Serbian healthcare system is under increased pressure across the country due to high numbers of COVID-19 cases. It may be more difficult than usual to access satisfactory healthcare for any medical issue, including COVID-19. There are reports that it is difficult to obtain COVID-19 tests in the public health system, including for symptomatic individuals. Temporary additional hospitals are being established in some towns, including Belgrade, in order to admit COVID-19 patients.
The Serbian Ministry of Health website gives up to date information on the number of coronavirus cases confirmed and tests carried out in Serbia. It includes regional data maps. This website also includes helpline telephone numbers.
