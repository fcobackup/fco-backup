International travel
Commercial flights to and from Vanuatu are very limited. Air Vanuatu are running a small number of cargo services with some seats for passengers to Brisbane, Auckland and Noumea.
If you are a British National looking to return to the UK, you will need to register for one of these flights with Vanuatu’s Ministry of Foreign Affairs in Port Vila. For the most recent international flight schedule to determine which flight you’d like to register for, please refer to the Air Vanuatu website.
Once you have determined which flight you’d like to register for, you should send your registration request to ekaltongga@vanuatu.gov.vu and nvuti@vanuatu.gov.vu at the Vanuatu Ministry of Foreign Affairs in Port Vila or by calling (+678) 33190.
You will also need to make your own transit arrangements at your point of arrival from Vanuatu. See Travel via Australia, New Zealand and New Caledonia in ‘Entry Requirements’ for more details about the current transit procedures through these countries.
Before making your onward flight booking from your transit point, you should also check the current transit rules for any other countries you will be travelling through. Airlines may also have their own requirements for travellers including having to undertake a pre-departure COVID-19 test before boarding.
It is a requirement of entry to the UK to obtain a COVID-19 test within a strict timeframe before entry. For further information on where to get COVID-19 testing in Vanuatu as well as current UK entry requirements, please refer to the ‘Returning to the UK’ section.

COVID-19 vaccines if you live in Vanuatu
As information is available about the national vaccination programme, this page will be updated.
The Medicines and Healthcare Products Regulatory Agency (MHRA) is the UK authority responsible for assessing the safety, quality and efficacy of vaccines. It has authorised the Pfizer/BioNTech, Oxford/AstraZeneca and Moderna vaccines for temporary supply and use in the UK. Find out more about MHRA approval for these vaccines.
British nationals living overseas should seek medical advice from their local healthcare provider in the country where they reside. Information about vaccines used in other national programmes, including regulatory status, should be available from the local authorities. This list of Stringent Regulatory Authorities recognised by the World Health Organisation may also be a useful source of additional information.
