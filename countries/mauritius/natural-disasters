Tropical cyclones
The tropical cyclone season in Mauritius usually runs from November to May. On 18 February Mauritius issued a cyclone warning class 1 for Cyclone Emnati, with damaging winds, storm surge and flash flooding likely. You are advised to monitor and follow the advice of the Mauritian Meteorological Services.
Cyclones can cause extensive damage to property. There is a well-structured system of phased warnings. You should follow advice issued by the local authorities. During a cyclone you are not allowed to leave your accommodation and car insurance policies often cease to be valid.
See our Tropical cyclones page for advice about how to prepare effectively and what to do if youâ€™re likely to be affected by a tropical cyclone.
Landslides
Some areas are prone to landslides, especially during cyclones and torrential rains. Mauritius Meteorological Services distribute 5-stage landside warnings and local authorities may organise evacuations of threatened areas if necessary.
