Local travel
Ferry services between Tortola and its sister islands of Virgin Gorda, Anegada and Jost Van Dyke, and also to the US Virgin Islands have now resumed after Hurricane Irma although there is still some disruption to scheduled services.
Road travel
Most roads are passable but work is ongoing to repair the remainder. Great care should be taken when driving particularly on the mountain roads.
Temporary driving licences are no longer issued in the BVI. You can drive for up to 30 days on a UK licence and then must apply for a local one at the Vehicle Department. Cars are left-hand drive, and vehicles drive on the left as in the UK.
Standard taxi fares exist for most destinations, but it is sensible to clarify the fare with the driver beforehand.
Sea travel
The yacht charter business in BVI is returning to normal. If you have already made bookings with yacht charter companies you should check with your operator before you travel.
Many visitors to the BVI take part in water sports. The rate of accidents is very low, but they do occur. Many accidents involve the consumption of alcohol. Fear and dehydration exaggerate the effects of alcohol, so take care if you have been drinking.
