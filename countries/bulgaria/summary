Sporadic protests occur across Bulgaria. You should avoid all protests, keep up to date with media reports and follow the advice of the local authorities. Such protests can become violent without warning and are best avoided. There are currently ongoing protests against the Government in Sofia city centre around the National Assembly and President’s buildings that should be avoided.
Be aware of pickpockets, bag thefts and street attacks on visitors in city centres and coastal resorts especially in crowded areas like buses, trains and busy streets. There has been an increase in thefts on the bus from Nessebar to Sunny Beach. Keep valuables in a safe. See Crime
There are regular reports of robberies and threatening behaviour by taxi drivers in Sunny Beach. There has also been an increase in the number of unlicensed taxis from Sofia airport overcharging passengers. If you’re travelling from the airport, make sure you take an official, licensed taxi.
