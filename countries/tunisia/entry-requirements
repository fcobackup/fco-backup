The authorities in the country or territory you’re travelling to are responsible for setting and enforcing the rules for entry. If you’re unclear about any aspect of the entry requirements, or you need further reassurance, you’ll need to contact the embassy, high commission or consulate of the country or territory you’re travelling to.
You should also consider checking with your transport provider or travel company to make sure your passport and other travel documents meet their requirements.
Entry rules in response to coronavirus (COVID-19)
Entry to Tunisia
Entry requirements into Tunisia vary depending on the prevalence of the epidemic in travellers’ country of residence. The Tunisian authorities have classified the UK as a “Green” country.
While the Foreign and Commonwealth Office (FCO) advice against all non-essential international travel for British nationals remains in place, Tunisian authorities now permit individuals resident in the UK to travel to Tunisia, with no requirement to take a test before departing or self-isolate on arrival.
Lists of countries classed as “Green”, with a low prevalence of the epidemic, and “Orange”, with a medium prevalence of the epidemic, are published (in French) online. See further information. The Tunisian authorities are updating country classifications regularly so please ensure you check these pages for the latest status before travelling.
Individuals resident in “Orange” countries can travel to Tunisia, subject to:
Having taken a coronavirus PCR test that is negative no more than 72 hours before departure and bringing evidence of this result with you;
Self-isolating in your place of residence or a hotel at your own expense for 14 days. If you wish to leave self-isolation, you may do so from the sixth day after your arrival, by paying for a PCR test and receiving a negative result; and
Signing a declaration to confirm that you will abide by these rules.
Individuals resident in “Red” countries are not permitted to enter Tunisia, unless they are Tunisian nationals or they hold residency in Tunisia. These individuals can travel to Tunisia subject to:
Having taken a coronavirus PCR test that is negative no more than 72 hours before departure and bringing evidence of this result with you; and
Spending seven days in a quarantine facility in a hotel (which you will have to pay for) then an additional seven days in confinement at home, subject to a negative COVID-19 test; and
Signing a declaration to confirm that you will abide by these rules

Regular entry requirements
Visas
British passport holders don’t need a visa for visits of up to three months. On arrival, security checks are sometimes carried out on British passport holders who were not born in the UK. This can take a few hours and you will need to be patient until clearance is given. These types of checks rarely take place on departure.
Passport validity
For stays of up to 3 months your passport should be valid for the proposed duration of your stay; you don’t need any additional period of validity on your passport beyond this.
UK Emergency Travel Documents
Tunisian authorities accept UK ETDs for entry to and exit from Tunisia. If you’re leaving Tunisia on an ETD, make sure you have a copy of the police report about the loss/theft of your full validity passport to present to the Immigration Officer.
Dual nationals
Dual British-Tunisian nationals should enter and leave Tunisia on their Tunisian passports.
