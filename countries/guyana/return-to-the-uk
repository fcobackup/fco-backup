There are currently extremely limited commercial options available to return to the UK from Guyana.
All scheduled international flights from Cheddi Jagan International Airport at Timehri and the Eugene Correia Airport at Ogle have been cancelled. The airport closures started on 17 March 2020 and are scheduled to last for the foreseeable future. Only specially authorised flights (such as repatriation flights or medical evacuations) are currently permitted.
The flight which departed on 7 May will be the only UK organised special flight from Guyana.
Trans Guyana Airways (TGA) are operating special relief flights between Guyana and Barbados.
These flights should help British nationals wishing to return to the UK on scheduled flights from Barbados.
For further information, contact Trans Guyana Airways by phone on +592-222-2525 or their website. COVID-19 PCR test results are required for entry and transit through Barbados. For passengers coming from Guyana, these tests cannot be more than 4 days old. For passengers arriving into Barbados from the UK, tests cannot be more than 72 hours old.
Eastern Airlines operate occasional charter flights between Guyana and the USA. For information on availability and to make reservations, visit the Eastern Airlines website. You will need to book onward connections from the USA. This is a commercial arrangement and as such we cannot be responsible for delays or cancellations that might take place.
You will not be able to transit the USA if you have been to the UK, European Union Schengen Area or the Republic of Ireland in the last 14 days and you will require an ESTA to travel. Cost of the ESTA is USD14. Visit the ESTA website to apply for an ESTA.
The Governments of Brazil and Suriname have both announced the closure of borders with neighbouring countries, including Guyana. There is no exit/entry available to Venezuela.

We know this is concerning for British people trying to leave Guyana. The UK government is working closely with airlines, the Guyana authorities and other governments to make sure commercial options are available for you to return to the UK as soon as possible.
This travel advice will be updated when departure options become available. If you are a British national in Guyana or Suriname and wish to leave, you should contact the British High Commission by email returnfrom.guyana@fcdo.gov.uk, who will inform you as soon as departure options become available.
Your journey home: re-entering the UK
When you return, you must follow the rules for entering the UK. You:
need to provide your journey and contact details up to 48 hours before you’re due to arrive in the UK
are not allowed to leave the place you’re staying for the first 14 days you’re in the UK except in very limited situations (known as ‘self-isolating’)
See also the list of people who are exempt from the border rules.
The National Travel Health Network and Centre (NaTHNaC) also provides advice on how to stay safe as you travel by air.
