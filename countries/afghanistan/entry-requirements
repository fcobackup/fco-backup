The FCDO advises against all travel to Afghanistan.
This page reflects the UK government’s understanding of current rules for people travelling on a full ‘British Citizen’ passport for the most common types of travel.
The authorities in Afghanistan set and enforce entry rules. For further information contact the embassy or consulate of the country or territory you’re travelling to. You should also consider checking with your transport or travel provider to make sure your passport and other travel documents meet their requirements.
You should also check specific COVID-19 test requirements airlines and transit countries have in place in advance of your flight. Airlines may refuse boarding if their requirements are not met.
