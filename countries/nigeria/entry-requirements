Warning
FCDO advises against all travel to parts of Nigeria.

This advice reflects the UK government’s understanding of current rules for people travelling on a full ‘British citizen’ passport from the UK, for the most common types of travel.
The authorities in Nigeria set and enforce entry rules. If you’re not sure how these requirements apply to you, contact the Nigeria High Commission in the UK.
COVID-19 rules
There are no COVID-19 testing or vaccination requirements for travellers entering Nigeria.
Visa requirements
You must have a visa to enter Nigeria as a visitor. Get your visa before travelling.
Some business travellers are eligible to apply for a visa on arrival. Check the visa conditions from Nigerian Immigration Services.
If you have a valid Nigerian residence permit (CERPAC or Green Card), you do not need a visa to enter Nigeria.
For further information contact the Nigeria High Commission in the UK.
Applying for a visa
You can apply for a visa from Nigerian Immigration Services.
Vaccination requirements
At least 8 weeks before your trip, check the vaccinations and certificates you need in TravelHealthPro’s Nigeria guide.
Depending on your circumstances, this may include a yellow fever vaccination certificate.
Health screening
You must fill in an online Nigeria Health Declaration Form when entering Nigeria. This includes transit passengers. On arrival, a paper version is available.
You may be asked to take part in thermal screening and carry out a travel history check. This is to assist the Nigerian Government in the detection of diseases of public health importance.
Customs rules
It is illegal to import beer, mineral water, soft drinks, sparkling wine, fruits, vegetables, cereals, eggs, textile fabrics, jewellery and precious metals. It is illegal to export African art, particularly antiques, without written authorisation from the Department of Antiquities. Find more details from the Nigeria High Commission in the UK.
