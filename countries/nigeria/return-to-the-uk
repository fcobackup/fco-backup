There are currently no commercial options available to return to the UK from Nigeria. All airports in Nigeria are closed to all international commercial flights until 23 April. We know this is concerning for British people trying to leave Nigeria. The UK government has been working closely with airlines and has now secured agreement for charter flights to start from Nigeria to the UK, from both Abuja and Lagos. We are still finalising arrangements so are not yet able to confirm the precise dates of departure.
The Nigerian authorities have told us that people who exceed their authorised visa stays as a result of travel restrictions linked to COVID-19 will not be penalised as over-stayers when they depart.
What to do
If you cannot leave Nigeria at this time, you should:
Follow the advice of local authorities, including local measures to help minimise your risk of exposure to coronavirus;
Find accommodation that’s suitable for your needs;
Keep in regular contact with family and friends at home, so they know you are safe and well.
Future travel options
The UK government is working closely with airlines, the Nigerian authorities and other governments to make sure options are available for you to return to the UK as soon as possible.
To be eligible for a flight your primary residence has to be in the UK. Access to the first flights will be prioritised for those who are vulnerable, so those who have an underlying medical condition that could make them susceptible to contracting COVID-19. We are working with a company called Central Travel Management, who will manage the booking and ticketing process and will actively manage the passenger list to ensure this prioritisation. Further information on dates and price of flights will follow shortly.
If you are eligible for the flights, want to leave Nigeria and have not yet registered with us, please do so as soon as possible by e-mailing: Consular.Lagos@fco.gov.uk with: name, email address, mobile telephone number, location, and any other relevant information.
We are co-ordinating with the Federal and State government to ensure that those of you who are outside of Abuja and Lagos can get to the airports despite the lockdown.
