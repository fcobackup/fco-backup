This page reflects the UK government’s understanding of current rules for people travelling on a full ‘British Citizen’ passport, for the most common types of travel.
The authorities in Armenia set and enforce entry rules. For further information contact the embassy, high commission or consulate of the country or territory you’re travelling to. You should also consider checking with your transport provider or travel company to make sure your passport and other travel documents meet their requirements.
Restrictions in response to coronavirus
Arrivals are subject to self-isolation and/or testing requirements (see following section). Face-masks must be worn in all public spaces.
Testing / screening on arrival
You can now enter Armenia with a negative PCR test certificate issued a maximum of 72 hours prior to arrival or a certificate of complete COVID-19 vaccination with the second dose taken at least 14 days before entering the country. You should not use the NHS PCR testing service to get a test in order to facilitate your travel to another country. You should arrange to take a private test.
If you arrive without a certificate, and have no symptoms, you can pay for a PCR test at Zvartnots airport or the land border crossing from Georgia. You must then isolate until you receive a negative result.
More information on the process for taking a PCR test, and a list of COVID-19 testing laboratories in Armenia, is available on the Zvartnots International Airport website.
Demonstrating your COVID-19 vaccination status
Armenia has not yet confirmed that it will accept the UK solutions for demonstrating your COVID vaccination status. You should follow guidance for alternative entry requirements. Your NHS appointment card from vaccination centres is not designed to be used as proof of vaccination.
Entry borders to Armenia
On 12 January 2021, Armenia reopened its land borders with Georgia and Iran to foreign nationals. However, both neighbouring countries retain their own strict border controls in response to COVID-19. You should check Georgia and Iran entry/exit requirements before attempting to cross land borders to/from Armenia.
Regular entry requirements
