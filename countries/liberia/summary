A nationwide State of Emergency, which includes a range of measures to prevent the spread of coronavirus, is in place in Liberia for 60 days from 10 April. See Coronavirus.
Given the rise of the number of cases of coronavirus (COVID-19) the Government of Liberia has announced the suspension of all commercial flights (except cargo, charter and special flights). Currently there are no scheduled passenger services to Liberia. Special charter flights are allowed with prior permission; cargo flights are still permitted. See Return to the UK.
Protests and demonstrations do take place in Monrovia on occasion. You should avoid protests, demonstrations, large gatherings and crowds and follow the advice of local authorities.
Terrorists are likely to try to carry out attacks in Liberia. Attacks could be indiscriminate. You should be vigilant, especially in places visited by foreigners. See Terrorism
General medical facilities throughout Liberia are unable to provide the same standard of healthcare as in the UK. Facilities in rural areas are rudimentary. Many medical facilities expect to be paid up-front for treatment. If you travel to Liberia, stay in contact with your employer or host organisation about the support that they can provide to you while you’re in the country.
If you’re concerned that you might have been exposed to, or showing symptoms of Ebola or Lassa Fever, you should seek immediate medical advice. If you’re in the UK call NHS on 111.
Avoid travelling at night outside Monrovia, except to or from Roberts International Airport. Make sure you have pre-arranged transport from the airport. See Crime and Road travel
The small British Embassy in Monrovia can only offer limited consular assistance.
If you’re abroad and you need emergency help from the UK government, contact the nearest British embassy, consulate or high commission.
Take out comprehensive travel and medical insurance before you travel.
