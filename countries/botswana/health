Before you travel check that:
your destination can provide the healthcare you may need
you have appropriate travel insurance for local treatment or unexpected medical evacuation
This is particularly important if you have a health condition or are pregnant.
Emergency medical number
Call 997 and ask for an ambulance.
Contact your insurance company quickly if you’re referred to a medical facility for treatment.
Health risks and recommended vaccines
Check TravelHealthPro’s current advice on Botswana to find out how to reduce the health risks you’ll face there.
TravelHealthPro also lists the recommended vaccines that could apply to you. At least 8 weeks before you travel, check how to get vaccines and whether you have to pay on the NHS travel vaccinations page.
There are occasional outbreaks of anthrax among wild animals. Do not touch dead animals or carcases. If you suspect that you have come into contact with anthrax, seek urgent medical advice.
If you intend to camp or walk in the bush, take precautions to avoid tick bites, as they can cause several dangerous diseases.
Medication
The legal status and regulation of some medicines prescribed or bought in the UK can be different in other countries.
Read best practice when travelling with medicines on TravelHealthPro.
The NHS has information on whether you can take your medicine abroad.
Healthcare facilities in Botswana
Healthcare in Botswana is good in major towns, but medical facilities and communications are limited in rural areas. For serious medical treatment, medical evacuation to the UK or South Africa may be necessary.
Private hospitals will not treat you unless you can pay, and the cost may be high. Public hospitals will only take you as an emergency patient if you have full insurance. For outpatient treatment, you will need to pay up front.
Make sure you have adequate travel health insurance and accessible funds to cover the cost of any medical treatment abroad and repatriation.
