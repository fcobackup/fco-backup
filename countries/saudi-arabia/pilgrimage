Umrah
If you are resident outside of Saudi Arabia, you should apply to perform Umrah through the official Ministry of Hajj app. The Nusuk app for Umrah is available for both Android users and Apple users.
Visas
You can apply for an e-visa to perform Umrah. To do this, you must select Umrah in the drop down menu for the purpose of the visit otherwise you will not be prioritised for Umrah.
Hajj
Hajj 2023 is now complete. If you are still in Saudi Arabia having performed Hajj, please note the Hajj visa is for a set length of time. It is not extendable. Check your visa expiry date to make sure you know when you must leave Saudi Arabia by. If you overstay, you may incur large fines and/or be detained and deported or banned from returning to Saudi Arabia in the future.
Booking for Hajj 2024 is not yet open. Details of the process and further updates for Hajj 2024 can also be found on the official Ministry of Hajj and Nusuk Hajj platform Twitter pages.
Be cautious of people who claim they can secure places for travellers from the UK. It may be a scam.
Personal documents
Keep your passport and travel documentation safe. Take photocopies and keep one copy with you, and leave a copy with friends or family. If you lose your passport during the Hajj, you will need to apply for an Emergency Travel Document (ETD) to return to the UK which costs £100. You will need to allow time for the ETD to be processed. See Apply for an Emergency Travel Document for more information.

Scams and Fraud
Organised crime groups operate in the UK and target people planning a Hajj or Umrah trip. Fraudsters do not discriminate against age, gender or location. Many victims of fraud are over the age of 65. Fraudsters also target licensed travel companies to advertise fraudulent deals to Saudi Arabia.
Places to perform Hajj can only be secured from the Nusuk Hajj platform. Be cautious if somebody is claiming they can secure you a place by other means.
Check correct processes on the Saudi Ministry of Hajj website. If you use a travel company when travelling for Umrah, you can check whether your travel agent/tour operator is ATOL protected. This means that if the travel agency closes down while you are in Saudi Arabia you are guaranteed a flight home without having to pay any extra. If the agency closes down before you are due to travel, ATOL protection allows you to claim your money back.
Don’t book without researching the booking process – if the offer seems too good to be true, it usually is. A recommendation from a friend or family member does not guarantee the authenticity of the outfit – a fraud may be ongoing for a while before the fraudsters take the money and disappear.
When paying, consider carefully your method of payment. Establishing an auditable paper trail and keeping records of financial transactions will make it more difficult for you to be defrauded. Get everything in writing. Always get written terms and conditions as this details your contract with the travel provider.
