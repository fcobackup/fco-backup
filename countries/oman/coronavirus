International travel
A limited schedule of international flights, including to the UK resumed on 1 October 2020. The Royal Oman Police have resumed issuing residence, business ‘express’, tourist and family visit visas. You should stay in touch with your airline, hotel and monitor local media.
British nationals intending to visit Oman for less than 10 days can do so without requiring a visa if they have proof of hotel accommodation, travel/ health insurance and confirmed return or onward travel. It is not yet clear what self-isolation requirements must be followed so anyone considering this option should seek further detail from their airline, travel company or Omani embassy.
Anyone entering Oman must complete an online pre-registration form prior to departure and have a PCR test on arrival and after 7 days self-isolation.
