Warning
FCDO advises against all but essential travel to parts of Ecuador.

This advice reflects the UK government’s understanding of current rules for people travelling on a full ‘British citizen’ passport from the UK, for the most common types of travel. 
The authorities in Ecuador set and enforce entry rules. If you’re not sure how these requirements apply to you, contact the Ecuadorean Embassy in the UK.
Documents required to enter via land or river border
If you wish to enter Ecuador via a land and river borders from Peru or Colombia, you must present a criminal record certificate from the country where you lived for the last 5 years. The certificate must be legalised with the Hague Apostille and translated into Spanish if issued in another language. This mandatory requirement was announced on 11 January for implementation with immediate effect.
Alternatively, if you do not have a legalised criminal record, you can ask immigration authorities to carry out a check on their ’SIMIEC’ Ecuadorean Immigration System (which flags any travel prohibitions or INTERPOL alerts). The following people are exempt from the presentation of the criminal record certificate:
Holders of a valid Ecuadorean visa
Holders of diplomatic passports
Children and adolescents under 18
Victims of human trafficking or those seeking international protection under the Ecuadorean Human Mobility Law.
There are no restrictions in place for anyone flying into Ecuador.
To obtain a UK Police Criminal Record Certificate, check the ACRO website. For information about legalising the document with the Hague apostille check the Foreign, Commonwealth and Development Office’s Legalisation Office website site.
COVID-19 rules 
There are no COVID-19 testing or vaccination requirements for travellers entering Ecuador. 
If you have COVID-19 symptoms such as high temperature, cough, loss of sense of smell or taste or a skin rash, complete a health declaration form online or when you arrive.
Ecuadorean nationals and foreign residents must have COVID-19 vaccinations. 
Travel in Ecuador  
You may be asked to wear a face mask in some hospitals, clinics and other medical settings.  
See further information on the Ministry of Public Health Twitter account. 
Passport validity requirements 
Your passport must have an ‘expiry date’ at least 6 months after the date you arrive. 
Check with your travel provider that your passport and other travel documents meet requirements. Renew your passport if you need to.  
You will be denied entry if you do not have a valid travel document or try to use a passport that has been reported lost or stolen. 
Visa requirements 
You can travel to Ecuador for up to 90 days in any 12-month period without a visa.  
If you plan to stay longer, contact your nearest Ecuadorean Embassy (in Spanish) before travelling.  
If you’re already in Ecuador and want to stay longer than 90 days, you can pay to extend your stay (in Spanish) by an extra 90 days. You must apply for an extension before the first 90-day period ends or you could be fined.  
If you overstay your visa, you will get a fine when you leave. You will not be allowed to return to Ecuador unless you pay the fine before you leave the country. 
For immigration information, see Ecuador Migration. 
Applying for a visa 
To stay longer (to work or study, or for other reasons), contact the nearest Ecuadorean embassy (in Spanish) before you travel. The Ecuador Ministry of Foreign Affairs has visa application information (in Spanish). 
You should get an appointment before visiting the Ministry of Foreign Affairs and Human Mobility (MFA). For general guidance contact: consejeria@cancilleria.gob.ec or citasvisas@cancilleriga.gob.ec
Checks at border control 
You may be asked your reason for travel and for evidence of a return or onward journey.  
Peru and Colombia land border crossings 
If you enter Ecuador via land from Peru or Colombia, you must get an official passport entry stamp showing your arrival date. Sometimes buses do not stop at the border, which can lead to foreign visitors not getting a stamp. You could get a fine or be asked to return to the border. Contact an immigration office as soon as possible. 
Galapagos Islands 
Tourists can stay in the Galapagos Islands for up to 60 days. To enter Galapagos, you must have: 
evidence of a hotel booking or an invitation letter from your host  
evidence of a return flight to the Ecuadorean mainland  
completed an online Galapagos transit control card at least 24 hours before your flight – you must also keep a copy 
travel health insurance, which is mandatory for foreign tourists
Travelling with children 
Leaving Ecuador  
Some British children aged 17 and under must have a notarised consent letter (in Spanish) to leave Ecuador, if they are travelling alone or with one parent or legal guardian.
British children must have a notarised letter from parents or guardians not travelling with them if they were born in Ecuador, even if they’re travelling on a British passport, or live in Ecuador.
If they are tourists, British children (or British-Ecuadorean dual nationals) do not need a consent letter. 
If one parent is deceased, the other parent must submit the death certificate to an Ecuadorean public notary to get an indefinite notarial permit to travel with the child. 
In more complex situations, such as legal disputes, a child will need judicial written permission (‘Autorización de Viaje Judicial’) issued by an Ecuadorian judge (‘Juzgado de la Niñez y Adolescencia’).  
Entering Ecuador  
Children entering Ecuador with someone other than a parent or legal guardian do not need a consent letter. 
Vaccination requirements  
At least 8 weeks before your trip, check the vaccinations and certificates you need in TravelHealthPro’s Ecuador guide. 
Depending on your circumstances, these may include a yellow fever certificate.
Customs rules 
There are strict rules about goods you can take into or out of Ecuador via air and via land. You must declare anything that may be prohibited or subject to tax or duty. 
Taking money out of Ecuador  
You must declare cash you’re carrying when you leave Ecuador. You will have to pay tax on amounts over 1,350 US dollars.
