Coronavirus guidance is being updated.
Read the Prime Minister’s statement for the latest information.

There remain limited, indirect commercial options to return to the UK from Austria.
If you live in the UK and are currently visiting Austria, you’re strongly advised to return now by commercial means. Don’t run the risk of getting stranded.
UK special charter flights will only operate for priority countries where commercial options are not possible. You should not assume that these flights will become available in countries where commercial routes are operating. Please do not contact the contracted travel management company if no flight is advertised here.
Commercial flights
Indirect flights from Vienna to the UK are currently being offered by Lufthansa (via Frankfurt) and KLM (via Amsterdam).
Please also consider options from Munich Airport in Germany.
Travel via Germany
If you plan to return to the UK via Germany, it is possible to transit through Germany.
As with other forms of transport, many cross-Channel operators are operating substantially reduced services for passenger traffic. Passengers should check with their operator before departing, and may still be subject to severe disruption.
Check travel advice for any country that you will transit on the way back to the UK.
Future travel options
You will need to pay for your return travel to the UK. If departure options are available but you cannot afford the travel costs and have exhausted all other options for getting funds, you may be eligible to apply for an emergency loan from the government. This is a last resort option and you would need to repay the loan when you are back in the UK.
For more information, you should contact Corporate Travel Management (CTM). CTM are a commercial partner of the FCO and are authorised to administer such loans on behalf of the FCO.
Your journey home: re-entering the UK
When you return, you must follow the rules for entering the UK. You:
need to provide your journey and contact details up to 48 hours before you’re due to arrive in the UK
are not allowed to leave the place you’re staying for the first 14 days you’re in the UK except in very limited situations (known as ‘self-isolating’)
See also the list of people who are exempt from the border rules.
The National Travel Health Network and Centre (NaTHNaC) also provides advice on how to stay safe as you travel by air.
