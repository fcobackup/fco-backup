Entry rules in response to coronavirus (COVID-19)
Entry to Seychelles
The Department of Health has specified separate entry requirements for visitors and for returning residents or work permit holders. A full list of entry guidelines and application forms can be found on Department of Health website. If you intend to travel to Seychelles, you must ensure that you follow and understand the Department of Health guidelines.
Visitors may only be permitted to enter Seychelles from countries deemed to be a low or medium COVID-19 risk. A list of approved countries can be found on Department of Health website. The United Kingdom is currently considered a high-risk country by the health authorities in Seychelles. You should be aware that this list is updated regularly and can be changed without notice. Visitors who are permitted to enter Seychelles must provide proof of a negative COVID-19 test taken no more than 72 hours prior to boarding a flight to Seychelles and must also submit an entry application form in advance of travel. All passengers must also provide proof of accommodation in an approved establishment for the duration of their stay when entering Seychelles.
Seychellois nationals and returning residents currently in high-risk countries may be permitted entry to Seychelles, but will be required to undergo facility-based quarantine, at their own expense, for 14 days. All Seychellois and returning residents must provide proof of a negative COVID-19 test, produced no more than 72 hours before boarding their flight to Seychelles, regardless of the country from which they are travelling. An application for entry form should also be completed and returned to the Public Health Authority before travel. Gainful Occupation Permit (GOP) holders must follow the same guidelines, but must also be cleared by the Department of Employment and Immigration. If you are uncertain of your status, you should contact the Department of Employment and Immigration before attempting to enter Seychelles.
Cruise ships from any country worldwide will not be permitted to berth in Seychelles until further notice.
Seychelles International Airport may allow private jets and commercial charter flights to land if they are carrying passengers who will then be transferred to authorised yachts, or to specifically authorised tourist facilities. All passengers must have proof of a negative COVID-19 test performed in the 48 hours prior to boarding. You should contact your airline and the Seychelles Department of Health to understand when and if you will be permitted entry to Seychelles.
Permission for yachts to enter Seychelles waters may be granted by the Public Health Commissioner. Permission for crew to disembark will not be granted until the vessel has spent at least 14 days at sea. If you intend to enter Seychelles waters and if you wish to disembark from a vessel, you are required to contact the Seychelles Department of Health before attempting to do so.
Screening on arrival
All passengers will be temperature checked at all ports of arrival. If symptoms of COVID-19 are found to be present, tests will be conducted. Those found to be positive will be quarantined and re-checked.
Quarantine requirements
Visitors who meet other entry requirements, will not be required to quarantine or self-isolate on arrival to Seychelles.
Seychellois and returning residents will be required to quarantine or self-isolate on arrival. Individuals who have spent at least 14 days in a low or medium risk country before travelling to Seychelles will be permitted to self-isolate in their homes for up to 14 days upon entering Seychelles. Seychellois and returning residents travelling from high-risk countries may be permitted entry to Seychelles, but will be required to undergo quarantine at a government facility, at their own expense, for 14 days.
Regular entry requirements
The Government of Seychelles is reviewing its policies on Gainful Occupational Permits (GOPs) for foreign nationals. Following the economic impact of the coronavirus, it is a possibility that GOPs for some foreign nationals will not be renewed. You should speak to your employer and contact the Government of Seychelles Department for Immigration and Civil Status if you hold a GOP and are concerned about your employment status in Seychelles.

Visas are not required for British passport holders.
Passport validity
Your passport should be valid for the proposed duration of your stay. No additional period of validity beyond this is required.
