This page reflects the UK government’s understanding of current rules for people travelling on a full ‘British Citizen’ passport, for the most common types of travel.
The authorities in North Macedonia set and enforce entry rules. If you’re unsure how North Macedonia’s entry requirements apply to you, contact its UK embassy, high commission or consulate. You should also consider checking with your transport provider or travel company to make sure your passport and other travel documents meet their requirements.
Entry rules in response to coronavirus (COVID-19)
There are currently no entry rules in response to coronavirus.
Demonstrating your COVID-19 status
North Macedonia will accept the UK’s proof of COVID-19 recovery and vaccination record and proof of COVID-19 vaccination issued in the Crown Dependencies. If you are travelling with a printed PDF proof of vaccination status, it must date from 1 November 2021 to ensure that the certificate can be scanned successfully. Your NHS appointment card from vaccination centres is not designed to be used as proof of vaccination and should not be used to demonstrate your vaccine status.
Border crossings
All land border crossings in North Macedonia are open for movement of passengers and vehicles. Neighbouring countries may have different entry and exit restrictions on their side of the border. You should check before travelling.
Some border crossings in neighbouring countries may still be closed or subject to entry requirements. It is your responsibility to ensure that you can enter the next country on your journey. Check country-specific FCDO Travel Advice for details.
Regular entry requirements
Visas
British passport holders don’t need a visa to travel to North Macedonia for up to 3 months.
Holders of UK Refugee Travel Documents travelling to North Macedonia or transiting the country en-route to Kosovo, must obtain visas for travel to, or transit through, North Macedonia from the Embassy of North Macedonia in London.
If you plan to stay for longer than 3 months, contact the Embassy of North Macedonia in London.
Unaccompanied minors (children under 18) must have a letter of consent from their parents or guardian. Failure to do so may result into refusal of entry and deportation.
Passport validity
Passports and other documents accepted for entry must be valid for a minimum of 90 days from the arrival date.
Registering with the police
You must register with the local police in the town/city where you’re staying within 24 hours of your arrival in North Macedonia, unless you’re in a hotel in which case you will be registered automatically when checking in. You should retain the registration document as proof of registration until your departure from North Macedonia.
If you don’t register you may receive a fine of between 600 and 1,000 Euros, and be detained or face a court appearance (which may include a restriction on your ability to return to North Macedonia).
Travel to Serbia
Foreign nationals, including those from the United Kingdom, have sometimes been denied entry into the Republic of Serbia from North Macedonia if they hold entry/exit stamps from Kosovo.
