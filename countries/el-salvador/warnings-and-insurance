State of Emergency
The Government of El Salvador declared a 15-day State of Emergency on Sunday 16 June in the face of sustained heavy rainfall. They have advised everyone to stay in their homes. As of Monday 17 June, there are reports of over 40 landslides, hundreds of fallen trees and dozens of roads blocked. Some forecasts suggest that the rainfall this week will be the equivalent of El Salvadorâ€™s normal entire annual rainfall. British nationals are advised to follow the advice of the Government and to cooperate with local authorities. See the extreme weather and natural hazards for further advice about what to do ahead of a storm and what to expect in the aftermath of a storm.
