Coronavirus guidance is being updated.
Read the Prime Minister’s statement for the latest information.

The information on this page covers the most common types of travel and reflects the UK government’s understanding of the rules currently in place. Unless otherwise stated, this information is for travellers using a full ‘British Citizen’ passport.
The authorities in the country or territory you’re travelling to are responsible for setting and enforcing the rules for entry. If you’re unclear about any aspect of the entry requirements, or you need further reassurance, you’ll need to contact the embassy, high commission or consulate of the country or territory you’re travelling to.
You should also consider checking with your transport provider or travel company to make sure your passport and other travel documents meet their requirements.
Restrictions in response to coronavirus
Entry
The Government of Myanmar has suspended all commercial passenger flights from any of its airports until 30 June. It will then review the situation.
From 1 June the Myanmar authorities have revised quarantine arrangements for British nationals arriving in Myanmar on either visit or business visas. A mixture of quarantine and self-isolation measures will apply in addition to medical checks. These arrangements are subject to change and at short notice.
All arrivals will need to:
Have completed one week quarantine in the “respective home country” prior to boarding flight to Myanmar. (The British Embassy is seeking clarity on what this means for those currently or normally in a country other than UK and what evidence is required to prove this).
On arrival in Myanmar will be temperature-checked and must provide a “Covid-Free” certificate.
Complete 7 days quarantine in a government facility. (The British Embassy is seeking clarity on where these facilities are and if any exemptions will apply)
Complete a further 7 days of self-isolation at home at a verifiable address.
Before travel, we advise that all visitors check with their nearest Myanmar Embassy to confirm their current visa will allow them entry, or the criteria for obtaining or renewing a visa.
Visas
British Nationals usually resident in Myanmar but currently away with expired business visas, should apply for a single entry business visa at your nearest Myanmar Embassy (with a sponsorship letter from your employer). You should then apply for a long term multi-entry visa in Myanmar when you return.
New tourist visa applications are currently suspended.

Passport validity
Your passport should be valid for a minimum period of 6 months from the date of entry into Myanmar. The British Government has advised the Myanmar government of a “virtual six-month extension” for all British passports’ validity.
Yellow fever
Check whether you need a yellow fever certificate by visiting the National Travel Health Network and Centre’s TravelHealthPro website.
UK Emergency Travel Documents
UK Emergency Travel Documents (ETDs) are not valid for entry into Myanmar. However, ETDs are accepted for exit from Myanmar.
