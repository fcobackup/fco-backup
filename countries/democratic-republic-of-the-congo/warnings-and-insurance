Security situation in DRC
If you are in Goma or Bukavu, you should leave while routes remain available.
There are reports of fighting in Goma and that M23 have captured the city. We advise against all travel to Goma and Bukavu.
The border crossings between Rwanda and the DRC at Gisenyi/Goma could close at short notice.
There are reports that Goma Airport has been attacked by M23 forces and that commercial flights are no longer operating from the airport. Routes to depart Bukavu are limited. Support from the UK government is severely limited outside Kinshasa. You should not assume that FCDO will be able to provide assistance to leave the country in the event of serious unrest or crisis.
On 28 January there were large and violent protests outside multiple embassies in Kinshasa, in response to the fighting in Goma in eastern DRC. Stay alert and avoid any protests. Carry an identification document, limit movements and be cautious if you are travelling at night.
