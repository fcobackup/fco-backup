Apart from Ecuadorean-minted 5c, 10c, 25c and 50c coins, which are used in parallel with the US equivalents, the US Dollar is the only legal currency in Ecuador. Credit cards and travellers’ cheques are generally accepted in cities.
The maximum tax free cash limit that can be taken out of the country is US$1,350 (equivalent to 3 minimum salaries).

If you wish to take more than this amount of cash out of the country you will be required to pay 3.7% tax (ISD).
