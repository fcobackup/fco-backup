Djibouti remains one of the main routes for those fleeing the conflict in Yemen. Limited arrangements are in place to facilitate onward travel for British nationals arriving in Djibouti. However, the UK government’s ability to help is limited and you’ll be expected to cover the cost of visas, accommodation, insurance and onward travel yourself. Any travel options you pursue are taken at your own risk.
Consular support is limited in Djibouti as there is no British Embassy. The British Honorary Consul in Djibouti can only offer limited help. However, the British Embassy in Addis Ababa, Ethiopia can provide consular support to British nationals. If you need consular assistance you should contact the British Embassy in Addis Ababa.
