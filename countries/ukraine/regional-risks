To enter or exit Crimea
In theory foreign nationals need to provide their passport and a special permit issued by the territorial body of the State Migration Service of Ukraine. However, due to the ongoing war in Ukraine, it is not currently possible for foreign nationals to enter or exit Crimea.
The Crimean sea ports of Kerch, Sevastopol, Feodosia, Yalta and Yevpatoria have been designated by the Ukrainian authorities as closed to international shipping.
