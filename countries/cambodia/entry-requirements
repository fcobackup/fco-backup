The information on this page covers the most common types of travel and reflects the UK government’s understanding of the rules currently in place. Unless otherwise stated, this information is for travellers using a full ‘British Citizen’ passport.
The authorities in the country or territory you’re travelling to are responsible for setting and enforcing the rules for entry. If you’re unclear about any aspect of the entry requirements, or you need further reassurance, you’ll need to contact the embassy, high commission or consulate of the country or territory you’re travelling to.
You should also consider checking with your transport provider or travel company to make sure your passport and other travel documents meet their requirements.
Visas
We have been made aware that restrictions on travellers coming from France, Germany, Italy, Spain and the USA are to be introduced from 17th March. We are awaiting confirmation the Cambodian Government.
Tourist visas are available on arrival at Phnom Penh or Siem Reap international airports. If you wish to get a visa on arrival you should arrive with a passport photograph. You can also get an eVisa online before you travel.
Visa fees, conditions and photograph requirements are subject to change. Check the Royal Cambodian Embassy, or the Ministry of Foreign Affairs & International Co-operation website for the latest information on fees, conditions and photograph requirements and on how to apply for an e-visa.
Tourist visas issued by a Royal Cambodian Embassy abroad may appear to have a longer validity than 1 month. The validity of the visa refers to time you have to enter Cambodia. The visa is valid for 30 days from the actual date of entry into Cambodia. Make sure your passport is stamped on arrival, and keep the departure form. If you lose your departure form, you’ll need to contact immigration officials before you leave the country to make alternative arrangements.
You can be fined, detained and deported if you overstay your visa. There is a fine of $10 per day for overstaying the validity term of your visa. There is no limit to this fine. Those who overstay more than 30 days will be required to leave Cambodia in addition to paying the fine.
If you lose your passport with your Cambodia visa (and corresponding entry stamp), you’ll need to get an exit visa from the Cambodian authorities once you have received an Emergency Travel Document from the British Embassy. An exit visa will cost $30 and must be obtained from the Cambodian Immigration Department in Phnom Penh, 332, Russian Boulevard, Phnom Penh, Cambodia. The exit visa will take up to 3 working days to be processed by the Cambodian authorities.
Regional travel
All tourist boats that would enter Cambodia at Kaom Samnor, on the Mekong River, are prohibited from entering
Recent changes to visa requirements for Thailand may affect travellers wishing to make regular crossings at the land border between Cambodia and Thailand. See travel advice for Thailand for further information.
There is disruption and restrictions on British nationals visiting Vietnam from Cambodia. Anyone planning to travel to Vietnam from Cambodia is advised to get a visa before booking flights.
If you already have a valid Vietnamese visa you should check with the Vietnamese Embassy well in advance of travelling.
In addition to the suspension of the visa waiver for British nationals, we understand that the Vietnamese Ministry of Public Security has stopped processing e-visa applications for British nationals and people coming from or in transit through virus hit areas.
See Travel Advice Vietnam for further details.
More general information on land border crossings from Laos and Vietnam is available e at the Ministry of Foreign Affairs & International Co-operation website.
Passport validity
Your passport should be valid for a minimum period of 6 months from the date of entry into Cambodia. Entry is normally refused if you have a damaged passport or pages missing.
Your passport should also be valid for a minimum period of 6 months for any subsequent renewal or extension of your visa that you apply for from within Cambodia.
Work permits
To work in Cambodia, you’ll need a valid business visa and a valid work permit. Business visas are issued by the Immigration Department and are usually available on arrival in Phnom Penh airport, or at the Immigration Department. You may be able to apply for a Business visa in advance at your nearest Cambodian Embassy. Your employer will need to apply for your work permit from the Department of Labour and Social Affairs.
The Cambodian government is enforcing these rules more strictly than in previous years. There is some uncertainty about whether the government will impose charges retroactively on individuals who did not have valid work permits previously. Procedures are subject to change and you should always consult the relevant Cambodian government department for the latest advice.

UK Emergency Travel Documents
