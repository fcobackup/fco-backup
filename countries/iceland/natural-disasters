Iceland is volcanically and seismically active.
The Icelandic Met Office issued a yellow warning on 17 November 2017 for Öræfajökull, the volcanic glacier in southeast Iceland. This warning indicates higher than normal levels of volcanic activity. In case of an emergency, the Department of Civil Protection and Emergency Management in Iceland will send out text messages to everyone situated in the area of Öræfajökull.
A large volcanic eruption took place in the area around the Bárðarbunga volcano on the Vatnajökull glacier in the east of Iceland in August 2014. Eyjafjallajokull and Grimsvötn volcanoes erupted in 2010 and 2011 respectively causing disruption to Icelandic and European airspace.
Further volcanic eruptions are possible and there is the potential for sulphur dioxide and other volcanic gases to be emitted during eruptions.
If you have existing respiratory conditions, take particular care and monitor the advice of the Icelandic authorities.
