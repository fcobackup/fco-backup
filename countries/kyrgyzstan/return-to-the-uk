Coronavirus guidance is being updated.
Read the Prime Minister’s statement for the latest information.

There are currently no commercial options available to return to the UK from Kyrgyzstan. There are no commercial flights scheduled and all land borders are closed. Turkish Airlines have now suspended draft plans to resume flights between Bishkek and Istanbul from 22 June, as the Kyrgyz government have not granted permission for international flights to resume.
We know the lack of commercial flights is concerning for British people trying to leave Kyrgyzstan. The UK government is working closely with airlines, the Kyrgyz authorities and other governments to make sure options are available for you to return to the UK as soon as possible.
Whilst you cannot leave Kyrgyzstan at this time, you should:
follow the advice of local authorities, including local measures to help minimise your risk of exposure to coronavirus
find accommodation that’s suitable for your needs.
keep in regular contact with family and friends at home, so they know you are safe and well

Future travel options
The UK government is working closely with airlines, the Kyrgyz authorities and other governments to make sure options are available for you to return to the UK as soon as possible.
This travel advice will be updated when departure options become available.

You will need to pay for your return travel to the UK. If departure options become available but you cannot afford the travel costs and have exhausted all other options for getting funds, you may be eligible to apply for an emergency loan from the government. This is a last resort option and you would need to repay the loan when you are back in the UK.
For more information, you should contact Corporate Travel Management (CTM). CTM is a commercial partner of the FCO and authorised to administer such loans on behalf of the FCO.
Your journey home: re-entering the UK
When you return, you must follow the rules for entering the UK. You:
need to provide your journey and contact details up to 48 hours before you’re due to arrive in the UK
are not allowed to leave the place you’re staying for the first 14 days you’re in the UK except in very limited situations (known as ‘self-isolating’)
See also the list of people who are exempt from the border rules.
The National Travel Health Network and Centre (NaTHNaC) also provides advice on how to stay safe as you travel by air.
