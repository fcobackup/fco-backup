Entry and borders
The Burundi authorities have announced the suspension of flights into and out of Bujumbura International Airport except for cargo flights.
Any arrivals from affected countries, including the UK, will be placed in compulsory quarantine for 14 days. This also includes anyone who has spent the past 14 days in affected countries prior to entering Burundi. Screening measures are in place at both air and road borders.
Visas
The Burundi authorities will no longer issue new visas, and will only renew visas for those already in Burundi.
If you need further information about entry requirements, contact the local immigration authorities or the nearest Burundi embassy. You should also check with your airline or travel company for the latest information.
