Crime
Around 20,000 British nationals live in Qatar, and approximately 130,000 visit annually. Most visits are trouble-free.
Although crime levels are low, female visitors should take extra care when travelling alone at night.
Only use registered taxis and don’t enter a taxi late at night unaccompanied.
If you’re a victim of sexual assault, you should contact the British Embassy at the earliest opportunity.
Road travel
You can drive using a full and valid UK driving licence for up to 12 months from the date of your arrival in the country, as a visitor or a resident, without the need to undertake a driving test. After this, you’ll need to apply for a Qatari driving licence and sit both theory and practical tests. If you intend to drive using an UK licence in Qatar, you should obtain an International Driving Permit before travelling.
Road discipline is very poor; speeds are high and minor accidents common. Qatar has very high fatality rate for road accidents. If you have an accident, stay with your vehicle. It’s an offence to leave the scene of the accident, but if no one has been injured and it’s safe to do so, you can move your vehicle to a safer place. You’ll need to get a police report for insurance purposes.
The driver and front seat passenger should wear a seat belt at all times. You must not use a mobile phone while driving. Even minor expressions of ‘road rage’ like rude gestures can attract significant penalties. Offenders may be fined, imprisoned and/or deported. You may be banned from leaving the country until your case has been resolved.  More serious cases may take up to 6 months to be heard.
Excursions to the desert can be hazardous unless in a properly equipped 4 x 4 vehicle. Always travel in convoy with other cars, take a supply of water and a mobile telephone, and leave travel plans with friends or relatives.
It’s an offence in Qatar to drink and drive, and there is zero tolerance for it. Driving under the influence of alcohol is punishable by a custodial sentence of between one month and three years, a fine of QAR10,000 (approx £2,100) to QAR50,000 (approx £10,500), or both. Offenders may also be deported.
Sea travel
Many areas of the Gulf are highly sensitive, including near maritime boundaries and the islands of Abu Musa and the Tunbs in the southern Gulf. Vessels entering these areas have been detained and inspected, and there have been occasional arrests. You should make careful enquiries before entering these waters or visiting ports.
Regional tensions may also affect your route. Vessels operating in the Gulf of Oman, Northern Arabian Sea, Gulf of Aden and Bab El Mandeb regions may be at increased risk of maritime attack.
Take care when travelling by Dhow, as the safety of these vessels may not be up to UK standards. Make sure life jackets are available.
Political situation
Regional developments continue to have an impact on local public opinion in the region. You should be aware of local sensitivities on these issues. You should follow news reports and avoid public gatherings and demonstrations. There is the potential for increased tension on Fridays.
