This page reflects the UK government’s understanding of current rules for people travelling on a full ‘British Citizen’ passport, for the most common types of travel.
The authorities in Réunion set and enforce entry rules. For further information contact the embassy, high commission or consulate of the country or territory you’re travelling to. You should also consider checking with your transport provider or travel company to make sure your passport and other travel documents meet their requirements.
Entry rules in response to coronavirus (COVID-19)
Travel to Réunion is severely restricted until further notice. Only travellers who can prove that entry is for essential reasons will be allowed to enter, and they will be expected to fill in a travel certificate (available here) and provide proof. The local Prefecture website will have details of any further local restrictions. Quarantine may be requested by authorities in other territories if travelling from Réunion.
All travellers over the age of 11 must undertake a test for COVID-19 within 72 hours before departure for Réunion. The test is obligatory and the traveller must show proof of a negative result before embarking. Arrivals to Réunion will be required to self-isolate for seven days, before taking another PCR test.
Travellers may also need to produce a self-certified document affirming that they have no COVID symptoms and that to their knowledge they have not been in contact with any person confirmed positive within the last 14 days. You should check with your travel operator and the local Prefecture’s advice ahead of travel.
Airlines may refuse boarding to anyone who does not produce both proof of a negative result and the self-certified document.
These entry requirements are subject to change. For further information on the entry restrictions in place for French Overseas Territories, see the French government’s website before travelling.

Regular entry requirements
Visas
Réunion is an Overseas Department of France (département d’outre-mer) and part of the European Union.
If you hold a British Citizen passport, you don’t need a visa to enter Réunion for stays of up to three months. Other British passport holders, and those who plan to stay longer than three months, should check the current entry requirements on the website of the French Ministry of Foreign Affairs and, if necessary, confirm with the nearest French Diplomatic mission.
Passport validity
You must have at least sixmonths left on an adult or child passport to travel to most countries in Europe (not including Ireland).
If you renewed your current passport before the previous one expired, extra months may have been added to its expiry date. Any extra months on your passport over 10 years may not count towards the six months needed.
Check your passport is valid for travel before you book your trip. You will need to renew your passport before travelling if you do not have enough time left on your passport.
UK residents in Réunion
If you live in Réunion, you should carry your residence document, as well as your valid passport when you travel. If you have applied but not yet received your document, carry your certificate of application. You will have received this as an email. If you have not yet applied for a residence document, you should carry evidence that you are resident in Réunion. This could include a tenancy agreement or a utility bill in your name, dating from 2020. For more information, including on how to apply for a residence document, see the French government’s website.
