Cases of coronavirus (COVID-19) have been confirmed in Spain. The Spanish authorities have introduced a number of measures to limit the spread of the virus.
If you’re currently in Spain, follow the advice of local authorities. Anybody planning to travel to Spain should consult their airline or tour operator.
British travellers who are currently in Spain and who wish to return to the UK are advised to make travel plans to do so as soon as possible.
Spain declared a State of Emergency (“Estado de Alarma”) on 14 March, which introduces a series of measures including significant restrictions on movement throughout the country in response to the coronavirus outbreak. These measures affect:
Accommodation
The Spanish government has ordered hotels and short-stay accommodation (such as short-stay campsites or caravan parks) must close by midnight 26 March. British travellers who are currently in Spain and who wish to return to the UK are advised to make travel plans to do so as soon as possible.
If you’re currently on holiday in Spain, check with your tour operator or accommodation provider for further information. If you’re travelling and wish to return to the UK, contact your tour operator, checking the website of their airlines or ferry companies for further advice. The Spanish authorities may ask British travellers to move hotels before 26 March and have underlined that no-one will be left without accommodation.
These measures do not apply to long term accommodation, such as long-stay campsites, as long as clients can cater for themselves, in their own spaces (ie. that clients do not rely on communal facilities).
Land borders
From Tuesday 17 March until the end of the State of Emergency, land borders are closed for entry to Spain, with the following exceptions: Spanish nationals, Spain residents, frontier workers and those able to prove that they need to enter for essential reasons.
The land borders remain open for those leaving Spain. British nationals can still drive through France to return to the UK, but they will need to complete an ‘attestation’ (declaration) specifying the reason for being outside.
If you’re planning to use this route, check the latest FCO travel advice for France ahead of your journey. At present, air and maritime borders remain open, but many airlines and ferry companies are operating revised or reduced services.
Public places and transport
Public gatherings are banned, most shops other than those selling food or other essential items such as pharmacies will be closed, many businesses and all schools and universities are closed, and all citizens have been instructed to remain at home except when going about a limited set of activities, in particular:
to buy food or other essential items
to return home to their primary residence
to go to hospital or other health centres
to go to work (if unable to work from home)
to carry out caring or similar duties or in case of real need.
Transport services will be operating at reduced levels.
Travel to airports to leave Spain is still permitted, but travellers may be asked to provide evidence that they are departing Spain (i.e. plane ticket).
