If you have a health condition, or you are pregnant, you may need specialist healthcare abroad. Check whether your destination country can provide the healthcare you may need and ensure you have appropriate travel insurance for unexpected medical evacuation or local treatment.
See the Coronavirus travel health and Healthcare sections in the Coronavirus page for COVID-19 health information.
At least 8 weeks before your trip, check the latest country-specific health advice from the National Travel Health Network and Centre (NaTHNaC) on the TravelHealthPro website. Each country-specific page has information on vaccine recommendations, any current health risks or outbreaks, and factsheets with information on staying healthy abroad. Guidance is also available from NHS (Scotland) on the FitForTravel website.
General information on travel vaccinations and a travel health checklist is available on the NHS website. You may then wish to contact your health adviser or pharmacy for advice on other preventive measures and managing any pre-existing medical conditions while you’re abroad.
The legal status and regulation of some medicines prescribed or purchased in the UK can be different in other countries. If you’re travelling with prescription or over-the-counter medicine, read this guidance from NaTHNaC on best practice when travelling with medicines. For further information on the legal status of a specific medicine, you’ll need to contact the embassy, high commission or consulate of the country or territory you’re travelling to.

Yellow fever
The Ecuadorean authorities recommend travellers have a yellow fever vaccination if travelling to some areas in the Amazon region. A yellow fever vaccination is obligatory when entering Ecuador from endemic countries such as Brazil, Dominican Republic, Congo, Uganda, etc).
High altitude
Altitude sickness is a risk in parts of Ecuador, including Quito which is at 2,800m. Don’t underestimate the effects of high altitude on your body. If you plan to travel to altitudes over 2,500 metres, discuss the health risks associated with travelling to high altitude with your GP before you travel. More information about altitude sickness is available from TravelHealthPro.
Be aware of higher exposure to UV radiation. Since January 2020, the levels of UV radiation have significantly increased throughout Ecuador. You should use a high factor sunblock, wear long sleeved clothing and keep very well hydrated.
Stay hydrated
It is advisable to drink only boiled, filtered or bottled water and avoid ice in drinks. Make sure ice is also made from boiled or bottled water, especially outside urban areas.
If you are taking a long bus/plane journey, make sure you keep yourself well hydrated during the trip and move around regularly.
Local medical care
The Ecuadorean public healthcare system provides the same level of assistance to locals and foreigners, at no cost. However, good/specialised medical treatment may not always be available outside the main cities. Private treatment can be very expensive and private hospitals will require a credit card guarantee for admission.
You should contact your insurance/medical assistance company promptly if you are referred to a medical facility for treatment.
Make sure you have adequate travel and medical insurance and accessible funds to cover the cost of any medical treatment abroad and repatriation. For life threatening emergencies, in principle every private or public health institution is obliged by law to assist patients.
There are limited facilities on the Galapagos Islands. If you travel to the Galapagos make sure your insurance includes evacuation by air ambulance. San Cristóbal island has a well-equipped public hospital, but Santa Cruz island only has a basic hospital and Isabela Island only has a very small and extremely basic health centre. If you travel to the Galapagos Islands by boat, you may be asked to supply information such as your blood group and emergency contact information when you board the ship.
If you need emergency medical assistance during your trip, dial 911 and ask for an ambulance. Consider using the ECU 911 free smartphone application to register any medical issues and to report various types of emergencies involving yourself or others for emergency assistance.
