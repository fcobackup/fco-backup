Healthcare in Paraguay
If you think you have COVID-19 symptoms, dial the Ministry of Health hotline at 154.
The public healthcare system varies across the country, and in some cities in Paraguay, the additional burden of treating Covid-19 patients might affect services such as accident and emergency care. Some private hospitals might not accept credit card payments for admissions and only accept patients with valid health insurance. Short-term foreign visitors are required to demonstrate proof of medical insurance before boarding their flight to Paraguay. Check with your airline carrier.
Check if your travel or health insurance has comprehensive cover for coronavirus and refer to official channels in your location for further details.
