There are enhanced quarantine procedures at entry points to Japan such as airports and ports. The authorities may carry out extended health checks on arrival including compulsory hospitalisation.

Local measures
The majority of primary and secondary schools remain closed until the end of regular spring holidays in early April. Many large-scale cultural and sporting events remain cancelled.
Hokkaido Prefecture has lifted its state of emergency, although residents will still be asked to stay indoors at the weekend.
Visas
Japan has suspended its visa waiver system for anyone travelling on a British Citizen or British National (Overseas) passport until at least the end of April 2020, among other measures. This means that you will not be able to enter Japan as a visitor without a visa. Single and multiple entry visas have also been suspended. See Entry requirements
