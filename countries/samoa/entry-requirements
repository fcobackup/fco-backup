This information is for people travelling on a full ‘British citizen’ passport from the UK. It is based on the UK government’s understanding of Samoa’s current rules for the most common types of travel.
The authorities in Samoa set and enforce entry rules. If you’re not sure how these requirements apply to you, contact the Samoan High Commission in Brussels. 
Passport validity requirements 
To enter Samoa, your passport must have an ‘expiry date’ at least 6 months after the date you arrive. Check with your travel provider that your passport and other travel documents meet requirements. Renew your passport if you need to.  
You will be denied entry if you do not have a valid travel document or try to use a passport that has been reported lost or stolen. 
Visa requirements 
You can visit Samoa without a visa for up to 60 days. Border officials will issue a free visitor permit or business visitor permit using your arrival card. You may need to show: 
an onward or return ticket 
sufficient funds – a bank statement is acceptable evidence 
confirmed accommodation such as a hotel booking or letter of invitation 
To stay longer than 60 days, or for work, study or other reasons, apply for a Samoan entry permit. 
Vaccine requirements 
To enter Samoa, you must have a certificate to prove you’ve had a yellow fever vaccination if you’re coming from a country listed as a transmission risk.  
For full details about medical entry requirements and recommended vaccinations, see TravelHealthPro’s Samoa guide.  
Departure tax for flights to American Samoa  
If you are flying from Samoa to American Samoa, you must pay a departure tax of 40 Samoan tala.  
Customs rules 
There are strict regulations covering the import of firearms, plant and animal products, pets and recreational drugs. You must declare anything that may be prohibited or subject to tax or duty. 
Taking money into Samoa 
Declare cash or travellers cheques if the value is 20,000 talas or more. You will get a certified declaration to show you brought it with you.
