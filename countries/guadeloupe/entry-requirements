This page reflects the UK government’s understanding of current rules for people travelling on a full ‘British Citizen’ passport, for the most common types of travel.
The authorities in Guadeloupe set and enforce entry rules. For further information contact the embassy, high commission or consulate of the country or territory you’re travelling to. You should also consider checking with your transport provider or travel company to make sure your passport and other travel documents meet their requirements.
Entry rules in response to coronavirus (COVID-19)
All travellers over the age of 11 must undertake a test for COVID-19 within 72 hours before departure for Guadeloupe. The test is obligatory and the traveller must show proof of a negative result before embarking.
Travellers must also provide a self-certified document affirming that they have no COVID symptoms and that to their knowledge they have not been in contact with any person confirmed positive within the last 14 days.
Airlines will refuse boarding to anyone who does not produce both proof of a negative result and the self-certified document.
The French Government has outlined new measures to stem the spread of coronavirus, which also apply to the French Overseas Territories. The local Prefecture website will have details of any further local restriction. Please see the Travel Advice for France for more information on Covid-19.
Regular entry requirements
Visas
Guadeloupe is an Overseas Department of France (département d’outre-mer).
If your passport describes you as a British Citizen, you will not need a visa to enter Guadeloupe. Other British passport holders should check the current entry requirements on the website of the French Ministry of Foreign Affairs and if necessary confirm with the nearest French Diplomatic mission.
If the UK leaves the EU without a deal, the current visa policy for British Citizens visiting Guadeloupe may change. We’re working with the relevant authorities to clarify entry requirements and this page will be updated as soon as further information is available. If you would like more details in the meantime, or want to discuss a specific issue, you should consult the French Embassy in London. If you’re a British Overseas Territories Citizen passport holder the current visa policy for travel to Guadeloupe will be unaffected by the UK leaving the EU.
Passport validity
Your passport should be valid for the proposed duration of your stay. No additional period of validity beyond this is required. 
Yellow fever certificate requirements
Check whether you need a yellow fever certificate by visiting the National Travel Health Network and Centre’s TravelHealthPro website.
UK Emergency Travel Documents
UK ETDs are accepted for entry, airside transit and exit from Guadeloupe.
