Ecuador’s National Emergency Operations Committee (COE) has announced that from Friday 21 May all social mass events and public gatherings continue to be suspended, mixed on-line/in person schooling is prohibited, inter provincial buses can operate at 75% capacity, and that both public and private sectors should continue prioritising virtual working.
The power to impose further restrictions, including curfew hours, transit and other controls on social gatherings lies with local municipalities and other competent authorities, in conjunction with Ecuador’s National Emergency Operations Committee.
Please check more detailed information with local authorities – details below - to ensure that you comply with any local restrictions, including vehicle circulation restrictions in your area.
Restrictions do not apply for key sectors such as public and private healthcare, security, basic public services, emergency response, produce sectors and those who need to transport goods and food. People who are transporting passengers to/from the airport (showing flight tickets) and verified medical emergencies and appointments are also exempt.
Restrictions
The central government´s “red, amber, green” alert system is no longer in force. However, it will be used as an internal management tool for epidemiological monitoring.
Each municipal government is responsible for determining its own specific restrictions including, but not limited to, maximum capacity for public transport, the circulation of private vehicles against licence plate numbers, health prevention protocols for all businesses and industries and alcohol sale and consumption.
We strongly recommend that you follow the local municipalities’ social media channels to obtain the most up to date notifications, but bear in mind that these might change at any time:
Quito: @MunicipioQuito; Guayaquil: @alcaldiagye; Cuenca: @MunicipioCuenca; Galapagos: @CGGalapagos
Ecuador’s National Emergency Operations Committee (COE) has a website with their official resolutions (Spanish only).
Within the national health emergency, the Ecuadorean Ministry of Health will continue to issue the required health prevention measures, including PCR tests and any mandatory self-isolation (Aislamiento Preventivo Obligatorio – APO) requirements.
Restrictions in Quito
Quito Municipality continues with its campaign to increase testing and triage. In addition to adhering to the standard general biosecurity measures, you must also carry an identity card at all times.
All COVID-19 measures will continue to be enforced robustly and infringements will be handled by the relevant competent authorities.
The “Hoy No Circula” circulation private vehicle restriction system has been reactivated from 21 May to 30 June 2021.
Vehicles with number plates ending in the following numbers cannot circulate on the following days:
Monday: 0, 1, 2, 3
Tuesday: 2, 3, 4, 5
Wednesday: 4, 5, 6, 7
Thursday: 6, 7, 8, 9
Friday: 8, 9, 0, 1
From Monday to Thursday, the “Hoy No Circula” vehicle restriction is between 6am to 8pm and on Friday from 6am to 11pm. This is only applicable for the urban areas of Quito Metropolitan District.
All vehicle number plates are allowed to circulate on Saturday, from 6am to 11pm, and on Sundays from 6am to 12pm, and whole day on official public holidays.
Within Quito Municipality´s Resolution A022-2021 of 18 May, a complete restriction of transport circulation has been issued for Friday and Saturday for the whole Metropolitan District, from 11pm to 6am of the following day.
Vehicle circulation restrictions do not apply for verified medical emergencies and appointments; for transfers to the airport (showing flight tickets) and for key sectors with safe passage documents.
In addition, people who work for certain vital sectors, such as health, food provision, financial and emergencies, will be allowed to circulate on the days which the vehicle’s number plate would not normally be permitted to circulate. You must present valid credentials or proof of emergency if stopped by a local authority. The issuance of special safe passage documents (“salvoconductos”) has been reinstated for private vehicles that can justify their need to circulate inside the “Hoy No Circula” restrictions.
All public and social gatherings are prohibited. Pubs and nightclubs are closed until further notice. All sport activities that cannot comply with the minimum distancing requirements are also suspended temporarily.
You will be fined 50% of a minimum salary if you are found drinking in public spaces (including inside vehicles).
Restaurants, shopping centres, public transport, bus terminals and tourist transport can operate at a maximum of 50% capacity. Cinemas, theatres and gyms (complying with minimum distancing requirements) can operate at a maximum capacity of 30%.

Healthcare in Ecuador
If you present symptoms while in Ecuador, you should call 171 and you will be attended by trained Ministry of Health personnel. You can also call 911, which has some English-speaking operators. For further information (in Spanish), follow the Ministry of Health official social media channels @Salud_Ec.
The authorities have allowed for privately-arranged COVID-19 tests in laboratories approved by the Ministry of Health. On 20 April 2021, the central government set maximum reference costs for these tests.
The Ecuadorean government recommends the “SaludEC” app, a new platform to support COVID-19 response, by registering for general reports and official announcements. It provides information to evaluate potential COVID-19 symptoms. It also allows online medical checks and scheduling appointments at Ministry of Health centres for non-coronavirus needs.

COVID-19 vaccines if you live in Ecuador
Wherever possible British nationals should aim to be vaccinated in the country where they live. As further information is available about the national vaccination programme, this page will be updated. Sign up to get email notifications.
The new Ecuadorean government has made changes to the official vaccination programme (“Plan de Vacunación 9/100”). The Ministry of Health has partnered with the National Electoral Council (CNE) to use the electoral roll to determine who needs to be vaccinated, and where. This means that if you did not register to vote in the latest Ecuadorean elections you may not currently be registered for vaccination. You can check if you are registered by accessing the new official website (available in Spanish only) and entering your Ecuadorean ID number (“cédula”) and your date of birth. If you are registered, you will be given an estimated date of vaccination as well as the assigned venue. If you are not registered, you can sign up for a vaccine at: https://registrovacunacion.cne.gob.ec/
The Medicines and Healthcare Products Regulatory Agency (MHRA) is the UK authority responsible for assessing the safety, quality and efficacy of vaccines. It has authorised the Pfizer/BioNTech, Oxford/AstraZeneca and Moderna vaccines for temporary supply and use in the UK. Find out more about MHRA approval for these vaccines.
British nationals living overseas should seek medical advice from their local healthcare provider in the country where they reside. Information about vaccines used in other national programmes, including regulatory status, should be available from the local authorities. This list of Stringent Regulatory Authorities recognised by the World Health Organisation may also be a useful source of additional information. Find out more about COVID-19 vaccines on the World Health Organisation COVID-19 vaccines page.
