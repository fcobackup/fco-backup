You should respect local customs, which are strictly observed, and religious sensitivities.  
Do not wear beachwear when away from beaches and hotels. 
Homosexuality is legal in Vanuatu but open displays of affection between same-sex partners will attract adverse attention and is likely to offend some. See our information and advice page for the LGBT community before you travel.
Drinking kava is an ancient tradition in Vanuatu. Kava is widely available at traditional ceremonies, at nakamals (kava bars) and at some hotels. Some nakamals, particularly outside of Port Vila, do not welcome women. Be aware of the effects of kava and consume responsibly. Since 2003 kava has been banned from entry to the UK due to concerns about its health impacts.
It is illegal for supermarkets to sell alcohol between noon on a Saturday and 7am on a Monday. However, clubs bars and hotels may serve alcohol during these times.
Drug offences are punishable by fines, imprisonment or both. While there are no mandatory sentences for drug offences in Vanuatu, it is rare for a convicted person not to be fined or receive a jail sentence, even for ‘soft’ drug offences.
Most ni-Vanuatu (meaning people ‘of Vanuatu’) will allow you to take their photograph but you should always seek their permission first.
Land ownership in Vanuatu is an important and often sensitive issue. If you are travelling off the beaten track, be aware that you may be trespassing and required to pay a “visiting fee” to the landowner. At most beaches you will also be asked to pay an entry fee.
