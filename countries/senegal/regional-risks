This section has safety advice for regions of Senegal. It only covers regions where FCDO has specific advice.
You should also read FCDOâ€™s overall travel advice and safety and security advice.
Northern and eastern border areas
Take particular care in remote areas of Senegal near the border areas with Mauritania and Mali, and to the east of the city of Podor as far as Kidira.
Casamance Region
Casamance, the spur of land south of The Gambia, has suffered from decades of low-intensity separatist violence, largely directed at Senegalese security forces. Be on alert for clashes if you are travelling in the region. The risk of attacks is lower in the main tourist areas of the Casamance.
When driving:
avoid travelling at night
stick to main roads
travel in convoy if possible
do not pull over if anyone tries flag you down
be aware that many roads in the Casamance are of low quality
Senegalese forces carry out minor operations near the border with The Gambia to combat wood trafficking.
