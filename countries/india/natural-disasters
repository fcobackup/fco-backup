Monsoons
Travel in rural areas during the monsoon season (in North India, June to October) can be hazardous. Monsoon rains cause flooding and landslides that can cut off affected towns and villages for days. Check access routes before travelling and take extra care.
Monsoon rains frequently impact travel in and around Mumbai. If youâ€™re in Mumbai during the monsoon season, you should take note of weather forecasts from the Indian Meteorological Department and follow the advice of local authorities.
Cyclones and Tropical storms
Cyclones and tropical storms are common, particularly off the east coast of India in the months from September-December. In Bay of Bengal, the tropical cyclone season has two peaks, April to June and September to December. You should monitor local and international weather updates from the Indian Meteorological Department and follow the advice of local authorities and tour operators. See our Tropical cyclones page for advice on what to do if you are caught up in a storm.
Earthquakes
Several parts of India lie on highly active fault zones. The most active are those states along the length of the Himalayas. Earth tremors are common in these regions and can cause landslides in hilly and mountainous areas. Limited emergency response vehicles, equipment, and medical facilities could increase the impact that an earthquake could have in these areas. The US Federal Emergency Management Agency has advice about what to do before, during and after an earthquake.
