The Foreign, Commonwealth & Development Office (FCDO) advises against all travel to Afghanistan. If you choose to travel or stay in Afghanistan, you should keep a low profile. There is a heightened risk of detention of British nationals. The British Government may not be notified about such detentions; communications with next of kin may not be guaranteed; and detention may be lengthy. There are currently no British consular officials in Afghanistan and our ability to provide consular assistance is severely limited. You should not travel to Afghanistan.
The security situation in Afghanistan remains extremely volatile. There is an ongoing and high threat of terrorist attacks through Afghanistan, including around the airport. Travel throughout Afghanistan is extremely dangerous, and border crossings may not be open. See ‘Safety and security’.
Following the death of Al Qaida leader, Ayman al- Zawahiri, in a US drone attack, British Nationals should be aware that the situation may be volatile. If you choose to travel to or stay in Afghanistan you should be vigilant, try to avoid all crowds and public events including religious events, and take appropriate security precautions. Travel throughout Afghanistan is extremely dangerous, and border crossings may not be open. See ‘Safety and security’.
The British Embassy in Kabul has suspended in-country operations. Consular support is not available from the British Government within Afghanistan.

British nationals may access consular services at our diplomatic missions in neighbouring countries.
