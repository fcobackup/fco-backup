Cases of coronavirus (COVID-19) have been confirmed in Norway. The Norwegian authorities have introduced a number of measures to limit the spread of the virus.
Travel restrictions
On 14 March Prime Minister Solberg announced that borders will be partially closed from 8:00 Monday 16 March. This means that non-residents will not be allowed to enter the country after this point. This will include those travelling in from Sweden and Finland. Non-residents are still able to transit via Norwegian airports as long as the final destination is not within Norway, but please check with you airline before departing.
The Norwegian authorities have issued recommendations that people avoid using public transport unless strictly necessary. Airports remain open but travel is being discouraged and there are limited commercial means of leaving Norway to return to the UK by air.
For information on how to return to the UK from Norway, see Return to the UK.
All British nationals legally resident in Norway will be allowed to enter the country, but are required to enter self-quarantine for 14 days. Those with symptoms will be isolated.
The Norwegian Health Directorate advise that all travellers arriving after 27 February and who have travelled to countries other than Finland and Sweden are required to enter self-quarantine for a period of 14 days after arrival.
From 16 March onwards those arriving from Sweden and Finland will also be required to self-quarantine for 14 days. Exemptions for workers crossing the Swedish and Finnish borders will apply â€“ please see the Ministry of Foreign Affairs website for the details.
Rules on how long you need to remain in quarantine have been clarified to allow those not showing symptoms to leave immediately.
Local measures
From Thursday 12 March day care centres, schools, universities, and other educational institutions (e.g. libraries) will be closed until 26 March. There are also restrictions on all public events and large parts of the hospitality and service sectors, including those that involve close personal contact e.g. hairdressers and beauty salons. Pubs and nightclubs are required to close. Establishments serving food are allowed to open but social distancing restrictions apply.
The Chief Medical Officer advises British nationals aged 70 and over and those with pre-existing health condition against cruise ship travel at this time. A number of Norwegian ports are considering restrictions on passenger embarkation and disembarkation. The situation can change rapidly so check with cruise provider before travelling.
