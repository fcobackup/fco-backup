Travel to Turkey is subject to entry restrictions
The Turkish Government have implemented a series of COVID-19 travel restrictions that are affecting flight operations between the United Kingdom and Turkey
Direct flights have been temporarily suspended from UK to Turkey
Flights from Turkey to the UK continue. If you are in Turkey and wish to return to the United Kingdom, direct commercial flights are available from Istanbul with Pegasus Airlines and Turkish Airlines. Tickets can be purchased direct from the airlines via their normal points of sale. If you held a ticket for a flight on one of these airlines that was cancelled, you should contact them directly to discuss your rebooking options
If you are in the United Kingdom and wish to return to Turkey, direct commercial flights are no longer available. If you held a ticket for a flight that has been cancelled, please contact your airline or travel agent to discuss your rebooking/refund options
Airlines are allowed to transport transit passengers from the UK who are travelling on one ticket via Turkey to another international destination. But as flights are operated on a commercial basis by airlines they may be subject to change or cancellation at short notice. You should contact airlines directly for the latest information about your flight
Travel to Turkey from the UK via a third country is permitted. However, passengers who have been in the UK within the last 10 days will be quarantined for 14 days on arrival in Turkey at locations selected and funded by the local Turkish authorities. In addition, before boarding, all passengers aged 6 years and above will be required to show a negative PCR test taken within 72 hours prior to departure
Passengers in quarantine will be given a mandatory PCR test on day 10 of their quarantine – if negative, the quarantine can end at that point
There are different requirements in place for arrivals to Turkey from different countries. You should check the latest COVID-19 travel requirements set by the Turkish authorities with your airline before travelling
All passengers arriving in Turkey will be subject to a medical evaluation for symptoms of coronavirus, including temperature checks. And all passengers travelling to Turkey aged 6 years and above will be required, before boarding, to submit a negative PCR test result completed within 72 hours prior to their time of flight departure to Turkey
Passengers who are in transit to another country via Turkey are not required to submit negative PCR tests, unless they are flying from the UK, Denmark or South Africa (transit passengers from these three destinations are still required to show a negative PCR test taken within 72hrs of departure to Turkey)
See Entry requirements for more information before you plan to travel.
Preparing for your return journey to the UK
If you are due to travel from Turkey to the UK, contact your airline directly.
If you’re returning to the UK from overseas, you will need to:
provide your journey and contact details before you travel
check if you need to self-isolate on your return
Check our advice on foreign travel during the coronavirus (COVID-19) pandemic and sign up for email alerts for this travel advice.
If you’re planning travel to Turkey, find out what you need to know about coronavirus there in the Coronavirus section.
During the COVID-19 pandemic, it is more important than ever to get travel insurance and check it provides sufficient cover. See the FCDO’s guidance on foreign travel insurance.
British nationals made over 2.5 million visits to Turkey in 2019. Most visits are trouble free. Be alert to your surroundings and remain vigilant in crowded places popular with foreign nationals, including during festival periods.
If you’re travelling to Turkey for tourist or business purposes, you are able to travel without a visa for visits of up to 90 days in any 180-day period. See Visas
Many parts of Turkey are subject to earthquakes. You should familiarise yourself with safety procedures in the event of an earthquake and follow the advice of the local authorities. See Natural disasters
The situation has calmed following an attempted coup in July 2016. A state of emergency imposed after the coup attempt has been lifted, although some restrictions remain in place. See Political situation
Terrorists are very likely to try to carry out attacks in Turkey. Terrorist groups, including PKK, Daesh (formerly referred to as ISIL) and far left organisations, continue to plan and carry out attacks. Further attacks could be indiscriminate. Most attacks have taken place in the south-east of the country, and in Ankara and Istanbul. While there is a potential that citizens from western countries may be targets or caught up in attacks, particularly in the major cities, attacks are most likely to target the Turkish state, civilians and demonstrations. You should be vigilant, follow the advice of local security authorities, monitor media reports and keep up to date with this travel advice. See Terrorism
It’s illegal to be a member or supporter of a terrorist organisation in Turkey, including expressions of support on social media. Some organisations in the region though not proscribed in the UK, such as the YPG and the Gülen Movement are illegal in Turkey.
You should carry your passport and a printed copy of your visa (if applicable) or residence permit at all times. In some busy areas, especially Istanbul, the Turkish authorities are stopping members of the public to conduct ID checks. See Local laws and customs
There have been reports of an increase in holidaymakers being encouraged to submit a claim for personal injury if they have experienced gastric illness during their stay. You can find more information about the action you can take if you have suffered a personal injury on the Citizens Advice website. You should only consider pursuing a complaint or claim if you have genuinely suffered from injury or illness. If you make a false or fraudulent claim, you may face legal proceedings in the UK or Turkey.
You can contact the emergency services by calling 155 (police), 112 (ambulance) and 110 (fire).
If you’re abroad and you need emergency help from the UK government, contact the nearest British embassy, consulate or high commission. Consular support is severely limited in parts of Turkey where the FCDO advise against travel, and limited in the areas where the FCDO advise against all but essential travel.
