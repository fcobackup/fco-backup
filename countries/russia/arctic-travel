FCDO advises against all travel to Russia.
Most British nationals travel safely around the Arctic each year. However, consular assistance and support to British nationals is limited by the capacity of national and local authorities. Make sure you have appropriate travel insurance and accessible funds to cover the cost of any medical treatment or potential repatriation.
Before you visit:
consider the remote nature of certain destinations and access to medical facilities, search and rescue and evacuation options
have emergency plans in place, particularly if you are an independent traveller
Sea travel in the Arctic
Most people visit the Arctic by ship. Some areas of the Arctic are uncharted and ice-covered. Before you travel:
check the experience and credentials of operators offering travel in the region
consider the on-board medical facilities and discuss any pre-existing medical conditions with the cruise operator
Search and rescue
In the highest latitude regions of the Arctic, cruise ships may be isolated from other vessels or populated areas. Be aware that:
search and rescue response may be very far away
assistance to stranded vessels may take several days to arrive, particularly in bad weather
search and rescue teams will only offer basic transport and medical care; they are unlikely to be able to offer advanced life support
