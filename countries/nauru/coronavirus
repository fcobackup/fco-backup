Travel restrictions
Nauru authorities are requesting all persons to consider whether travel to Nauru is necessary and all persons are asked to cancel or postpone any non-essential travel to Nauru.
Passengers who have transited through, or have been in mainland China, Hong Kong, Macao, Iran, Italy, Korea, Europe, USA or Asia (except Taiwan) in the past 21 days, will not be allowed to enter Nauru.
Effective 16 March 2020, all persons arriving in Nauru will be required to spend up to 14 days in “approved Transition Accommodation” before entry into Nauru.
All persons travelling to Nauru are required to undergo pre-travel screening.
The Government of Australia has announced that from 9pm Australia Eastern Standard Time on 20 March, entry to the country will only be permitted to Australian citizens or permanent residents. This follows a similar announcement by New Zealand from 19 March. As many flight connections to and from Nauru connect in Australia and New Zealand, options to depart Nauru are likely to reduce.
If you’re currently a visitor in Nauru, you’re advised to prepare to leave as soon as possible. If you’re resident in Nauru, you should be aware of the potential impact of the border closures and flight restrictions on future travel plans.
See the TravelHealthPro website for further advice on travel abroad and reducing spread of respiratory viruses during the COVID-19 pandemic.
