Terrorist attacks in Sri Lanka can’t be ruled out. Attacks could be indiscriminate, including in places visited by foreigners.
The military conflict between the Government and the Liberation Tigers of Tamil Eelam (LTTE, commonly known as ‘the Tamil Tigers’) ended in May 2009. In 2011 the State of Emergency and the Emergency Regulations were lifted, but there remains a heightened level of security in some parts of the country. In April 2014, the Sri Lankan military shot dead three alleged LTTE operatives in Nedunkerni (Vavuniya).
You should be vigilant. Avoid military areas and High Security Zones. Always carry formal photographic identification with you. Stop and show your ID when asked to do so. The Sri Lankan Prevention of Terrorism Act permits prolonged detention without charge or trial. If you’re detained, you should ask the authorities to contact the British High Commission.
There’s a heightened threat of terrorist attack globally against UK interests and British nationals, from groups or individuals motivated by the conflict in Iraq and Syria. You should be vigilant at this time.
