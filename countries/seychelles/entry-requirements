Entry rules in response to coronavirus (COVID-19)
New measures in place from 3 January to 15 February
Following an increase in the number of coronavirus cases in Seychelles, the Government of Seychelles has introduced new measures, which includes entry to Seychelles.
The Government of Seychelles has announced that, with effect from Monday 28 December, the United Kingdom will no longer feature on the list of countries from which visitors may travel to Seychelles. The restrictions on visitors from the UK will be reviewed on 15 February.
Dual nationals, permanent residents and approved work permit holders may continue to travel from the United Kingdom to Seychelles but will be required to quarantine or self-isolate on arrival, subject to direction from the Public Health Authority, for ten days in accommodation approved by the Public Health Authority. A COVID-19 test must also be performed no more than 48 hours before departure and you must be able to demonstrate a negative test result on entry. You should visit the Seychelles Ministry of Health website for full entry procedures.
An application for entry form should also be completed and returned to the Public Health Authority before travel. Work permit holders must also be cleared by the Department of Employment and Immigration. If you are uncertain of your status, you should contact the Department of Employment and Immigration before attempting to enter Seychelles.
In addition to the above, you may now enter Seychelles, if you have received a complete dose of a vaccination against COVID-19 at least two weeks before travelling. If you have received a vaccine that requires two doses, then you must have received the final dose at least two weeks before travelling. Visitors must stay at approved accommodation, and provide both an authentic vaccination certificate and a negative PCR test result conducted within 72 hours of travel. You can find a travel advisory detailing the full entry procedures for all travellers at the Ministry for Tourism website. You are strongly advised to familiarise yourself with the full entry requirements before you travel. These may be updated regularly and without warning.
All arrivals by sea on pleasure crafts / yachts must apply for entry but may only come to shore 10 days after their last port of call and must have a negative PCR test. If you intend to enter Seychelles waters and if you wish to disembark from a vessel, you are required to contact the Seychelles Ministry of Health before attempting to do so.
Cruise ships from any country worldwide will not be permitted to berth in Seychelles until further notice.
Seychelles International Airport may allow private jets and commercial charter flights to land if they are carrying passengers who will then be transferred to authorised yachts, or to specifically authorised tourist facilities. All passengers must have proof of a negative COVID-19 test performed in the 48 hours prior to boarding. You should contact your airline and the Seychelles Department of Health to understand when and if you will be permitted entry to Seychelles.
Entry requirements will be reviewed by the Government of Seychelles on 15 February.
Screening on arrival
All passengers will be temperature checked at all ports of arrival. If symptoms of COVID-19 are found to be present, tests will be conducted. Those found to be positive will be quarantined and re-checked.
Quarantine requirements
Dual nationals, permanent residents and approved work permit holders may continue to travel from the United Kingdom to Seychelles but will be required to quarantine or self-isolate on arrival, subject to direction from the Public Health Authority, for ten days in accommodation approved by the Public Health Authority. A COVID-19 test must also be performed no more than 48 hours before departure and you must be able to demonstrate a negative test result on entry.
Regular entry requirements
The Government of Seychelles is reviewing its policies on work permits (Gainful Occupational Permits) for foreign nationals.

You should speak to your employer and contact the Government of Seychelles Department for Immigration and Civil Status if you hold a GOP and are concerned about your employment status in Seychelles.

Visas are not required for British passport holders.
Passport validity
Your passport should be valid for the proposed duration of your stay. No additional period of validity beyond this is required.
