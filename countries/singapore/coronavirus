Coronavirus travel health
See the TravelHealthPro website for further advice on travel abroad and reducing spread of respiratory viruses during the COVID-19 pandemic.
Travel in Singapore
Read the Singapore Government article on the phased approach to resuming activities safely for information.
Those who do not comply with these measures will be fined and foreign nationals could face deportation. Repeat offenders will face further fines and/or prosecution. Be aware that restrictions and penalties are subject to change at short notice.
Public spaces and services
The wearing of facemasks is compulsory for everyone when outside of their place of residence, except children under 6 years old, when eating or when engaged in strenuous exercise.
Most shops, services and eateries are open with social distancing measures in place. No alcohol will be available in bars and restaurants after 10:30pm.
You must record visits to any shops, services etc. through a ‘Safe Entry’ phone app or by signing in at the entrance. You will be required to either download Singapore’s ‘TraceTogether’ app or collect a ‘TraceTogether’ token from the Singapore government in order to enter an increasing number of locations.
Groups of up to 8 people are allowed to meet outside the home. Households are able to receive up to a total of 8 visitors in one day. A distance of 1 metre should be maintained between people, except when this is not possible due to space constraints e.g. in a lift or on public transport. Speaking is discouraged on public transport.
Healthcare in Singapore
For contact details for English speaking doctors visit our list of healthcare providers. English is almost universally spoken in Singapore, so all hospitals – whether private or public – will have English-speaking medical staff.
