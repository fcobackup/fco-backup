The information on this page covers the most common types of travel and reflects the UK government’s understanding of the rules currently in place. Unless otherwise stated, this information is for travellers using a full ‘British Citizen’ passport.
The authorities in the country or territory you’re travelling to are responsible for setting and enforcing the rules for entry. If you’re unclear about any aspect of the entry requirements, or you need further reassurance, you’ll need to contact the embassy, high commission or consulate of the country or territory you’re travelling to.
You should also consider checking with your transport provider or travel company to make sure your passport and other travel documents meet their requirements.
Restrictions in response to coronavirus
Entry
The Government of Myanmar has suspended all commercial passenger flights from any of its airports until 15 June. It will then review the situation.
Once commercial flights to Myanmar resume, the British Embassy currently understands that all passengers arriving in Myanmar will be subject to the below quarantine and self-isolation measures. These measures are subject to change and at short notice.
Diplomats and staff accredited to international organisations: 28 days self-isolation at home at a verifiable address
Other foreign staff e.g. teachers: 21 days quarantine at a government facility or private hotel. Then 7 days self-isolation at a verifiable private address.
Myanmar national and tourists: 21 days quarantine at a government facility or private hotel. Then 7 days self-isolation at a verifiable private address.
Before travel, we advise that all visitors check with their nearest Myanmar Embassy to confirm their current visa will allow them entry, or the criteria for obtaining or renewing a visa.
Visas
British Nationals usually resident in Myanmar but currently away with expired business visas, should apply for a single entry business visa at your nearest Myanmar Embassy (with a sponsorship letter from your employer). You should then apply for a long term multi-entry visa in Myanmar when you return.
New tourist visa applications are currently suspended.
