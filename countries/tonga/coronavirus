The Tonga authorities have introduced a number of precautionary measures in response to the coronavirus (COVID-19) pandemic.
Travel restrictions
A State of Emergency was declared on 20 March by the Government of the Kingdom of Tonga. Effective immediately, Tongan borders have closed to entry by all foreigners.
The Government of Tonga has announced that all international flights to Tonga are diverted from Tonga until Saturday 18 April, except for international flights approved by the Ministry of Health. Please see the full list of diverted flights on the Diversion Order.
The Kingdom of Tonga has extended the National Lockdown Notice to 1am on Sunday 12 April 2020. This includes a night time curfew from 8 pm to 6 am. Travellers are advised to follow the guidance of the government of the Kingdom of Tonga.
There is no British diplomatic representation in Tonga. Consular support is limited in Tonga. However, the British High Commission in Suva in Fiji can provide consular support to British nationals. Please monitor guidance on their social media. Check their Facebook page and their Twitter feed.
All international cruise ships and yachts scheduled to arrive after 19 March shall not be granted entry into Tonga until further notice.
Some countries in the region have also introduced travel restrictions to and from the Pacific islands. You should check specifics for any countries that might be involved in your travel when planning a trip to and/or from Tonga.

Local measures
Medical care across Tonga is not as advanced as you would find in the UK. Access to medical services and the availability of fresh foods in Tonga could be impaired during a serious or extended Covid-19 outbreak.
