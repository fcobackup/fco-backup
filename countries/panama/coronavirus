Cases of coronavirus (COVID-19) have been confirmed in Panama. The Panama authorities are introducing a number of measures to limit the spread of the virus. You should monitor the press and official announcements of the Panamanian government to ensure you are up-to-date with any changes to these restrictions.
Local measures
Panama is currently under a state of emergency, and quarantine measures are in place.
From 1 April 2020, unless you fall under one of the quarantine exemptions, only women are permitted to leave their homes/accommodation on Mondays, Wednesdays and Fridays and only men are permitted to leave their homes/accommodation on Tuesdays, Thursdays and Saturdays. No one should leave their homes/accommodation on Sundays. On those days, you are allowed to leave your homes/accommodation to shop for food and medication during one hour (with a half hour grace period either side) according to the last digit of your passport. You should not leave your accommodation outside of these times unless it is an emergency or you fall under one of the limited exemptions. Details of the times you can leave your accommodation can be found on the British Embassy Twitter account.
On 25 March 2020, domestic flights within Panama were suspended.
Ubers are no longer in circulation for passenger travel. Yellow taxis have a reduced presence, and do not operate on Sundays.
On 15 March, Panamanian authorities announced new restrictions on access to medical services for routine care, as well as widespread closures of commercial and leisure establishments. Further restrictions were announced on 20 March. On 25 March the distribution, sale and consumption of alcoholic drinks has been banned for the duration of the national state of emergency.
Commercial businesses have been ordered to close, except for supermarkets, pharmacies, health clinics, fuel stations and other key businesses. Supermarkets can have no more than 50 people inside.
Members of the public have been urged to wear masks when leaving their accommodation.
The police and security forces are empowered to enforce restrictions on movements and events due to the current state of emergency. You should follow their instructions.
Sanitary cordon
On 19 March 2020, the Panamanian Government began establishing sanitary cordons in different provinces of the country, including Panama City, with checkpoints in various locations. The Panamanian Government may change suddenly the provinces that are sanitary cordons, and may introduce other restrictions on movement. These are posted on the Panamanian Ministry of Health Twitter feed.
You should avoid any unnecessary travel to and from any of the listed areas. If you urgently need to travel, you will need to show ID and proof of your reason for needing to cross the checkpoint in order to pass, such as evidence of your flight out of Panama.
Local authorities may also impose similar restrictions on movement.
Further information
The authorities have set up a hotline (169) to answer any questions or receive information regarding suspicious case of coronavirus. If you are concerned that you may be unwell as a result of the coronavirus, you should call the national hotline on 169, or use the Panamanian Government’s “R.O.S.A” (virtual clinic) using this link to send a WhatsApp message, and follow their advice.
The Panamanian Tourism Authority (ATP) has created the following helpline to provide assistance: +507 6330 2520 or via email to contact@atp.gob.pa.
Further advice on coronavirus is available from Public Health England and on the TravelHealthPro website.
