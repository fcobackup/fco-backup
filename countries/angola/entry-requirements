This page has information on travelling to Angola.
This page reflects the UK government’s understanding of current rules for people travelling on a full ‘British Citizen’ passport from the UK, for the most common types of travel.
The authorities in Angola set and enforce entry rules. If you’re unsure how Angola’s entry requirements apply to you, contact its UK embassy, high commission or consulate.
All travellers
The Angolan government has removed all COVID-19 requirements to exit and enter Angola. However, you are strongly advised to check with your airline in advance of your travel should there be other requirements by the carrier or any countries you may be transiting through.
Children and young people
There are additional requirements for passengers under 18 entering or transiting through Angola without their parents or legal guardian, or travelling with one parent only. These requirements don’t usually apply to foreign nationals, but as a precaution and to avoid any possible delays, British nationals under 18 entering or transiting through Angola without their parents or legal guardian, or travelling with one parent only, are advised to bring a letter of authorisation to travel from any parent(s) not travelling.
If you’re transiting through Angola
Transiting is when you pass through one country on the way to your final destination.
Check with your airline before departing.
Check your passport and travel documents before you travel
Passport validity
Your passport should be valid for a minimum period of 6 months from the date of entry into Angola.
Visas
You must apply for a valid visa and/or work permit before travelling to Angola, otherwise you may be detained at the airport and then deported. The deportation process can take a long time. You should check all entry requirements with the Angolan Consulate in London well in advance of travel.
If you’re applying for a tourist visa, you can submit documentation online in advance of travel and be granted a pre-approval, normally within 72 hours. This allows you to receive your physical visa on entry into Angola, subject to a fee equivalent to USD $120, paid in cash (preferable) or by Visa or MasterCard to the immigration officer on arrival. Further information can be found on the online application portal.
You may be fined 15,000 Kwanzas (Angolan currency) per day if you overstay your visa. You may not be allowed to leave the country until your fine has been paid. Legal action may be taken against you if you don’t pay your fine. This may include being detained, deported or not being allowed to re-enter Angola.
Fines are in place for a wide range of visa offences including (but not limited to) working, studying or residing without the correct visa, changing employment without notifying the authorities, employing staff with incorrect visas, failing to renew residence cards, or changing address without notifying the authorities.
Yellow fever certificate requirements
All passengers entering Angola are required to show a yellow fever vaccination certificate.
