Warning
FCDO advises against all but essential travel to parts of Uzbekistan.

This advice reflects the UK government’s understanding of current rules for people travelling on a full ‘British citizen’ passport from the UK, for the most common types of travel.
The authorities in Uzbekistan set and enforce entry rules. If you’re not sure how these requirements apply to you, contact the Uzbek Embassy in the UK.
COVID-19 rules
There are no COVID-19 testing or vaccination requirements for travellers entering Uzbekistan.  
Passport validity requirements
If you’re visiting Uzbekistan, your passport should have an ‘expiry date’ at least 3 months from the day you arrive.
Check with your travel provider that your passport and other travel documents meet requirements. Renew your passport if you need to.
You will be denied entry if you do not have a valid travel document, or try to use a passport that has been reported lost or stolen.
Visa requirements
If you have a British citizen passport, you can enter Uzbekistan as a visitor for stays of up to 30 days without a visa.
If you’re travelling on a different type of British passport, travelling for a purpose other than tourism or business, or intend to stay longer than 30 days, you should check entry requirements with the Uzbek Embassy in the UK.
If you’re entering Uzbekistan on an Uzbek visa, check it and carefully note the date of expiry and the number of entries permitted.
Do not overstay your visa, or exceed your permitted duration of stay, even for a very short period. If you overstay, you could get a fine and possibly be deported. It is not always easy or possible to extend your stay or visa if you want to stay in the country for longer than planned. If you’re travelling overland, make sure you arrive at your intended border crossing in good time before your period of stay or visa expires.
For more information on visas, contact the Uzbek Embassy in the UK.
Make sure you get your passport stamped.   
Border guards check the stamp on exit to ensure that travellers do not exceed the 30-day period.
Registering with the Uzbek authorities
You must register with the local district OVIR (Department of Foreign Travel and Exit) within 3 days of your arrival. Saturdays and Sundays count as part of the 3-day period. If you’re staying in a hotel, you’ll be asked for your passport at check-in. Hotel staff will complete the registration paperwork and return your passport. If you do not register within 3 days of arrival in the country, you get fined for each day you are late.
If you’re staying in a private house, your host should register you directly with their local district OVIR or on the electronic registration system, Emehmon. If you travel to another city and plan to stay for longer than 3 days, you’ll need to register again. You must follow this procedure, as a full record of where you’ve been in Uzbekistan is required upon departure. If you are unable to account for your whereabouts, you could get a fined for each day you are late and possibly be deported.
Travelling through Uzbekistan
If you’re travelling through Uzbekistan in a recreational vehicle or staying in tents and camping, you must register yourself. Register online through the electronic registration system, Emehmon, within 3 days of arrival. When you’re registering online, you’ll have to pay a tourist tax charge for each day of your stay. At the moment you can only pay the tourist tax online with an Uzbek debit card in local currency – seek assistance from hotels or local tour operators.  
Uzbek-British dual nationality
Uzbekistan does not recognise dual nationality. If you enter Uzbekistan on an Uzbek passport and are also a British national, the British Embassy can only provide very limited consular assistance. If you’re arrested or detained, consular access is unlikely to be granted.
Vaccination requirements
At least 8 weeks before your trip, check the vaccinations and certificates you need in TravelHealthPro’s Uzbekistan guide.
Customs rules
There are strict rules about goods you can take into or out of Uzbekistan (in Uzbek and Russian). You must declare anything that may be prohibited or subject to tax or duty, including large amounts of money.
You must complete a customs declaration form. You should fill out 2 copies of the form. Make sure customs officials sign and stamp both copies. You’ll need to show one at customs as you enter Uzbekistan and the other when you leave. If you have currency or valuables you did not declare, officials may confiscate them.
Taking money into and out of Uzbekistan
You’ll need to complete a foreign currency declaration form when you arrive and keep a copy.
There is a separate form for visitors carrying significant amounts of money: the threshold is 10,000 US dollars. Visitors cannot take more than 10,000 US dollars out of the country. The forms are available in the arrival area of the airport.
You cannot leave Uzbekistan with more foreign currency than you brought with you.
Bring enough cash for your entire stay. Credit cards are not widely accepted outside Tashkent and the main tourist areas of Samarkand and Bukhara. Travellers cheques are not normally accepted. There are very few ATMs. US dollars are the most widely accepted foreign currency.
Only change money through official exchange booths. It is illegal to change money on the black market, and there are harsh penalties. Official exchange booths will not accept damaged or marked bank notes.
Medication
Before you travel to Uzbekistan with prescription or non- prescription medicines, you should check the State Customs Committee of Uzbekistan’s list of prohibited medicines and the amount of medication you’re allowed to import (in Uzbek and Russian).
You should carry a doctor’s prescription if you travel with prescription medicines and declare them on your customs declaration form. Some non-prescription medicines in the UK cause problems on entry into Uzbekistan, including codeine. Possession can lead to civil or criminal proceedings if you do not have a prescription, or if you’re carrying more than you need for the visit and do not declare them on arrival. Issues have most frequently been reported at land borders.
