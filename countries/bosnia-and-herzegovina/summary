Around 9,000 British nationals visit Bosnia and Herzegovina every year. Most visits are trouble-free.
Sarajevo’s first Pride march will take place on Sunday 8 September between approximately 11am and 2pm. The route begins at the Eternal Flame and passes along Marshall Tito Street, ending at Parliament Square. There is likely to be a mix of reactions to the event and a counter demonstration leaving Ciglane and heading for Alipasina has been announced for the same time. For more information, check the event website (in English). You should follow the advice of local authorities and, if joining the march, its organisers.
Unexploded landmines remain a real danger, particularly in isolated areas in the mountains and countryside. Flooding and landslides in previous years have moved minefields and destroyed some of the minefield markings. For latest updates on mines see the Mine Action Centre website. See Local travel
