There is an ongoing outbreak of coronavirus (COVID-19) in many countries; cases have been confirmed in Cuba since 11 March 2020. The Cuban authorities have introduced a number of measures to limit the spread of the virus. You should comply with any additional screening measures put in place by the Cuban authorities. See Health
The Cuban Government made important announcements on 20 and 23 March of measures to counter the spread of Coronavirus (COVID-19) in Cuba. There are significant implications for tourists and foreign residents. Some of the detail is being elaborated and the British Embassy in Havana is urgently seeking clarifications on some issues from the Cuban authorities. International flight services are busy and services are being reduced and suspended. Customers should follow up with their tour operator or airline as a matter of urgency and research other option.
The British Embassy in Havana is closed to the public. If you need emergency consular assistance you should telephone the Embassy +53 7 214 2200 and press option 2 (note there is a short time delay to connect to the officer). Please note we are receiving an unprecedented number of calls so it may take some time to be connected. We are also receiving a high volume of email enquiries and may not be able to deal with your individual enquiry straight away.
On 20 and 23 March the government of Cuba announced new measures to combat the spread of Coronavirus in Cuba. The measures affect foreign nationals. The information to note is:
• Who can enter Cuba. From Monday 23 March (midnight) only Cuban nationals and foreign residents will be allowed to enter Cuba, i.e. no more tourists can enter Cuba. All will be put in government-managed isolation accommodation for 14 days. This measure applies for 30 days and is subject to review. Returning residents will be taken to their province of residence.
• Hotels. Tourists staying in hotels will be confined to those hotels until it is time for them to depart. They cannot leave the hotel unless to go to the aiport. All excursions are suspended. A medic will visit the hotel twice per day.
• Casas particulars (private houses). Tourists can only stay in authorised private houses, and must stay in the house. Some tourists will be moved from private houses to government hotels in the coming days (starting in Baracoa, Trinidad and Vinales). The government will cover the transport. The cost of the hotel will be similar to the private house.
• Tourists are not to be out of their hotels or casas.
• All discos, nightclubs, gymnasiums, etc (government or private owned for public access, and in hotels) will be closed.
• Restaurants and bars will be restricting services, working hours and seating (there musgt be two metres between tables).

• People in queues must maintain a minimum of distance of one metre between them.
• There will be an increased police presence in the streets and shops, to monitor people are following the measures.
International airlines are permitted to come to Cuba with Cuban nationals and foreign residents and leave with passengers without symptoms/coronavirus.
If you wish to leave Cuba you should make a plan to leave now and contact your airline or tour operator. We are aware that many airlines are reviewing their operations and are suspending or reducing flights into and out of Cuba. We anticipate that you will find it increasingly difficult to return to the UK. It is not known how long any disruption to services may last. If you are taking a flight via another country, please check latest FCO travel advice for that country to be sure you can transit or enter that country.
The Cuban government will give a further update on Monday 23 March on national television.
