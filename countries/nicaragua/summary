Many areas of the country experienced a period of political disturbances in April 2018, resulting in hundreds of deaths and detentions according to UN reports. Protests led to violent clashes and use of tear gas, rubber bullets and live ammunition. The situation is now quieter but remains unpredictable. You should stay well away from all demonstrations and gatherings, even if apparently peaceful, as these could result in outbreaks of violence. See Political situation.
Flooding and landslides caused by hurricanes Eta and Iota, which struck Central America in November 2020, caused significant damage to infrastructure on the North Atlantic coast and along the border with Honduras.
