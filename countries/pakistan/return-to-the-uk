On 21 March, the government of Pakistan announced the suspension of all international flights to Pakistan, until 2000 PST on 4 April. The government of Pakistan described the measure as a ‘temporary suspension imposed due to exceptional circumstances’. We understand that the suspension applies also to international flights out of Pakistan.
Despite this suspension, Pakistan International Airlines (PIA) has announced flights from Islamabad to UK operating on 27 and 28 March. We understand that PIA flights will only be advertised through travel agents. We understand Qatar Airways is also planning on operating a daily flight from Islamabad International Airport from 25 March until 3 April. For Qatar Airways flights please see website or contact travel agents. If transiting a third country, please check that you will be able to fly on to the UK.
If you live in the UK and are currently travelling abroad you are strongly advised to return, where and while there are still commercial routes available. You should contact airlines and travel agents immediately. If you are a permanent resident overseas, you should stay and follow the advice of local authorities.
