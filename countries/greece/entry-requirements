The information on this page covers the most common types of travel and reflects the UK government’s understanding of the rules currently in place. Unless otherwise stated, this information is for travellers using a full ‘British Citizen’ passport.
The authorities in the country or territory you’re travelling to are responsible for setting and enforcing the rules for entry. If you’re unclear about any aspect of the entry requirements, or you need further reassurance, you’ll need to contact the embassy, high commission or consulate of the country or territory you’re travelling to.
You should also consider checking with your transport provider or travel company to make sure your passport and other travel documents meet their requirements.
Entry rules in response to coronavirus (COVID-19)
UK nationals are permitted to enter Greece if they are a permanent resident in the UK, Greece, another EU/EFTA state, or in one of the following countries; Australia, New Zealand, South Korea, Thailand, Rwanda, Singapore, United Arab Emirates, Russian Federation, United States, Serbia, Israel, North Macedonia, Canada, Belarus, Bahrain, Qatar, China, Kuwait, Ukraine, Saudi Arabia or Bosnia-Herzegovina. If you’re a British national who resides in another country, not listed above, you may be refused entry to Greece due to measures put in place by the Greek authorities to combat the spread of COVID-19.
Anyone travelling to Greece must comply with the Greek authorities’ requirements, including completion of a Passenger Locator Form (PLF) before you travel (both into and out of Greece). Read this section of the travel advice in full and check Greek authorities’ advice to understand how these requirements apply to you.
You must wear a face mask at all times when on an aeroplane, bus, train or ferry travelling to or from Greece; and whilst at airports.
The following measures are in place with respect to travel to Greece:
Travellers must fill in a Passenger Locator Form (PLF) no later than 11:59pm of the day before arriving in Greece. Please see below for further guidance on the Passenger Locator Form.
Arrivals from the UK must provide either: proof of a negative COVID-19 PCR test, undertaken within the 72 hour period before arrival into Greece; proof of a negative COVID-19 rapid antigen test from an authorised laboratory, undertaken within the 48 hour period before the scheduled flight; or proof of two COVID-19 vaccinations completed at least 14 days before travel (see Demonstrating your COVID-19 vaccination status). Travellers with proof of either are exempted from the need to self-isolate on arrival to Greece.
Failure to provide proof of either may result in your carrier not allowing you to travel and will likely result in the Greek authorities refusing you permission to enter Greece.
The exemption from self-isolation detailed above also applies to arrivals from the EU/EFTA states, or one of the following countries; Australia, New Zealand, South Korea, Thailand, Rwanda, Singapore, United Arab Emirates, Russian Federation, United States, Serbia, Israel, North Macedonia, Canada, Belarus, Bahrain, Qatar, China, Kuwait, Ukraine, Saudi Arabia, Bosnia-Herzegovina.
In addition, arrivals into Greece may be required to undergo a rapid COVID-19 test on arrival.
If you test positive on arrival in Greece, you (and those you are travelling with) will have to self-isolate in quarantine hotels provided by the Greek state for at least 10 days. The expenses of the accommodation in quarantine hotels are covered by the Greek state. Local authorities will be able to offer further advice on self-isolation requirements.
You should not use the NHS testing service to get a test in order to facilitate your travel to another country. You should arrange to take a private test.
You must comply with all instructions given by the Greek authorities. Failure to do so may result in you being refused permission to enter Greece and/or legal enforcement.
You should also be aware that if other passengers on your flight, bus, train or ferry later test positive, you may be subject to further quarantine/self isolation requirements. These will be mandatory and you should comply with the Greek authorities’ requirements.
Demonstrating your COVID-19 vaccination status
If you live in England, Greece will accept the NHS app or your NHS letter to demonstrate your COVID-19 vaccination status. If you live in Scotland or Wales, Greece will accept your respective NHS letter to demonstrate your COVID-19 vaccination status. Your NHS appointment card from vaccination centres is not designed to be used as proof of vaccination and should not be used to demonstrate your vaccine status.
Passenger Locator Form
You must complete an online Passenger Locator Form (PLF) at least 24 hours before your arrival in Greece. The form is in English, and is required whichever way you travel to Greece (including by ferry, road, rail or air). Failure to do so in advance may result in your carrier not allowing you to travel, a 500 Euro fine on arrival or the Greek authorities not allowing you to enter or re-enter the country.
Every traveller, including children, must have their details included on a PLF. If you’re travelling with others outside of your household, you should all complete your own form. If you’re travelling together as a household, the Greek authorities ask for you to complete one form with all adults and children included. You can add additional members of your household at the top of the form before you submit.
Some airlines may require individual PLFs for every traveller over the age of 18 within the same household. Check directly with your airline what you will need to show to be allowed boarding. Remember that you will need to complete PLFs at least 24 hours before your flight.
Once you have completed the form, you will receive an email with a QR code. When you receive your code, make sure you either print it, or can show it on your mobile phone.
If you are travelling by air to Greece, your airline will ask you to prove that you have completed the PLF form. You should print or show (e.g. on your phone) your email with the QR code you have received. Failure to do so could result in you being refused boarding to the flight.
If you are travelling by ferry to or from Greece, the ferry operator will ask you to complete an additional form (‘Pre Boarding Information’), alongside your PLF. This additional form will be provided by the ferry operator, either via their website, or at booking offices: you should contact them directly if you need further information. Temperature checks may also be carried out before boarding; and it is obligatory to wear masks on all ferries, where capacity is limited to allow for social distancing.
On arrival in Greece, you will need to show your QR code to the Greek authorities. Make sure you have either a printed copy of the code, or can show it on your phone. Failure to provide your PLF form/ QR code will result in a fine or you may be refused entry to Greece.
Additional restrictions on entry by air
Air connections with Greece are liable to suspension or amendment, sometimes at short notice. If you are due to fly to or from Greece, you should contact your airline or operator for the latest information.
Additional restrictions on entry by land borders
Greece’s land borders (including those with Albania, North Macedonia and Turkey) are subject to restrictions at present. As well as checking the below information, you should refer to the ‘Coronavirus’ pages for details of how local or national measures may affect travel across land borders. The following general restrictions are in place;
entrants into Greece via land borders are likely to be asked to undergo rapid testing for coronavirus. This is in addition to the requirement to show a negative result from a coronavirus test undertaken within the 72-hour period before their arrival into Greece;
travellers will require a rapid COVID test on arrival. If the result is positive, the Greek authorities will ask you to quarantine until advised otherwise. This is in addition to the requirement to show a negative result from a coronavirus PCR test undertaken within the 72-hour period before their arrival into Greece;
the land border with Bulgaria is open at the Promachonas crossing point, without additional restrictions or timed closures;
the Krystallopigi border crossing with Albania is closed, as part of measures to reduce the spread of coronavirus; the Kakavia border crossing is limited to a maximum of 400 persons permitted to cross into Greece per day (not including freight and goods vehicles); and the Nimfea border crossing is open only to freight and goods vehicles, such as lorries;
all other border crossings are open (for travel permitted within the framework set out by local and national restrictions, as detailed in the ‘Coronavirus’ pages); but operating with reduced hours. They are shut down each night between 11pm and 7am. Outside these hours, you may cross into Greece via these border points only for essential reasons;
Anyone arriving at any of the above entry points must prove they have completed a Passenger Locator Form prior to arrival in Greece; and will also require proof of a negative COVID PCR test result. The test must have been undertaken within the 72 hour period before your time of arrival into Greece. The exemption from requiring proof of a negative COVID PCR test for individuals with valid proof of full vaccination applies for nationals from qualifying states under the same terms as outlined above.
Monitor official information from the Greek authorities on any changes to border arrangements.
Regular entry requirements
Visas
The rules for travelling or working in European countries changed on 1 January 2021:
you can travel to countries in the Schengen area for up to 90 days in any 180-day period without a visa. This applies if you travel as a tourist, to visit family or friends, to attend business meetings, cultural or sports events, or for short-term studies or training
if you are travelling to Greece and other Schengen countries without a visa, make sure your whole visit is within the 90-day limit. Visits to Schengen countries within the previous 180 days before you travel count towards your 90 days
to stay longer, to work or study, for business or for other reasons, you will need to meet the Greek government’s entry requirements. Check with the Greek Embassy what type of visa and/or work permit, if any, you may need
if you stay in Greece with a residence permit or long-stay visa, this does not count towards your 90-day visa-free limit
Any time you spent in Greece or other Schengen countries before 1 January 2021 does not count towards your 90-day visa-free limit.
At Greek border control, you may need to use separate lanes from EU, EEA and Swiss citizens when queueing. Your passport may be stamped on entry and exit. You may also need to:
show a return or onward ticket
show you have enough money for your stay
There are separate requirements for those who are resident in Greece. If you are resident in Greece, you should carry proof of residence as well as your valid passport when you travel. For further information on these requirements, see our Living in Greece guide.
Passport validity
Check your passport is valid for travel before you book your trip, and renew your passport if you do not have enough time left on it.
You must have at least 6 months left on an adult or child passport to travel to most countries in Europe (not including Ireland).
If you renewed your current passport before the previous one expired, extra months may have been added to its expiry date. Any extra months on your passport over 10 years may not count towards the 6 months needed.
Travelling with medication
According to Greek law, a visitor can bring up to 5 different prescribed medicines for personal use, with a maximum of 2 boxes of each medicine.
Some prescribed and over-the-counter medicines available in the UK, including medication containing codeine, are considered controlled substances in Greece. A doctor’s prescription is required in all cases, which should mention your details, the types of medicine and the condition treated. On arrival, Greek Customs may in some cases require you to obtain permission from the Greek National Organisation of Medicines - if you need to carry more than the permitted number of boxes, for example. The National Organisation of Medicines examines these requests on a case by case basis.
For more information on controlled medicines, contact the Greek National Organisation of Medicines (telephone: 0030 213 2040 285 / 307 / 225, open Monday to Friday, 12pm to 3pm Greece time, or email: relation@eof.gr).
UK Emergency Travel Documents
UK Emergency Travel Documents are valid for entry, airside transit and exit from Greece.
