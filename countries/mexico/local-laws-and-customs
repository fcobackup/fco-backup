The Mexican Police have the authority to ask for proof of legal status in Mexico at any time. The police and Immigration authorities are conducting more searches since the start of the COVID pandemic. A number of British people have been detained for not having the relevant documentation on them. If you are a resident you may be asked to provide your residency card issued by the Mexican government.
If you are travelling in Mexico you will need to be able to provide your passport and stamp proving your entrance and stay if requested by Mexican authorities. You can obtain a digital registry of your entry documents here Portal de Servicios INM which will be accepted by the authorities. Copies/photos are not accepted. If you are unable to produce these documents, you may be detained, held at an immigration holding centre, and ultimately deported.
Do not become involved with drugs of any kind. Penalties for drug offences are severe. Convictions carry sentences of up to 25 years.
Although civil unions between same-sex partners are now legal in Mexico City and the state of Coahuila, homosexuality in Mexico is generally tolerated, rather than accepted. Public displays of affection between same sex couples may be frowned upon. See our information and advice page for the LGBT community before you travel.
Mexican law on surrogacy is under development. Assisted human reproduction, including surrogacy, might only be recognised in some Mexican states. If you’re considering a surrogacy arrangement in Mexico, you should familiarise yourself with the relevant laws and regulations and make sure you’ll meet all legal requirements to take the newborn child out of Mexico before you start the process. You should seek independent legal advice before entering into any surrogacy arrangement. For more information see our guidance on surrogacy overseas.
If you require more information on procedures, local laws, development of current events or social services you can contact LOCATEL at 5658 1111. They have English-speaking staff available.
