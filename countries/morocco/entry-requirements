This page reflects the UK government’s understanding of current rules for people travelling on a full ‘British Citizen’ passport, for the most common types of travel.
The authorities in Morocco set and enforce entry rules. For further information contact the embassy, high commission or consulate of the country or territory you’re travelling to. You should also consider checking with your transport provider or travel company to make sure your passport and other travel documents meet their requirements.
Restrictions in response to coronavirus
Entry and borders
You will need to provide proof that you have been fully vaccinated against COVID-19, with the second dose administered at least two weeks prior to travel, and a negative PCR test result before boarding your flight or ferry to Morocco. The result must show that the PCR test itself was undertaken no more than 48 hours before boarding. For travel by ferry, you will also need to take a COVID-19 test during the journey. Children under the age of 6 years old are exempt from the PCR testing requirement for entry into Morocco.
On arrival to Morocco, you will be asked to present a completed Public Health Passenger form. You can print a copy in advance of travelling. In addition, and following an official announcement on Saturday 13 November, you will also have your temperature taken and may be asked to do a rapid antigen test (provided free of charge) immediately upon arrival in Morocco. If you test positive and are not a permanent resident of Morocco, your airline will be required to arrange for you to immediately leave Morocco. A Moroccan resident testing positive would be transferred to a public health care facility. Children under 11 are exempt from this testing requirement.
Travellers transiting through third countries should ensure they consult FCDO Travel Advice for that country for the latest COVID-19 related travel and transit guidance.
British nationals in Morocco who require consular assistance should call the British Embassy on + 212 (0) 537 63 33 33 and follow the voice menu for “option 4 - consular assistance”.
Demonstrating your COVID-19 status
Morocco will accept the UK’s proof of COVID-19 recovery and vaccination record at the border. For details on how to demonstrate your COVID-19 status in domestic settings in Morocco, see the Coronavirus page. If you are travelling with a printed PDF proof of vaccination status, it must date from 1 November to ensure that the certificate can be scanned successfully. Your NHS appointment card from vaccination centres is not designed to be used as proof of vaccination and should not be used to demonstrate your vaccine status.
Regular entry requirements
Visas
British nationals don’t need a visa to enter Morocco for the purpose of tourism for up to 3 months.
When entering the country, make sure your passport is stamped. Some tourists have experienced difficulties leaving the country because their passport bears no entry stamp.
Passport validity
Your passport should be valid for the proposed duration of your stay in Morocco. However, the Moroccan Consulate General in London advise that your passport should be valid for at least 3 months on your date of entry to Morocco. If your passport does not meet this requirement you may face difficulties and you should check with the Moroccan authorities and your travel provider before travelling.
Before travelling, make sure your passport isn’t damaged. Some travellers have been refused entry when travelling on damaged passports.
Moroccan citizens who reside in the UK and travel to Morocco, may not be allowed to return to the UK unless they present evidence of their UK immigration status. This can include their UK biometric residence permit card or a valid UK entry clearance.
UK Emergency Travel Documents
UK Emergency Travel Documents are accepted for entry to, airside transit, and exit from, Morocco.
Western Sahara
See our travel advice for Western Sahara if you plan to travel to this disputed territory.
Algerian border
The land border between Algeria and Morocco is closed. Don’t attempt to cross it.
Arriving by private boat
If you’re arriving by private boat, you must enter the country at a recognised port of entry. Entry through other ports will be considered illegal.
