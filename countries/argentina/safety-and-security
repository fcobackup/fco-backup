Terrorism
There is a high threat of terrorist attack globally affecting UK interests and British nationals, including from groups and individuals who view the UK and British nationals as targets. You should remain vigilant at all times
UK Counter Terrorism Policing has information and advice on staying safe abroad and what to do in the event of a terrorist attack. Find out how to reduce your risk from terrorism while abroad.
Terrorism in Argentina
Terrorist attacks in Argentina cannot be ruled out.
Political situation
Following an increase in violent organised and drug-related crime in Rosario, Province of Santa Fe, the Government of Argentina has deployed additional security forces to maintain public order and safety. Public transport and taxis have also been affected. If you are in Rosario or planning to travel to Rosario, exercise a high degree of caution, monitor the media and follow the advice of the local authorities.
Political demonstrations and picketing are more common in Argentina than in the UK. Some demonstrations attract large numbers of people, and they can occasionally turn violent.
You should:
avoid all protests, demonstrations and marches
exercise normal caution at any large gathering
be aware of your surroundings
follow the advice of local authorities
There have also been occasional Falklands-related protests including outside the British Embassy and British-affiliated businesses in Argentina.
Demonstrations
Groups of demonstrators (‘piqueteros’) sometimes block major roads during times of social unrest. This can include blocking the major routes into and out of Buenos Aires City. This can cause significant delays.
When planning to travel:
monitor the local news
do not attempt to cross blockades
follow the advice of the local authorities
Crime
Protecting your belongings
Thieves normally work in teams of 2 or more and tend to target small bags and pockets. You should:
always keep a close eye on your personal possessions
not carry all your valuables in one place
avoid carrying large amounts of cash or wearing jewellery
keep a photocopy or scanned copy of your passport somewhere safe
avoid isolated or poorly lit areas at night
You might be asked for a photo ID when paying with a credit card so carry one with you but keep it secured. A money belt under your clothes is the safest option.
Theft
Thieves and pickpockets operate on public transport, bus and train terminals.
Thieves posing as hotel guests snatch bags while tourists are checking into hotels or hostels. Handbags can be cut open in crowded places and mobile phones have been snatched while being used on the street. Thieves on motorbikes can snatch bags from pedestrians.
Thefts from unattended vehicles, especially hire cars, are common.
You should:
keep your valuables out of sight or close to you
avoid hanging bags on the back of your chair
avoid using ATMs at night
be aware of your surroundings when withdrawing money
Street crime and scams
Be alert to street crime, especially thieves (often women) using distraction techniques. A common form of distraction theft reported in Buenos Aires is the ‘mustard scam’. Thieves will rob tourists while an accomplice pretends to help remove mustard that has been accidentally sprayed on them. If this happens to you, politely but firmly refuse assistance and walk away.
In Buenos Aires, be particularly cautious in:
Palermo
San Telmo
La Boca
Retiro
Florida Street
9 de Julio
Avenida de Mayo
Rivadavia Avenues near the obelisk
the Retiro Bus terminal
In Mendoza, be particularly cautious downtown.
Violent crime
Violent and armed robberies can happen in the streets immediately outside the Caminito tourist area in La Boca. Stay in the designated tourist area where there are high-visibility police patrols. If robbed, hand over your cash and valuables without resistance.

Criminal kidnapping
Kidnappings and ‘express kidnappings’ - short term opportunistic abductions, aimed at extracting cash from the victim - occasionally happen in Argentina. Victims are held and forced to empty their bank accounts in different ATMs after which they are normally quickly released. Be aware of your surroundings and always let someone you trust know your whereabouts. If you are a victim of kidnapping, follow the kidnapper’s instructions.
To reduce your risk:
avoid wearing expensive clothing or jewellery, particularly in public
avoid casual taxis, use official or pre-booked taxis instead where the driver is registered
be vigilant, especially at night
Drink and food spiking
Drinks and other foods can be spiked and could put you at risk of robbery or assault. Do not leave food or drinks unattended in bars and restaurants and do not accept them from strangers.
Be aware of the risk of bringing people you don’t know well into your accommodation. It doesn’t happen often, but there have been reports of foreign tourists being robbed or assaulted after inviting new acquaintances, met online or in person, into their accommodation. Be alert to the possible use of ‘date rape’ and other drugs. Alcohol and drugs can reduce your vigilance, making you less in control.
Laws and cultural differences
Illegal drugs and prison sentences
Don’t become involved with illegal drugs of any kind. Possessing even very small quantities can lead to a lengthy prison sentence.
LGBT travellers
Argentine society is open and diverse. Discrimination based on sexual orientation is rare. Same-sex marriage is legal. Read our advice for LGBT travellers before you travel.
Legal action against oil and gas companies
The government of Argentina has stated that it intends to pursue legal action against oil and gas companies engaged in hydrocarbon exploration in the Falkland Islands. If you’re travelling to Argentina and think you may be affected by this type of legal action, seek independent legal advice.
Outdoor activities and adventure tourism
If you take part in extreme or adventure sports (including paragliding, climbing, off-road driving and hot air ballooning), make sure:
adequate safety precautions are in place
you only use reputable operators and insist on training
your travel insurance covers all the activities you want to undertake and includes helicopter rescue and medical evacuation
You will have to pay for most helicopter rescues, including in Mount Aconcagua.
Altitude sickness is a risk in parts of Argentina. More information about altitude sickness is available from TravelHealthPro (from the UK’s National Travel Health Network and Centre).
Transport risks
Road travel
You will need an International Driving Permit to drive in Argentina.
Respect for speed limits and traffic signals varies and drivers can make unexpected manoeuvres. Crime against car users, particularly when stationary at traffic lights, is a problem.  Always keep car windows closed and doors locked in major cities.
Take care when driving in the province of Misiones, close to the borders with Paraguay and Brazil; the area is used to smuggle goods. Seek local advice from customs officials if you intend to drive in this area.
Taxis
Book taxis in advance if possible. If you hail a taxi in the street, only use a ‘radio taxi’. These have a clearly visible logo on the car doors.
See the City of Buenos Aires’ government site for a downloadable list of registered taxi companies with their contact details.
Air travel
Flights from Argentina can be unreliable and susceptible to delays and cancellations. Check the status of your flight with your airline or travel company before travelling to the airport.
Sea travel
There have been cases of disruption by activist groups and unions against British-flagged shipping, and shipping involved in hydrocarbons or fishing activity in the Falkland Islands. If you’re responsible for a vessel, contact your agent or the local authorities before travelling. Most cruise ships and visiting tourists should not be affected.
Extreme weather and natural disasters
Flooding
Many northern provinces experience occasional flooding. This can disrupt transport and delivery of food. Flash floods can occur during heavy rains, in provinces including Buenos Aires. Monitor local media and follow instructions given by the local authorities.
Volcanic eruptions
The Copahue Volcano on the Argentina-Chile border erupts occasionally, and residents are evacuated. If you’re travelling to this area, monitor local media reports and follow the advice of the local authorities.
