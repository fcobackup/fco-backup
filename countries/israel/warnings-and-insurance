Conflict with Lebanese Hizballah
There is an ongoing conflict between Israel and Lebanese Hizballah. There are continued exchanges of rocket, drone and small arms fire from Lebanese Hizballah over Israel’s northern border with Lebanon. Tensions are currently heightened following Israeli strikes in Beirut since 20 September.  
Cross-border attacks have increased since 21 September in northern Israel, including in Haifa, the Jezreel Valley, Krayot and other areas in the Galilee, including the lower Galilee. Since 25 September, rockets have also been fired on central Israel and central and northern West Bank. Whilst rocket fire has increased, strikes have largely been intercepted and there has not been significant damage to civilian infrastructure.
On 1 October, Iran launched over 200 ballistic missiles at Israel. The interception of missiles over Israel may result in falling fragments or debris. If you encounter any projectile debris or fragments you should move away from them immediately and contact local authorities.
There remains a risk that these hostilities could escalate further, and with little warning. You should check Home Front Command for the latest guidance. Restrictions may be put in place at short notice.
Conflict in Israel and the OPTs
On 7 October 2023 there was a large-scale terrorist attack by Hamas in southern Israel. Hamas continues to launch rockets into Israel and the Israeli Defence Forces are conducting significant military activity in Gaza. There is an ongoing risk of rocket attacks and other incidents of violence across Israel and the OPTs, including the West Bank, and increased military activity by the Israeli Defence Forces in Gaza and the West Bank. Militia groups in Iraq and Yemen have also fired missiles and drones at Israel which have impacted different areas, including Eilat.  
There is an increased risk of political tension which can cause demonstrations and clashes around anniversaries and significant events, including 7 October.
If you are in Israel and the OPTs
We recognise this is a fast-moving situation that poses significant risks. The situation has the potential to deteriorate quickly and without warning, and could result in instructions to shelter in place. This could disrupt air and road links out of the country. We strongly encourage you to check you and your dependents have the required documentation to travel at short notice. If your reason to remain in Israel and the OPTs is not essential you should consider leaving if it is safe to do so.
If you are in an area affected by the fighting, follow the instructions of Israeli Home Front Command. To find these:
visit the Israeli Home Front Command website (available in Israel only)
call 104 if you are in Israel
The Israeli government has declared a state of emergency across the whole country. International borders (air and land) in Israel and the OPTs could close at short notice. Check with border officials before you travel for the latest information. Check the travel advice for any neighbouring country that you are planning to travel to or through.
Before travelling within Israel or the OPTs, check the local measures in place, that roads are open and, where appropriate, that scheduled train and bus services are operating.

Travel within or out of Israel or the OPTs is at your own risk. You are encouraged to follow the advice of local authorities, for example on which routes are open or when to take shelter.
Travelling to Egypt from Gaza
The Rafah border crossing has been closed to all civilians due to Israeli military operations in the area since 6 May. When re-opened, it is for the Egyptian and Israeli authorities to determine who is permitted to cross, and when.
If you are a British national in Gaza who wants to leave Gaza, you should make contact with us as soon as possible. There are currently no exit routes available for foreign nationals to depart Gaza as a result of the military operations, but we are working with the Israeli, Egyptian and Jordanian authorities to explore alternatives.
If you are a UK visa holder who meets all of the following criteria, you can contact us to request support to leave Gaza:
you have a spouse/partner or a child aged 17 or under currently living in the UK; and
you hold valid permission to enter or remain in the UK for longer than 6 months
Movement to the Rafah crossing and beyond is at your own risk, and dependent on the permission of the Egyptian and Israeli authorities. You should only travel if you judge it is safe to do so. Check the Egypt travel advice.
