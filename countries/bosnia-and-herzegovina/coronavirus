Cases of coronavirus (COVID-19) have been confirmed in Bosnia and Herzegovina. The Bosnian authorities have introduced a number of measures to limit the spread of the virus.
International travel
Current travel measures include prohibiting entry at borders to all foreign nationals. Some groups are exempt from this rule, including: residents, diplomats, EUFOR/NATO staff, freight drivers and crew, and foreigners in transit to their country of residence. Anyone entering the country may be required to spend up to 14 days in a quarantine facility. If you are ordered to self-isolate and are found not to be doing so, you could be detained in a quarantine facility. Changes to restrictions may be introduced at short notice. You should comply with any additional screening measures put in place by the authorities.
A number of restrictions are in place at border crossing points into and out of Bosnia and Herzegovina. The Border Police of Bosnia and Herzegovina are publishing regular updates. Countries neighbouring Bosnia and Herzegovina (Croatia, Serbia and Montenegro) have also introduced restrictions. Please check country-specific FCO Travel Advice for details.
The Bosnian authorities have advised that where individuals’ visas or residence permits have expired due to current restrictions on travel meaning they were unable to leave the country, the Bosnian authorities will adopt a case by case approach. If your visa or residence permit has expired, you should contact your nearest Field Office of the Service for Foreigners’ Affairs.

Medical Care
Access to emergency medical care can be limited. Medical services are often below the standard of those in the UK.
If you are ordered to self-isolate and are found not be doing so, you could be detained in a quarantine facility.
Protective clothing
When outside, everyone is required to wear a face mask or other face covering and gloves.
Movement restrictions
There is no longer a daily curfew in the Federation entity of BiH. However, there are special restrictions on the movements of those under the age of 18 and over the age of 65. Persons under the age of 18 can move outside between 2pm and 8pm on Tuesdays, Thursdays and Saturdays. Persons over the age of 65 can move outside between 9am and 1pm on Mondays, Wednesdays and Fridays.
In the Republika Srpska, there is a general curfew in place from 10pm-5am. On weekends, people in the Republika Srpska cannot leave the territory of the municipality where they are resident. Those over the age of 65 can leave their homes only between 7am-1pm on weekdays.
On 6 May, the curfew in Republika Sprska will start earlier at 3pm, ending at 5am on 7 May. After this general curfew times will resume.
You should follow the advice of all levels of authority as other local levels may change measures without notice.
Shops and services
Other restrictive measures include closures of cafés, restaurants, gyms, spas, cinemas, theatres, and other facilities across the country, as well as a ban on all public gatherings. A range of shops, pharmacies, petrol stations and some other exempt places will continue working. Educational institutions are closed across the country.
Further changes could be introduced at short notice. Keep up to date with information from your tour operator, transport or accommodation provider on the impact on any existing travel plans.
