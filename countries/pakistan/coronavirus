Cases of coronavirus (COVID-19) have been confirmed in Pakistan. The Pakistani authorities have introduced a number of measures to limit the spread of the virus.
Entry and travel restrictions
For information on how to return to the UK from Pakistan, see Return to the UK.
We understand that the Pakistani authorities have closed land borders with Afghanistan, China, India and Iran. Border crossings with Iran have opened occasionally to allow Pakistani nationals to return home. Border crossings with Afghanistan open a number of times a week, but for outward goods transport only. Those crossing into Pakistan may have to comply with COVID-19 testing and quarantine measures.
Screening and quarantine measures for international air arrivals
International air passengers travelling to Pakistan will be subject to thermal screening on arrival. The Pakistan Civil Aviation Authority (CAA) has announced that Standard Operating Procedures for flights to Pakistan have been updated for the period 14 to 19 April. We understand that these guidelines include measures to quarantine all passengers on arrival for seven days, either in a free facility arranged by the Government of Pakistan, or in a facility which the passenger will pay for. Airlines are responsible for recording which facility passengers prefer.
Passengers may be subject to an initial swab test upon arrival at the quarantine facility. They will then be subject to a second swab test on the sixth day of quarantine. Passengers with a positive result will either be required to stay at the quarantine facility, or moved to a suitable location. Passengers with a negative test result will be required to complete a further seven days of quarantine at home, and should follow local authority guidelines. Before travelling, you should ensure that you have a form of payment for food and water during this quarantine and testing period.
Passengers on flights to Pakistan may also be required to follow special measures before boarding, and while on board the aircraft, including the wearing of a surgical mask. Reinforcement of screening and administrative measures at all sea ports has been announced.
Incoming passengers who test positive for COVID-19 may be subject to compulsory isolation or quarantine. People who have come into contact with others with COVID-19 symptoms may also be isolated or quarantined. Those that test negative will still have to self-isolate at home, and should follow local authority guidelines.

Domestic flights
Domestic flight operations are suspended until 21 April. Despite this, the Government of Pakistan has permitted some flights between Islamabad and Gilgit-Baltistan to continue. Cargo and special flights are also exempted from these restrictions.
Social measures
Pakistani authorities have introduced a number of measures to limit the spread of the virus, including school closures. There are strict restrictions on public gatherings, including religious congregations, events in wedding halls, and sports matches. Some provincial authorities are introducing additional measures, including requiring residents to stay at home, and closing shops, restaurants and other public places. Most public transport has been suspended, and in some places there are limits on the number of people allowed to be in one car. Measures are particularly strict in Sindh and Punjab. There have been reports of patrols and check points to enforce these measures, and some provinces have reportedly introduced powers to fine or arrest anyone breaking the rules.
Some provinces are also imposing compulsory isolation or quarantine for people who have COVID-19 symptoms, or people who have come into contact with others with COVID-19 symptoms. In some cases, local authorities are quarantining specific areas.
You should follow the federal and relevant provincial guidance, and monitor local media for updates. Plan any movements accordingly.
If you are running out of medication or have medical needs, you should speak to your travel insurance company for advice and seek local medical assistance, including from pharmacies. Your GP / UK doctor may be able to advise of alternative medication if yours is not available in Pakistan.
Further information
The Pakistani authorities have announced a helpline (on phone number 1166) for people who have recently travelled to China, Iran or a country where COVID-19 is present and who have symptoms like fever, cough and difficulty breathing. British nationals who are worried about the virus, or suspect they may have contracted it, should contact that number and follow the guidance given by the authorities.
Further information on coronavirus, including advice on preparing for foreign travel and helping reduce the spread of the virus, is available from Public Health England and on the TravelHealthPro website.
