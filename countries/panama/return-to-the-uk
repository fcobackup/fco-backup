Financial support for a flight
If you have exhausted all other options available to you for getting funds, you may be eligible to apply for an emergency loan from the government to cover the cost of the ticket.
You would need to repay the loan when you are back in the UK.
Our partner CTM is also authorised to administer such loans on behalf of the FCO and details will be available when you are asked to pay.
Transport to the airport for flights
Movement within Panama is restricted, but for those with tickets, travel to the airport for repatriation is a valid exemption.
The British Embassy can facilitate a safe passage letter in Spanish and English for the driver for use at checkpoints to and from the airport. Email the British Embassy BEPanama.CV@fco.gov.uk with your flight confirmation and the following details:
the driver’s full name
identification number (cedula)
licence plate number
make and model of the vehicle
names of British nationals travelling with you
If you are having difficulty booking transportation, the British Embassy may be able to assist.
If you are travelling from outside Panama City, you’re advised to arrive in Panama City on the day before the flight, to prevent any last minute delays. See a list of hotels in Panama City that you may find helpful.
We are monitoring the situation for further departures from Panama but these are likely to be limited until the air embargo is lifted (currently scheduled for 22 June)
If local authorities need confirmation that you are in transit to the airport, please call +507-297-6550 for assistance.
