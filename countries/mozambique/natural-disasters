Mozambique is regularly affected by natural disasters, including floods, drought and cyclones.
Coastal areas are at risk of cyclones during the rainy season (November to April) with heavy rainfall and a risk of flooding around river basins. Rains will also make roads harder to pass, and make some areas impassable. Monitor local reports and international weather updates from the World Meteorological Organisation, check your routes before travelling around the country and follow the advice of the local authorities.
See our Tropical cyclones page for advice about how to prepare effectively and what to do if youâ€™re likely to be affected by a tropical cyclone.
