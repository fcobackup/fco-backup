The Foreign, Commonwealth & Development Office (FCDO) advises against all but essential travel to:
the whole of Seychelles based on the current assessment of COVID-19 risks
From 4am on Saturday 9 January, visitors arriving into England who have been in or transited through Seychelles in the previous 10 days will not be permitted entry. British and Irish nationals, and third country nationals with residence rights in the UK arriving in England from Seychelles will be required to quarantine in a hotel. Different rules apply for arrivals into Scotland, Wales and Northern Ireland.
The FCDO is not advising those already travelling in Seychelles to leave at this time. Travellers should follow the advice of the local authorities on how best to protect themselves and others, including any measures that they bring in to control the virus. You should contact your tour operator or airline if you have any questions about your return journey.
From 1 January onwards those with residence rights includes: holders of Indefinite Leave to Remain; holders of existing leave to enter or remain (that is those with biometric Residence permits) or an entry clearance/visa that grants such leave like students and workers (excluding visit visas); holders of EU Settlement Scheme (“EUSS”) leave; those who have rights of entry under the Withdrawal Agreements (including returning residents with a right of residence under the EEA Regulations and EEA frontier workers); family members of EEA nationals with rights under the Withdrawal Agreement.

There is a problem with drugs in Seychelles, in particular heroin. Crime levels have risen as a result; there has been an increase in break-ins, robberies, burglaries and opportunist thefts against residents, expatriates and tourists. There were robberies and attacks at, and around, Cote D’Or beach on the island of Praslin in late 2017. Police responded with increased foot patrols and lighting. They advise visitors to take care when walking in this area, particularly at night. You should take sensible precautions to safeguard yourself and your possessions. See Crime
