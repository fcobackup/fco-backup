Other measures may include the requirement to present COVID-19 negative tests to enter some states, random testing in public areas including at airports, stations, malls and restaurants. You should monitor local media and follow any procedures put in place by local authorities. Before undertaking inter-state travel in India you should check the latest entry requirements and other testing/quarantine restrictions. Strict restrictions remain in containment zones.
The wearing of facial/cloth masks is compulsory in all public places. There are strict restrictions on large gatherings. You may be penalised if you violate restrictions.

Healthcare in India
Coronavirus cases in many parts of India are currently on the rise. There is a risk that the healthcare system will come under significant strain as the number of COVID-19 cases increases. RT-PCR testing may also become more difficult to arrange or results may take longer than expected for those who need negative RT-PCR tests for return to the UK. Access to routine and emergency healthcare exist, but capacity may be limited.
If you have symptoms of COVID-19 (coughing and fever and/or shortness of breath) and would like to get tested and get more information, contact a registered medical practitioner. A government supported central help line number +91-11-23978046 can be used to re-direct you to a medical practitioner. Testing is now also available on demand from private laboratories in the country. See additional guidance on testing. You may be liable for prosecution if you’re symptomatic or a confirmed case and deliberately attempt to hide symptoms and/or travel history.
