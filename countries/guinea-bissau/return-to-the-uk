Coronavirus guidance is being updated.
Read the Prime Minister’s statement for the latest information.

There are currently no commercial options available to return to the UK from Guinea Bissau. All borders and commercial air links are closed.
We know this is concerning for British people trying to leave Guinea Bissau. The UK government is liaising closely with airlines, the Guinea Bissau authorities and other governments to identify options for you to return to the UK.
If you cannot leave Guinea Bissau at this time, see advice on staying in Guinea-Bissau during coronavirus.
Future travel options
If you are a UK visitor who is normally resident in the UK and you want to leave Guinea Bissau, it may be possible to leave on a European repatriation flight.
This travel advice will be updated when departure options become available. Sign up for travel advice email alerts and follow the British Embassy Dakar on Facebook or Twitter.
If you are a British national, normally resident in the UK and you want to leave Guinea Bissau, you should also contact the British Embassy Dakar, which covers Guinea Bissau.
You will need to pay for your return travel to the UK. If departure options are available but you cannot afford the travel costs and have exhausted all other options for getting funds, you may be eligible to apply for an emergency loan from the government. This is a last resort option and you would need to repay the loan when you are back in the UK. For more information, you should contact Corporate Travel Management (CTM). CTM are a commercial partner of the FCO and are authorised to administer such loans on behalf of the FCO.
