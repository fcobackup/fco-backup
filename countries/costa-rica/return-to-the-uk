The FCO strongly encourages British nationals in Costa Rica to consider leaving to avoid difficulties they will face if flights out of the country and the region are further restricted and they are unable to get home.
British Airways have indicated that their direct flights to and from Costa Rica will cease after their last flight on Monday 30 March 2020 and are scheduled to resume on 27 June 2020. Resident and non-resident British nationals in Costa Rica who wish to leave should contact their airline or tour operator, and travel insurance company.
