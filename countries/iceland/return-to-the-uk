There are still commercial options to return to the UK from Iceland.
If you live in the UK and are currently visiting Iceland, you’re strongly advised to return now by commercial means. Don’t risk getting stranded.
UK special charter flights will only operate for priority countries where commercial flights are not possible. You should not assume that these flights will become available in Iceland because commercial routes are operating. Please do not contact the contracted travel management company if no flight is advertised here.
Flights
Only Icelandair currently flies to the UK (London Heathrow) on a significantly reduced service.
If you’re trying to get back to the UK and need financial help, see the FCO’s guide on financial assistance.
Travelling to the airport
The public bus company www.straeto.is is still running a service between Reykjavik and the airport.
Taxis are available.
Your journey home
The National Travel Health Network and Centre (NaTHNaC) provides advice on how to stay safe as you travel by air.
When you arrive back in the UK, follow the guidance for when you return to the UK on steps you should take to protect yourself and others.
Help and support
If you need urgent consular assistance, you can contact the British Embassy on +354 550 5100.
The Embassy cannot provide further information or advice about departure options over the phone.
You will need to pay for your return travel to the UK. If departure options are available but you cannot afford the travel costs and have exhausted all other options for getting funds, you may be eligible to apply for an emergency loan from the government. This is a last resort option and you would need to repay the loan when you are back in the UK. For more information, you should contact Corporate Travel Management (CTM). CTM are a commercial partner of the FCO and are authorised to administer such loans on behalf of the FCO.
