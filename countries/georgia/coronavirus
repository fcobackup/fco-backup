Travel in Georgia
Public transport is functioning normally. Taxis can hold no more than three people in a single vehicle, including the driver, with passengers sitting in the rear. If travelling to Tbilisi airport by taxi this social distancing rule must still be observed. Face masks must be worn in all public transport and taxis.
Accommodation
Most hotels and other rental accommodation have re-opened. Face masks must be worn when entering public spaces inside hotels and rental accommodation
Public spaces and services
Although most coronavirus restrictions have been lifted, enforcement of regulations on social distancing and masks is being tightened as coronavirus cases have risen following the summer holidays. No more than 10 people can participate in social gatherings such as weddings and funerals, indoor or out. Culture and sport events are limited to 200. There is no limit for political or election-related activities. Shops, restaurants and certified hotels remain open. Some educational establishments will open from 15 September, but schools in Tbilisi and most other large towns will delay re-opening until 1 October. Some remote learning is likely to continue.
It is mandatory to wear masks in enclosed spaces such as shops, when entering hotels and restaurants, and on public transport. Failing to do so can result in a 20 Lari (approx. £5) fine for an individual or 500 Lari (approx. £130) for a legal entity. In areas where there is an unexplained case of coronavirus, lockdown measures may be introduced without warning.
