Transport risks
Road travel
If you are planning to drive in the Cayman Islands, see information on driving abroad and check the driving regulations and other legal requirements you need to be aware of.
You can use a UK photocard driving licence to drive in the Cayman Islands. If you still have a paper driving licence, you may need to update it to a photocard licence or get the correct version of the international driving permit (IDP) as well.
Hire car companies often have stricter requirements for their customers, such as a year of driving experience or a higher minimum age.
Drink-driving is a serious offence in the Cayman Islands. If you are tested and found to have more than 0.07% of alcohol in your system (slightly lower than the limit in England, Wales and Northern Ireland), you may get a fine and possible imprisonment for 6 months.
Minibuses are currently the only form of local public transport. They run only on the main routes. For other journeys, taxis are available, or you can hire a car.
Air travel
Airlines have early check-in times for passengers and luggage, as all luggage is subject to being hand-searched. Check your recommended check-in time with your airline.
You will get an immigration card when you arrive which you must keep for your departure.
