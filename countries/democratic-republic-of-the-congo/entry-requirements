Entry rules in response to coronavirus (COVID-19)
Entry to DRC
DRC authorities opened their international and internal borders on 15 August. DRC’s neighbouring countries may have border restrictions in place. If you are planning travel in the region, you should check the travel advice for Republic of Congo, Central African Republic, South Sudan, Rwanda, Burundi, Tanzania, Zambia and Angola.
Testing/screening on arrival
All travellers entering DRC are subject to screening, including temperature checks. Travellers aged 11 and above need to provide proof of a negative coronavirus test upon entry to DRC and/or proof of vaccination against COVID-19. The test result date must be within the 72 hours prior to your arrival date. Children under the age of 11 are exempt. In addition, the Congolese Civil Aviation Authority has announced that all passengers, even those vaccinated, will be subjected to a PCR COVID-19 test at the airport upon arrival. Passengers are therefore invited, prior to boarding in the country of departure, to register online at on the National Institute of Biomedical Research website to obtain a QR code to be presented on arrival at the sampling centre at the airport. Registration requires you to upload a photo of your passport and a copy of your ticket. The cost of the test is around US$45, payable online, or on arrival (in cash).Travellers aged 11 and above must also pay $45 USD for a mandatory test on arrival.
You should not use the NHS testing service to get a test in order to facilitate your travel to another country. You should arrange to take a private test.
Demonstrating your COVID-19 vaccination status
DRC has not yet confirmed that it will accept the UK solutions for demonstrating your COVID vaccination status. You should follow guidance for alternative entry requirements. Your NHS appointment card from vaccination centres is not designed to be used as proof of vaccination.
Data collection
There are currently no track and trace requirements for arrivals.
Testing on departure
You must provide proof of a negative test for coronavirus upon departure. The test result date must fall within 3 days before your departure date and be provided by either INRB (Institut National de Recherche Biomédicale – The National Institute of Biomedical Research) or a medical facility approved by them.
You may be subjecting to screening, including temperature checks, when leaving DRC.
Regular entry requirements
Visas
All British passport holders need to get a visa before travelling to the DRC. You can’t buy a short-term pass to enter the country. To get a visa, contact:
The Embassy of the Democratic Republic of the Congo
281 Gray’s Inn Road
London
WC1X 8QF
Telephone: 0207 580 3931
Email: info@ambardc-londres.gouv.cd
DRC visa requirements mean that some types of visa applications are referred to Kinshasa for a decision. In these cases, a formal letter of invitation from the person or organisation you’re visiting, stamped by the Ministry of Foreign Affairs in Kinshasa and submitted with your application, can help to speed up the visa issuing process.
You should check requirements with the DRC Embassy in London and allow at least 2 to 3 weeks for visa processing.
A Rwandan or Ugandan immigration stamp in your passport should not prevent you from entering the DRC, but you may still experience difficulties on arrival if you do have them.
You should consider getting a long-term visa if you’re planning to stay in the DRC for a considerable period. When applying for or renewing a long term visa, DRC authorities now need a certificate of “Good Conduct” from your country of residence and a “Consular Certificate” as part of the application. The Consular Certificate can be issued at the British Embassy in DRC.
Passport validity
Your passport should be valid for a minimum period of 6 months from the date of entry into the DRC.
UK Emergency Travel Documents
UK Emergency Travel Documents are valid for entry into the DRC with a valid visa.
It may be necessary to produce a police report if your passport has been lost or stolen and you have been issued with an ETD, as immigration officials want to see evidence of entry stamps on departure/exit.
Departure tax
There is a departure tax of $50 per passenger plus a fee of 5,000 Congolese Francs on international flights and $10 per passenger on domestic flights. These are official fees paid when checking in. Get an official receipt plus a copy for each fee. You should hand the originals on request to immigration and at boarding, and keep the copies.
Satellite phones, GPS receivers or Military clothing
You may have difficulties at immigration if you are travelling with satellite phones, GPS receivers or military clothing.
