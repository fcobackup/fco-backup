The information on this page covers the most common types of travel and reflects the UK government’s understanding of the rules currently in place. Unless otherwise stated, this information is for travellers using a full ‘British Citizen’ passport.
The authorities in the country or territory you’re travelling to are responsible for setting and enforcing the rules for entry. If you’re unclear about any aspect of the entry requirements, or you need further reassurance, you’ll need to contact the embassy, high commission or consulate of the country or territory you’re travelling to.
You should also consider checking with your transport provider or travel company to make sure your passport and other travel documents meet their requirements.
If you need further information about entry requirements, contact the local immigration authorities or the nearest Latvian embassy/consulate. You should also check with your airline or travel company for the latest information.
Entry rules in response to coronavirus (COVID-19)
Direct commercial flights between Latvia and the United Kingdom have resumed. Details of flights can be found on airlines’ websites.
From 16 July, all passengers are required on arrival to complete and hand to their transport provider (e.g. airline, bus or coach company, ferry line) a contact form. This should give your telephone number, address where you will be staying, list the countries you have visited in the previous 14 days and include an undertaking to comply with the epidemiological security measures established in Latvia to limit the spread of COVID-19.
Quarantine requirements
Travellers arriving in Latvia from a country (or who have been in a country in the previous 14 days) where the cumulative incidence of COVID-19 cases in 100,000 of population over the previous 14 days is 16 or above are required to self-isolate for 14 days since leaving that country. These countries are marked in red and yellow in the table of comparative epidemiological data published every Friday on the Latvian Centre for Disease Prevention and Control website. On 14 August the UK was added to the list of countries from which arrivals are required to self-isolate.
Further details on self-isolation are on the Latvian Centre for Disease Prevention and Control website and the Latvian Government’s COVID-19 website:
if you are required to self-isolate you must carefully monitor your health for 14 days, including by taking your body temperature twice a day (in the morning and evening)
if you experience mild flu-like (increased body temperature, cough, sore throat) symptoms for at least two days you should call 8303. The dispatcher will then evaluate on a case-by-case basis and refer you to a testing point or send a medical unit to you if you are unable to travel to a testing point
in case of sudden onset of at least one of the following symptoms – dry cough, fever, shortness of breath – restrict contact with people nearby, but in case this is not possible, keep a distance of at least two metres from them, and call 113 immediately (State Emergency Medical Service).
If you have arrived in Latvia and are self-isolating but wish to leave Latvia before the end of the 14 day self-isolation period you should call the Latvian State Police on 110 and let them know of your intended departure.
Keep up to date with information from your tour operator, transport or accommodation provider on the impact on any existing travel plans.

Regular entry requirements
Visas
If you hold a British Citizen passport, you don’t need a visa to enter Latvia. If you’re planning a stay of longer than 3 months, see our Living in Latvia guide and contact the Latvian Embassy if you have further questions.
The rules on travel will stay the same until 31 December 2020.
Visas from 1 January 2021
The rules for travelling or working in Europe will change from 1 January 2021:
You will be able to travel to countries in the Schengen area for up to 90 days in any 180-day period without a visa for purposes such as tourism. This is a rolling 180-day period.
Therefore, if you’re travelling to Latvia, previous visits to the Schengen area within the 180 days before your date of travel would count against the 90-day limit.
If you are travelling visa-free to Latvia and to other countries in the Schengen area, make sure your whole visit is within the limit.
To stay for longer, to work or study, or for business travel you will need to meet the entry requirements set out by Latvia. This could mean applying for a visa or work permit. You should check with the Latvian Embassy what type of visa, if any, you will need.
Periods of stay authorised under a visa or permit will not count against the 90-day limit.
The European Commission has not yet set out how the limit of 90 days in any 180-day period for visa-free travel will be implemented for those who are already travelling in the EU or Schengen Area on 31 December 2020.
If you are travelling to Latvia before 31 December 2020 and will stay until 1 January 2021 or later, you should check with the Latvian Embassy for information on how the 90-day visa-free limit will apply to you. This also applies if your stay includes travel to other Schengen area countries.
At border control for Latvia, you may need to:
show a return or onward ticket
show you have enough money for your stay
use separate lanes from EU, EEA and Swiss citizens when queuing
Your passport may be stamped on entry and exit.
Passport validity
The rules on travel will stay the same until 31 December 2020.
Your passport should be valid for the proposed duration of your stay; you don’t need any additional period of validity on your passport beyond this.
Passport validity from 1 January 2021
From 1 January 2021, you must have at least 6 months left on an adult or child passport to travel to most countries in Europe (not including Ireland).
If you renewed your current passport before the previous one expired, extra months may have been added to its expiry date. Any extra months on your passport over 10 years may not count towards the 6 months needed.
Check your passport is valid for travel before you book your trip. You will need to renew your passport before travelling if you do not have enough time left on your passport.
Health insurance
You are required to have health insurance when you enter Latvia. This must include repatriation costs. Those who require visas for Latvia (other than EU family members) will need to show their policies upon arrival in Latvia.
UK Emergency Travel Documents
UK Emergency Travel Documents (ETDs) are accepted for entry, airside transit and exit from Latvia.
