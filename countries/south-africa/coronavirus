Travel in South Africa
Travel to and from the airports or other ports of arrival is restricted at this time. If you have a repatriation flight booked, linked to an Embassy or High Commission, you will generally not be allowed to go straight to the airport, and will be expected to meet at a pre-determined ‘assembly point’. The flight organisers are responsible for providing instructions for where to meet.
Some internal flights are operating. You will need to fill in a health declaration form which must be handed in at the airport. If travelling within South Africa you may travel straight to the airport.
You must wear a mask if using public transport, which is operating with strict hygiene requirements and reduced passenger numbers.
Everyone is required to wear a cloth face mask when in public.
Failure to comply with South African government regulations could result in a fine or arrest.
Accommodation
Hotels, guest houses and private rental accommodation are allowed to open subject to government regulations. You should contact your accommodation provider for more information.
Public spaces and services
The South African authorities have published COVID-19 guidelines and advice and have introduced a number of measures to limit the spread of the virus. Failure to comply could result in a fine or arrest.
South Africa has introduced a risk based, five-level approach to lockdown restrictions. On 18 August, South Africa moved to level 2 (from level 3).
The level of restriction in place may differ by province and district. You should follow advice from the local authorities about what restrictions apply where you are.
The South African government has implemented a countrywide curfew between 10pm and 4am. Everyone must wear a cloth face mask when in public.
Beaches and public parks are now open, but are subject to strict health protocols. There are strict rules regarding gatherings of people.
You should comply with any regulations set out by the South African government during the lockdown. See details on guidelines and relief.
Healthcare in South Africa
If you take regular medication, make sure you know how you can access a repeat prescription during the lockdown. Pharmacies are an essential service, and will generally be open, although temporary (2-3 day) closures are possible if a customer or staff member tests positive for COVID-19. Most medicines that require a prescription from a doctor in the UK will require one in South Africa. If necessary, you should obtain an electronic prescription from your medical practitioner to enable a local doctor to write one. Ask your insurer, or your accommodation provider to help you find one.
Private hospitals in South Africa are prepared to treat COVID-19, and the standard of care may be higher than in government hospitals. Our experience suggests that only people who are showing symptoms of COVID-19 are able to get a test, at both private and public healthcare facilities.
For contact details for English speaking doctors, visit our list of doctors.
If you think you have COVID-19 symptoms, you should contact your health insurer for advice, and can call the South African government local emergency hotline (0800029 999) or consult the online advice.
