The government has announced strict temporary measures to control the spread of the virus. If you’re planning travel to Kosovo, find out what you need to know about coronavirus there in the Coronavirus section.
During the COVID-19 pandemic, it is more important than ever to get travel insurance and check it provides sufficient cover. See the FCDO’s guidance on foreign travel insurance.
For information about COVID-19 vaccines, see the Coronavirus page.
Protests have the potential to turn violent, you should take care if you see large crowds gathering during heightened political tensions in the city. Check local media, consult hotel receptions for advice and regularly review information on this site for updates.
There have been violent clashes in the north of Kosovo and incidents involving grenades and vehicle explosions in northern Mitrovica. Be cautious and avoid public gatherings, particularly around the Austerlitz Bridge area which separates Mitrovica north and south.
Terrorists are likely to try to carry out attacks in Kosovo. Attacks could be indiscriminate, including in places visited by foreigners, large public gatherings and cultural events. Terrorists may target religious sites, including churches. See Terrorism
High levels of air pollution can occur in Kosovo. See Health
It’s possible to travel from Serbia into Kosovo, and back again. You’ll probably encounter problems entering Serbia from Kosovo if your passport shows you entered Kosovo directly from anywhere else other than Serbia. If tensions rise in the north it’s better to avoid border crossing Gates 1 and 31 (Leposavic and Zubin Potok). See Northern Kosovo
Residual landmines and other unexploded ordnance remain in Kosovo, although all roads and tracks have been cleared. See Local travel
If you’re abroad and you need emergency help from the UK government, contact the nearest British embassy, consulate or high commission. Consular support is limited in parts of Kosovo where the FCDO has existing advice against all but essential travel (see above).
