Regular entry requirements
Visas
The rules for travelling or working in European countries changed on 1 January 2021:

if you are travelling to Liechtenstein and other Schengen countries without a visa, make sure your whole visit is within the 90-day limit. Visits to Schengen countries within the previous 180 days before you travel count towards your 90 days
to stay longer, to work or study, for business travel or for other reasons, you will need to meet the Liechtenstein government’s entry requirements. Check with the Swiss Embassy in London what type of visa and/or work permit you may need
if you stay in Liechtenstein with a visa or permit, this does not count towards your 90-day visa-free limit
Any time you spent in Liechtenstein or other Schengen countries before 1 January 2021 does not count towards your 90-day visa-free limit.
At Liechtenstein border control, you may need to use separate lanes from EU, EEA and Swiss citizens when queueing. Your passport may be stamped on entry and exit. You may also need to:
show a return or onward ticket
show you have enough money for your stay
