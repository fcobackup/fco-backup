Cases of coronavirus (COVID-19) have been confirmed in Eswatini.
The Foreign and Commonwealth Office (FCO) advise against all but essential travel to Eswatini. This is due to the South African authorities announcing measures restricting individuals entering South Africa if they have come from various countries affected by coronavirus, including the United Kingdom. These measures came into effect on 18 March.
British Nationals in Eswatini, particularly those who have been in a coronavirus affected country (including the UK) in the past 20 days, should be aware that it is not possible to leave Eswatini by road into South Africa after 20 March without a visa. British Nationals will still be able to transit through OR Tambo International Airport in Johannesburg.
You should comply with any additional screening measures put in place by the authorities. Keep up to date with information from your tour operator, transport or accommodation provider on the impact of any existing travel plans.
If you need further information about entry requirements, contact the local immigration authorities or the nearest Eswatini High Commission. You should also check with your airline or travel company for the latest information.
Further information on coronavirus, including advice on preparing for foreign travel and helping reduce the spread of the virus, is available from Public Health England and on the TravelHealthPro website.
