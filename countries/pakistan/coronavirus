Cases of coronavirus (COVID-19) have been confirmed in Pakistan. The Pakistani authorities have introduced a number of measures to limit the spread of the virus.
Entry and travel restrictions
Pakistani authorities have introduced a number of measures to limit the spread of the virus including closures of the border with Iran, Afghanistan and the Wagah border with India, school closures, and banning public gatherings. Some provincial authorities are introducing additional measures, including requiring residents to stay at home, and closing shops and restaurants. Measures are particularly stringent in Sindh and Punjab. British Nationals should follow the federal and relevant provincial guidance, and monitor local media for updates. Movements should be planned accordingly.
On 21 March, the government of Pakistan announced the suspension of all international flights to Pakistan, effective from 2000 PST on 21 March until 2000 PST on 4 April. The government of Pakistan described the measure as a ‘temporary suspension imposed due to exceptional circumstances’. We understand that the suspension applies also to international flights out of Pakistan.
Despite this suspension, we understand Qatar Airways is planning operating daily flights from Islamabad International Airport from 25 March until 3 April. We understand that other airlines may be planning one-off or limited services leaving Pakistan in the next few days. If transiting a third country, please check that you will be able to fly on to the UK. Some internal flights within Pakistan have also been cancelled.

Reinforcement of screening and administrative measures at all sea ports have been announced.
