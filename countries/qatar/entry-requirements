This page has information on travelling to Qatar.
This page reflects the UK government’s understanding of current rules for people travelling on a full ‘British Citizen’ passport from the UK, for the most common types of travel.
The authorities in Qatar set and enforce entry rules. If you’re unsure how Qatar’s entry requirements apply to you, contact its UK embassy, high commission or consulate.
All travellers
The requirements for entering Qatar differ depending on whether the country you are travelling from is subject to ‘COVID-19 Red Health Measures’. The list of countries which are subject to these measures can be found on the Ministry of Public Health website, along with full details of Qatar’s travel and return policy. The UK is not currently subject to ‘COVID-19 Red Health Measures’.
The need for a pre-departure PCR test if travelling from the UK is determined by your vaccination status (see below).
Before travelling to Qatar, visitors must have registered via the Ministry of Public Health’s pre-registration platform. Visitors who hold either the NHS UK COVID Pass app or the EU COVPass app (the EU digital COVID Certificate) are exempt from the requirement to pre-register.
You must complete and sign an ‘undertaking and acknowledgement form’ prior to arrival. This form is available on the Ministry of Public Health website, pre-registration platform, and airline online booking form.
All visitors should download the Ehteraz app and activate this on arrival, through the use of either a local or international sim card.
You may be required to pass through thermal screening or temperature checks on arrival into Qatar at air, land or sea ports.
If you are fully vaccinated
Check the Ministry of Public Health website to see whether the country you are travelling from is subject to ‘COVID-19 ‘Red Health Measures’. The UK is not currently subject to these measures.
If you have either the NHS UK COVID Pass app or the EU COVPass app (the EU digital COVID Certificate), you are exempt from the requirement to pre-register.
If you have had a medically confirmed COVID-19 infection, you are considered to have immune status valid for twelve months from the date of the infection and will be treated as though you are fully vaccinated. An official and verifiable laboratory test result will be required as evidence of the past infection. For further guidance refer to the Ministry of Public Health website.
Proof of vaccination status
The UK COVID Pass is accepted as proof of vaccination for entry to Qatar.
If you do not have a UK COVID Pass you will need to upload evidence of vaccination on the pre-registration platform.
For the purposes of entry into Qatar, the Ministry of Public Health recognises the Pfizer/BioNTech, Moderna, AstraZeneca or Johnson & Johnson vaccines. To find out whether you qualify as fully vaccinated refer to the Ministry of Public Health website. This includes details on the recognised immunity validity period for each vaccine, and other conditionally approved vaccines.
Vaccinated visitors
Fully vaccinated visitors travelling from countries not subject to ‘COVID-19 Red Health Measures’ must take a pre-departure PCR test within 48 hours of their flight departure time, with a negative result. No quarantine or testing on arrival is required. Visitors who hold a UK COVID Pass (or one of the EU or GCC passes listed on the Ministry of Public Health Website) are exempt from the requirement for a pre-departure PCR test.
Fully vaccinated visitors travelling from countries subject to ‘COVID-19 Red Health Measures’ must take a pre-departure PCR test within 48 hours of their flight departure time, with a negative result.

All hotel quarantine packages need to be booked through the Discover Qatar website.
Vaccinated residents
British nationals holding a Qatar residence permit no longer require prior approval to return to Qatar. However, the Government of Qatar recommends that all residents complete pre-registration for return to Qatar using the pre-registration platform ahead of travel.
Fully vaccinated residents returning to Qatar no longer need to undertake a pre-departure PCR test or quarantine on arrival, irrespective of whether the country of departure is subject to ‘COVID-19 Red Health Measures’.
Fully vaccinated residents will need to undergo a rapid antigen test within 24 hours of arrival. This applies to all residents regardless of age. The test can be administered at either a primary health care centre or private clinic/hospital – see the list of accredited COVID-19 testing healthcare facilities. Rapid antigen self-tests are not accepted. For further information visit the Ministry of Public Health website.
If you are not fully vaccinated
If you have had a medically confirmed COVID-19 infection, you are considered to have immune status valid for twelve months from the date of the infection.

If you’re transiting through Qatar
Transiting is when you pass through one country on the way to your final destination.
Transiting through Qatar is permitted for travellers who meet the requirements of their final destination country.
There are no additional requirements for transiting passengers, even if you choose to use the transit hotel within the airport.
Travellers cannot remain in the transit area for more than 24 hours between flights, regardless of whether you are using the transit hotel within the airport.
Further information about transiting through Qatar can be found on the webpage for Hamad International Airport.
Check your passport and travel documents before you travel
Check with your travel provider to make sure your passport and other travel documents meet their requirements.
Passport validity
If you are visiting Qatar your passport should be valid for a minimum of 6 months from the date you arrive.
If you are a resident of Qatar your passport must be valid on arrival.
Visas
You can get a free 30-day tourist visa-waiver on arrival in Qatar if you’re travelling on a full British Citizen passport. If you’re travelling for any purpose other than tourism, and/or hold one of the other types of British passport, you must get a visa before you travel.
If you need to stay longer than 30 days, you must extend your visa waiver before it expires through the Ministry of Interior. If you fail to do so, you may receive an overstay fine, which must be paid before leaving Qatar.
You can find further information on visa requirements and extensions on the Qatar Ministry of Interior website
UK Emergency Travel Documents
UK Emergency Travel Documents (ETDs) are not valid for entry into Qatar. However, ETDs are accepted for airside transit and exit from Qatar. If you are seeking to exit Qatar on an ETD because your full validity passport has been lost or stolen, you must obtain a police report in order to do so. These reports can be obtained at any police station in Qatar. You should allow sufficient time to collect this report as they can take up to 2 days to be processed. Without this report you may experience difficulties at the airport. If the holder of the ETD is a new-born child with no previous passport or identification, an exit permit is required before exiting Qatar. These can be obtained from the Immigration Office in Al Gharrafa. If your destination is not the UK you will need proof of residency for your destination country. An emergency travel document does not grant you entry. You are responsible for checking you have the correct documents to enter your destination country.
Living and working in Qatar
If you’re applying for a residence permit, you will have to undergo a medical test including blood tests and a chest X-ray. The tests screen for diseases including, but not restricted to, HIV/AIDS, Tuberculosis, Hepatitis B and C. Testing positive may lead to further tests and possible deportation.
