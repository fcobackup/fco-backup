The information on this page covers the most common types of travel and reflects the UK government’s understanding of the rules currently in place. Unless otherwise stated, this information is for travellers using a full ‘British Citizen’ passport.
The authorities in the country or territory you’re travelling to are responsible for setting and enforcing the rules for entry. If you’re unclear about any aspect of the entry requirements, or you need further reassurance, you’ll need to contact the embassy, high commission or consulate of the country or territory you’re travelling to.
You should also consider checking with your transport provider or travel company to make sure your passport and other travel documents meet their requirements.
Entry rules in response to coronavirus (COVID-19)
Entry to Germany
There are now no general COVID-19-related restrictions on entry into Germany from elsewhere in the EU, the UK, Iceland, Liechtenstein or Norway. Entry restrictions and heightened checks on Germany’s borders for those arriving by land or air from these countries expired on 15 June. For Spain, the restrictions on entry (by air) were lifted on 21 June.
The German Interior Ministry has confirmed that travellers from the UK are no longer required to demonstrate a valid reason in order to enter Germany. Standard German entry and immigration rules in place before the COVID-19 outbreak apply.
Entry into Germany from third countries (outside the EU/EEA and the UK)
In line with the European Commission recommendation, from 2 July Germany is gradually lifting restrictions on entry from third states where the COVID-19 epidemiological situation is improving. The rules concern travellers’ place of immediate prior stay, not their nationality.
On 2 July Germany lifted restrictions on entry for travellers coming from the following countries: Australia, Georgia, Canada, Montenegro, New Zealand, Thailand, Tunisia and Uruguay. Restrictions will also be lifted for entry from South Korea, China and Japan if this can be agreed on a reciprocal basis. Currently Germany has not yet lifted restrictions on entry from Serbia, Morocco, Algeria and Rwanda, on the basis of infection data provided by its own public health institute, although these four countries were included on the European Commission list. The list will be reviewed every two weeks.
Entry from any third country is possible for travellers who can demonstrate an important reason for their travel. The list of important reasons covers German and EU citizens and any third-country nationals with a right of residency in Germany. It also includes healthcare and social care personnel and health researchers, skilled workers whose economic activity is necessary and cannot be postponed or performed from abroad, freight and transport staff, seasonal workers, students who cannot continue their studies from abroad, travellers making visits for urgent family reasons, diplomats and staff at international organisations, and persons transiting Germany.
Transiting Germany
It remains possible for British citizens (and all EU/EEA citizens) to transit via Germany in order to go home or to their place of habitual residence.
You should ensure you are aware of your airline’s policy on protective measures on board flights; some carriers have made the wearing of face masks compulsory, for example.
The Federal Ministry of the Interior has detailed information on its website, including in English, regarding the rules on entry and exit from Germany.
Quarantine requirements
The German Interior Ministry has encouraged federal states to revise their quarantine regulations for arriving and returning travellers. People entering from other EU countries, the Schengen area and the UK will only have to go into quarantine if they are entering from an area where there is a high rate of infection. Travellers should consult local federal state and health authority guidance for specific arrangements (see Federal Interior Ministry FAQs)
Since 8 August travellers entering Germany after staying in a designated risk area abroad during the previous 14 days must undergo mandatory testing for Covid-19. The German government regularly updates its list of designated risk areas. See the English archive at the bottom of this Robert Koch Institute link for the latest list.
If you’re travelling to Germany and have been in a designated risk area, there are three choices. You can:
present a valid test taken within 48 hours prior to arrival;
take a test directly on arrival - there are facilities to provide such testing operating at airports and major transport hubs; or
take a test after your return to your place of residence in Germany, where you are required to report to the local health office. The test is free of charge if taken within 72 hours of arrival.
A negative test may exempt you from the 14-day self-isolation requirement, but you should note that some German states require a second negative test before granting an exemption from quarantine.
Regular entry requirements
Visas
If you hold a British Citizen passport, you don’t need a visa to enter Germany. If you’re planning a stay of longer than 3 months, see our Living in Germany guide and contact the German Embassy if you have further questions.
The rules on travel will stay the same until 31 December 2020.
Visas from 1 January 2021
The rules for travelling or working in Europe will change from 1 January 2021:
You will be able to travel to countries in the Schengen area for up to 90 days in any 180-day period without a visa for purposes such as tourism. This is a rolling 180-day period.
Therefore, if you’re travelling to Germany, previous visits to the Schengen area within the 180 days before your date of travel would count against the 90-day limit.
If you are travelling visa-free to Germany and to other countries in the Schengen area, make sure your whole visit is within the limit.
To stay for longer, to work or study, or for business travel you will need to meet the entry requirements set out by Germany. This could mean applying for a visa or work permit. You should check with the German Embassy what type of visa, if any, you will need.
Periods of stay authorised under a visa or permit will not count against the 90-day limit.
The European Commission has not yet set out how the limit of 90 days in any 180-day period for visa-free travel will be implemented for those who are already travelling in the EU or Schengen Area on 31 December 2020.
If you are travelling to Germany before 31 December 2020 and will stay until 1 January 2021 or later, you should check with the German Embassy for information on how the 90-day visa-free limit will apply to you. This also applies if your stay includes travel to other Schengen area countries.
At border control for Germany, you may need to:
show a return or onward ticket
show you have enough money for your stay
use separate lanes from EU, EEA and Swiss citizens when queuing
Your passport may be stamped on entry and exit.
Passport validity
The rules on travel will stay the same until 31 December 2020.
Your passport should be valid for the proposed duration of your stay; you do not need any additional period of validity on your passport beyond this.
Passport validity from 1 January 2021
From 1 January 2021, you must have at least 6 months left on an adult or child passport to travel to most countries in Europe (not including Ireland).
If you renewed your current passport before the previous one expired, extra months may have been added to its expiry date. Any extra months on your passport over 10 years may not count towards the 6 months needed.
Check your passport is valid for travel before you book your trip. You will need to renew your passport before travelling if you do not have enough time left on your passport.
UK Emergency Travel Documents
UK Emergency Travel Documents (ETDs) are accepted for entry, airside transit and exit from Germany.
Working in Germany
If you intend to work in Germany, you should get detailed information on employment regulations from the German Embassy.
