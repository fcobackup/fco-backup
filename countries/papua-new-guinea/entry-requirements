Entry rules in response to coronavirus (COVID-19)
Entry to Papua New Guinea
Commercial options for travel to and from Papua New Guinea remain very limited. If transiting through another country, it is important that you also check the latest requirements for transit through that country.
Nobody may enter Papua New Guinea unless they have a written exemption from the Controller or his delegate, and evidence of a negative RT-PCR test result for COVID-19 taken within a 7 day period prior to arrival. You should not use the NHS testing service to get a test in order to facilitate your travel to another country. You should arrange to take a private test.
International visitors should apply for their exemption to enter Papua New Guinea by emailing the NCC Travel Desk at covid19-travel@police.gov.pg with the following documents:
completed and signed Air Passenger Transport Form (APTF ), including details of your travel date to Papua New Guinea, quarantine hotel (if required) and a scanned copy of your passport biodata page as the ID
letter to the Controller, including your reason for travel, visa details, passport details (including the expiry date) and, if applicable, your work permit details (or letter from your employer) and/or resident permit details
copy of your passport biodata page
copy of your visa for Papua New Guinea and, if applicable, a copy of your work permit and/or resident permit
copy of your reservation at a designated hotel for quarantine (if required)
copy of your flight itinerary
You should submit your completed documents at least two weeks prior to travel.
You will be required to show evidence of your approved exemptions, negative COVID-19 test and hotel reservation (if required) to be allowed to board a flight to Papua New Guinea. From 21 September, travellers to Papua New Guinea must also complete an online electronic health declaration form within 24 hours of departure. The barcode generated should be saved as evidence of submission
Anyone arriving into Papua New Guinea must self-isolate in a government approved hotel for 14 days, unless you have spent the 7 days prior to travel in Australia (except the state of Victoria), New Zealand or one of a number of Pacific Island states. A full list is available on the official PNG government COVID-19 website.
Travellers quarantining in a government approved hotel will be expected to cover the cost of their stay. Those arriving from destinations other than Australia, New Zealand or Pacific Island states will also be subject to monitoring through either an approved tracking device or tracking application at their own cost. All travellers quarantining at home will be subject to monitoring through an approved tracking device or application at their own cost, regardless of where they have travelled from.
Further details of the measures in place for international travel can be found on the official PNG government COVID-19 website.
Domestic airline travellers may be required to be tested for COVID-19. Testing requirements for domestic travel are at the discretion of each province, and travellers should check the latest requirements with their travel agent. Further details of the measures in place for domestic travel can be found on the official PNG government COVID-19 website.
