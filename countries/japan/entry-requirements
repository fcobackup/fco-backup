This advice reflects the UK government’s understanding of current rules for people travelling on a full ‘British citizen’ passport from the UK, for the most common types of travel.
The authorities in Japan set and enforce entry rules. If you’re not sure how these requirements apply to you, contact the Japanese Embassy in the UK.
COVID-19 rules
There are no COVID-19 testing or vaccination requirements for travellers entering Japan.
Travel in Japan
There are no official COVID-19 restrictions on travel, dining out or other activities. However, the Japanese government still recommends social distancing, mask wearing and other basic precautions. Public compliance with these recommendations is high.
Passport validity requirements   
If you’re visiting Japan, your passport must be valid for the length of your stay. No additional period of validity is required.
Check with your travel provider that your passport and other travel documents meet requirements. Renew your passport if you need to.
You will be denied entry if you do not have a valid travel document or try to use a passport that has been reported lost or stolen. 
Visa requirements
If you have a ‘British citizen’ passport, you can travel to Japan for tourism or business for up to 90 days. You will get a visa in your passport on arrival, and you do not need to apply before you travel. The Japanese immigration authorities may extend your visa by another 90 days at their discretion. You will need to apply for an extension.
If you have another type of British passport, you must get a visa.
To stay longer (to work or study, for or for other reasons), you must meet the Japanese government’s entry requirements. Check which type of visa or work permit you need with the Japanese Embassy in the UK.
It is illegal to work in Japan without the correct visa however informal or temporary the work.
If you overstay your permission to remain in Japan, you risk arrest, detention and a heavy fine.
For residency information, see the Japanese Immigration Services Agency website and living in Japan.
Vaccination requirements
At least 8 weeks before your trip, check the vaccinations and certificates you need in TravelHealthPro’s Japan guide.
Customs rules
There are strict rules about goods you can take into or out of Japan. You must declare anything that may be prohibited or subject to tax or duty.
It is illegal to bring meat products (including sausages, bacon and ham) to Japan without permission from the Japanese Animal Quarantine Service. Penalties include a heavy fine and prison sentence.
Whale meat is available in Japan but importing it into the UK and EU is illegal. If you import whale meat to the UK, you can get a fine of up to £5,000 and a prison sentence. Customs officers will seize the meat.
Taking money into Japan  
People mainly use cash in Japan.
You may have difficulty using credit and debit cards issued outside Japan. Cirrus, Maestro, Link and Delta cash cards are not widely accepted. Japanese post offices, 7-Eleven stores and JP Post Bank have cash machines that will accept some foreign cards during business hours.
Check with your bank before travelling and take alternative sources of money.
