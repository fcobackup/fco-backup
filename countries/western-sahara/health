Visit your health professional at least 4 to 6 weeks before your trip to check whether you need any vaccinations or other preventive measures. Country specific information and advice is published by the National Travel Health Network and Centre on the TravelHealthPro website and by NHS (Scotland) on the fitfortravel website. Useful information and advice about healthcare abroad is also available on the NHS Choices website.
Medical facilities are adequate in the main cities (Laayoune, Dhakla and Smara) all of which have hospitals, clinics and pharmacies. For more sophisticated medical treatment (scans etc) you will need to go to a major centre in Morocco or the Canary Islands. Medical facilities are almost non-existent in desert areas. Make sure you have adequate travel health insurance and accessible funds to cover the cost of any medical treatment abroad and repatriation.
If you need emergency medical assistance during your trip, dial 150 and ask for an ambulance. Contact your insurance/medical assistance company promptly if you are referred to a medical facility for treatment.
