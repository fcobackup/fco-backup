If you need emergency medical assistance during your trip, dial 103 and ask for an ambulance, although the emergency services operators only speak Kazakh or Russian and waiting times for ambulances can be lengthy. If possible it is often quicker to take a taxi to the hospital. You should contact your insurance/medical assistance company promptly if you are referred to a medical facility for treatment.
