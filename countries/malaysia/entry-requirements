Warning
FCDO advises against all but essential travel to parts of Malaysia.

This information is for people travelling on a full ‘British citizen’ passport from the UK. It is based on the UK government’s understanding of Malaysia’s current rules for the most common types of travel.
The authorities in Malaysia set and enforce entry rules. If you’re not sure how these requirements apply to you, contact the Malaysian High Commission in the UK.
Passport validity requirements
To enter Malaysia, your passport must have an ‘expiry date’ at least 6 months after the date you arrive. Make sure it is undamaged, with no pages missing.
Check with your travel provider that your passport and other travel documents meet requirements. Renew your passport if you need to.  
You will be denied entry if you do not have a valid travel document or try to use a passport that has been reported lost or stolen.
Dual nationals
Malaysia does not recognise dual nationality. You can be refused entry if you’re found with a Malaysian passport and one of a different nationality. If you have dual nationality (not including Malaysian), enter and exit on the same passport.
Visa requirements
You can visit Malaysia without a visa for tourism. You will normally be allowed to stay for 90 days on arrival.
If you want to stay for longer than 90 days or are not a tourist, you must apply for a visa from the nearest Malaysian diplomatic mission before you travel.
The Malaysian authorities do not tolerate illegal immigration. Do not overstay your visa or violate the terms of entry. Even if you overstay for just a few days, you can be:
fined
detained
deported to the UK at your own cost
banned  from returning to Malaysia
Detention facilities can be poor with limited healthcare. The British High Commission is unable to help you stay in Malaysia or issue any document to support your overstay.
Keep a copy of your passport and visa safe in case your passport is lost. It may take time to get a replacement visa. If you cannot show your original visa or entry stamp on exit, you may be treated as an overstayer.
Submitting an arrival card
You must submit an arrival card online to enter Malaysia. Do this before you travel – airlines may ask for it at check-in. If you are not passing through immigration, you do not need to complete an arrival card. See the Malaysian Immigration website for further information, including exemption details.
Entering East Malaysia
If you’re travelling between Peninsular Malaysia and East Malaysia (sometimes known as Malaysian Borneo and made up of the states of Sabah and Sarawak), you must carry your passport. You will pass through immigration control and must get entry and exit stamps.
Vaccine requirements
To enter Malaysia, you must have a certificate to prove you’ve had a yellow fever vaccination if you’re coming from a country listed as a transmission risk.
For full details about medical entry requirements and recommended vaccinations, see TravelHealthPro’s Malaysia guide.
Drug screening
The Malaysian authorities could ask you to take a urine test on arrival if they suspect drug use. If they find drugs in your system, they could detain or deport you and ban you from returning to Malaysia. You could face these penalties even if you took the drug outside Malaysia, including in a country where it is legal.
Customs rules
There are strict rules about goods you can take into or out of Malaysia. You must declare anything that may be prohibited or subject to tax or duty.
If you are not sure if it is legal to bring items, including medications, declare them on entry.
Importing firearms
It’s illegal to import unlicensed firearms and ammunition into Malaysia. This includes spent ammunition and souvenirs from war museums. Do not take any weapons or replica weapons into Malaysia. You may be detained and charged if you do. If you’re convicted of dealing in illegal firearms, you can get a death sentence.
Taking money into or out of Malaysia
When you enter or exit Malaysia, you must declare cash in any currency or travellers cheques worth 10,000 US dollars or more. If you do not, customs officials could seize your money. You could get a fine of up to 3 million Malaysian ringgit and up to 5 years in prison.
Before you travel, you must get approval to take ringgit worth 10,000 US dollars or more into or out of Malaysia.  
See the Royal Malaysian Customs Department website for more information.
