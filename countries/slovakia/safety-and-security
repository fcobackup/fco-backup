Terrorism in Slovakia
An attack on a bar popular with the LGBT+ community in the capital Bratislava on 12 October 2022 which resulted in 2 deaths was classified as a terrorist act. Prior to this attack, there was no recent history of terrorism in Slovakia. Further attacks cannot be ruled out.
You should be aware of the global risk of indiscriminate terrorist attacks which could be in public places, including in places frequented by expatriates and foreign travellers.
Border with Ukraine
There is widespread military activity in Ukraine. FCDO advises against all travel to Ukraine.
Political demonstrations
Demonstrations may occur with little or no warning. Avoid any protests, political gatherings or marches. Follow the advice of local authorities.
Crime
Protecting your belongings
Take precautions against pickpockets and bag snatchers and do not leave your possessions unattended. Do not leave your passport as a deposit for services such as car rental, and keep sight of your bank card when making payments.
There is a risk of petty crime, especially in Bratislava. Pickpockets operate around the main tourist areas, particularly the Christmas markets and in bars, and have targeted foreigners.
Drink spiking
There is a risk of drink spiking and theft in clubs around the old town pedestrian area in Bratislava. People have sometimes been charged extortionate prices for drinks, so check prices before ordering.
Vehicle crime
Foreign-registered cars can be targeted. Criminals may puncture your tyres at a petrol station or fake a breakdown and then rob you or drive off in your car if you stop to help.
At night, only stop your car in a well-lit public area such as a service station. Make sure you lock your car and in be extremely wary of anyone offering help.
Do not leave luggage in view in your car.
Laws and cultural differences
Personal ID
You must carry your passport with you at all times as identification.
Alcohol laws and bans
Bratislava has become a popular destination for stag parties and tourists have been fined or imprisoned for causing public nuisance. Unruly or rowdy behaviour between 10pm and 6am is illegal and could attract police attention. In Bratislava Old Town, it is illegal to drink alcohol in the street. If you drink alcohol (for example bought in a supermarket) in other public areas, you could get a fine of 33 euros.
Illegal drugs and prison sentences
Penalties for smuggling, possession and use of drugs are severe.
Using cameras and binoculars in secure areas
Taking photographs of any location that could be seen as a military establishment or security related may result in problems with the authorities.
LGBT+ travellers
Same-sex sexual relationships are legal in Slovakia, but same-sex marriages and civil partnerships are not recognised in Slovak law. Public displays of affection may be frowned on or receive unwanted attention.
Read more advice for LGBT+ travellers.
Outdoor activities and adventure tourism
Swimming and water sports
Observe local rules and regulations on publicly accessible lakes, rivers and other water sources. Jumping into unknown waters can result in serious injury, including paralysis or death.
Skiing and hiking
If you’re planning a winter sports holiday in Slovakia, read the SkiSafe guidance including what to do before you go and staying safe at your resort.
If you ski or hike in the Slovak mountains and need help from the Slovak Mountain Rescue Service (HZS), you will have to meet costs of up to 1000 euros. Make sure your insurance includes rescue costs. Anyone ignoring or violating HZS rules or instructions will be fined up to 3,320 euros.
Visitors in mountain areas occasionally encounter bears and wolves, but attacks on people are rare. For advice on minimising risks, see the Slovak Wildlife Society website.
Transport risks
Road travel
You can drive in Slovakia with your UK driving licence. For any stay longer than 6 months you must exchange your licence for a Slovak one.
If you are planning to drive in Slovakia, see information on driving abroad and read the RAC’s Slovakia guide.
Many main roads have only a single carriageway in each direction making overtaking difficult. Beware of oncoming cars overtaking on your side of the road. Road markings are difficult to see in poor weather and can be faded. In winter, you must equip your car for severe driving conditions.
Drink driving is a serious offence in Slovakia. If you are tested and found to have any alcohol in your system, you may get a fine of up to 1300 euros, have your licence confiscated, and face possible imprisonment.
Tolls
If you use Slovak motorways (‘Dialnica’) you must display a motorway vignette (sticker) on the inside of your windscreen as you enter Slovakia. If you do not you could get a heavy fine. You can get a motorway vignette at all major border crossings into Slovakia and at larger petrol stations.
More information on the toll system and a road network map is available from the toll system operator.
Taxis
Taxi drivers sometimes try to overcharge tourists by adding unauthorised supplements or by not setting the meter at the start of a journey.
