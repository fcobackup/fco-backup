The South Sudan authorities had already introduced a number of precautionary measures in response to the coronavirus pandemic. The likelihood of further, more restrictive measures in the coming weeks is high.
Entry and borders
There are currently no routine commercial flights in to or out of South Sudan. Juba airport has been closed since 24 March. All land borders are closed.
South Sudan has suspended the issue of visas at its Embassies abroad, and the South Sudan Embassy in London is closed.
Local measures
An official government curfew has been introduced across South Sudan from 8pm to 6am. Most shops, restaurants and businesses are closed. There are also restrictions on public transport, inter-state movements and public gatherings.
Keep up to date with information from your tour operator, transport or accommodation provider on the impact on any existing travel plans. If you need further information about entry requirements, contact the nearest South Sudan Embassy. You should also check with your airline or travel company for the latest information.
