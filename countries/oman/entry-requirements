The information on this page covers the most common types of travel and reflects the UK government’s understanding of the rules currently in place. Unless otherwise stated, this information is for travellers using a full ‘British Citizen’ passport.
The authorities in the country or territory you’re travelling to are responsible for setting and enforcing the rules for entry. If you’re unclear about any aspect of the entry requirements, or you need further reassurance, you’ll need to contact the embassy, high commission or consulate of the country or territory you’re travelling to.
You should also consider checking with your transport provider or travel company to make sure your passport and other travel documents meet their requirements.
Entry rules in response to coronavirus
Before you travel
You must have a valid visa before you travel. Visas cannot currently be issued on arrival. You should check with your airline what documentation they require you to present.
You must take a PCR test no more than 72 hours prior to your arrival in Oman and complete an online pre-registration form.
You will also need to have downloaded the Tarassud+ and HMushrif track and trace applications (available on iOS and Android phones). While you can do this on arrival in Oman, you should aim to download it before you leave the UK.
Although no longer a requirement, when checking in at the airport, residents returning to Oman should be prepared to give proof of their accommodation (such as a rental agreement) or have a letter from their sponsor confirming that they have accommodation. Travellers with tourist, business ‘express’ or family visit visas should also have proof of their accommodation. You must also be able to show you have travel/health insurance for the duration of your stay, covering at least 30 days of coronavirus treatment.
Travel by air
British nationals with valid residence, tourist, business ‘express’ or family visit visas can enter Oman. Any other travellers should seek approval via their airline. Alternatively, their sponsors can email the Omani MFA at consular@mofa.gov.om.
Travel by land
The Omani authorities have announced that land borders will be closed from 6pm local time on Monday 18 January.
Screening on arrival
All arrivals (over the age of 15) are required to have a PCR test at Muscat International Airport. There is a charge of 25 Omani Riyals for this test. You can pay for this through the Tarassud+ App before you arrive in Oman. You will receive a QR code that you can show at the screening point to confirm payment.
You will also be required (if you are over the age of 15) to wear a tracking bracelet for the period of your self-isolation. There is a charge (also payable through the Tarassud+ application) of 6 Omani Riyals for the bracelet. Bracelets must be returned once you have completed your self-isolation. Some health clinics have established drop off points for this purpose.
Quarantine requirements
The results of the PCR test undertaken at the airport will be sent to your registered phone (usually within 24 hours). You should self-isolate until you receive the result.
Regardless of the result of the PCR test taken at the airport, you must self-isolate for 7 days. On the eighth day you can take another PCR test. These can be taken at some hospitals, private health clinics or at a drive through testing facility at Muscat airport. If the result is negative you can have your tracking bracelet removed and end your self-isolation. You may be charged a small additional fee to have the bracelet removed.
Foreign nationals with resident status can self-isolate either at their home in Oman or other in other accommodation (eg hotels) with proof of their ability to cover living costs during that period.
Data collection
Prior to travelling, you should download the Tarassud+ track and trace application. Through that app, or on arrival, you will need to pay 25 Omani Riyals for a PCR test (testing on arrival) and, if you are staying more than 7 days, an additional 6 Omani Riyals for a tracking bracelet.
Testing on departure
On departure you will have your temperature checked. If you show symptoms of coronavirus, you may be prevented from travelling. You must also comply with whatever the entry and testing requirements are at the country you intend to travel to.
Regular entry requirements
Visas
See ‘entry rules in response to coronavirus’ section.
Passport validity
Your passport should have at least 6 months’ validity remaining on your date of entry to Oman.
Oman doesn’t recognise dual nationality. If you hold both British and Oman nationalities and this becomes known to the Omani authorities, they may confiscate your Omani or British passport.
Yellow fever certificate requirements
Check whether you need a yellow fever certificate by visiting the National Travel Health Network and Centre’s TravelHealthPro website.
UK Emergency Travel Documents
UK Emergency Travel Documents (ETDs) are valid for entry, exit and transit in Oman however they must have at least 6 months’ remaining validity. Residents and tourists will need to get an exit stamp before leaving. This can cause delays and may prevent you from leaving on your booked flight. Check your passport carefully to make sure it’s legal and valid so that you don’t need an ETD.
Travelling with medication
Some prescribed and over the counter medicines available in the UK are banned substances in Oman. If you’re travelling to Oman with prescription drugs, carry a copy of the prescription. For further information, check with Oman’s Ministry of Health well in advance of travel.
