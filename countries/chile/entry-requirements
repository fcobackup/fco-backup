The information on this page covers the most common types of travel and reflects the UK government’s understanding of the rules currently in place. Unless otherwise stated, this information is for travellers using a full ‘British Citizen’ passport.
The authorities in the country or territory you’re travelling to are responsible for setting and enforcing the rules for entry. If you’re unclear about any aspect of the entry requirements, or you need further reassurance, you’ll need to contact the embassy, high commission or consulate of the country or territory you’re travelling to.
You should also consider checking with your transport provider or travel company to make sure your passport and other travel documents meet their requirements.
Entry rules in response to coronavirus
Entry to Chile
On 18 March 2020 the Chilean Government introduced a prohibition on entry into the country, except for Chilean nationals and foreign nationals with valid residency visas for Chile. It is possible to transit through Chile, as long as you remain airside throughout your journey.
Quarantine requirements
Chilean nationals and foreign nationals with Chilean residency who return to the country will be required to self-quarantine for 14 days. If you are returning by air, you will be handed a health form to fill in during the flight, to hand to authorities on arrival. At the airport you will have your temperature checked. You will also need to confirm to authorities where you will be conducting quarantine and provide details of how you will be travelling to that location (including the name of the taxi company that you are using, if relevant).
Although this is not an entry requirement, if you wish to undertake a PCR test, you can do so by visiting a local doctor or hospital and obtaining a medical order (orden medica) for the test. Once you have done the test, you should receive the results within 72 hours. If the result is negative, you do not need to remain in quarantine. If the result is positive, you must remain in quarantine for 14 days from the day of the test.
The Chilean authorities have closed all ports to cruise liners.
Regular entry requirements
Visas
If you are a British passport holder visiting Chile for less than 90 days, you do not need a visa. If you wish to stay longer, you should consult the nearest Chilean Embassy. 
On arrival in Chile the immigration authorities will issue you with a ‘Tarjeta de Turismo - Tourist Card’, an A5 sized white form. You must retain this document and present it to immigration when you leave.
Once in Chile, if you decide to stay for 90 days or more, you should contact the Chilean Immigration Department located in San Antonio 580, Santiago. Telephone: 600 626 4222.
Passport validity
Your passport should be valid for the proposed duration of your stay. No additional period of validity beyond this is required.
Dual nationality
British-Chilean dual nationals must enter and leave Chile using their Chilean passport. Chilean entry and exit requirements for dual nationals may change without notice. For further information check with the Chilean Embassy.
Travelling with children   
Chile has strict requirements for the entry and exit of minors under the age of 18.
Children born in Chile require a Chilean passport to leave.
Children under 18 years old who are leaving Chile alone, with only one parent/guardian, with friends or relatives, or with a group must get authorisation to travel from the Chilean authorities before travel. You can get this authorisation from any ‘notaria’ in Chile.
UK Emergency Travel Documents
UK Emergency Travel Documents are accepted for entry, airside transit and exit from Chile. Your ETD must be valid for the proposed duration of your stay.
Dual British/Chilean nationals must have a Chilean travel document (passport) to be allowed to depart - UK ETDs cannot substitute this requirement.
Tourist card (Tarjeta de Turismo) issued by Border authorities on your arrival in Chile must be presented to immigration when you leave. If you lose it, you should request a copy of the Tourist card at the nearest PDI office or the one at Santiago airport.
