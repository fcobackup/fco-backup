The Foreign and Commonwealth Office (FCO) advise against all but essential travel to Malta, due to travel restrictions implemented by the Maltese Government related to the coronavirus (COVID-19) pandemic.
On 16 March the Maltese Prime Minister called for all temporary visitors to Malta to leave as soon as possible, if they intend to do so. He also stated he could see no reason for tourists to travel to visit Malta at this time. We recommend that British nationals who wish to leave Malta contact their travel operator to make arrangements to do so as soon as possible, whilst commercial flights are still operating.
The Maltese authorities have introduced a number of measures in response to the coronavirus (COVID-19) pandemic. You should comply with any additional screening measures put in place by the authorities.
On 13 March Malta introduced a mandatory 14 day self-quarantine period for all arrivals into Malta. This will affect tourists and returning residents. Asymptomatic visitors can choose to either enter mandatory self-quarantine or to return to their country of origin as soon as possible. If you choose to leave Malta you must travel directly from your accommodation to the airport where you will be thermally screened. Most flights continue to operate but this could change at short notice. See Health
