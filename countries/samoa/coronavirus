The Samoan authorities have introduced a number of precautionary measures in response to the coronavirus (COVID-19) pandemic. Check with your airline or tour operator that you meet all requirements. You should monitor the health advisory website. You should comply with any additional screening measures put in place by the Samoan authorities.
The Government of Australia has announced that from 9pm Australia Eastern Standard Time on 20 March, entry to the country will only be permitted to Australian citizens or permanent residents. This follows a similar announcement by New Zealand from 19 March. As many flight connections to and from Samoa connect in Australia and New Zealand, options to depart Samoa are likely to reduce. If you’re currently a visitor in Samoa, you’re advised to prepare to leave as soon as possible. If you’re resident in Samoa, you should be aware of the potential impact of the border closures and flight restrictions on future travel plans.
