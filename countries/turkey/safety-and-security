Warning
FCDO advises against all travel to parts of Turkey.

This guide also has safety advice for regions of Turkey.
Terrorism
There is a high threat of terrorist attack globally affecting UK interests and British nationals, including from groups and individuals who view the UK and British nationals as targets. Stay aware of your surroundings at all times.
UK Counter Terrorism Policing has information and advice on staying safe abroad and what to do in the event of a terrorist attack. Find out how to reduce your risk from terrorism while abroad.
Terrorism in Turkey
Terrorists are very likely to try to carry out attacks in Turkey.
Most terrorist attacks have occurred in southeast Turkey, Ankara and Istanbul.  You should remain aware of your surroundings, keep up to date with local media reports and follow the advice of local authorities.
See Regional risks for details about the areas in south-east Turkey where FCDO advises against travel.
There have been several attacks involving knives, firearms and explosives. Attacks could  be indiscriminate including in places visited by foreign nationals, such as:
public buildings
places of worship
airports
large public gatherings, including major events, public holidays, religious occasions
There have been a number of recent significant attacks. For example:
in October 2024, 5 people were killed and 22 injured in an attack on the Turkish Aerospace Industries’ facility in Kahramankazan, 40km northwest of central Ankara
in February 2024, one person was killed in an armed attack on the Çağlayan courthouse in Istanbul by the terrorist group DHKP/C
in January 2024, one person was killed by two gunmen in the Santa Maria Catholic Church in Sariyer, in an attack claimed by Daesh
in 2022, 6 people were killed in an explosion in central Istanbul
Extremist groups based in Syria, including Daesh and Al-Qaeda linked groups, have the capacity to carry out attacks in Turkey. Daesh has previously targeted border crossings and nearby locations on the Syrian side of the border.
Political situation
Demonstrations occur occasionally in cities and may become violent. Police have used tear gas and water cannon to disperse protests.
Events in Israel and the Occupied Palestinian Territories have led to heightened tensions in the region and in locations across Turkey. Large demonstrations continue to occur outside diplomatic missions connected to the conflict in major cities, particularly Israeli diplomatic missions in Ankara and Istanbul.
Avoid all demonstrations and leave the area if one develops. Local transport routes may be disrupted.
Crime
Protecting yourself and your belongings
Street robbery and pickpocketing are common in the major tourist areas of Istanbul. Be aware of your personal belongings and make sure they are always secure.
Drink and food spiking
Be wary of strangers approaching you to change money, or to take you to a restaurant or nightclub. If strangers offer you food and drink these could be spiked. Buy your own drinks and always keep sight of them.
Counterfeit alcohol
In a small number of cases, counterfeit bottles of branded alcohol have caused deaths of tourists. If you have any concerns, ask for advice from your tour operator or the Turkish authorities.
Sexual assault
In 2023, 42 cases of sexual assault, including rape, were reported to British consular staff in Turkey. Most cases happened during summer holidays in coastal tourist areas. Crimes were committed at night by someone the victim met during the day, including hotel and spa workers. There have also been sexual attacks on minors visiting toilet facilities alone. Be extra vigilant in these situations.
Taxi safety
Accepting lifts from drivers of unofficial taxis is highly risky. Find a registered taxi and note the registration number before entering. App-based taxis are also widely available.
Laws and cultural differences
Personal ID
It is illegal not to carry some form of photographic ID in Turkey. Always carry your passport or residence permit. In some busy areas, especially Istanbul, the authorities may stop people for ID checks. There are also several police checkpoints on main roads across Turkey. Cooperate with officials conducting checks.
Dress code
Dress modestly if you’re visiting a mosque or a religious shrine to avoid causing offence.
Personal injury claims
There are reports of tourists being encouraged to submit a claim for personal injury if they have experienced gastric illness in Turkey. Find out what you can do if you have suffered a personal injury on the Citizens Advice website. Only make a claim if you have genuinely suffered from injury or illness. If you make a false or fraudulent claim, you may face legal proceedings in the UK or Turkey.
Smoking bans
Smoking is illegal on public transport and in all indoor workplaces and public places. Smoking is restricted in some outdoor areas where cultural, artistic, sports or entertainment activities are held.
Illegal drugs and prison sentences
Turkey has strict laws against the use, possession and trafficking of illegal drugs. You may receive a fine or prison sentence of 4 to 24 years.
Stray dogs
Most towns and cities have stray dogs. Packs congregate in parks and wastelands and can be aggressive. Take care and do not approach stray dogs. If you’re bitten, get medical advice immediately. Rabies and other animal borne diseases are present in Turkey.
Sale of antiquities
Buying or exporting antiquities is illegal. You could be fined and receive a prison sentence of 5 to 12 years. Some historical items found at local markets and in antique shops can be sold within Turkey but are illegal to export. Confirm the status of antique items before you buy them.
Using cameras
Do not take photographs of or near military or official installations. Ask for permission before photographing people.
LGBT+ travellers
Same-sex sexual activity is legal in Turkey. However, many parts of Turkey are socially conservative and showing affection in public could receive unwelcome attention. Read more advice for LGBT+ travellers.
Comments about the nation and flag
It is illegal to insult the Turkish nation or the national flag. These laws can also apply to comments or images online no matter where you were or when you posted them. Defacing Turkish banknotes is also illegal. Offences under these laws are punishable by a prison sentence of between 6 months and 3 years.
Outdoor activities and adventure tourism
Extreme sports
If you do an extreme sport, check that adequate safety precautions are in place. British nationals have been injured and killed doing extreme sports. Only use reputable operators. Make sure you are given full instructions and training before your activity. Make sure your travel insurance covers you for all activities you do.
Quad biking and mopeds
Quad biking is an extreme sport and carries the risk of serious injury or death. You need specific travel insurance to cover quad biking. Always read the details of your insurance cover, especially the small print and exclusions on your policy.
Make sure you are given full instructions and training before your activity.
Insurance sold by the hire company usually only provides third party insurance. It’s likely you will be charged for any damage to the rental vehicle and you may face arrest if you do not pay.
If you hire a moped you need a valid driving licence with at least category A1 - ‘light motorcycle’. Make sure the vehicle is in good condition. Drivers and passengers must wear helmets. Failure to do so may invalidate your insurance. If police stop you, they will fine you and take your licence.
Jeep safaris
Jeep safaris can be dangerous-there were a number of reported accidents in 2023. If you join a jeep safari, use a reputable company who have adequate health and safety procedures and equipment. Always check that activities are covered by your insurance.
Water sports
Book activities at a licensed water sports centre and before you start:
make sure the paperwork is completed
ask for a safety demonstration
make sure you know how to call for help
See ⁠watersports safety advice from the Royal Society for the Prevention of Accidents (ROSPA).
Obey any warning signs and flags on beaches. Follow instructions from lifeguards and observe the flag indicators on beaches.
Follow local advice if jellyfish or urchins are present.

Transport risks
Road travel
If you are planning to drive in Turkey, see information on driving abroad.
You need a 1968 international driving permit (IDP) or a UK driving licence notarised in Turkish to drive in Turkey. The 1949 IDP is not accepted any more. You cannot buy an IDP outside the UK, so get one before you travel. You must also carry a green card to show you have third party insurance.
If you bring a vehicle registered in another country into Turkey, observe the Turkish customs regulations. Check if you need a UK sticker to drive your car outside the UK. 
Driving conditions
Take care when travelling by road, particularly at night. Approach checkpoints slowly and follow the instructions of security personnel. Roads between major cities are generally in excellent condition, but the road surface can be poor in remote areas. Accidents are common – mainly due to poor or reckless driving.
It is illegal to ride without a helmet on motorcycles and mopeds. You may get a severe fine if you are not wearing a helmet.
Do not drink and drive. The police fine drunk drivers and they could confiscate your licence for 6 months.
Extreme weather and natural disasters
Find out what you can do to prepare for and respond to extreme weather and natural hazards.
Extreme temperatures 
Extreme temperatures can affect many areas of Turkey over the summer months.  
The NHS has information on how to cope in hot weather.
Wildfires
Wildfires happen frequently in Turkey during summer.
You could get a fine or prison sentence for lighting a fire of any kind or discarding cigarettes in risk areas such as woodland. Look out for signs that tell you fires, barbeques, and smoking are prohibited.
If there is a wildfire in your area, local authorities may tell you to leave your accommodation. Follow the directions of local authorities.
If you see a wildfire, call emergency services on 112.
Flooding
Severe rainstorms can cause flooding and landslides across Turkey, damaging roads and bridges. Some routes may become impassable, making it difficult to travel and reducing essential services.
If you’re in an affected area:
monitor local media
follow instructions of local authorities, including evacuation orders
Earthquakes
Many parts of Turkey regularly experience earthquakes and tremors. These can be a high magnitude, cause damage to infrastructure, and pose a risk to life.
A 7.8 magnitude earthquake hit Gaziantep and neighbouring provinces in the south-east of Turkey in February 2023. Strong earthquakes may continue to affect the region and it remains heavily damaged. There is a shortage of local accommodation.
Follow any advice given by the local authorities.  See the US Federal Emergency Management Agency guidance about what to do before, during and after an earthquake .
