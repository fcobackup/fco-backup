Cases of coronavirus (COVID-19) have been confirmed in Argentina. The Argentine authorities have introduced a number of measures to limit the spread of the virus.
The FCO strongly encourage non-resident British nationals in Argentina to leave as soon as possible to avoid difficulties they will face trying to get home if flights out of the country and the region are further restricted.
Borders and travel
The government has closed the countryâ€™s borders for all those entering except for Argentine citizens and resident foreign nationals, and most international flights have been suspended.
There are no longer direct flights from Argentina to the UK. Some airlines continue to fly limited routes back to the UK via third countries. Travellers should regularly check availability with these airlines. For information on how to return to the UK from Argentina, see Return to the UK
Local measures
On 19 March, Argentina introduced a nationwide quarantine to last from midnight on Thursday 19 March to midnight on Tuesday 31 March. Exemptions to the quarantine are for single person journeys to buy necessities, such as medicines or foodstuffs, in your local area, and to travel to an airport if you already have a flight booked.
Anyone outside their accomodation without justification may be charged with committing a public health crime.
