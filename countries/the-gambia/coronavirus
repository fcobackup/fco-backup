Cases of coronavirus (COVID-19) have been confirmed in The Gambia. The Gambian authorities have introduced measures to limit the spread of the virus.
All travellers arriving from ‘hotspot’ countries, including the United Kingdom, will be isolated for 14 days upon arrival.
From midnight on Monday 23 March, airspace will be closed with the exception of medical cargo flights. The land border with Senegal will also be closed with the exception of essential supplies and security personnel.
Additional surveillance and detection mechanisms have been put in place at Banjul International Airport and various points of entry along The Gambia’s border.
The Government of The Gambia also announced that all schools and universities will be closed from 18 March for 21 days and public gatherings including open markets will be suspended for 21 days.
You should comply with any additional screening measures put in place by the authorities. The Government of the Gambia has set up a help line “1025” for anyone with information or concerns about coronavirus.
If you are a British National requiring assistance, to help us understand your situation, you should submit your information via the online form on the British High Commission website.
