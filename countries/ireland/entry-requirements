Entry rules in response to coronavirus (COVID-19) for passengers travelling to Ireland
Travellers arriving into Ireland from Great Britain, or from all other countries, should follow the Irish government guidance. There are specific arrangements for travellers whose journey originates in Northern Ireland (see below).
The Irish government announced on 26 November additional measures for travellers arriving in Ireland from Southern Africa. These measures include, for Irish residents (plus any other approved essential categories) travelling from Botswana, Eswatini, Lesotho, Mozambique, Namibia, South Africa and Zimbabwe to undergo home quarantine regardless of vaccine/recovery/test status, and PCR testing during quarantine.
Post-arrival quarantine is no longer required upon entry to Ireland for any other category of traveller but there are pre-departure requirements in place.
Passenger Locator Form
All travellers to Ireland must fill out a Passenger Locator Form before departure. Failure to complete this form is an offence. See Irish Government guidance on completing the form online, who is exempt, and penalties for failure to submit an online form. The Passenger Locator Form will be checked by air or sea carriers before departure. Individuals travelling from Great Britain to Ireland via Northern Ireland should also complete a Passenger Locator Form. Passengers will also be asked for proof of vaccination or recovery, or to present evidence of a negative RT-PCR test taken within 72 hours prior to arrival in the country.
Travelling when fully vaccinated
Travellers arriving into Ireland from Great Britain with valid proof of full vaccination, or with proof of recovery from COVID-19 within 180 days, will not require travel-related testing.
Fully vaccinated or recovered passengers travelling from Great Britain to Ireland will need to have proof of their full vaccination or recovery record. (See ‘Demonstrating your COVID-19 status’).
For more information on the Irish Government’s definition of fully vaccinated, see the Irish Government website. On 15 November the Irish Government expanded its list of approved vaccinations and vaccine combinations for travel purposes.
Demonstrating your COVID-19 status
Ireland will accept the UK’s proof of COVID-19 recovery and vaccination record. If you are travelling with a printed PDF proof of vaccination status, it must date from 1 November to ensure that the certificate can be scanned successfully. Your NHS appointment card from vaccination centres is not designed to be used as proof of vaccination and should not be used to demonstrate your vaccine status.
Travelling when not fully vaccinated
For those without valid proof of vaccination or COVID recovery within 180 days, you will need to: present evidence of a negative RT-PCR test result within 72 hours prior to arrival into the country.
Non RT-PCR tests are not accepted when travelling to Ireland and passengers with a Digital COVID Certificate based on a non RT-PCR test (for example, antigen tests) require proof of an additional negative RT-PCR test taken no more than 72 hours before arrival.
If you arrive in Ireland without proof of vaccination, proof recovery or a valid RT-PCR test result, you will be required to take a test within 36 hours of arrival.
There are specific exemptions to the above. You should visit the Irish government website for more details.
Travelling with children
Children under the age of 12 will not need to take a PCR test prior to travelling to Ireland.
Children between the ages of 12 and 17 will be required to have a negative RT-PCR test, taken within 72 hours prior to arrival to travel into the country, unless they have valid proof of vaccination or recovery.
Travelling to Ireland from Northern Ireland
If you’re travelling to Ireland from Northern Ireland and have not been outside of Northern Ireland or Ireland in the past 14-days, you do not need a Passenger Locator Form, proof of vaccination, recovery or test results upon arrival into Ireland.
If you have been outside of Northern Ireland or Ireland in the past 14 days, you are subject to the requirements based on your travel history and vaccination or recovery status.
Regular entry requirements
ID
Ireland, along with the UK, is a member of the Common Travel Area. British nationals travelling from the UK don’t need a passport to visit Ireland. However, Irish immigration officers will check the ID of all passengers arriving by air from the UK and may ask for proof of nationality, particularly if you were born outside the UK. You are therefore advised to take your British passport with you.
For more information about the types of ID you might be asked to present, see the website of the Ireland Citizens Information Board.
Before travelling, check with your carrier about their ID requirements, as most airlines and other transport providers won’t carry passengers to and from Ireland unless they’ve seen satisfactory photographic ID.
Passport validity
If you’re using a passport to enter Ireland, it should be valid and in date. You should also checking your air or sea carrier’s terms and conditions of travel. For journeys on the island of Ireland, British and Irish citizens do not require any travel documents when crossing the land border.
UK Emergency Travel Documents
UK Emergency Travel Documents (ETDs) are accepted for entry into, transit through, and exit from Ireland.
Travelling with pets
Read the Irish government’s entry requirements for your pet.
If you wish to travel with a pet to the EU, please read our guidance.
If your pet passport was issued in an EU Member State it remains valid for travel to Ireland.
