This information is for people travelling on a full ‘British citizen’ passport from the UK. It is based on the UK government’s understanding of the current rules for the most common types of travel. 
The authorities in Oman set and enforce entry rules. If you’re not sure how these requirements apply to you, contact the Omani Embassy in the UK.   
COVID-19 rules
There are no COVID-19 testing or vaccination requirements for travellers entering Oman.  
Passport validity requirements
To enter Oman, your passport must have an ‘expiry date’ at least 6 months after the date you arrive.
Check with your travel provider that your passport and other travel documents meet requirements. Renew your passport if you need to.
You will be denied entry if you do not have a valid travel document or try to use a passport that has been reported lost or stolen.
Dual nationals
Oman does not recognise dual nationality. If you hold both British and Omani passports, the Omani authorities may confiscate one of your passports.
Visa requirements
You can visit Oman for up to 14 days without a visa.
If you overstay or do not extend your visa or residency, the Omani authorities may fine and detain you. Fines can be up to 10 Omani rials a day, with a total maximum fine of 500 rials.
Applying for a visa
To stay longer than 14 days or for work, study or other reasons, you must have a visa. To avoid the risk of refusal, it’s better to apply for a visa online before you travel – you can select the ‘unsponsored visit visa’ option if you’re a tourist.
You can also get a visit visa on arrival at an airport in Oman.
Checks at border control
At Omani border control, you must be able to show:
a ticket for return or onward travel
proof of your accommodation – for example, a hotel booking
proof of your travel health insurance
Vaccine requirements
You must have a certificate to prove you’ve had a yellow fever vaccination if you’re coming from Rwanda, Tanzania or a country listed as a transmission risk.
For full details about medical entry requirements and recommended vaccinations, see TravelHealthPro’s Oman guide.
Customs rules
There are strict rules about goods you can take into or out of Oman. You must declare anything that may be prohibited or subject to tax or duty.
Taking medicines into Oman
Some UK prescription and over-the-counter medicines are illegal in Oman. Carry a copy of your prescription if you’re bringing medicine. Check with Oman’s Ministry of Health well before you travel.
