Before you travel, check the ‘Entry requirements’ section for Nicaragua’s current entry restrictions and requirements. Entry rules may change with little warning. Monitor this advice for the latest updates and stay in contact with your travel provider.
If you plan to pass through another country to return to the UK, check the travel advice for the country you’re transiting.
It is more important than ever to get travel insurance and check your cover. See the FCDO’s guidance on foreign travel insurance.
There is no British Embassy in Nicaragua. Our consular support there is severely limited. If you need emergency consular assistance, you should contact the British Embassy in San Jose, Costa Rica, at +506-2258-2025.
If you need to contact the emergency services in Nicaragua, call 118 (police), 128 (ambulance) or 115 (911 from a mobile) (fire).
Stay away from all demonstrations and gatherings, even if apparently peaceful, as these could result in outbreaks of violence. See Political situation.
The hurricane season usually runs from June to November. You should monitor local and international weather updates from the World Meteorological Organisation and the US National Hurricane Centre. See Natural disasters. See our tropical cyclones page for advice about what to do if you are caught up in a storm.
Although there’s no recent history of terrorism in Nicaragua, attacks can’t be ruled out. See Terrorism
