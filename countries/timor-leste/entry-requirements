This information is for people travelling on a full ‘British citizen’ passport from the UK. It is based on the UK government’s understanding of Timor-Leste’s current rules for the most common types of travel.
The authorities in Timor-Leste set and enforce entry rules. If you’re not sure how these requirements apply to you, contact the Timor-Leste Embassy in the UK.  
Passport validity requirements
To enter Timor-Leste, your passport must have an ‘expiry date’ at least 6 months after the date you arrive and have 2 blank pages.
Check with your travel provider that your passport and other travel documents meet requirements. Renew your passport if you need to.
You will be denied entry if you do not have a valid travel document or try to use a passport that has been reported lost or stolen.
Visa requirements
You must have a visa to visit Timor-Leste for tourism.  
You will be issued a single-entry tourism visa, valid for up to 30 days, when you arrive at Presidente Nicolau Lobato International Airport in Dili, or Dili seaport. The visa costs 30 US dollars, payable only in cash.
Travelling to Oecussi overland
If you plan to travel overland, rather than by ferry, to the exclave of Oecussi, you will need to apply for a separate visa on arrival. This visa is available at the Wini border checkpoint. Alternatively, you can apply for a visa for Oecussi in advance. To do this, you must show your round-trip ticket and complete the required forms at your nearest Timor-Leste embassy or consulate, or at the Office of the Ministry of the Interior in Dili, before you travel.
Entering at the Atambua-Batugade border crossing
If you’re entering Timor-Leste through Indonesia at the Atambua-Batugade border crossing, you can purchase a visa on entry. Alternatively, you can purchase a tourism visa in advance from a Timor-Leste embassy or consulate in either Denpasar or Kupang. These visas are usually single-entry and last for 30 days.
See travel advice for Indonesia for more information.
Extending your tourism visa
You can apply to extend a tourism visa for 30 days. If possible, apply at least 15 days in advance of the tourist visa’s expiry date.  
Vaccine requirements
For details about medical entry requirements and recommended vaccinations, see TravelHealthPro’s Timor-Leste guide.
Customs rules
There are strict rules about goods you can take into or out of Timor-Leste. You must declare anything that may be prohibited or subject to tax or duty.
Taking money into Timor-Leste
If you’re planning on bringing cash or travellers cheques worth 20,000 US dollars or more you must get authorisation from the Central Bank of Timor-Leste before you arrive.
