Warning
FCDO advises against all travel to parts of Armenia.

This guide also has safety advice for regions of Armenia.
Terrorism  
There is a high threat of terrorist attack globally affecting UK interests and British nationals, including from groups and individuals who view the UK and British nationals as targets. You should remain vigilant at all times. 
UK Counter Terrorism Policing has information and advice on staying safe abroad and what to do in the event of a terrorist attack. Find out how to reduce your risk from terrorism while abroad. 
Terrorism in Armenia 
Terrorist attacks in Armenia cannot be ruled out.
You should be aware of the global risk of indiscriminate terrorist attacks, which could be in public areas including those frequented by expatriates and foreign travellers. 
Political situation 
Although a ceasefire exists, the eastern border between Armenia and Azerbaijan is closed and tensions remain. See regional risks for details about FCDO’s warning against all travel.
Protests 
Protests sometimes take place in central Yerevan and other major cities. These are usually organised by opposition political parties or activist groups highlighting topical social and political issues. Although protests tend to be peaceful and usually pass off without incident, avoid large crowds and demonstrations, follow the advice and instructions of the local authorities, monitor the media and remain vigilant.
Crime 
Protecting your belongings 
Crime levels are low. There are occasional incidents of pickpocketing, bag-snatching, theft from cars and burglary involving foreign nationals. To help protect your belongings: 
leave spare cash, passports and valuables in a safe place
carry a copy of the photo page of your passport rather than the original document
when using ATMs check no one is watching or following you
take particular care if using an ATM after dark
Laws and cultural differences  
Illegal drugs and prison sentences 
If you use illegal drugs, you can get fines and a long prison sentence. The penalty for smuggling drugs is a prison sentence of between 4 and 10 years. 
It is illegal to use, possess or trade marijuana, cannabidiol (CBD), or tetrahydrocannabinol (THC) products. You can be prosecuted for having these substances even when they are prescribed for medical purposes. 
Using cameras and binoculars in secure areas 
It is illegal to photograph sites such as military bases, equipment and installations. These are considered sensitive areas and visitors have been detained and questioned for attempting to photograph them. 
LGBT+ travellers 
Same-sex sexual activity has been legal since 2003 but many Armenians still view same-sex couples with disapproval. LGBT+ people in Armenia tend to be discreet about their sexuality. Local LGBT+ groups occasionally suffer from verbal and physical harassment. Physical contact between members of the same sex, such as holding hands and kissing, are common signs of friendship in Armenian culture, and not necessarily an indicator of sexual orientation. 
Read more advice for LGBT+ travellers. 
Disorderly behaviour 
Armenian society does not tolerate drinking to excess as this leads to disorderly behaviour, particularly during the late evening and through the night. British nationals have been arrested for drunken behaviour.
Transport risks  
Taxis 
If you hail taxis on the street you risk being scammed for high fares. There have also been occasional reports of taxi drivers sexually harassing single female passengers. You can download the GG taxi app on your phone when you arrive. GG is considered a reputable taxi app service in Armenia.
Public transport 
Public transport is often overcrowded, particularly in Yerevan. Yerevan buses are modern, but local buses in the regions may be old and poorly maintained.   
If you travel on the cross-border train service between Armenia and Georgia, secure your valuables, do not leave the compartment unattended, and lock the door from the inside.  
Road travel  
If you are planning to drive in Armenia, see information on driving abroad and check the rules of the road in the RAC’s Armenia guide. The guide lists driving regulations and other legal requirements you need to be aware of.
You’ll need to have both a 1968 International Driving Permit (IDP) and your UK driving licence to drive in Armenia. You cannot buy an IDP outside the UK, so get one before you travel.
Road safety 
The standard of driving is poor. Be prepared for drivers who drive recklessly and ignore traffic laws. Roads are in a poor state, particularly in the coldest months, from November to February. If possible avoid driving outside of cities and towns in the dark because of the poor condition of the roads and lack of lighting.  
If you are walking, be careful when crossing roads and use subways where available. 
Air travel 
The UK Air Safety List (ASL) lists all known airlines in Armenia that do not meet international safety standards and are banned from operating commercial air services to, from, and within the UK. Check ASL when considering which airlines to fly with. The list is maintained by the Department for Transport, based on advice from the UK Civil Aviation Authority. 
The UK has placed sanctions on Aeroflot, Rossiya Airlines and Ural Airlines, which operate out of Russia and fly to Armenia. It is illegal under UK law for any British national or British company to buy tickets from these airlines.
Extreme weather and natural disasters 
Earthquakes 
There is a risk of earthquakes. The last serious earthquake was in 1988 in the Lori region in the north. It killed between 25,000 and 50,000 people, injured thousands and left several cities in ruins. 
The US Federal Emergency Management Agency has advice about what to do before, during and after an earthquake.
