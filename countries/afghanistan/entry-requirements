The guidance on this page covers arrival by air to Kabul and reflects the FCDO’s current understanding of requirements. The FCDO maintains its advice against all travel to Afghanistan and advise all British nationals still in Afghanistan to leave now because of the security situation. There are also COVID-19 related restrictions on travel to Afghanistan.
This page reflects the UK government’s understanding of current rules for people travelling on a full ‘British Citizen’ passport, for the most common types of travel.
The authorities in Afghanistan set and enforce entry rules. For further information contact the embassy, high commission or consulate of the country or territory you’re travelling to. You should also consider checking with your transport provider or travel company to make sure your passport and other travel documents meet their requirements.
Entry rules in response to coronavirus (COVID-19)
Entry to Afghanistan
The IATA now states that a negative pre-departure COVID-19 PCR test result is required for entering Afghanistan. We advise against all travel to Afghanistan. Travellers are advised to check with their travel provider and follow individual airline requirements on this. However, due to the security situation the FCDO advise against all travel to the whole of the country.
Testing on arrival
There is currently no testing on arrival.
Quarantine requirements
There are currently no compulsory quarantine requirements or temperature checks at the airports.
Data collection
If you choose to travel to Afghanistan against FCDO advice, visitors will be asked to complete a landing form detailing their visit, including passport and visa information, as is standard practice in many other countries.
Testing on departure
No testing facilities are currently available in Afghanistan.
Regular entry requirements
Visas
We advise against all travel to Afghanistan. If you choose to travel against this advice, you must get a visa before travelling to Afghanistan. You cannot get a visa on arrival. If you’re intending to work in Afghanistan against FCDO advice and do not hold a Diplomatic or Official passport you will need a work permit which in turn needs a medical certificate. For further information contact the Embassy of the Islamic Republic of Afghanistan in London, including information on any changes in visa process during the coronavirus (COVID-19) pandemic.
Passport validity
Your passport should be valid for a minimum period of 6 months from the date of entry into Afghanistan.
UK Emergency Travel Documents
We have temporarily suspended most operations at the British Embassy in Kabul in response to the deterioration in the security situation. FCDO consular assistance can only be provided remotely and is therefore extremely limited. We are no longer able to issue emergency travel documents in Afghanistan. If you are in need of consular assistance, you should call +44 (0)1908 516666 and select the option “Consular services for British nationals”. You can also email help@fco.gov.uk
Yellow fever certificate requirements
Check whether you need a yellow fever certificate by visiting the National Travel Health Network and Centre’s TravelHealthPro website.
Travelling with children
If you’re travelling alone with a child you may need to produce documentary evidence of parental responsibility. The FCDO does not allow staff based in Afghanistan to travel with their partners or children. For further information on exactly what is needed at immigration, contact the Embassy of the Islamic Republic of Afghanistan in London.
