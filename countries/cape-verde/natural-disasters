Hurricanes
The rainy season in Cape Verde runs from August to October.
Hurricanes can develop, although hurricanes often begin their formation in the waters around the Cape Verde Islands, they rarely reach hurricane strength close to the Islands. A typical Cape Verde-type hurricane develops in the area south of the islands, usually during the rainy season from August to October. You should monitor local and international weather updates from the US National Hurricane Center.. See Tropical cyclones
Sand storms
Some of the islands may experience sand storms (known locally as “bruma seca”) between December and February. The intensity of the storms varies but can disrupt air travel especially on the island of Boa Vista. If a sand storm occurs while you’re on one of the islands contact your tour operator or airline.
Seismic activity
Some of the islands experience seismic activity and tremors. This is usually within the bounds of normal activity and mostly on the islands of Brava and Fogo but can sometimes be dangerous. Check with your travel provider before travelling to the islands of Brava or Fogo.
