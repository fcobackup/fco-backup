All non-resident foreigners entering Uruguay must have proof of health insurance that covers suspected or actual coronavirus.
Upon arrival, passengers will need to either present a negative coronavirus test taken maximum 72 hours before travelling or a swab will be taken on arrival. You will have to wait for a negative test result before being able to leave the port/airport and go to a declared address to carry out a 7-day mandatory quarantine. You will then be required to have a second swab taken and wait for results before being allowed to finish your quarantine period.
