Crime
Crime levels are low, but petty crime can occur. Take sensible precautions to protect your passport and money, and be alert to pickpockets in public places. Do not become involved with drugs of any kind. The emergency number for the police is 117.
Scams
Foreign visitors and residents can be targeted by scam artists. Scams can cause great financial loss. If you receive an e-mail claiming to be from Her Majesty’s Revenue and Customs (HMRC) offering a tax refund on provision of your bank details you should make absolutely sure that it is not part of a scam.
Road travel
A full (i.e. not provisional) valid UK, or other EU/EEA, driving licence is sufficient for driving in Liechtenstein.
Driving licence rules will stay the same until 31 December 2020.
If you’re living in Liechtenstein, check the country Living in Guide for information on requirements for residents.
Driving regulations
If you plan to travel to Liechtenstein via the motorways in Switzerland or Austria, you must purchase and display a motorway vignette or face large on-the-spot fines in these countries.
Traffic regulations are strenuously enforced. Any serious breach of the regulations can result in heavy fines and/or imprisonment.
All road users should follow instructions given by local police and officials on the main alpine transit routes, at bottlenecks and areas of heavy traffic congestion.
A warning triangle is compulsory and must be kept within easy reach (not in the boot).
Radar detectors are prohibited in Liechtenstein whether in use or not.
The limit for alcohol in the bloodstream is 0.8% and police may request any driver to undergo a breath test or drugs test.
See the RAC and AA guides on driving in Liechtenstein.
Road safety
Alpine winters often make driving more difficult. You should equip your car with winter tyres and snow-chains, and check road conditions prior to departure.  
Sports activities and winter sports
The following alpine hazards exist throughout the year: - avalanches and snow drifts - landslides and flooding - glacial crevasses and hollows - falling rocks - thunderstorms - altitude sickness - sun exposure - sudden weather changes
Many accidents happen due to insufficient information, inappropriate equipment or overestimating your own capability. Follow advice given by local authorities and guides, take note of weather forecasts and conditions, make sure you are physically fit and have the necessary experience, be in a team of at least two, inform someone of your plans, take warm clothes and wet weather gear, and use sun block and sun glasses.
