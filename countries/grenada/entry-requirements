Entry rules in response to coronavirus
Grenada Government has announced that from 15 November you do not need to quarantine on arrival if you are fully vaccinated and arrive with a negative pcr test. Details have yet to be confirmed on the Ministry of Health website. Once they are confirmed this page will be updated.
Entry to Grenada
Effective 31 July only fully vaccinated visitors will be allowed entry into Grenada with some exemptions. Please refer to the exemption list here for more details. Persons providing proof of full vaccination will only be required to quarantine for up to 48 hours, pending a negative result from a PCR test, administered on entry, and paid in advance. One is considered fully vaccinated two weeks after their second dose of a two-dose vaccine or two weeks after a one-dose vaccine. Children 13 years and under, traveling with their vaccinated parents/guardians, can quarantine with them for up to 48 hours. Unvaccinated minors between 14 and 18 years old can travel to Grenada with their vaccinated guardians. The entire travel party will be treated as unvaccinated and required to quarantine for up to 7 days.
The Government of Grenada’s entry health protocols mean that all travellers must pre-book approved accommodation for quarantine on arrival, pre-pay for COVID test, apply for a Pure Safe Travel Certificate and obtain a negative COVID PCR test result within 3 days of travel. Link to full details is on Ministry of Health website. These rules are subject to change and should be checked regularly. You should not use the NHS testing service to get a test in order to facilitate your travel to another country. You should arrange to take a private test.
