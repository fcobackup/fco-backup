Germany has put measures in place to limit the spread of coronavirus (COVID-19). For information on how to return to the UK from Germany, see Return to the UK
Entry and borders
Germany has intensified border controls at airports and land borders. Unless travellers are resident in Germany, can demonstrate a compelling reason for their travel to Germany, or are border workers commuting between Germany and neighbouring countries, they will be refused entry. Frontier workers and goods traffic are not currently affected.
If you intend to fly to Germany, check with your airline before you travel and ensure you bring any supporting documents you need to justify your travel. If you are transiting through an airport in Germany in order to travel to the UK, you will need to have onward travel, and, if necessary, temporary accommodation booked before you will be permitted to enter Germany.
If you’re living in Germany, you can return as long as your habitual place of residence is Germany and you can provide proof of this. Proof of residence might include:
Certificate of registration of address (also available online)
Payslip (with German address)
Free movement certificate (not issued any longer)
Other official documents evidencing residence in Germany
You should bear in mind that the situation is changing quickly and that border police in some regions may take a more strict approach.
The Federal Ministry of the Interior has detailed information on its website, including in English, regarding the rules on entry and exit from Germany.

Hospitals and care homes that have no active Covid-19 cases can now start developing plans for receiving visitors again;
