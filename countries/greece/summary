The Foreign, Commonwealth & Development Office (FCDO) advises against all but essential travel to:
Greece based on the current assessment of COVID-19 risks. The FCDO is not advising against travel to the islands of Rhodes, Kos, Zakynthos, Corfu and Crete.
The British Embassy are monitoring reports of an earthquake near Tyrnavos, that struck this morning (3 March). You should remain vigilant and follow the advice of the local security authorities, and be aware of the possibility of aftershocks.
If you are arriving in the UK from Greece, including the islands of Corfu, Crete, Kos, Rhodes, Zakynthos, you need to self-isolate on your arrival, unless you have a valid exemption. Check the latest guidance for England, Northern Ireland, Scotland and Wales.
The FCDO is not advising those already travelling in Greece to leave at this time.

Travel is subject to entry restrictions
UK nationals are permitted to enter Greece if they are a permanent resident in the UK, Greece, another EU/EFTA state, or in one of the following countries; Australia, New Zealand, Israel, Russia, Rwanda, Singapore, South Korea, Thailand, UAE. If you’re a British national who resides in another country, not listed above, you’re likely to be refused entry to Greece due to measures put in place by the Greek authorities to combat the spread of COVID-19
If you travel to Greece, you will need to complete a Passenger Locator Form (PLF) at least 24 hours before travel. Failure to do so in advance may result in your carrier not allowing you to travel, a 500 Euro fine on arrival or the Greek authorities not allowing you to enter the country. If you are a permanent resident of Greece, or a Greek citizen, you are also required to complete a PLF form before travelling outside of Greece. See Entry requirements for full details
All arrivals into Greece need to provide proof of a negative COVID-19 PCR test, undertaken within the 72 hour period before your time of arrival into Greece
Anyone entering Greece from the UK will also be asked to undergo a rapid test for COVID-19 on arrival. Arrivals from the UK are currently required to self-isolate for 7 days in the event of a negative test result. In the event of a positive test result, travellers will have to isolate for at least 14 days. In either case, travellers will need to undertake a further PCR test at the end of their period of self-isolation.
