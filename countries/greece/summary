In response to the coronavirus (COVID-19) pandemic, the Greek government has announced that from 16 March, all people arriving in Greece from abroad are required to go into 14 days’ self-isolation. This is a mandatory measure, which the authorities will enforce by prosecution and fines. However UK nationals can continue to enter Greece and observe this restriction. UK nationals are not affected by the European Union’s measures to close EU borders to third country nationals.
Some airlines have begun to reduce their flight schedules to and from Greece, due to reduced demand. You should keep up to date with the latest advice from your airline, and contact them directly in case of disruption.
