On 18 March, Portugal declared a state of emergency due to coronavirus (COVID-19.) The precise nature and scope of the emergency measures are expected to be announced on 19 March. In the meantime, British nationals in Portugal should limit their movements outside their accommodation wherever possible.
From midnight on 18 March, flights from Portugal to countries outside the EU/EEA, with the exception of the UK, USA, Canada, Venezuela, South Africa and Portuguese speaking countries will be suspended. Flights to Brazil will be limited to Rio de Janeiro and São Paulo. Flights to and from Italy remain suspended.
While flights to the UK are not affected by these measures, airlines have cancelled a number of flights between the UK and Portugal. If your travel plans are likely to be affected, or you want to check on the status of your flight, contact your airline or travel company for the latest information.
From 16 March until 15 April, there will be border controls on the land border with Spain. Cross border workers, goods traffic and people entering or leaving Portugal to return to their place of residence will be allowed to travel. All travellers will be subject to health screening. The Portuguese authorities have also suspended all flights, rail and ferry connections between Portugal and Spain and implemented health screening at airports on the Portuguese mainland.
We recommend that British Nationals who wish to leave the country make arrangements to do so as soon as possible.
Around 2.2 million British nationals visited Portugal in 2018. Most visits are trouble-free.
