Travel in Ecuador
The Ecuadorean government provides coronavirus-related information on the Coronavirus Ecuador website. The Ministry of Health also provides an information page. However, the most up to date information is accessible via their Twitter account.
Public spaces and services
Following the announcement of the end of the national state of emergency, as of 4 January 2021, curfew restrictions are no longer in place. Power to impose controls and tailor regulations is now devolved to local municipalities and to other competent authorities. (Please therefore check with local authorities – details below - to ensure that you comply with any local restrictions.)
A national public health emergency remains in place. The Ecuadorean Ministry of Health issued an emergency extension of 90 days on 11 December 2020. The general nationwide biosecurity measures include:
extra precaution advised for people over 60 years old, and those whose medical conditions make them vulnerable to COVID-19
mandatory use of face masks in public spaces.
all individuals to comply with social distancing measures and practice frequent hand washing
all in-person classes are suspended. Classes will continue online until 18 January when blended classes (in-person and online) will be allowed to be proposed by schools on a pilot basis
remote working continues to be encouraged
public gatherings are prohibited
the reopening of beaches will continue to be monitored via the “Distancia2” app.
authorised labs to undertake COVID-19 tests
a nationwide tracing app ( ̔ASI Ecuador̕ ) is available to alert people if they have been in contact with a confirmed COVID-19 case during the last 15 days. The app is supported via Bluetooth and maintains the confidentiality of users
land borders with Colombia and Peru remain closed until further notice. However, Ecuadorean nationals and foreign residents may be allowed to enter Ecuador via the Rumichaca and Huaquillas northern and southern borders.
ports remain closed for travel/tourism activities. Only cargo services are allowed
Restrictions
The central government´s “red, amber, green” alert system is no longer in force. However, it will be used as an internal management tool for epidemiological monitoring.
Each municipal government is responsible for determining its own specific restrictions including, but not limited to, maximum capacity for public transport and institutions, operations capacity of private businesses, the circulation of private vehicles against licence plate numbers, health prevention protocols for all businesses and industries and alcohol consumption
We recommend you follow the local municipalities’ social media channels to obtain the most up to date notifications, but bear in mind that these might change at any time:
Quito: @MunicipioQuito; Guayaquil: @alcaldiagye; Cuenca: @MunicipioCuenca; Galapagos: @CGGalapagos
Ecuador’s National Emergency Operations Committee (COE) has a website with their official resolutions (Spanish only).
Within the national health emergency, the Ecuadorean Ministry of Health will continue to issue the required health prevention measures, including PCR tests and any mandatory self-isolation (Aislamiento Preventivo Obligatorio – APO) requirements.
Restrictions in Quito
Quito Municipality continues with its campaign to increase testing and triage. In addition to adhering to the standard general biosecurity measures, you must also carry an identity card at all times.
All COVID-19 measures will continue to be enforced robustly and infringements will be handled by the relevant competent authorities.
Only people who work for certain vital sectors, such as health, food provision, financial and emergencies, will be allowed to circulate on the days which the vehicle’s registration plate would not normally be permitted to circulate. You must present valid credentials or proof of emergency if stopped by a local authority. The Municipality can issue special safe passage documents (“salvoconducto”) for private vehicles that can justify their need to circulate outside the “Hoy Circula” restrictions (passenger transfer to and from the airport, and medical appointments).
Inter-provincial bus transport operation has been authorised by local municipalities, at 75% capacity, from/to bus terminals. Accredited tourist transport vehicles are not subject to any mobility restriction.
As part of the Municipality´s regular monitoring of the pandemic situation, the Quito Metropolitan Emergency Operations Committee has issued new temporary restrictions that will be in force from 22 January to 7 February 2021.
All public gatherings are suspended. Pubs, nightclubs and gyms are also closed until further notice. All sport activities that cannot comply with the minimum distancing requirements are also suspended temporarily.
On Fridays, Saturdays and Sundays, alcohol sales are only permitted between 6am and 10pm.
Restaurants, cinemas and theatres can operate at 30% capacity, while public transport, bus terminals and interstate and tourist transport can operate at a maximum 50% capacity. Shopping centres can operate at 50% between 0800-2000.
Family and social gatherings are limited to 10 people.
Private vehicles will continue to circulate through the “Hoy Circula” system as follows:
Vehicles with licence plates ending with odd numbers (1, 3, 5, 7 and 9) can circulate Monday, Wednesday and Friday.
Vehicles with licence plates ending with even numbers (2, 4, 6, 8 and 0) can circulate Tuesday, Thursday and Saturday.
Sundays and public holidays: all vehicle plate number numbers are allowed to circulate.
From 22 January to 7 February 2021, no vehicles can circulate between 11pm and 4am.

Visit the Guayaquil “Jose Joaquin de Olmedo” International Airport website for general information on COVID-19 measures and related FAQ (in Spanish).
Healthcare in Ecuador
If you present symptoms while in Ecuador, you should call 171 and you will be attended by trained Ministry of Health personnel. You can also call 911, which has some English-speaking operators. For further information (in Spanish), follow the Ministry of Health official social media channels @Salud_Ec.
The authorities have allowed for privately-arranged COVID-19 tests in laboratories approved by the Ministry of Health.
The Ecuadorean government recommends the “SaludEC” app, a new platform to support COVID-19 response, by registering for general reports and official announcements. It provides information to evaluate potential COVID-19 symptoms. It also allows online medical checks and scheduling appointments at Ministry of Health centres for non-coronavirus needs.
