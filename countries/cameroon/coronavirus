Visas
All entry visas have been suspended.
The Government of Cameroon has confirmed it will not penalise British nationals whose visas have expired while they are unable to leave the country due to coronavirus restrictions. Immigration Police will not pursue you if this is your situation, you will be allowed to leave the country freely when able to, and this will not affect your chances of being granted a visa in the future.
