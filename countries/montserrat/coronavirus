Check the latest information on risk from COVID-19 for Montserrat on the TravelHealthPro website
See the TravelHealthPro website for further advice on travel abroad and reducing spread of respiratory viruses during the COVID-19 pandemic.
International travel
There are two companies offering 4-6 scheduled flights per day, and charter flights from Antigua’s VC Bird International Airport to the John A. Osborne Airport on Montserrat: FLY MONTSERRAT and SVG Air. Flights are on small aircraft capable of carrying up to 9 passengers. Short notice cancellations or changes to the schedule are common, and we recommend you check with the airline in case of delay.
Oversized bags can’t be carried due limited baggage space. Baggage is frequently held on Antigua and travels separately on subsequent flights.
Entry and borders
See Entry requirements to find out what you will need to do when you arrive in Montserrat.
Be prepared for your plans to change
No travel is risk-free during COVID-19. Countries may further restrict travel or bring in new rules at short notice, for example due to a new COVID-19 variant. Check with your travel company or airline for any transport changes which may delay your journey home.
If you test positive for COVID-19, you may need to stay where you are until you test negative. You may also need to seek treatment there. See Healthcare in Montserrat for more information on self-isolation.
Plan ahead and make sure you:
can access money
understand what your insurance will cover
can make arrangements to extend your stay and be away for longer than planned
