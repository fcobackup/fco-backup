Entry and borders
Since 25 March, all international flights to and from Kenya have been suspended by the Kenyan government. Cargo flights are excepted, but crew must observe strict guidelines. On 6 April, the suspension of international passenger flights was extended for 30 days.
All individuals who entered Kenya between 22 March and the suspension of international passenger flights on 25 March must undergo mandatory quarantine for 14 days at government designated facilities at their own expense.
On 29 March, the government of Kenya announced the start of mass testing for all persons who arrived in the country in the last week and are currently in designated hotels or facilities undergoing mandatory quarantine. Those who test positive will be taken to a dedicated isolation facility. This exercise will continue until all those in quarantine have been tested.
The government of Kenya has also mandated that any person who has entered Kenya from a country with reported coronavirus cases since 1 March 2020, including the UK, must self-quarantine for 14 days or until they have been symptom-free for 14 days from the time of entry into Kenya.
The Kenya-Uganda land border has been closed to all pedestrians and vehicles, with the exception of cargo trucks. Further closures of land borders with other neighbouring countries may follow.
Local measures
Since 27 March a daily nationwide curfew is in effect starting at 7pm and ending at 5am (local time). During this window, all persons will be required to stay at home or indoors, except for essential service workers. An extension of the curfew for 21 days was announced on 25 April.
On 6 April, the government of Kenya announced that road, rail and air movements would be restricted in and out of the Nairobi Metropolitan area, effective 6 April, and Mombasa, Kwale and Kilifi Counties, effective 8 April, for an initial containment period of 21 days. An extension of these restrictions for a further 21 days came into effect on 26 April. A similar travel suspension for an initial 21 day containment period has been applied to Mandera County, starting on 22 April. Movements within those designated areas are still permitted.
The government of Kenya has directed that face masks must be worn in public places, including supermarkets, and when using public and private transport. Social distancing rules have also been extended to apply during the use of private vehicles. Car owners are now limited to carrying 50% of their vehicle’s passenger capacity. In practice, this means five-seater vehicles will only be allowed to carry one passenger in addition to the driver, while seven-seater vehicles will only be allowed two passengers in addition to the driver.
Pharmacies and other shops selling essential products remain open, though business hours may be affected by the daily nationwide curfew.
All bars are closed until further notice. Restaurants can operate ‘takeaway’ services only.
The government has directed public places to set a maximum capacity to conform to social distance requirements of at least 1.5 metres. You can also expect shops, supermarkets and public transport systems to implement measures to ensure social distancing.
All meetings, conferences and events of an international nature have been banned. Kenyan citizens have been advised to avoid crowded places and to work remotely where possible.
The government of Kenya are conducting random temperature screenings in spaces frequented by the general public. If you show signs or symptoms of coronavirus and are able to self-isolate, you can expect to be directed to do so. If you show signs or symptoms of Coronavirus and self-isolating is not an option available to you, you can expect to be taken into a State health facility by the Kenyan authorities.
You should comply with all measures put in place by the Kenyan authorities.
