Everyone should comply with the measures put in place in Montenegro to limit the spread of coronavirus (COVID-19).
Moving around in Montenegro
For information on entering Montenegro, see Entry Requirements. A number of restrictions to prevent the spread of the virus have been put in place by the Montenegrin Government, on the advice of the Institute for Public Health.
Those entering Montenegro, or in some circumstances in country can be subject to a mandatory quarantine or self-isolation period of 14 days at the direction of sanitary inspectors, for example if you are arriving from a country with a high incidence of coronavirus, have symptoms of coronavirus or if you have been in contact, or are suspected to have been in contact, with someone known to have coronavirus. Additional measures may be requested.
Facemasks or coverings are mandatory in all public places.
Visiting people receiving treatment in healthcare institutions and people in social and childcare institutions remains banned.
Public gatherings involving more than 200 people are banned.
Access to private and public beaches is allowed. A distance of at least 2 metres between sunbeds / other beach occupants is required, unless visitors are members of the same family household.
Indoor and outdoor group sport activities are allowed, with a requirement to split sport teams into smaller groups wherever possible.
More stringent measures are in place in the municipality of Rozaje in the North East of Montenegro.
Social measures
Social distancing of two metres is highly recommended.
The Government of Montenegro has introduced a set of measures in response to the coronavirus. A list of measures in English is available on the Montenegrin government website.
Visas
Expired permanent and temporary residence permits and temporary work permits will remain valid for foreigners until 1 July 2020.
Health
If you develop any symptoms or are concerned about your health do not go to a hospital or a doctor. You should stay in your home or accommodation and call the designated Institute of Public Health hotline 1616 from 10am to 8pm, or ask a Montenegrin-speaker to call on your behalf. Call handlers will be able to assess the risks you have been exposed to and provide further recommendations and instructions for you to take.

Finance
There is a range of financial support from the government that you can access while you are unable to return due to coronavirus restrictions.
If you’re in Montenegro, and have exhausted all other options to cover essential living costs while you wait to return home, you could apply for an emergency loan for your living costs from the UK government. You can only apply if you normally live in the UK and you cannot return home. This last-resort option is for those most in need, and you would need to repay the loan when you are back in the UK. Apply for an emergency loan.

Help and support
If you need urgent consular assistance, contact your nearest British embassy, high commission or consulate. All telephone numbers are available 24/7.
