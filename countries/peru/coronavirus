See the TravelHealthPro website for further advice on travel abroad and reducing spread of respiratory viruses during the COVID-19 pandemic.
International travel
Passengers at the airport will need to follow strict regulations, including the mandatory use of masks and facial protectors (usually a clear plastic full-face covering) and social distancing
At present, commercial airlines are operating to and from Peru up to 8 hours flying time away.
KLM are flying from Lima to Amsterdam on a daily basis and Air France are flying from Lima to Paris on a weekly basis. However, these flights do not bring passengers into Peru. There are currently no direct inbound passenger flights from Europe to Peru.
If travelling via another country, it is essential you check the travel advice for that country, as some currently do not permit transit to/from the UK.
All passengers arriving in Peru, irrespective of nationality, will have to quarantine for 14 days. This can be in a home anywhere in the country or in a government-run facility at the Pan American Games village in Lima.
