This page has information on travelling to Saudi Arabia.
This page reflects the UK government’s understanding of current rules for people travelling on a full ‘British Citizen’ passport from the UK, for the most common types of travel.
The authorities in Saudi Arabia set and enforce entry rules. If you’re unsure how Saudi Arabia’s entry requirements apply to you, contact its UK embassy, high commission or consulate.
Exit and re-entry permits
British residents in Saudi Arabia will need a valid exit or re-entry permit from the Saudi Ministry of Interior to leave and re-enter the country.
COVID-19 rules
There is no requirement to provide a COVID-19 vaccination certificate or negative PCR or antigen test certificate to enter the Kingdom.
All visitors intending to visit the Kingdom (excluding residents) must have medical insurance that covers the costs of COVID-19 treatment in outpatient clinics, emergencies and hospitals.

Check your passport and travel documents before you travel
Passport validity
If you are entering Saudi Arabia, your passport should be valid for a minimum period of six months from the date you arrive.
Check with your travel provider to make sure your passport and other travel documents meet their requirements.
Visas
All visitors, including pilgrims, need a visa or an Electronic Visa Waiver (EVW) to enter Saudi Arabia.
You can apply for a tourist visa online or on arrival at any of Saudi Arabia’s international airports. Muslim tourists may perform Umrah on a tourist visa, but a separate visa is needed for Hajj. See separate guidance on the Umrah application process in the Pilgrimage section
If you are travelling to Saudi Arabia for tourism, business, medical treatment or to study, you can apply for an Electronic Visa Waiver. An EVW permits a single entry visit of up to six months. You can apply for an EVW through the Saudi Ministry of Foreign Affairs’ visas portal. You must have a confirmed flight booking and apply for your EVW from 90 days to 48 hours prior to your trip. Tourist visas are valid for 360 days from the date of issue and can be used for visits of up to 90 days. A daily fine will be levied if you overstay your visa.
If you’re travelling for any other purpose, you should apply for a visa through visa agencies accredited to the Royal Embassy of Saudi Arabia. If you overstay your visa you will be fined and deported.
If you’re transiting through Saudi Arabia, you may need a transit visa if the connecting time between your flights is more than 12 hours. Once the ticket is issued, you should confirm with your airline or travel agency if you need a transit visa. You should be able to apply for a transit visa through your airline, travel agency or through an established agent via the visa section of the Royal Embassy of Saudi Arabia.
If you’re planning to travel to Saudi Arabia via the causeway from Bahrain, you should check the terms of your Saudi visa before travelling. If you’re planning to apply for a visa, you should seek advice (eg from your visa agent, the Saudi Embassy or your employer) about the visa options available to you. Saudi visas may only allow for entry into the country by air and may prevent you from entering across a land border including via the causeway from Bahrain.
If you’re planning to travel around the time of Hajj, check with your airline for any restrictions. In previous years, the Directorate of Civil Aviation of Saudi Arabia have restricted visitors who are not performing Hajj from flying to Jeddah, Madinah and Taif. During this time, visitors may need a valid Hajj visa to be allowed to board flights to Jeddah, Madinah and Taif. Visitors with business or visit visas will still be able to enter Saudi Arabia through other entry points.
British residents in Saudi Arabia will need a valid exit or re-entry permit from the Saudi Ministry of Interior to leave the country.
Yellow fever certificate requirements
Check whether you need a yellow fever certificate by visiting the National Travel Health Network and Centre’s TravelHealthPro website.
Previous travel to Israel
You may be refused entry to Saudi Arabia if your passport contains evidence of previous travel to Israel or indicates Israel as your birthplace.
Female travellers
If you are a female visitor arriving on a non-tourist visa, or a resident, you must be met by your sponsor on arrival. Otherwise you may face delays before being allowed to enter the country or to continue on other flights.
Foreign women married to Saudi nationals must have a re-entry or final exit permit issued by their husband to leave Saudi Arabia.
