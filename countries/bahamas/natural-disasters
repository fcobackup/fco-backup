The hurricane season in The Bahamas normally runs from 1 June to 30 November. The Bahamas Department of Meteorological Climatology Section advises residents and visitors in North West and Central Bahamas (including Nassau) to complete seasonal hurricane preparations.
You should monitor local and international weather updates and keep up to date with the progress of any approaching storms, including via the US National Hurricane Centre website and the Bahamian National Emergency Management Agency (NEMA)
Hurricane Dorian in 2019, in Abaco and Grand Bahama, led to the deaths of over 200 people – most killed by the rapid surge in sea water, as well as high winds and debris; after effects included the salinisation of the ground (drinking) water. In preparation for a hurricane, you should ensure your residence is secure, you have sufficient drinking water, and you have considered your means of escape in the event of a tidal surge (including access to life jackets). A list of government-provided hurricane shelters for all islands is available here. You should follow the advice of local authorities, including on any evacuations. Due to the risk of flight cancellation, many local residents will take early decisions to avoid hurricane paths even before an evacuation is ordered.
See our tropical cyclones guidance page for advice about how to prepare effectively and what to do if you’re likely to be affected by a hurricane or tropical cyclone.
