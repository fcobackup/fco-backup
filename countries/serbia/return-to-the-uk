The Serbian Government has announced the closure of all airports in Serbia to international passenger flights until further notice. All border crossings for road, rail and river transport will be closed from 8am on Friday 20 March, except for freight traffic. Following these measures, and those taken by neighbouring countries, there are now no commercial means of leaving Serbia to return to the UK by air, road, rail or river.
