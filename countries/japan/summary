You should keep in touch with news broadcasts, follow the advice of the local authorities (Cabinet Secretariat Civil Protection Portal Site) and keep up to date with this travel advice.
For updates on political events on the Korean peninsula which could affect travellers to Japan, you should read FCDO travel advice for South Korea.
