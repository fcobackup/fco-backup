Travel is subject to entry restrictions
Short-term visitors who have been in the UK and other select countries in the last 14 days are currently unable to enter Japan, unless they are travelling for business purposes or in exceptional circumstances.
Japan has also suspended its visa waiver system for anyone travelling on a British passport. Single and multiple entry visas issued prior to 20 March also remain suspended.
Non-Japanese nationals who arrive in Japan will be required to undergo a coronavirus screening test and are required to self-isolate for 14 days on arrival at a designated location (such as a hotel or your own home) and avoid using public transport. You will also need to provide written evidence of a negative COVID-19 test result conducted within 72 hours of your flight departure time if arriving from the UK.
