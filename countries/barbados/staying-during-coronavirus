This page gives you guidance on how to stay safely in Barbados as a visitor, if you are unable to return to the UK.
Everyone should comply with the measures put in place in Barbados to limit the spread of coronavirus (COVID-19).
Moving around in Barbados
For information on entering Barbados, see Entry Requirements
The government of Barbados imposes a 14 day quarantine for all persons arriving on the island. If you arrive on a flight from a CARICOM country, you have the option of home quarantine. If you arrive from a non-CARICOM country, you have to quarantine in a government facility. A curfew is in operation: 10:00 pm to 5:00am Friday, Saturday and Sunday. Outside of these hours, you should continue to observe social distancing and practice good hygiene at all times.
Wearing a face mask is actively encouraged and some premises will only allow you to enter if you are wearing a face mask. You may have your temperature taken when entering some premises.
You should follow the Barbados Government Information Service on Facebook for further details as plans are subject to change at short notice.
Health
Follow the advice of local authorities, including local measures to help minimise your risk of exposure to coronavirus. The Barbados Ministry of Health and Wellness has a coronavirus hotline staffed by public health officers 24 hours a day on +1 246 536 4500.

Finance
There is a range of financial support from the government that you can access while you are unable to return due to coronavirus restrictions.
If you’re in Barbados, and have exhausted all other options to cover essential living costs while you wait to return home, you could apply for an emergency loan for your living costs from the UK government. You can only apply if you normally live in the UK and you cannot return home. This last-resort option is for those most in need, and you would need to repay the loan when you are back in the UK. Apply for an emergency loan.

If you need urgent consular assistance, contact your nearest British embassy, high commission or consulate. All telephone numbers are available 24/7.
