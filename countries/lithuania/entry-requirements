The information on this page covers the most common types of travel and reflects the UK government’s understanding of the rules currently in place. Unless otherwise stated, this information is for travellers using a full ‘British Citizen’ passport.
The authorities in the country or territory you’re travelling to are responsible for setting and enforcing the rules for entry. If you’re unclear about any aspect of the entry requirements, or you need further reassurance, you’ll need to contact the embassy, high commission or consulate of the country or territory you’re travelling to.
You should also consider checking with your transport provider or travel company to make sure your passport and other travel documents meet their requirements.
Entry rules in response to coronavirus (COVID-19)
Entry to Lithuania
British nationals travelling to Lithuania from England, who do not display symptoms of COVID-19, do not need to self-isolate on arrival. British nationals travelling to Lithuania from Northern Ireland will need to self-isolate for 10 days. From 00:01 on 23 November, British nationals travelling to Lithuania from Scotland and Wales will also need to self-isolate for 10 days. You may leave isolation earlier if you have a negative COVID-19 PCR test, taken no earlier than 48 hours before your arrival, or taken in Lithuania after your arrival. You should not use the NHS testing service to get a test in order to facilitate your travel to another country. You should arrange to take a private test.
From 16 November, British nationals travelling to Lithuania from Denmark, Spain, Italy, the USA, the Netherlands and Sweden must take a COVID-19 PCR test no earlier than 48 hours before arriving in Lithuania or within 24 hours of arriving. Individuals must then remain in isolation, until a negative test result is received.
British nationals travelling to Lithuania from any other country deemed a high risk for COVID-19, will need to self-isolate for 10 days. You may leave isolation earlier if you have a negative COVID-19 PCR test, taken no earlier than 48 hours before your arrival, or taken in Lithuania after your arrival. The list of countries from which arrivals are required to self-isolate is published on KoronaStop.lt. The Lithuanian Government reviews this list regularly.
You can register for a PCR test by calling the COVID-19 hotline on +370 37367 963. The hotline is open daily between 8am and 11pm. The option to shorten isolation does not apply to those who are known to have had contact with a confirmed COVID-19 case in the last 14 days.
You must not use public transportation to travel to the testing centre. If you do not have access to a private vehicle, you will need to travel to the testing centre by taxi. You are advised to check at the time of booking whether the taxi company is able to take you to a testing centre, as some taxis may not have the precautions in place to provide this service.
You will not be required to self-isolate, if you can provide on arrival medical evidence of recovery from COVID-19 in the last three months.
The Lithuanian government advises that, even those leaving isolation early, keep face-to-face communication with others to a minimum, avoid public gatherings, shops, museums, catering venues, and continue to work from home for 10 days following arrival. If you do need to meet with other people during this period, you are advised to wear a facemask and maintain a safe distance from others.
British nationals travelling to Lithuania by air, sea, bus or train from any overseas destination, including the UK, will need to complete an online registration form prior to arrival.
People arriving in Lithuania by private vehicles or on foot must complete the online registration form within 12 hours of arriving in Lithuania.
The movement of goods is not restricted.
Quarantine requirements
While in isolation, you must:
not leave your place of isolation without the permission of a healthcare professional;
not attend public gatherings, shops or public services;
not have guests/visitors;
organise for essential provisions to be delivered by friends, family or delivery services;
consult with a GP by phone/email to arrange extensions to prescriptions; and
call the Emergency Response Centre on 112, or COVID-19 hotline on +370 37367 963, if you develop symptoms of COVID-19. The hotline is open daily between 8am and 11pm.
While in isolation, you may be contacted by Lithuanian health officials. Failure to comply with self-isolation requirements could result in a fine of between 60 and 1,500 Euros.
The Lithuanian Government advises against isolating in properties shared by others who have not travelled from a high risk country. If this is not possible, you should stay in separate, well-ventilated rooms, restrict your movement within the home and minimise use of common spaces.
Those self-isolating on arrival from a country deemed high risk, but who are not known to have had contact with a confirmed COVID-19 case and do not have COVID-19 symptoms, may go for walks within a 1km radius of their place of isolation. You must wear a covering on your face and mouth, avoid contact with other people and not enter public buildings (such as shops, restaurants or museums) or attend public events. If you are contacted by Lithuanian health officials while on a walk, you must return immediately to your place of isolation.
British nationals needing to temporarily break isolation, may submit a request to Lithuanian National Public Health Centre (NVSC) at least 7 days in advance. Individuals registering for a COVID-19 PCR test through the COVID-19 hotline do not require separate permission to attend the test from the NVSC.
British nationals may leave Lithuania before the end of their isolation period in order to return to the UK/their country of residence.

Regular entry requirements
Visas
If you hold a British Citizen passport, you don’t need a visa to enter Lithuania. If you’re planning a stay of longer than 3 months, see our Living in Lithuania guide and contact the Lithuanian Embassy if you have further questions.
The rules on travel will stay the same until 31 December 2020.
Visas from 1 January 2021

you will be able to travel to countries in the Schengen area for up to 90 days in any 180-day period without a visa as a tourist, to visit family or friends, to attend business meetings, cultural or sports events, or for short-term studies or training.
if you are travelling to Lithuania and other Schengen countries without a visa, make sure your whole visit is within the limit. Visits to Schengen countries within the previous 180 days before you travel would count towards the 90-day limit
to stay for longer, to work or study, for business travel or for other reasons, you will need to meet the entry requirements set out by Lithuania. This could mean applying for a visa and/or work permit. You should check with the Lithuanian Embassy what type of visa and/or work permit, if any, you will need
if you are in Lithuania with a visa or permit, your stay will not count towards the 90-day limit
The 90-day limit for visa-free travel will begin on 1 January 2021. Any days you stay in Lithauania or other Schengen countries before 1 January 2021 will not count towards the 90-day limit.
At border control for Lithuania, you may need to:
show a return or onward ticket
show you have enough money for your stay, and
use separate lanes from EU, EEA and Swiss citizens when queueing
Your passport may be stamped on entry and exit.
Passport validity
The rules on travel will stay the same until 31 December 2020.
Your passport should be valid for the proposed duration of your stay; you do not need any additional period of validity on your passport beyond this.
Passport validity from 1 January 2021
From 1 January 2021, you must have at least 6 months left on an adult or child passport to travel to most countries in Europe (not including Ireland).
If you renewed your current passport before the previous one expired, extra months may have been added to its expiry date. Any extra months on your passport over 10 years may not count towards the 6 months needed.
Check your passport is valid for travel before you book your trip. You will need to renew your passport before travelling if you do not have enough time left on your passport.
UK Emergency Travel Documents
UK Emergency Travel Documents (ETDs) are accepted for entry, airside transit and exit from Lithuania.
