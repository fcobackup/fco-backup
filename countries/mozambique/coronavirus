Entry and borders
The government of Mozambique requires travellers from all countries with active transmission to self-isolate on arrival for 14 days.
You should comply with any additional screening measures put in place by the authorities.
Many visitors from the UK travel to Mozambique via Kenya or South Africa. Both countries have put in place travel restrictions on individuals from countries affected by coronavirus, including the UK. Check FCO travel advice for Kenya or South Africa if this applies to you.
If you need further information about entry requirements, contact the local immigration authorities or nearest Mozambique Embassy or High Commission. You should also check with your airline or travel company for the latest information.
