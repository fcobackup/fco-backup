Warning
FCDO advises against all travel to parts of Democratic Republic of the Congo.

This section has safety advice for regions of the Democratic Republic of Congo. It only covers regions where the Foreign, Commonwealth & Development Office (FCDO) has specific advice.
You should also read FCDO’s overall travel advice and safety and security advice.
Eastern DRC
FCDO advises against all travel to the provinces of:
North Kivu, including the city of Goma
South Kivu, including the city of Bukavu
Haut-Uélé and Ituri, including the entire DRC-South Sudan border
Maniema
Tanganyika
Haut Lomami
The security situation in eastern DRC remains unstable. Armed groups are active and intercommunal violence can affect the political, security and humanitarian situation. Large numbers of civilians remain displaced as a result of the conflict. Acts of violence, including killing, rape and looting continue against civilians. 
There are continued reports of towns in eastern DRC being attacked by or falling under temporary control of armed groups. There are continued reports of attacks and kidnappings, including against staff from NGOs and international organisations. Be prepared to leave at short notice via available routes. If you are in an area against FCDO advice, you should be vigilant at all times and keep your security situation under constant review.
Foreign nationals travelling in eastern DRC have been left vulnerable, without escorted transport. The risk of kidnap or injury remains high.
While British government staff do visit areas of eastern DRC, the British Embassy’s ability to offer support is severely limited.
Peacekeeping forces
A United Nations peacekeeping presence is deployed in eastern DRC. The Congolese army is carrying out operations against foreign and domestic armed groups operating in North and South Kivu and Ituri provinces. Foreign, regional forces are also present in eastern DRC.
Goma and Bukavu
FCDO advises against all travel to Goma in North Kivu and Bukavu in South Kivu in eastern DRC. The situation in eastern DRC is unpredictable, and there is a high risk of ongoing instability, particularly in Goma and Bukavu.  
The armed group M23 and Rwanda Defence Forces (RDF) have captured and taken control of Goma. Fighting in Goma and the surrounding areas has intensified. Goma airport is currently not operational and is under the control of RDF and M23.
The Goma-Gisenye border crossing into Rwanda is controlled by RDF and M23. The border appears open however the situation is highly unstable and there have been incidents of people being temporarily detained and denied entry to Rwanda. 
On 16 February, RDF and M23 forces captured and took control of Bukavu, the main city in south Kivu. This follows advances south from Goma. On Friday 14 February, M23 and RDF forces captured Kavuma airport, approximately 30km north of the city. Commercial flights are not operating from the airport.  
The Ruzizi border crossing in Bukavu is under RDF and M23 control and appears open, but the situation remain highly unpredictable and may change at short notice.
There is an ongoing risk of protests in the east, particularly in Goma, North Kivu province. These could be directed at foreign nationals.
A ‘state of siege’ is in place in the provinces of Ituri and North Kivu. Military administrations with extended security powers have replaced the civilian administrations. On 20 February 2024, the Governor of North Kivu banned vehicles from driving in the province with tinted windows (this includes the city of Goma). 
The situation in Goma, Bukavu, and the surrounding areas remains uncertain, unstable and can change quickly. British nationals should be prepared to leave at short notice and have adequate supplies of food, water, medicine etc in case of the need to lock down.
Border crossings with Rwanda
The border crossings between Rwanda and the DRC at Gisenyi/Goma and Cyangugu/Bukavu may close at short notice. On the 27 January 2025, there were reports of gunfire and artillery fire crossing the border into Rwanda near the Gisenyi/Goma border crossing.
Territory in Mai-Ndombe Province
