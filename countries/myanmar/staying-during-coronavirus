This page gives you guidance on how to stay safely in Myanmar as a visitor, if you are unable to return to the UK.
Everyone should comply with the measures put in place in Myanmar to limit the spread of coronavirus (COVID-19).
Registering with the British Embassy
If you are still in Myanmar and wish to leave, e-mail ReturnFromMyanmar@fco.gov.uk with the following details:
name
email address
phone number
a copy of your passport biodata page
number of people wishing to travel
Moving around in Myanmar
In some areas there may be local requirements for visitors from other parts of the country to quarantine or self-isolate for 28 days on arrival.
Additional movement restrictions have been introduced in 10 Yangon townships: South Okkalapa, Pabedan, Bahan, Mayangone, Insein, Shwe Pyithar, Hlaing Tharyar, Mingaladon, Tamwe, and Botahtaung. All residents must stay at home but can leave the house for work. When outside the home, residents must wear a mask at all times and carry ID.
Cars are only allowed in these townships if these belong to residents. Only two people are allowed in a car. A curfew of 10pm-4am is still in place across all Yangon townships between 23 April and the 23 June. The police will be enforcing these restrictions. You risk arrest if you do not comply.
It is recommended that foreigners carry:
passport
Form C (immigration document)
Foreigner’s Registration Certificate
Myanmar Driver’s Licence (if you own a car)
a copy of your passport information page
a copy of your Myanmar visa
a copy of your immigration stamp showing when you last entered Myanmar.
There are restrictions on large public events (including festivals) and cinemas until 15 May. Restaurants in Yangon have been instructed to close except for delivery service.
Accommodation
There have been reports that some local authorities are carrying out checks to make sure all foreign tourists are staying in registered hotels and guest houses, not in private apartments. If you are on a tourist visa and are not currently staying in a registered hotel or guest house, you should move into one now. This is a requirement under Myanmar law and is a condition of your visa.
Some tourist resorts have been ordered to close.
Visas
The Myanmar Ministry of Labour, Immigration and Population has announced a new process for extending tourist visas, which involves obtaining a letter of recommendation from the embassy. Our current advice remains to pay for any overstay on departure (3$ per day).
The British Embassy is liaising with the Myanmar Government to encourage overstays to be allowed automatically at no extra cost given the circumstances. However, if you do want to extend your visa, email returnfrommyanmar@fco.gov.uk with a copy of your passport data page and a copy of your existing visa. The British Embassy will email a letter of recommendation to you at no cost. You will then need to take the letter of recommendation to the Immigration office on Pansodan street, and pay a fee of $50.
Health
If you are currently in Myanmar and are displaying symptoms of coronavirus, you should consult your healthcare provider. You may then be asked to notify the Myanmar National Hotline for Coronavirus (+95 67 3420268) and be transferred to a public health facility for testing.
If you test positive for the virus, you are highly likely to be transferred to a Government quarantine hospital until you have recovered. Patients are obliged to use a government facility even if they have private insurance. Patients in government hospitals are expected to make their own arrangements for bringing in food and other essential supplies. Lone travellers will not be allowed out of isolation to purchase food or make phone calls.
The coronavirus pandemic is expected to put significant pressure on Myanmar’s medical facilities. They may not be able to offer routine care.
It may be difficult for you to travel to a neighbouring country for medical attention. You should check your personal arrangements with your healthcare provider.
