The Foreign and Commonwealth Office (FCO) advise against all but essential travel to:
the districts of Nangade, Quissanga, Ibo, Macomia, Mocimboa da Praia, Palma and Meluco in Cabo Delgado province, due to attacks by groups with links to Islamic extremism. This includes the islands off the coast.
Terrorists are likely to try to carry out attacks in Mozambique. There has an been an increasing intensity of attacks in Cabo Delgado since January 2019, with attacks reported in the districts of Palma, Mocimboa da Praia, Macomia, Nangade, Quissanga, Muidumbe, Meluco and Ibo. Militants have used explosives, machetes and firearms to conduct lethal attacks, as well as burning vehicles and homes. There are reports of an increased security presence in the province, including road blocks, and there are regular clashes between militants, armed vigilante groups and Mozambican security forces.

Mozambique was affected by two major tropical cyclones during the 2018-19 rainy season:
Tropical Cyclone Idai made landfall at the port city of Beira on 14 March, devastating critical infrastructure in the provinces of Sofala, Zambezia, Manica and Tete, including electricity, communication and road networks. Since then the situation has improved and the extent of the floods is now reducing. Major roads and communication lines have been restored and the airport is open. However, there remains an increased risk from malaria and cholera in flooded areas. You should familiarise yourself with the symptoms and follow the advice of the National Travel Health Network and Centre.
Tropical Cyclone Kenneth made landfall on 25 April. Travel to and through affected areas is likely to be extremely difficult for some time.
If you’re travelling to affected areas, take extra care and follow the advice of the local authorities.
Coastal areas have a risk of tropical cyclones during the rainy season (November to April). Widespread flooding can also occur around river basins, especially the Zambezi. Monitor local reports, check your routes before travelling and follow the advice of local authorities. You can monitor local and international weather updates from the World Meteorological Organisation. See Natural disasters
Traffic accidents are common due to the condition of the roads, poor driving and vehicle standards. Always drive carefully and be aware of pedestrians using the roads. If you’re travelling by road make sure you have relevant documents with you at all times and monitor local media for traffic updates. See Road travel
Piracy remains a significant threat in the Gulf of Aden and Indian Ocean. See Sea travel
Most visits to Mozambique are trouble-free, but violent crime does occur, and there have been cases of criminal kidnappings. You should take extra care. See Safety and security
Consular support is limited in parts of Mozambique where we advise against all but essential travel. If you’re abroad and you need emergency help from the UK government, contact the nearest British embassy, consulate or high commission.
The Overseas Business Risk service offers information and advice for British companies operating overseas on how to manage political, economic, and business security-related risks.
