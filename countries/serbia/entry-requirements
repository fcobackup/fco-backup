This page reflects the UK government’s understanding of current rules for people travelling on a full ‘British Citizen’ passport, for the most common types of travel.
The authorities in Serbia set and enforce entry rules. For further information contact the embassy, high commission or consulate of the country or territory you’re travelling to. You should also consider checking with your transport provider or travel company to make sure your passport and other travel documents meet their requirements.
Entry rules in response to coronavirus (COVID-19)
Entry to Serbia
All visitors to Serbia (with a limited number of exceptions set out below) must present one of the following documents on arrival. You will be refused entry if you do not provide one of these documents:
A negative PCR test result issued within 48 hours of arrival. Visitors travelling from the USA may also present an antigen FIA Rapid Test result. Tests cannot be taken on arrival;
Certificate of vaccination issued in Serbia, or a country with which Serbia has concluded an agreement on vaccine recognition (includes the UK – See Demonstrating your COVID-19 status);
Certificate of Covid-19 recovery, issued within 6 months of arrival, issued in Serbia or a country with which Serbia has concluded an agreement on such documents (does not include the UK).
Serbian nationals and foreign nationals with temporary and permanent residence who do not provide one of the above documents must spend 10 days in self-isolation at home following entry to Serbia. Individuals undergoing self-isolation must report to a healthcare centre within 24 hours of entering Serbia by registering on the e-Health portal.
Persons who have travelled outside Serbia and are returning within 48 hours may present a negative PCR test result issued from Serbia, provided it was issued within 48 hours prior to re-entry into Serbia.
Exemptions to these requirements include:
Citizens of Albania, Bosnia and Herzegovina, Bulgaria, Hungary, North Macedonia and Montenegro, entering Serbia directly from those countries.
Foreign nationals transiting Serbia (up to 12 hours);
Crew of international cargo (road and river) transport (time limits apply);
Crews and cabin crews of aircraft arriving in and transiting Serbia;
Children aged 12 years and under, provided the parent/adult accompanying has complied with the entry requirements outlined above. Children aged 12 to 18 must take a PCR or antigen test within 48 hours of arrival.
Further details can be found on the website of the Ministry of Foreign Affairs.
You should not use the NHS testing service to get a test in order to facilitate your travel to another country. You should arrange to take a private test. If you need further information about entry requirements, contact the local immigration authorities or the nearest Serbian Embassy or Consulate. You should also check with your airline or travel company for the latest information.
Serbian borders remain open for entry and exit, subject to any entry requirements currently in place in neighbouring countries.
Demonstrating your COVID-19 status
Serbia will accept the UK’s proof of COVID-19 recovery and vaccination record. Your NHS appointment card from vaccination centres is not designed to be used as proof of vaccination and should not be used to demonstrate your vaccine status.
Regular entry requirements
Visas
British passport holders don’t need a visa to visit Serbia for up to 90 days. For further information on entry and exit requirements, contact the Serbian Embassy in London.
If you wish to extend your stay in Serbia you will need to apply for temporary residence status at least 30 days before the 90 day period expires at the police station where you’re registered. For more information visit the website of the Serbian Ministry of Foreign Affairs.
When you enter Serbia, make sure you get an entry stamp in your passport. Temporary residents should have an exit-entry visa as well as a residence stamp. If you try to leave Serbia without an entry stamp or exit-entry visa you may face charges of illegal immigration, a heavy fine and possible imprisonment.
You should only enter Serbia through recognised border crossings.
Previous travel to Kosovo
The authorities in Serbia don’t consider the designated crossing points with Kosovo to be official ‘international’ border crossing points.  Foreign nationals have been denied entry to Serbia if they have Republic of Kosovo stamps in their passports.  You’re less likely to experience problems if you travel into Kosovo from Serbia and return via the same route, or if you travel via Albania, North Macedonia or Montenegro. For more information visit the website of the Serbian Ministry of Foreign Affairs.
Passport validity
Your passport should be valid for the proposed duration of your stay. No additional period of validity beyond this is required.
Registration
It’s a legal requirement that you register with the local police in the town/city where you’re staying within 24 hours of your arrival in Serbia, unless you’re staying in a hotel where you will be registered automatically on checking-in. If you don’t register you could be fined, detained or face a court appearance.
Customs declarations
You will be required to declare money (including travellers’ cheques) in excess of €10,000 (or equivalent in other currencies) that you bring into Serbia. Customs officers hold declaration forms and will require a receipt of purchase for Dinars bought from a foreign bank.
On departure, you will need to return a certified copy of this declaration to customs so that money (up to the amount brought in but not exceeding €10,000 in value) can be taken out again. If you fail to comply with these rules, your money may be confiscated.
In order to avoid customs charges, you will be required to declare items of value (eg jewellery, photographic and computing equipment) that you are temporarily bringing into Serbia. 
For more information on declaration of money and the importation of goods see the Serbian Ministry for Foreign Affairs or the National Tourism Organisation of Serbia.
UK Emergency Travel Documents
UK Emergency Travel Documents are accepted for entry, airside transit and exit from Serbia and as valid ID documents in Serbia. However, they should be valid for not less than 7 days and no more than 6 months.
