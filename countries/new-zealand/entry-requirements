This page has information on travelling to New Zealand.
This page reflects the UK government’s understanding of current rules for people travelling on a full ‘British Citizen’ passport from the UK, for the most common types of travel.
The authorities in New Zealand set and enforce entry rules. If you’re unsure how New Zealand’s entry requirements apply to you, contact its UK embassy, high commission or consulate.
COVID-19 entry restrictions
New Zealand’s borders have fully re-opened.
New Zealand borders are fully open to all travellers as of 31 July 2022.
From 20th October, travellers arriving into New Zealand by air are no longer required to fill out a New Zealand Traveller Declaration form disclosing their Covid-19 vaccine status and travel history.
All travellers
Following the lifting of COVID-19 restrictions on 13 September 2022, there are no longer any requirements for travellers to be fully vaccinated in order to travel to New Zealand. However, some travel providers might have in place certain requirements for passengers to travel with them, so please consult your travel provider’s website for further information.
Eligible travellers entering New Zealand will also be given a pack of rapid antigen tests (RATs) with instructions at the airport. Travellers are encouraged to test on day 0/1 and 5/6. Please see New Zealand Government COVID-19 for full details.
You do not need a visa to enter New Zealand as a visitor for up to 6 months, but you will need to get a New Zealand Electronic Travel Authority (NZeTA) before you travel.
The NZeTA costs NZD $17 if applying via the dedicated mobile app, or NZD $23 if completed online via the Immigration NZ website. You will also need to pay an International Visitor Conservation and Tourism Levy (IVL) of NZD $35 when you apply. Once issued, the NZeTA is valid for up to two years. The New Zealand immigration authorities recommend that applicants allow up to 72 hours for processing.
On arrival in New Zealand, you will also need to satisfy the Immigration Officer that you meet the criteria for visa-free entry, which includes having an onward ticket and sufficient funds to support you during your stay. You can check the full criteria on the New Zealand Immigration website.
New Zealand’s immigration rules are strict, particularly regarding employment. Visitors cannot work in New Zealand.
For more information about visas, visit the New Zealand Immigration website or contact the nearest New Zealand High Commission.
If you’re transiting through New Zealand
Transiting is when you pass through one country on the way to your final destination.
If you are planning to transit through New Zealand to another country you must request an NZeTA before you travel. You must ensure you hold the necessary entry documentation for your final destination and the other countries which you will transit through.
In most cases, transit passengers must hold an Electronic Travel Authority (ETA) or transit ETA before travel. These are applied for online. See Information about NZeTA for further detail.

Visas
You do not need a visa to enter New Zealand as a visitor for up to 6 months, but you will need to get a New Zealand Electronic Travel Authority (NZeTA) before you travel.
Quarantine and bio security
New Zealand has very strict bio-security regulations. It is illegal to import most food-stuffs (meat and meat products, honey, fruit, dairy produce) and strict penalties are handed out to those breaking these rules. Take care when importing wood products, golf clubs, footwear, tents, fishing equipment and items made from animal skin. The immigration arrivals card has full details. If in doubt, declare items to a Ministry of Agriculture official or dump them in one of the bins available at the airport. Failure to comply with these regulations can result in a heavy fine of up to $100,000 or imprisonment.
Medication
There are some restrictions on bringing medication into New Zealand. Visit the New Zealand Customs website for more information. If you arrive in New Zealand with any prescription medicines, you must declare it on your passenger arrival card.
All codeine-containing products are classified as prescription only medication (a controlled drug). Codeine is found in many pain relieving medications. You can import controlled drugs for personal use, subject to declaring them on arrival into New Zealand to the Customs Service and demonstrating they have been lawfully supplied for the treatment of yourself or someone under your care. More details on these requirements can be found on the New Zealand Customs website.
