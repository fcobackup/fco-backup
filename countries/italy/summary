The FCDO advises against all but essential travel to:
the whole of Italy based on the current assessment of COVID-19 risks.
If you are returning to the UK from Italy, you will need to self-isolate on your return (unless you are exempt). Check the latest guidance for England, Northern Ireland, Scotland and Wales.
Travel to Italy is subject to entry restrictions
The Italian government announced on 23rd December that flights between the UK and Italy could resume after a temporary pause. However, with immediate effect and until 15th January, entry into Italy from the UK is only permitted for those with official residency in Italy OR those with absolute necessity, which must be declared in writing. You should contact your travel provider for more information. Until 6th January, those wishing to fly must present the airline with a negative Covid-19 rapid antigenic or molecular swab test taken no more than 72 hours before travel. You must ALSO take a Covid-19 rapid antigenic or molecular swab test on arrival in Italy – arrivals by air from the UK will take this test at the airport. Whatever the result of the two swab tests, those arriving in Italy from the UK must ALSO report to their local health authorities on arrival AND must quarantine for 14 days.
You will need to download and complete a self-declaration from the Ministry of Interior before you travel to Italy and inform local authorities of your presence.
From 1 January 2021, UK Nationals, resident in Italy by 31 December 2020, will need to show proof of residence when re-entering Italy. This could include an identity card, a registration certificate or a utility bill in your name
Consult the Italian Government’s online questionnaire (in English) for more advice on entry requirements and travel to Italy.
