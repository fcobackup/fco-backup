Entry and borders
To curb the spread of COVID-19, the Government of India announced that all scheduled international commercial passenger services will remain closed until 14 April 2020. All domestic flights have also been suspended until 14 April 2020.
All land borders with Bangladesh, Bhutan, Myanmar and Nepal in East and North East India are closed.
Visas
The Government of India announced the suspension of all existing visas from 13 March to 15 April 2020 at the port of departure. Visa free travel for Overseas Citizens of India (OCI) is also suspended until 15 April 2020. This does not affect foreign nationals or OCI holders who are already in India.
Plese check the validity of your Indian visa. If it has, or is due to expire, you will need to apply for a visa extension. You will need to apply via the FRRO website. We are aware that there are currently issues with the FRRO website – we are working with the relevant authority to rectify. Please try at off-peak times if you are experiencing problems.
The Government of India has published FAQs for foreigners currently in India who are worried about overstaying their visa. Visit the FRRO website if you have any visa-related queries.
