This page has information on travelling to Botswana.
This page reflects the UK government’s understanding of current rules for people travelling on a full ‘British Citizen’ passport from the UK, for the most common types of travel.
The authorities in Botswana set and enforce entry rules. If you’re unsure how Botswana’s entry requirements apply to you, contact its UK embassy, high commission or consulate.
All travellers
All travellers should follow the entry rules set out for their COVID-19 status.
COVID-19 entry and exit requirements may be announced and altered at little notice. You should monitor the government of Botswana’s Facebook page for the latest developments or contact the government of Botswana’s 24 hour COVID-19 helpline on 16649 / 0800 600 111.
If you’re fully vaccinated
If you are fully vaccinated, you do not need to take a coronavirus test to travel to Botswana. You will need to present your vaccination certification during travel and on arrival.
Proof of vaccination status
Botswana accepts both the UK’s proof of COVID-19 vaccination record and proof of COVID-19 vaccination issued in the Crown Dependencies. Your final vaccine dose must have been administered at least 14 days prior to travel. Your NHS appointment card from vaccination centres is not designed to be used as proof of vaccination and should not be used to demonstrate your vaccine status
If you’re not fully vaccinated
Unvaccinated people must present proof of a negative COVID-19 PCR test, which was obtained not more than 72 hours before the date of travel. You may also be asked to undertake an additional PCR test at the port of entry at your own cost. If the test is positive, you will be permitted to isolate within the district of the port of entry at your own cost.
People who refuse to be subject to the above provisions are liable to a fine, imprisonment or both.
Children and young people
Children aged 12 years and over should follow the requirements for vaccinated or unvaccinated travellers, depending on their vaccination status. Children under the age of 12 are exempt from these requirements.
If you’re transiting through Botswana
Transiting is when you pass through one country on the way to your final destination.
The rules set out above also apply to travellers wishing to transit Botswana.
Check your passport and travel documents before you travel
Passport validity
Your passport should be valid for a minimum period of 6 months from the date of entry into Botswana.
The Botswana government has stated that dual nationals using two different passports can only enter the country on the same passport they used to exit the previous country.
Visas
British nationals do not normally need a visa to enter Botswana for stays of up to 90 days.
Overstaying can cause delays on departure. If you wish to extend your stay, seek an extension from the Department of Immigration.
Travel to or from South Africa
If you’re planning to enter South Africa before or after you visit Botswana, you should refer to the travel advice for South Africa.
Travelling with children
The Botswana government has introduced new immigration rules from 1 October 2016. Children (under 18 years of age) who are travelling into or through Botswana must provide a certified copy of their full unabridged birth certificate as well as a valid passport (an abridged (short) birth certificate won’t be accepted).
If the child is travelling with one parent, with another adult or unaccompanied, the parent or parents who aren’t present will need to provide an affidavit giving their consent for the child to travel. For more information please contact the Botswana Embassy.
Travelling with children via South Africa
If you’re transiting through South Africa with children, see our South Africa travel advice page for information and advice about the documents you’ll need to carry.
Yellow fever certificate requirements
Check whether you need a yellow fever certificate by visiting the National Travel Health Network and Centre’s TravelHealthPro website.
Ebola
The Botswana government continues to impose measures to screen travellers arriving from Ebola affected countries. Travellers arriving from Ebola affected countries may be denied entry to Botswana or put into quarantine on arrival. Further information is available from the Botswana Ministry of Health.
UK Emergency Travel Documents
UK Emergency Travel Documents (ETDs) are valid for entry, transit and exit from Botswana. However, unlike with a full validity UK passport, ETD holders must apply for the appropriate Botswana visa or be in possession of a residence permit before travelling to Botswana.
