There are currently no regular commercial options available to return to the UK from Oman. Oman suspended all international flights on Sunday 29 March and land borders are closed.
Oman Air flight
The British Embassy has been informed that, subject to sufficient tickets being sold, Oman Air will fly to London on 20 and 22 June, departing Muscat at 1.50am. These will be one-way flights.
If you wish to reserve a seat and/or discuss the terms and conditions, please contact Oman Air direct:
email: mct.sales@omanair.com
call: +968 9356 1117
If there is not sufficient interest, Oman Air will not operate the flight.
Future travel options
The UK government is working closely with the airlines, the Omani authorities and British companies exploring private repatriation for their staff, to make sure options are available for you to return to the UK as soon as possible.
This travel advice will be updated when departure options become available.
You will need to pay for your return travel to the UK. If departure options are available but you cannot afford the travel costs and have exhausted all other options for getting funds, you may be eligible to apply for an emergency loan from the government. This is a last resort option and you would need to repay the loan when you are back in the UK.
For more information, you should contact Corporate Travel Management (CTM). CTM are a commercial partner of the FCO and are authorised to administer such loans on behalf of the FCO.
If you cannot leave Oman
If you cannot leave Oman at this time, see advice on staying in Oman during coronavirus.
Your journey home: re-entering the UK
When you return, you must follow the rules for entering the UK. You:
need to provide your journey and contact details up to 48 hours before you’re due to arrive in the UK
are not allowed to leave the place you’re staying for the first 14 days you’re in the UK except in very limited situations (known as ‘self-isolating’)
See also the list of people who are exempt from the border rules.
The National Travel Health Network and Centre (NaTHNaC) also provides advice on how to stay safe as you travel by air.
