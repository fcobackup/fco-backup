According to latest Colombian Government advice, airports are closed to international traffic until 1 September.
UK special flights
On 1 and 4 May, the FCO organised 2 special flights from Colombia to help British tourists, short-term visitors and their direct dependents return to the UK. There are currently no further government-organised flights planned from Colombia.
Future travel options
The Colombian Government is organising a further humanitarian flight for Colombians stranded in the UK to return to Colombia on 7 July. We have been advised that it will be possible for British nationals and foreign nationals who have the right to enter the UK to travel on the Bogota to London leg of the Avianca flight on 6 July.
This will be operated as a commercial flight by Avianca, and seats will be sold on a first come, first served basis. The British Embassy do not have access to the bookings and will not be able to obtain a seat on the flight on your behalf.
The booking is open now. We expect the flight to sell out fast.
Please find booking instructions below:
Access the following link using either Internet Explorer or Microsoft Edge.
Please copy and paste code: ASDO920AMM, and click continue.
Make sure you select the “One-Way” option and the 6 July flight will become available.
Continue the process to complete your purchase.

We understand that Economy Class seats will cost $720 USD and Business Class seats $1,120 USD. Existing Avianca bookings will be accepted towards the flight.
Passengers will need to arrange and pay for their own travel to Bogota.
This travel advice will be updated when departure options become available. Sign up for email alerts and follow the British Embassy on Twitter page and Facebook.

If you cannot leave Colombia at this time, see advice on staying in Colombia during coronavirus.
You will need to pay for your return travel to the UK. If departure options are available but you cannot afford the travel costs and have exhausted all other options for getting funds, you may be eligible to apply for an emergency loan from the government. This is a last resort option and you would need to repay the loan when you are back in the UK. If you need to discuss financial assistance for other departure options please call the British Embassy on +57 1 326 8300.
Travel to the airport
Permits from the local authorities to travel to the airport are no longer required. Your booking confirmation will suffice.
