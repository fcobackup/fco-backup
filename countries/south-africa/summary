Over 430,000 British tourists visit South Africa each year.
Most visits are trouble-free, but a small number of British people encounter problems in South Africa. You should take sensible precautions to protect your safety.
There is a high level of crime including rape and murder in South Africa. Most violent crimes tend to occur in townships, isolated areas and away from the normal tourist destinations. However, armed robberies, including one leading to the death of a tourist, have taken place on Table Mountain in Cape Town in recent years. See Safety and security
If you’re visiting South Africa for tourism or business purposes for a period of up to 90 days, you don’t need a visa. If you’re travelling to South Africa with a child, be prepared to provide additional documentation before being granted entry. See Entry requirements
There have been incidents involving people being followed from OR Tambo International Airport in Johannesburg to their destinations and then robbed, often at gunpoint. Be vigilant in and around the airport and when driving away. See Safety and security
There are regular protest marches, strike related demonstrations, and periodic incidents of public disorder across South Africa, which can become violent. These can occur anywhere across South Africa, sometimes at short notice. You should avoid areas where protests, demonstrations or marches are taking place, especially in city centres and townships. Don’t attempt to cross protester roadblocks as this could provoke a violent reaction. You should monitor local and social media for updates.
Beach conditions and local safety provisions vary considerably throughout the South African coastline and every year several people drown due to the strong sea currents. See Water safety
Terrorists are likely to try to carry out attacks in South Africa. See Terrorism
