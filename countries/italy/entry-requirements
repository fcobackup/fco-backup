The information on this page covers the most common types of travel and reflects the UK government’s understanding of the rules currently in place. Unless otherwise stated, this information is for travellers using a full ‘British Citizen’ passport.
The authorities in the country or territory you’re travelling to are responsible for setting and enforcing the rules for entry. If you’re unclear about any aspect of the entry requirements, or you need further reassurance, you’ll need to contact the embassy, high commission or consulate of the country or territory you’re travelling to.
You should also consider checking with your transport provider or travel company to make sure your passport and other travel documents meet their requirements.
Entry rules in response to coronavirus (COVID-19)
Entry to Italy
Entry to Italy from the UK is permitted. You no longer have to justify your reason for travelling.
You should download and complete a self-declaration form from the Ministry of Interior before you travel to Italy. You must provide this to your airline/transport provider, or to the border police if you are stopped for checks.
Travellers arriving into Italy from Malta, Spain, Greece, Croatia and certain areas of France must undertake a compulsory COVID-19 test. See the Ministry of Foreign Affairs website for more details and check the list of available options for getting a test.
If you are tested for Coronavirus in Italy and receive a positive result, then you will be quarantined until two consecutive negative tests have been recorded. This may be a lengthy process.
Self-isolation
Travellers arriving in Italy directly from the UK are now usually exempt from the requirement to self-isolate.
You will need to self-isolate if, in the 14 days prior to your arrival in Italy, you have stayed in or transited through a country where Italy continues to require self-isolation. If these conditions apply to you, then you must report promptly to the local health authorities and self-isolate for 14 days. If you cannot self-isolate for 14 days for any reason, then entry to Italy may be refused.
More information on these requirements is available on the Ministry of Foreign Affairs frequently asked questions page.
Many airlines and airports serving Italy are resuming service, but may not be operating to their usual schedules. You are strongly advised to check your airline’s website, as well as the website for the airport you are intending to fly to for the latest information. You should also expect to be asked to wear a face mask throughout your flight and within the airport terminal.
Travel to Sardinia
If you are travelling to the island of Sardinia, you need to register your trip in advance. More information on this requirement is available on the regional website of Sardinia.
Travel via neighbouring countries
You should check travel advice for any countries you plan to travel through ahead of your journey.
Regular entry requirements
Visas
If you hold a British Citizen passport, you don’t need a visa to enter Italy. If you’re planning a stay of longer than 3 months, see our Living in Italy guide and contact the Italian Embassy if you have further questions.
The rules on travel will stay the same until 31 December 2020.
Visas from 1 January 2021
The rules for travelling or working in Europe will change from 1 January 2021:
You will be able to travel to countries in the Schengen area for up to 90 days in any 180-day period without a visa for purposes such as tourism. This is a rolling 180-day period.
Therefore, if you’re travelling to Italy, previous visits to the Schengen area within the 180 days before your date of travel would count against the 90-day limit.
If you are travelling visa-free to Italy and to other countries in the Schengen area, make sure your whole visit is within the limit.
To stay for longer, to work or study, or for business travel you will need to meet the entry requirements set out by Italy. This could mean applying for a visa or work permit. You should check with the Italian Embassy what type of visa, if any, you will need.
Periods of stay authorised under a visa or permit will not count against the 90-day limit.
The European Commission has not yet set out how the limit of 90 days in any 180-day period for visa-free travel will be implemented for those who are already travelling in the EU or Schengen Area on 31 December 2020.
If you are travelling to Italy before 31 December 2020 and will stay until 1 January 2021 or later, you should check with the Italian Embassy for information on how the 90-day visa-free limit will apply to you. This also applies if your stay includes travel to other Schengen area countries.
At border control for Italy, you may need to:
show a return or onward ticket
show you have enough money for your stay
use separate lanes from EU, EEA and Swiss citizens when queuing
Your passport may be stamped on entry and exit.
Passport validity
The rules on travel will stay the same until 31 December 2020.
Your passport should be valid for the proposed duration of your stay; you don’t need any additional period of validity on your passport beyond this.
Passport validity from 1 January 2021
From 1 January 2021, you must have at least 6 months left on an adult or child passport to travel to most countries in Europe (not including Ireland).
If you renewed your current passport before the previous one expired, extra months may have been added to its expiry date. Any extra months on your passport over 10 years may not count towards the 6 months needed.
Check your passport is valid for travel before you book your trip. You will need to renew your passport before travelling if you do not have enough time left on your passport.
UK Emergency Travel Documents
UK Emergency Travel Documents (ETDs) are accepted for entry, airside transit and exit from Italy.
