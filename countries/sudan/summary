The Foreign and Commonwealth Office (FCO) advise against all travel to:
the Darfur states
the Abyei Region
South Kordofan and Blue Nile states
the southern area of West Kordofan state that was previously part of South Kordofan, as shown on the map
within 50km of the border with South Sudan in White Nile and Sennar states
within 200km of the border with Libya
The FCO advise against all but essential travel to the rest of Sudan, including Khartoum. If you’re in Sudan, you should consider carefully whether your need to remain is essential and consider leaving the country by commercial means. As of 5 June 2019, the decision was made to withdraw non-essential British Embassy staff and dependants from Sudan.
Following the removal of Sudan’s former President on 11 April and the establishment of a Transitional Military Council, the situation in Khartoum and across Sudan is volatile. On 3 June, security forces dispersed protestors by force from the main protest site in central Khartoum. Approximately 30 people were killed and more than 100 injured. Sporadic gunfire continues across the city. A 5-day general strike is planned for Sunday 9 June which could lead to another escalation in violence and disruption to commercial flights, which are already limited. See Political situation
You should maintain a high level of vigilance across the country, avoid all protests and large gatherings, monitor developments closely and follow the instructions of local authorities and security services.
If you’re in Khartoum, limit your movements in and around the city and plan any travel carefully. There remains a significant military presence in the area to the north of the main protest site, and many roads around the city are blocked by civilians and military. Khartoum Airport remains open but access is limited - check regularly with your airline for the latest information on the status of your flight before leaving for the airport. We understand that Ethiopian Airlines are crrently operating additional flights. If you intend to travel outside of Khartoum and around the wider country, plan ahead and seek information on the situation in districts you propose travelling to or through before departing. See Local travel - Khartoum
There has been no internet service in Khartoum since 3 June. There had earlier been sporadic limitations on access to internet-based communications and social media sites. Virtual Private Networks (VPNs) are not readily available to download in Sudan. Voice and SMS is largely available on most mobile phones.
The ability of the British Embassy to provide consular support to British nationals in Sudan is severely limited. The Embassy is currently closed until further notice due to the security situation. If you wish to leave the country and need UK Emergency Travel Documents to do so, contact us on +249 (0)156 775500 for advice on alternative options.
You shouldn’t assume that the FCO will be able to provide assistance to leave the country in the event of serious unrest, a further deterioration in the security situation and/or reduced capacity of commercial flights. See this page for more information about the precautions you should take in the event of a crisis and the help and support the British Embassy can provide.
Terrorists are likely to try to carry out attacks in Sudan. Attacks could be indiscriminate, including in places frequented by expatriates and foreign travellers. See Terrorism
If you’re abroad and you need emergency help from the UK government, contact the nearest British embassy, consulate or high commission.
