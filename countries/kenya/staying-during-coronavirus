This page gives you guidance on how to stay safely in Kenya.
Everyone should comply with the measures put in place in Kenya to limit the spread of coronavirus (COVID-19).
Moving around in Kenya
A daily nationwide curfew is in effect from 9pm to 4am (local time). On 27 July, the curfew was extended for a further 30 days. During curfew hours, everyone must stay at home or indoors, except for essential service workers. The Government of Kenya has advised that passengers departing the airport after the 9pm curfew must retain their boarding pass as proof of their arrival time which will allow for movement to their accommodation. Similarly, evidence of air passengers arriving after 9pm will enable access for drivers coming to collect passengers during curfew hours.
The Government of Kenya has directed that face masks must be worn in public places, except when dining, or when adhering to social distancing in hotels, gardens or on beaches.
All bars are closed until further notice. Public places, tourism and hospitality establishments, travel and tour companies, hotels and other accommodations, restaurants, eateries, food and beverage outlets and entertainment and recreation facilities have been allowed to reopen, provided they comply with Government of Kenya public health protocols, including 1.5 metre social distancing and the daily curfew. On 27 July, the Government of Kenya directed that eateries and restaurants will close at 7pm for the next 30 days and will not be permitted to sell alcohol.
The Government has directed that, in addition to public transport systems, social distancing rules – in the form of capacity restrictions – will also apply when using private vehicles, including taxis. This means five-seater vehicles will only be allowed to carry two passengers in addition to the driver, while seven-seater vehicles will only be allowed four passengers in addition to the driver.
The suspension of large gatherings, meetings, conferences and political events was extended for a further 30 days on 27 July.
Kenyan citizens have been advised to avoid crowded places and to work remotely where possible.
You do not need a COVID-19 negative test to board domestic flights within Kenya.
Visas
If you need to renew your visa, the Kenyan Immigration Department has announced that visitor pass extensions will be processed online from 13 April 2020. Guidance on how to do so, as well as apply for other forms of documentation such as residence permits, is available from the Kenyan Immigration Department and the Kenyan High Commission in London.
Health
The government of Kenya has indicated that persons testing positive for COVID-19, but presenting as asymptomatic or with only mild symptoms, can expect to be directed to self-isolate at home if able to do so. Vulnerable persons will be prioritised for hospital care. Ministry of Health guidance is available.
Pharmacies and other shops selling essential products remain open, though business hours may be affected by the daily nationwide curfew.
The authorities are conducting random temperature screenings in spaces frequented by the general public. If you show signs or symptoms of coronavirus and are able to self-isolate, you can expect to be directed to do so. If you cannot self-isolate, you can expect to be taken into a State health facility by the Kenyan authorities.
