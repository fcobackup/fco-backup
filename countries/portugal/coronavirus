Inter-island travel
You should only travel between islands if your journey is essential. If you have to travel and you are travelling from a town or an island classified as medium or high risk, you will need to
have a negative RT-PCR COVID-19 test from, at most, 72 hours before you travel and show the negative result when you board, and

If you are staying for more than 7 days, you will have to repeat the test 6 days after the first test. If you are staying for more than 13 days, you will have to repeat the test 12 days after the first test.
If your flight is cancelled or delayed and your PCR COVID-19 test exceeds the 72 hour timeframe, you will have to take a test on arrival and self-isolate until you receive confirmation of a negative result.
This does not apply to children aged 12 and under.
If you live in the Azores, you should only travel internationally if your journey is essential.
Face coverings
On mainland Portugal and in the autonomous regions of Madeira and the Azores, you must wear a face mask in all enclosed spaces. You should wear your face covering when you enter the building and keep it on until you leave. You must also wear a face mask outdoors where it is not possible to maintain a 2m social distance from people outside your family group.
These measures apply to everyone over the age of 10 on mainland Portugal and in the Azores, and over the age of 5 in Madeira and Porto Santo.
You can be fined if you breach the regulations.
You may be exempt from using a face mask both indoors and out on medical grounds. You will have to show a declaration from your doctor as evidence that you have a health condition that prevents you from wearing a face covering. You should observe strict social distancing and limit the time you spend in common areas in enclosed spaces. For further information (in Portuguese) on exemptions, see decree-law 62-A/2020 (Article 3(2).

RT-PCR COVID-19 tests are carried out free-of-charge if you have a prescription issued by a national health service doctor. NHS testing is carried out at hospitals and laboratories by appointment.
If you need a COVID-19 test in order to travel, you should arrange to take a private test. Check when you book that the testing service can provide the appropriate COVID-19 test for your destination. You will not need a prescription, but you will have to show your passport and confirmed travel bookings. You will have to pay for the test in full. If you have health or travel insurance, check whether it will cover any expense you incur.
You will need to go to a pharmacy to get most medicines, though some non-prescription medication is sold at health stores in supermarkets and shopping centres. Pharmacies are widely available and are identified with a green cross. Find a pharmacy near you on the Pharmacy Association website.
UK prescriptions are not recognised in Portugal. Make sure you carry enough medication to last the duration of your visit.
If you need a repeat prescription, go to the nearest health centre or hospital A&E. You may have to pay for your medication. If you have an EHIC or a GHIC, you may be able to claim the cost back if your prescription is issued by a Portuguese state doctor.
