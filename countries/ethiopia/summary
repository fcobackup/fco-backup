Cases of coronavirus (COVID-19) have been confirmed in Ethiopia. The Ethiopian authorities have introduced a number of measures to limit the spread of the virus and on 8 April declared a State of Emergency across the country giving the authorities more power to enforce these measures. All passengers arriving in to the country will be subject to mandatory 14 day quarantine, in a hotel nominated by the authorities and at the passenger’s own cost. A number of major airlines have reduced their flight schedules. See Coronavirus
Given the rapidly changing situation in Ethiopia, a limited number of UK staff and their dependents are being temporarily withdrawn from the British Embassy. The Embassy will continue to carry out essential work including providing 24/7 consular assistance and support to British people in Ethiopia.
There are frequent incidences of civil unrest in Ethiopia, including protests and strikes. Some of these can cause temporary closure of roads or disruption to local business and transport, and in the past some have escalated into serious violence. See Local travel
Tensions are raised in the Somali Regional State and on the border between the Somali and Oromia Regions following clashes in a number of locations, including in the East and West Harerge zones and in the areas surrounding the town of Moyale on the border with Kenya. These clashes have led to a number of deaths. Although there are no reports of foreign nationals being targeted, you should exercise caution and follow the advice of local authorities. Road travel in the area – including on the route between Dire Dawa airport and Harar City – may be disrupted. See Ethiopian Somali Regional State and Oromia Region
Terrorists are likely to try to carry out attacks in Ethiopia. Attacks could be indiscriminate, including in places visited by foreigners. You should be vigilant at all times, especially in crowded areas and public places like transport hubs, hotels, restaurants, bars and places of worship and during major gatherings like religious or sporting events. There is a threat of kidnapping in Ethiopia’s Somali region, and on the southern border with Kenya, particularly in the eastern areas to which the FCO advise against all travel. See Terrorism
Internet connections in Ethiopia, including mobile data, can be intermittent.
If you’re abroad and you need emergency help from the UK government, contact the nearest British embassy, consulate or high commission. Consular support is severely limited in parts of Ethiopia where the FCO advise against all travel and limited where the FCO has existing advice against all but essential travel (see above).
Ethiopia is primarily a cash based society and banking facilities, including card payments and ATMs are very limited outside major cities. See Money
