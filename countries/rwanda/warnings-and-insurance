Rwanda-DRC border
The security situation near Rwanda’s borders with DRC remains unstable. Fighting has intensified in eastern DRC near to the Rwandan border. Armed group M23 have expressed their intent to occupy the city of Goma in eastern DRC, which is 500m from the Rwandan border and the Rwandan town of Gisenyi. The FCDO currently advises against all travel to Goma. Keep up to date with developments through your tour operator or local media.
The border crossings between Rwanda and DRC at Gisenyi-Goma could close at short notice.
