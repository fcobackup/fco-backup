Testing prior to arrival and departure
From 16 January, all air passengers are required to undergo a rapid COVID-19 test immediately on disembarking the plane. This is currently free of charge, which is undertaken in a hangar at the airport, but can take time. Passengers arriving in Angola, should carry water and a refreshment in case there is a long wait.
Those receiving a negative result will be allowed entry and can continue through immigration. You will need to undertake compulsory self-quarantine for 7 days before undergoing a further COVID-19 test. Those receiving a positive COVID-19 result will go immediately into mandatory quarantine at a government facility for observation and further testing.

Quarantine requirements
On 31 August, the Angolan government announced that passengers who can show proof of a full COVID-19 vaccination (ie two doses) and who test negative on disembarkation will be exempt from quarantine on arrival.
All other passengers will need to undertake compulsory self-quarantine for at least 7 days once tested for COVID-19 on arrival. If you test negative, returning residents can quarantine in their own homes. Non-resident essential workers have to quarantine in a government or government-approved facility. You must spend at least 7 days in quarantine before being tested. On arrival, health officials at the airport will issue a handout with contacts to your local health centre where you can get tested. On receipt of a negative PCR test, a Titulo De Alta (ALTA) will be issued by the health centre to authorise the end of quarantine.
Those testing positive on arrival can isolate at home if asymptomatic, but those showing symptoms may be required to go into mandatory quarantine at a government facility.
Regular entry requirements
Visas
You must apply for a valid visa and/or work permit before travelling to Angola, otherwise you will be detained at the airport and then deported. The process can take a long time. You should check all entry requirements with the Angolan Embassy in London well in advance.
If you’re applying for a tourist visa, you can submit documentation online in advance of travel and be granted a pre-approval within 72 hours. This allows you to receive your physical visa on entry into Angola, subject to a fee equivalent to USD $120, paid in cash, Visa or MasterCard. Further information can be found on the online application portal.
You’ll be fined 15,000 Kwanzas (Angolan currency) per day if you overstay your visa. You won’t be allowed to leave the country until your fine has been paid. Legal action will be taken against you if you don’t pay your fine. This may include being detained, deported or not being allowed to re-enter Angola.
Fines are in place for a wide range of visa offences including working, studying or residing without the correct visa, changing employment without notifying the authorities, employing staff with incorrect visas, failing to renew residence cards, or changing address without notifying the authorities.
Passport validity
Your passport should be valid for a minimum period of 6 months from the date of entry into Angola.
UK Emergency Travel Documents
UK Emergency Travel Documents (ETD) are not valid for entry or transit into Angola. However, ETD are accepted to exit Angola.
