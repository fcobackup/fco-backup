Crime levels are low, but you should take sensible precautions against pick pocketing and other street crime. See Crime
Macao, like other parts of China, does not recognise dual nationality. If you have both British and Chinese nationality you may be treated as a Chinese citizen by local authorities, even if you enter Macao on your British passport. If this is the case, the British Consulate-General in Hong Kong may not be able to offer you consular assistance. The FCDO has published guidance on nationality in China. If you have formally renounced Chinese citizenship, you should carry evidence that you have done so. See Local laws and customs
In 2018, 58,303 British nationals visited Macao. Most visits are trouble-free.  
Consular support may be limited in Macao. However, the British Consulate-General in Hong Kong can provide consular support to British nationals.
