Following unprecedented bouts of heavy monsoon rain and floods in Kerala over July and August 2018, around 360 people have lost their lives, as many as 700,000 have been displaced, and many are in relief camps across the state. More than 58,000 people have been rescued and thousands more are awaiting relief. The flood relief and rescue is in full swing across the state with the Navy, Army, Air Force, Coast Guard and NDRF supporting evacuation efforts.
The Government of Kerala has withdrawn the red alert that had been in place across the State. Floodwaters have begun to recede in a few affected areas, and the Met department has predicted little to no rain for the next 5 days. Both Trivandrum and Calicut/Kozhikode airports are operational and Kochi airport is operating Air Alliance flights out of the Naval base in Fort Kochi.
Special trains are running from Trivandrum and Ernakulam to Kolkata from Monday 20 August 2018 and train services are expected to be restored on all lines by that evening. The arterial roads in Kerala are still badly damaged with a lack of connecting bridges. Hence, travel within Kerala by road is only advised in extreme cases and undertaken with great caution.
The worst affected areas lie in the stretch between Chalakudi and Aluva, including Kochi Airport (Domestic and International), which is flooded and now closed until Sunday 26 August 2018. If your current location lies within the worst affected area and you’re in need of urgent help, you’re advised to contact the helpline number of the region you’re in (listed below). There are also reports of heavy rain/flooding in the neighbouring Kodagu district in Karnataka.
If you’re travelling to or are already in Kerala/Kodagu, you’re advised to closely monitor travel advice and media reports and follow the advice from local authorities. The Kerala Government has issued information on its official page. If you wish to leave Kerala, you’re advised to take the safest road to the nearest airport and board a flight out of Kerala to another Indian state - as most international flights departing Kerala, especially to the Gulf, are full. The airport helpline numbers are - Trivandrum contact number for international flights: 91- 471-2501 591: contact number for domestic flights: 91-471-2500 298; Calicut - 91-483-2719491, 08129202233 (M); Cochin - +91 484 2610115.

Terrorists are very likely to try to carry out attacks in India. Recent attacks have targeted public places including those visited by foreigners. There have been recent media reports suggesting Daesh (formerly referred to as ISIL) interest in attacking targets in India. There may be an increased threat to places visited by British nationals such as religious sites, markets, festival venues and beaches. You should be vigilant at this time, monitor local media and take all precautions for your safety. See Terrorism
If you’re travelling in or through Srinagar you should remain vigilant, avoid protests or large gatherings, follow the advice of the local authorities and your travel company and monitor the curfew restrictions in place and the local media. Srinagar Airport is currently open as is the road leading to Srinagar Airport. Take all precautions for your safety. If you’re travelling with a tour operator you should keep in touch with them and contact them for further information on arrangements they may be making for you to leave the area. Due to the accessibility and current unrest the level of consular assistance that the British High Commission can provide in Jammu & Kashmir is extremely limited.
Additional security measures have been implemented at airports across the country. If you’re travelling through an airport you should allow additional time to complete check-in and security as you and your baggage may be required to undergo random x-rays and baggage checks.
Authorities across north-eastern states have increased security presence after the publication on 30 July of a revision of the National Register of Citizens in the state of Assam. Anyone travelling to the region should check the latest travel news before they travel, and if you’re in the region take precautions like avoiding large crowds.
