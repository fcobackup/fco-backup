The Italian authorities have advised against travel for tourism purposes throughout Italy, and that tourists already on holiday in Italy should limit their movements to those necessary to return to the place where they live.
On 11 March, the Italian government announced new measures closing all non-essential business across Italy with immediate effect. All shops are closed apart from pharmacies and shops selling food and other basic necessities. Essential public services, transport, utilities, banks and postal services will remain active. All public gatherings, including religious ceremonies, funerals and sporting events remain suspended. Restaurants, bars, museums, cultural institutions, childcare facilities, schools and universities are closed, as are ski resorts.
The majority of carriers have now ceased operating direct flights between Italy and the UK. Alitalia continue to operate flights on a reduced basis. Other airlines have indicated that they will assist British tourists in Italy who have booked travel with them to return to the UK, which may require travel via other countries. Travellers should therefore contact their airlines as soon as possible.
Only one airport per region will remain open. Rome Ciampino closed for commercial flights on 13 March. Terminal 1 (only) of Rome Fiumicino airport will close on 17 March. Other airports, including Milan Linate, are due to close in the coming days.
Train companies are reducing services, for both domestic and international travel. Some cross-border bus companies are also cancelling their services. Ports remain open although we understand that passengers on cruise ships will not be allowed to disembark for tourism purposes. Passenger ferry schedules remain subject to change and cancellations. Several neighbouring countries have imposed restrictions on people entering from Italy. Please consult travel advice for the country concerned.
Please consult the latest advice from the Department of Health and Social Care for guidance on actions to take if you are concerned you have symptoms of coronavirus.
