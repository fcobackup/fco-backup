Warning
FCDO advises against all travel to parts of Democratic Republic of the Congo.

This guide also has safety advice for regions of the Democratic Republic of the Congo (DRC).
Terrorism  
There is a high threat of terrorist attack globally affecting UK interests and British nationals, including from groups and individuals who view the UK and British nationals as targets. Stay aware of your surroundings at all times.    
UK Counter Terrorism Policing has information and advice on staying safe abroad and what to do in the event of a terrorist attack. Find out how to reduce your risk from terrorism while abroad.
Terrorism in DRC
Terrorists are very likely to try to carry out attacks in DRC.
ADF, a militant group with links to Daesh, carry out regular attacks in North Kivu and Ituri provinces, eastern DRC. The majority of its attacks target villages in rural areas, but it has attacked military targets – primarily Ugandan and Congolese armed forces personnel. Attacks have also targeted bars, places of worship, markets and vehicle convoys.
Attacks could be indiscriminate including in places visited by foreign nationals. Stay aware of your surroundings, keep up to date with local media reports and follow the advice of local authorities.
Political situation
Protests and demonstrations
In May 2024 there was gunfire in the Gombe area of Kinshasa, near the Pullman Hotel, Palais de la Nation and British Embassy. There remains an increased security presence and police checkpoints have been introduced in locations around Kinshasa.
A range of military and peacekeeping forces are deployed in eastern DRC. Tensions about the presence of these forces and the role of international actors can cause protests in Goma and Kinshasa. There have been large protests against the UN peacekeeping mission known as the United Nations Organization Stabilization Mission (MONUSCO). In February 2024 there were protests outside the British Embassy and other western embassies. Similar protests cannot be ruled out in future. These could be directed at foreign nationals or target UN vehicles and premises.
Public gatherings and demonstrations can occur with little or no notice and can quickly turn violent.
Protests may result in:
the closure of shops and public services
restrictions on movement
In the event of serious unrest:
commercial flights may be suspended
roads may be blocked
international borders may be closed at short notice, particularly those with Rwanda, at Gisenyi/Goma and Cyangugu/Bukavu
internet connections and mobile phone networks may have reduced services or be cut off
military and police presence in Kinshasa and other major cities may increase - this may include stop-and-search checkpoints, especially after dark
To minimise your personal risk:
follow local media for news of any planned protests
leave quickly and do not attempt to watch or photograph any demonstration or disturbance
consider making contingency plans
keep a stock of essential supplies
keep your travel documents up-to-date, including appropriate visas
be prepared to move or go into curfew at short notice if told to by the authorities
see how to prepare for a crisis overseas
Stay away from areas where protests are planned, particularly in Kinshasa, Goma and other large cities. This may include:
N’Djili airport, Kinshasa
Churches and other religious buildings and institutions
large sporting stadiums or music venues
universities
political party headquarters
foreign embassies
government and parliament buildings
offices of the Electoral Commission
Do not assume FCDO will be able to help you leave the country in the event of serious unrest.
Traveling around DRC 
There is widespread poverty, social exclusion and health risks in many parts of the DRC. You may be at greater risk of being robbed or attacked in rural areas. Transport and accommodation are extremely limited outside Kinshasa and the major towns, so make travel arrangements in advance. Travel in the company of experienced people or organisations.
Be respectful of local customs and land rights, including the necessary permissions for activities. Recent incidents have occurred with local communities when foreign nationals have wild camped without permission.
Crime
Street crime and scamming
Foreign nationals are at particular risk of street robbery in Kinshasa, Lubumbashi and other urban centres, especially near hotels and supermarkets in the centre of town. Organised gangs lure people into traps through techniques including the use of children, promising cut-price gold and diamonds, or posing as police or security personnel. Robberies by gangs of street children are common and can be aggressive.
In Kinshasa, robberies can be carried out by people posing as taxi drivers or taxi passengers, and are often accompanied by a threat of violence.
In North and South Kivu, reports of criminal activity have increased, particularly those targeting the international community. There have been many reports of robberies and banditry in Goma, especially after dark.
To reduce your personal risk:
avoid walking in the streets alone at any time, especially at night
do not display valuables and cash
use a hotel safe if possible and keep copies of documents, including your passport, separately
use transport organised by a hotel or tour operator
if you must take a taxi, use a privately booked one and do not hail taxis in the street
Criminal kidnap
Kidnapping is a risk in parts of Kinshasa, including the Limete area.
There have been several recent incidents where criminals pretending to be policemen or security personnel have captured foreign nationals and then demanded payment for their release.
Criminals may also carry out ‘express kidnaps’, where they capture victims, take them to ATMs to withdraw money, and then release them.  
Foreign nationals can be perceived as being wealthier than locals and may be at particular risk.
To reduce risk:
avoid walking in the streets alone at any time, especially at night
Do not display valuables and cash
If you must use a taxi, use a privately booked one
do not hail taxis in the street.
Vehicle crime
Carjackings are rare, but lock vehicle doors and keep windows closed when driving. Watch out for armed gangs who may target your car or try to enter it to rob you. Do not drive off the main roads or park in unsupervised areas.
Laws and cultural differences
 Justice process
The DRC authorities rarely meet their international obligations to notify embassies when foreign nationals have been detained. Even if requested, adequate consular access is not always granted. Keep in close touch with family or friends and ask them to notify the British Embassy in Kinshasa immediately if you are arrested in DRC.
Using cameras in secure areas
Taking photographs of some government and military buildings is illegal, particularly borders or military installations. You risk being arrested and detained. Journalists should not conduct interviews or film without the necessary local permits.
LGBT+ travellers
Same-sex sexual activity is not illegal in DRC but is frowned upon by many. There is no legal recognition of same-sex couples or same-sex marriage, and there are no specific anti-discrimination laws protecting LBGT+ people. Members of the LGBT+ community are known to be harassed. Individuals may be charged under DRC’s Penal Code for ‘crimes against family life’.   
Read more advice for LGBT+ travellers.
Adopting children from DRC
FCDO advises against adopting from DRC. The UK does not recognise adoptions made in DRC as DRC is not a signatory to the Hague Convention on Protection of Children and Co-operation in Respect of Intercountry Adoption.
The DRC government has not issued exit permits for children adopted by foreign nationals in DRC since 2013 and many are still unable to leave the country. It is illegal for same-sex or trans-sexual couples to adopt Congolese children.
Camouflage clothing
If you wear any military-style clothing you could be misidentified as military personnel and be vulnerable to attack or detention.
Money
Credit cards are only accepted in a limited number of places in Kinshasa and other cities. US dollars are widely used alongside the local currency and a number of ATMs dispense US dollars in Kinshasa. Notes should be in good condition and issued after 2001. Elsewhere in DRC, cash is needed for transactions.
Make sure you have access to money, or have arrangements in place for it to be sent to you in an emergency, before leaving the UK.
Transport risks
Road travel
If you are planning to drive in Democratic Republic of Congo, see information on driving abroad. You’ll need a 1968 International Driving Permit (IDP) to drive in DRC. You will not be able to buy an IDP outside the UK, so get one before you travel.
Car hire is possible in Kinshasa although self-drive options are limited. Most car hire companies will only let you hire a car with a driver.
Road conditions
Driving standards are well below those in the UK and accidents are very common. Roads in Kinshasa are poorly maintained. Outside Kinshasa and other large cities, most roads are barely drivable even with a 4x4, especially during the rainy season from September to May. Consider the technical capability of your vehicle and be confident in your ability to operate it. Travel after dark brings increased risk.
Public buses and taxis are often not well-maintained, and there is a risk of assault.
Security forces operate roadblocks, particularly after dark. If you are asked to produce documents for inspection at a checkpoint, stay inside your vehicle and show them through closed windows.
Air travel
The UK Air Safety List (ASL) lists all known airlines in DRC that do not meet international safety standards and are banned from operating commercial air services to, from, and within the UK. Check the UK Air Safety List when considering which airlines to fly with. The list is maintained by the Department for Transport, based on advice from the UK Civil Aviation Authority. FCDO advises against all travel by air into and out of Goma airport. See why FCDO advises against travel.
Rail travel
The railways are in a poor state and you should be aware of the increased risk of travel by train. A refurbished route opened between Kinshasa and Matadi in 2015, although services are infrequent and unreliable.
River travel
The ferry service between Kinshasa and Brazzaville stops running in the late afternoon and there is no service on Sundays.
Boats and ferries on the rivers and lakes are poorly maintained and often overloaded. As a result of the low safety standards, high river traffic levels, strong currents, shifting sandbanks and poor maintenance there have been many accidents.
Extreme weather and natural disasters
Find out what you can do to prepare for and respond to extreme weather and natural hazards.
Flooding
During the wet season (approximately September to May), heavy rainfall often causes severe flooding in parts of DRC. Check for news of flooding before travelling.
Earthquakes
Earthquakes are a risk in DRC, but they are infrequent. The US Federal Emergency Management Agency website has advice about what to do before, during and after an earthquake.
Volcanic eruptions
Mount Nyiragongo volcano, close to the city of Goma and near the border with Rwanda, erupted in 2002 and 2021, resulting in loss of lives and damage to infrastructure in and around Goma. Further volcanic activity is possible at any time.
