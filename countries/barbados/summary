From 4 July, Barbados is exempt from the FCDO advice against all non-essential international travel. This is based on the current assessment of COVID-19 risks.
Travel is subject to entry restrictions
You should read and ensure that you understand fully the entry and monitoring protocols for Barbados before you travel – link here. These are subject to short notice change, so should be reviewed regularly.
You must complete and submit an online immigration/customs form 24 hours prior to travel
You are advised to arrive in Barbados with a COVID-19 negative PCR test result meeting Barbados entry requirements.
If you arrive in Barbados without a qualifying negative PCR test for COVID-19 that meets Barbados’ entry requirements, you will be subjected to a mandatory test on arrival and will need to quarantine. You will need to quarantine until the test results are provided. UK arrivals are further subject to daily monitoring by health officials for seven days, which may include calls / interviews with public health professionals.
Effective 14 September, arrivals will be required to undertake a second COVID-19 PCR test 5 – 7 days after arrival. If this second test proves negative, no further monitoring will be required. If you refuse to take the second test you will be required to quarantine at government approved facilities for a further seven days.
Persons may also be required to quarantine, and / or undertake a further COVID test, at any stage of their visit at the discretion of health officials.
If you test positive for COVID-19 at any point during your stay in Barbados you will be immediately transferred to the government isolation unit at Harrison’s Point, where you will be required to remain until you have returned two consecutive negative COVID-19 tests. This may take several weeks.
