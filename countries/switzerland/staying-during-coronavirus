This page gives you guidance on how to stay safely in Switzerland as a visitor, if you are unable to return to the UK.
Everyone should comply with the measures put in place in Switzerland to limit the spread of coronavirus (COVID-19).
Moving around in Switzerland
See Entry requirements
The Swiss Government have implemented “extraordinary measures” in response to coronavirus (COVID-19).
Gatherings of more than 5 people are banned, excluding families and members of the same household.
All contact with other individuals should be kept to a minimum, and a distance of 2 metre should be maintained at all times.
The public are strongly advised to stay at home and employers urged to allow staff to work from home.
The Swiss Government has started a phased relaxation of these measures. All shops, restaurants, markets, museums and libraries are now able to reopen with social distancing measures in place.

Finance
There is a range of financial support from the government that you can access while you are unable to return due to coronavirus restrictions.
If you’re in Switzerland, and have exhausted all other options to cover essential living costs while you wait to return home, you could apply for an emergency loan for your living costs from the UK government. You can only apply if you normally live in the UK and you cannot return home. This last-resort option is for those most in need, and you would need to repay the loan when you are back in the UK. Apply for an emergency loan.
