International travel
The Government of Jordan is preparing to reopen Queen Alia International Airport on 10 September to a limited number of commercial flights. This is primarily to facilitate the return of Jordanian citizens.
Countries are classified into three categories, red, yellow and green - depending on the epidemiological scale of the COVID-19 outbreak in each respective country. The UK is currently classified as ‘red’.
If you’re travelling from the UK to Jordan, you will need to take a PCR test on arrival (at your own cost) and wait up to three hours for the results. Those who test positive will be taken to designated C-19 hospitals for isolation and treatment if required. Those with a negative test result will then be moved by officials to a government quarantine facility (usually a range of hotels) for seven days and will then be asked to do a further seven days of home quarantine. During this period, those in home quarantine will be monitored by a GPS bracelet.
This list of countries in each categories is still under review and the British Embassy expects further details to be published in the near future. Until then, commercial flights in and out of Jordan are suspended and all land and sea borders are closed. Some commercial operators have been able, in exceptional cases, to negotiate flights out of Jordan. You should check any flight options directly with airlines or a reputable travel company.
