Terrorism in Trinidad and Tobago
Terrorist attacks in Trinidad and Tobago cannot be ruled out.
Attacks could be indiscriminate including in places visited by foreign nationals. Stay aware of your surroundings, keep up to date with local media reports and follow the advice of local authorities.       
Crime
Carnival and other large-scale events 
Robberies and opportunistic crime may occur during the carnival period.  If you are attending a large scale event, such as the Carnival celebrations in Trinidad, you should take sensible precautions and be vigilant of your surroundings at all times. Avoid displaying jewellery or valuable items that may attract attention of criminals. Do not leave your drinks unattended, practice caution at crowded events and have a clear plan to return home safely after attending any events.
Violent crime and assault: Trinidad
In Trinidad, there’s a high level of violent crime. Gang-related attacks and shootings are increasing around the city centre of Port of Spain, including Laventille, Morvant and Barataria.
There is a risk of armed robbery. You can reduce the risk of being targeted when on foot by:
avoiding unlit areas at night
using well-populated roads and paths
Stay aware of your surroundings and carry a mobile phone with roaming for use in an emergency.
Violent criminals often carry out attacks in vehicles, ranging from the threat of violence to sexual assault and robbery, kidnapping for ransom, rape and murder. You can take precautions against being targeted by:
using well-established taxi firms, recommended by locals or your hotel
being cautious about accepting lifts in a private car or ‘maxi taxi’
taking local advice to avoid areas affected by gang violence
keeping the windows closed and doors locked while driving
Violent crime can also happen in Tobago, but is rarer.
Protecting yourself and your belongings
If you’re staying in a villa, especially in an isolated area, it should have adequate security, including external security lighting, grills and overnight security guards.
Withdrawing cash from an ATM or changing money can make you a target for pickpockets or muggers. Consider asking hotel or villa staff to take you by car.
Keep money, valuables and passports somewhere safe, and never leave anything in an unattended vehicle.
Take care when using dating apps in Trinidad and Tobago, especially those used by the LGBT+ community. Criminals have used apps like Grindr to trick, rob, and assault people.
Drink spiking
Avoid accepting drinks from anyone you do not know, and do not leave drinks unattended.
Laws and cultural differences
Laws on clothing
It is an offence for anyone, including children, to dress in camouflage clothing or bring any into the country.  
Illegal drugs penalties
Trinidad and Tobago has decriminalised the possession of up to 30g of cannabis or up to 5g of cannabis resin. However, you’re not allowed to smoke cannabis in public spaces or while operating a vehicle.
If you are stopped with more than these amounts, you could get a fine of 50,000 Trinidad and Tobago dollars. More severe penalties remain in place for other drug-related offences.
LGBT+ travellers
Male and female same-sex sexual activity is illegal in Trinidad and Tobago. There are laws prohibiting LGBT+ individuals from entering the country. In practice, these laws are rarely enforced, and there is growing local support for LGBT+ rights. However, showing affection in public may attract negative attention.
