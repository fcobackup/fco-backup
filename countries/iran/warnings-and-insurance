FCDO advises against all travel to Iran

Political situation in Iran  
Israel continues to operate militarily against Iran. Reports suggest that a wide range of military, nuclear and civil installations across the country have been hit. Major cities have been affected, and the Israeli Defence Forces have issued evacuation warnings for some residential districts. A significant Iranian military response is ongoing.
The situation could escalate quickly and poses significant risks. We continue to advise against all travel to Iran.
If you are in Iran
Travel by air
Iranian airspace remains closed.
Travel by land
Iran’s borders with neighbouring countries may have restrictions for foreign travellers and may close at short notice. If you plan to depart Iran across a land border and consider it safe to do so, check the travel advice of the country you intend to enter before travelling to the border, including visa requirements.
Entry to countries bordering Iran is not straightforward, and some countries will ask for additional paperwork for British passport holders. If you intend to leave overland you do so at your own risk. Should you require assistance, including with additional paperwork, contact the FCDO.
Monitor this travel advice and other media to ensure you have the latest updates.
Be aware that FCDO advises against travel to some parts of countries that border Iran, including within Afghanistan, Iraq and Pakistan.
Read FCDO advice if you’re affected by a crisis abroad.
Limited UK government support  
UK government support is extremely limited in Iran. Assume that no face-to-face consular assistance will be possible in an emergency and the UK government will not be able to help you if you get into difficulty in Iran. 
Travel insurance 
If you choose to travel to Iran against FCDO advice, research your destinations and get appropriate travel insurance. Insurance should cover your itinerary, planned activities and expenses in an emergency.
