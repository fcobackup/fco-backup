Local laws reflect the fact that Jordan is a predominantly Islamic country. You should respect local traditions, customs, laws and religions at all times and be aware of your actions to ensure that they don’t offend. In 2018, the holy month of Ramadan started on 16 May and will finish on 14 June.
In 2019, the holy month of Ramadan is expected to start on 5 May and finish on 4 June. See Travelling during Ramadan
The Jordanian government doesn’t interfere with the practice of Christianity but encouraging conversion to the Christian faith is illegal. It is also illegal for a Muslim to convert to Christianity.
Jordan is a conservative society. You should dress modestly and behave courteously.
It’s illegal to drink alcohol on the street but permissible in bars, clubs, hotels and private homes. There are strict alcohol limits for drivers, similar to that of the UK. If you’re found guilty of drink driving you could face a driving ban, a fine or even imprisonment.
Possession, use or trafficking in illegal drugs is a serious offence and can result in a lengthy prison sentence and a heavy fine.
While Jordanian law may not explicitly prohibit homosexual acts, Jordan is a conservative society and public displays of affection between homosexual couples are not generally tolerated. You could be arrested under other Jordanian laws. See our information and advice page for the LGBT community before you travel.
