Restrictions on movement throughout the country have been lifted and travel between regions is permitted.
Road travel
Land borders are open.
Inter-regional travel is permitted. If travelling with people who are not from the same household, all passengers must wear a face mask covering the nose and mouth. Penalties may be imposed if you do not comply.
Public spaces and services
Social distancing measures and other safety precautions should continue to be observed at all times. See ‘Use of face masks’ and ‘Local measures and the ‘new normal’ phase’.
Local measures and the ‘new normal’ phase
On June 21, Spain entered the ‘new normal’ phase, which concludes the progressive 4-phase de-escalation plan and sees the return of cross-regional mobility. Protective protocols and safety measures remain in place and you should observe the guidelines set out by the Spanish Government at all times. You should also refer to regional authorities for any additional local measures where you are as this may vary from one region to the next.
Key ‘new normal’ measures include:
social distancing of 1.5-metres
obligatory use of face masks in public spaces (see ‘Use of facemasks’).
track and trace – all shops, businesses and transport companies are obliged to keep passengers’ contact information (where provided) for up to 4 weeks for tracking and tracing purposes.
Use of face masks
The use of face masks is obligatory to anyone over the age of 6 years old in all public spaces in Spain, where it is not possible to maintain social distancing of 1.5 metres. Face masks must cover the nose and mouth. Penalties may be imposed if you do not comply.
Those with respiratory problems or those unable to wear a mask due to other health conditions or disabilities are exempt from this rule. For details, please see here.
While not mandatory, the use of face masks on children between three and five years of age is recommended.
