The information on this page covers the most common types of travel and reflects the UK government’s understanding of the rules currently in place. Unless otherwise stated, this information is for travellers using a full ‘British Citizen’ passport.
The authorities in the country or territory you’re travelling to are responsible for setting and enforcing the rules for entry. If you’re unclear about any aspect of the entry requirements, or you need further reassurance, you’ll need to contact the embassy, high commission or consulate of the country or territory you’re travelling to.
You should also consider checking with your transport provider or travel company to make sure your passport and other travel documents meet their requirements.
Restrictions in response to coronavirus
Travel restrictions and borders
Temporary border controls were introduced from 17 March limiting entry to Estonian nationals, those with an Estonian Residence Permit or foreign citizens with family members in Estonia. All those entering are required to complete a health declaration on arrival and self-quarantine for 14 days. There are some exceptions to this including diplomats, healthcare workers and those transporting goods and raw materials, provided they are asymptomatic.
The Estonian Police and Border Guard will carry out health checks at international border crossing points (land, ports and airports) to identify travellers’ country of departure and check for symptoms of coronavirus.
The State of Emergency was lifted on 18 May 2020 but many of its measures, including restrictions on public events remain in place.
From 1 June, travellers without symptoms arriving from an EU Member State, Schengen Convention state or from the UK will again be allowed to enter the country.
Quarantine requirements
Those arriving from countries where the COVID-19 infection rate is 15 cases or fewer per 100,000 people for the previous 14 days do not need to self-quarantine on entry.
A list of countries from which arrivals are not required to self-quarantine is available on the official government crisis website and the website of the Estonian Ministry of Foreign Affairs and it will be updated every Friday. Those arriving from the United Kingdom are still required to self-quarantine for 14 days.
You should follow the local quarantine measures of the country that you are in.
See detailed information about border crossings on the Estonian government official crisis portal.
If you need further information about entry requirements, contact the local immigration authorities or the nearest Estonian embassy or consulate. You should also check with your airline or travel company for the latest information.
Regular entry requirements
Passport validity
Your passport should be valid for the proposed duration of your stay; you do not need any additional period of validity on your passport beyond this.
The rules on travel will stay the same until 31 December 2020.
Visas
If you hold a British Citizen passport, you don’t need a visa to enter Estonia. If you’re planning a stay of longer than 3 months, see our Living in Estonia guide and contact the Estonian Embassy if you have further questions.
The rules on travel will stay the same until 31 December 2020.
UK Emergency Travel Documents
UK Emergency Travel Documents (ETDs) are accepted for entry, airside transit and exit from Estonia.
