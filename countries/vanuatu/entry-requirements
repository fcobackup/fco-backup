Entry to Vanuatu
Borders are closed to non-residents. Air Vanuatu run occasional scheduled repatriation flights from Auckland, Brisbane and Noumea for Vanuatu citizens and permanent residents. Places on these flights need to be pre-approved by the Vanuatu authorities. Arriving passengers are required to undergo 14 days’ quarantine at a government approved location at their own expense.
The Government of Vanuatu has also issued specific instructions to crew on aircraft and foreign going sea vessels. Given the fast moving situation, you should familiarise yourself with controls in place and to check with your airline before you travel.
