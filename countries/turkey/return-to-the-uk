Coronavirus guidance is being updated.
Read what you can and cannot do

There are currently extremely limited commercial options available to return to the UK from Turkey.
The Turkish Government has implemented a ban on international flights until 1 June. Normal, scheduled international flights will not resume until the ban is lifted. At present there is no information about how soon airlines will resume their operations after it is lifted. Occasional ad hoc flights are still operating. If you have a future reservation for a flight from Turkey to the UK other than those listed below and our social media @UKinTurkey, there is no guarantee that the flight will operate. Contact your airline for the latest information.
If you live in the UK and are currently visiting Turkey, you’re strongly advised to return now by commercial means. Don’t risk getting stranded.
UK special charter flights will only operate for priority countries where commercial flights are not possible. You should not assume that these flights will become available in Turkey because commercial routes are operating. Please do not contact the contracted travel management company if no chartered flight is advertised here.

Financial assistance
You will need to pay for your return travel to the UK. If departure options are available but you cannot afford the travel costs and have exhausted all other options for getting funds, you may be eligible to apply for an emergency loan from the government. This is a last resort option and you would need to repay the loan when you are back in the UK.
For more information, you should contact Corporate Travel Management (CTM). CTM are a commercial partner of the FCO and are authorised to administer such loans on behalf of the FCO.
Travelling to the airport
Turkey has imposed restrictions on internal travel. You will need a travel permit:
to travel from one city to another, see Coronavirus
to go to the airport during a ‘full nation-wide’ lockdown, which is expected most weekends
if you are aged over 65 or under 20 and need to travel within the same city
To request a travel permit, submit a request to the British Embassy Ankara. You should make clear in the subject box that you are enquiring about a permit to travel, and have proof of your onward journey out of Turkey.
