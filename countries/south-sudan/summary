The Foreign and Commonwealth Office (FCO) is advising British nationals against all non-essential international travel at this time. Existing advice for South Sudan remains in place:
The FCO advise against all travel to South Sudan.
If you choose to travel to South Sudan against FCO advice, exercise caution and vigilance at all times and avoid any travel during the hours of darkness. You should make sure you have comprehensive contingency plans that don’t rely on support from the Embassy, including a stock of essential supplies and up-to-date travel documents and visas. If you’re concerned about your safety, you should contact the FCO on +44 207 008 1500. Subscribe to email alerts for updates to this travel advice.
An official government curfew has been introduced across South Sudan from 8pm to 6am in an effort to prevent the spread of coronavirus. See Coronavirus
Given the rapidly changing situation in South Sudan we are temporarily withdrawing a number of UK staff from our Embassy. The Embassy will continue to carry out essential work. Consular support is severely limited in South Sudan. The British Embassy in Juba does not have a consular section. If you are in South Sudan and need urgent help from the UK Government, contact the British High Commission in Nairobi.
There are reports of intercommunal violence in some parts of the country, and sporadic reports of fighting between armed groups in certain areas. It is possible that such violence will increase following the recent formation of a new Transitional Government of National Unity. There are also regular reports of serious criminality in Juba, particularly during the hours of darkness.
You should be vigilant of the local security situation, monitor the local media, and stay in a safe location. Most international organisations in South Sudan employ a security manager to monitor the situation and keep employees safe.
A new transitional government was formed in February 2020. A ceasefire is in place which has largely held since September 2018. But a deterioration in the security situation remains possible, and could be prompted by a number of factors including developments in the fragile economy. In the event of a serious deterioration, similar to those of July 2016 and December 2013, routes into and out of South Sudan may be blocked, Juba airport may be closed or inaccessible, and flights may be suspended at short notice. Regional developments may also increase the unpredictability of infrastructure and transport, as happened in April 2019 when events in Sudan led to the temporary closure of South Sudan’s airspace. The main road connecting Juba to Uganda is extremely dangerous, with regular reports of accidents and attacks on vehicles by armed groups.
Terrorist attacks in South Sudan can’t be ruled out. See Terrorism
Take out comprehensive travel and medical insurance before you travel.
