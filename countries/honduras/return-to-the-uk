Honduras has closed its land, air and maritime borders for the transit of people.
UK special flight
On 1 May, the FCO operated a special flight from Honduras to help British tourists, short-term visitors and their direct dependents return to the UK. There are currently no further special flights organised from Honduras. The British Embassy continues to work closely with the Honduran authorities, international governments, and airlines on all possible options for British Nationals still in Honduras who wish to return to the UK.
Your journey home
The National Travel Health Network and Centre (NaTHNaC) provides advice on how to stay safe as you travel by air.
When you arrive back in the UK, follow the guidance for when you return to the UK on steps you should take to protect yourself and others.
Travel via the USA
Some British nationals have successfully flown out of Honduras on commercial flights to the US. If you are considering this option, you should contact your nearest US embassy or consulate to check if you have the necessary entry requirements before getting on a flight. Be aware that you may not be permitted to enter the US if you have been in the UK, Europe or China in the past 15 days.

If you cannot leave Honduras at this time, you should:
follow the advice of local authorities, including local measures to help minimise your risk of exposure to coronavirus
find accommodation thatâ€™s suitable for your needs.
keep in regular contact with family and friends at home, so they know you are safe and well
