Be prepared for your plans to change
No travel is risk-free during COVID-19. Countries may further restrict travel or bring in new rules at short notice, for example due to a new COVID-19 variant. Check with your travel company or airline for any transport changes which may delay your journey home.
If you test positive for COVID-19, you may need to stay where you are until you test negative. You may also need to seek treatment there.
Plan ahead and make sure you:
can access money
understand what your insurance will cover
can make arrangements to extend your stay and be away for longer than planned
Travel in Guatemala
Restrictions to prevent the spread of coronavirus are in place. If you are in Guatemala you should:
Observe social distancing of at least 1.5 metres. On 6 October 2022, the Government of Guatemala declared that the proper use of masks is mandatory in the following places (regardless of the colour of the health alert):
it is still mandatory to wear masks in hospitals, medical clinics, vaccination centres, medical laboratories, nursing homes, prisons.
it is highly recommended to wear a mask on public transportation.
besides the places mentioned above, the use of masks is now optional.
children under 2 years of age and those with a medical condition certified by a health professional are exempt from this requirement
those under quarantine must also wear masks inside their homes.
wash and sanitise your hands frequently.
The sale of alcoholic and fermented beverages are prohibited from 1am to 6am.
If you do not comply with these measures you could be fined or face criminal charges. Fines range from £700 to £15,000.
Every town has been assigned a colour from red to green, which corresponds to the number of positive COVID-19 cases reported. For information about the specific restrictions in your location, refer to the Guatemalan government’s website.
You should familiarise yourself with the threat level in your area and keep up to date with any changes.
Public transport is operating, however, there are a number of restrictions on capacity and access can still be very limited. If you wish to travel to or from the airport you should hire a private taxi or driver.
When travelling in the country, follow the advice of the local authorities (PROATUR) and monitor local media. See Local travel.
