Hurricanes
The hurricane season in Belize normally runs from June to November. You should monitor local and international weather updates from the World Meteorological Organisation and the US National Hurricane Centre. For advice on what to do if you are caught up in a hurricane or tropical storm, see our tropical cyclones page.
Earthquakes
Belize does not suffer from earthquakes, but tremors from earthquakes in neighbouring countries can occasionally be felt in Belize. To learn more about what to do before, during and after an earthquake, see this advice from the US Federal Emergency Management Agency.
