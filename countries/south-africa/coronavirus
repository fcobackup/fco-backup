International travel
Flights between the UK and South Africa have largely returned to normal following the Coronavirus pandemic. Be aware that third countries may change their transit requirements at short notice. You should check with your airline to understand their requirements for travel during coronavirus.
PCR (polymerase chain reaction) COVID-19 tests are widely available from private medical facilities and some chemists in South Africa. If you need help finding a COVID-19 PCR test provider you should call The National Institute for Communicable Diseases helpline of (+27) 0800 029 999 for advice on possible testing facilities.
Entry and borders
You no longer need to present a PCR test or vaccine certificate on arrival in South Africa. However, other entry requirements still apply. See Entry requirements to find out what you will need to do before you arrive in South Africa.
Returning to the UK
Travelling from and returning to the UK
Check what you must do to travel abroad and return to England, Scotland, Wales or Northern Ireland.
If you plan to pass through another country to return to the UK, check the travel advice for the country you’re transiting.
Be prepared for your plans to change
No travel is risk-free during COVID. Countries may further restrict travel or bring in new rules at short notice, for example due to a new COVID-19 variant. Check with your travel company or airline for any transport changes which may delay your journey home.
Plan ahead and make sure you:
can access money
understand what your insurance will cover
can make arrangements to extend your stay and be away for longer than planned
If you think you have COVID-19 symptoms, you should contact your health insurer for advice. South Africa’s guidance on coronavirus can be found on their dedicated website. People who test positive and have symptoms are expected to self-isolate in their private accommodation. If you have tested positive for coronavirus and require assistance, please contact us on +27 12 421 7500 and follow the consular options.
Travel in South Africa
Internal flights and public transport are operating. You are no longer required to wear a face mask on public transport.
Accommodation
Hotels, guest houses and private rental accommodation are open. Some accommodation providers may still screen you for COVID-19 symptoms on arrival, but there is no legal obligation for them to do so. You should contact your accommodation provider for more information.
Public spaces and services
The South African authorities have relaxed rules designed to limit the spread of COVID-19. Masks are no longer a requirement in public spaces, and gatherings of any size are permitted.
Healthcare in South Africa
If you take regular medication, make sure you can access a repeat prescription if you need to. Most medicines that require a prescription from a doctor in the UK will require a script in South Africa (‘script’ is the widely used term in South Africa for ‘prescription’). If you need a prescription you can visit a local doctor. The doctor might prescribe on the basis of your visit, or they may ask you to obtain an electronic prescription from your medical practitioner in the UK. Pharmacies are readily available, with larger pharmacy groups Dis-Chem and Clicks having stores across the country. Some (but not all) of these stores have medical practitioners on site who can write prescriptions.
Most medical practitioners speak English, particularly in major cities and tourist areas. Visit our list of doctors.
If you think you have COVID-19 symptoms, you should contact your health insurer for advice. You can also consult the online advice. There is more information about what to expect if you test positive for COVID-19 under the Coronavirussection.
