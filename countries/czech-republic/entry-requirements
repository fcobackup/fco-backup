This page reflects the UK government’s understanding of current rules for people travelling on a full ‘British Citizen’ passport, for the most common types of travel.
The authorities in Czech Republic set and enforce entry rules. For further information contact their embassy, high commission or consulate. You may also check with your transport provider or travel company to make sure your passport and travel documents meet their requirements.
If you are travelling to the Czech Republic for work, read the guidance on visas and permits as the rules have changed since 1 January 2021.
Entry rules in response to coronavirus (COVID-19)
Entry to the Czech Republic
You are only allowed to enter the Czech Republic for essential reasons, such as for medical treatment or attending a funeral, or if you hold a residency permit issued by the Czech Republic or a permanent or long term residency permit issued by an EU+ country (EU plus Andorra, Iceland, Liechtenstein, Monaco, Norway, San Marino, Switzerland and Vatican City). If you are the spouse or long-term partner of a Czech or EU national, you may be able to enter the Czech Republic under certain conditions. Entry for tourism is not permitted. More information can be found on the website of the Ministry of Foreign Affairs. UK nationals resident in the Czech Republic who applied for a residence permit before 31 December 2020 but haven’t received the Certificate of Residence yet can request a “confirmation for entry” from the website of the Czech Ministry of Foreign Affairs.
Some flights between the UK and the Czech Republic have been cancelled. You should check with your airline operator before travelling.
If you have spent more than 12 hours in the UK during the previous 14 days, you must present a negative RT-PCR test result that has been taken in the UK no longer than 72 hours before departure. People who are resident in the Czech Republic can also present an antigen test which has been carried out no more than 48 hours prior to the start of travel. On arrival in the Czech Republic, you must self-isolate for at least 5 days, before undertaking a further RT-PCR test between 5-7 days after arrival, unless you are exempt (see below). A negative test result ends this period of self-isolation. If you test negative, you will need to wear a FFP2 standard facemask or higher when you are outdoors (available in Czech pharmacies and known in Czech as a “respirátor”) after ending self-isolation up until 14 days after arrival. You are also required to fill in a Passenger Locator Form and present it upon arrival. You should consult your airline operator before travelling.
Details on regulations in place for travellers, permitted reasons for entry, and more information on entry requirements, exemptions from testing and self-isolation after arrival for certain categories of people and local restrictions can be found on the website of the Czech Ministry of Interior.
You are allowed to transit the Czech Republic, but you need to present either a negative RT-PCR test result (no older than 72 hours before departure), or a negative antigen test result (no older than 48 hours before departure) upon entry.
If you are legally permitted to travel, check our advice for the country you are visiting and each country that you would transit.
You should not use the NHS testing service to get a test in order to facilitate your travel to another country. You should arrange to take a private test.
Regular entry requirements
The information on this part of the page covers the most common types of travel and reflects the UK government’s understanding of the rules currently in place. Unless otherwise stated, this information is for travellers using a full ‘British Citizen’ passport.
The authorities in the country or territory you’re travelling to are responsible for setting and enforcing the rules for entry. If you’re unclear about any aspect of the entry requirements, or you need further reassurance, you’ll need to contact the embassy, high commission or consulate of the country or territory you’re travelling to.
You should also consider checking with your transport provider or travel company to make sure your passport and other travel documents meet their requirements.
Visas
The rules for travelling or working in European countries changed on 1 January 2021:
you can travel to countries in the Schengen area for up to 90 days in any 180-day period without a visa. This applies if you travel as a tourist, to visit family or friends, to attend business meetings, cultural or sports events, or for short-term studies or training
if you are travelling to the Czech Republic and other Schengen countries without a visa, make sure your whole visit is within the 90-day limit. Visits to Schengen countries within the previous 180 days before you travel count towards your 90 days
to stay longer, to work or study, for business or for other reasons, you will need to meet the Czech government’s entry requirements. Check with the Embassy of the Czech Republic what type of visa and/or work permit you may need
if you stay in Czech Republic with a residence permit or long-stay visa, this does not count towards your 90-day visa-free limit
any time you spent in the Czech Republic or other Schengen countries before 1 January 2021 does not count towards your 90-day visa-free limit.
At Czech border control, you may need to use separate lanes from EU, EEA and Swiss citizens when queueing. Your passport may be stamped on entry and exit. You may also need to:
show a return or onward ticket
show you have enough money for your stay
There are separate requirements for those who are resident in the Czech Republic. If you are resident in the Czech Republic, you should carry proof of residence as well as your valid passport when you travel. For further information on these requirements, see our Living in the Czech Republic guide.
Passport validity
Check your passport is valid for travel before you book your trip, and renew your passport if you do not have enough time left on it.
Make sure your passport is:
valid for at least 3 months after the day you plan to leave the Czech Republic, or any other Schengen country
less than 10 years old
The 3 months you need when leaving a country must be within 10 years of the passport issue date.
If you renewed your current passport before the previous one expired, extra months may have been added to its expiry date. Any extra months on your passport over 10 years may not count towards the minimum 3 months needed.
UK Emergency Travel Documents
UK Emergency Travel Documents (ETDs) are accepted for entry, airside transit and exit from the Czech Republic.
