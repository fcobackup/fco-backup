The Foreign and Commonwealth Office (FCO) is advising British nationals against all non-essential international travel at this time. Existing advice for Jordan remains in place:
The FCO advise against all but essential travel to:
within 3km of Jordan’s border with Syria. See Border areas
Commercial flights in and out of Jordan are suspended and all land and sea borders are closed. Some commercial operators have been able, in exceptional cases, to negotiate flights out of Jordan. See Return to the UK
For guidance on how to stay safely in Jordan as a visitor if you are unable to return to the UK, see Staying during coronavirus
Around 95,800 British nationals visited Jordan in 2019. Most visits are trouble free.
Following the attack on the coalition base at Taji in Iraq on 11 March, and subsequent US strikes, tensions may be raised across the region. There is a possibility of an increased threat against Western interests, including against UK citizens. You should remain vigilant and keep up to date with the latest developments, including via the media and this travel advice.
The political situation in Jordan is stable. However, protests and demonstrations sometimes occur, and feelings are running higher because of the pandemic. The majority of demonstrations are peaceful, but you should take sensible precautions and avoid all political gatherings and demonstrations. Follow the advice of local authorities and stay informed of the security situation through the media and this travel advice.
Terrorists are very likely to try to carry out attacks in Jordan. There have been a number of incidents since 2016, some serious. Attacks could be indiscriminate including in places visited by foreigners, particularly hotels, shopping malls and tourist sites. You should take extra care, and in the event of an incident, follow the advice of the Jordanian authorities. See Terrorism
Local laws reflect the fact that Jordan is a predominantly Islamic country. You should respect local traditions, customs, laws and religions at all times and be aware of your actions to ensure that they don’t offend.
You can contact the emergency services by calling 911.
If you’re abroad and you need emergency help from the UK government, contact the nearest British embassy, consulate or high commission. Consular support is limited in the border areas of Jordan where the FCO advise against all but essential travel, as set out above.
Take out comprehensive travel and medical insurance before travelling.
