Crime
Trinidad
There is a high level of gang related violent crime in Trinidad, particularly in and around the city centre of Port of Spain, including Laventille, Morvant and Barataria. Crime tends to occur within local communities but can sometimes affect visitors.
Trinidad’s annual Carnival celebrations will take place on 24-25 February 2020. During the festival there are large gatherings of people at events across the island. The Trinidad & Tobago Ministry of Tourism and the police have enhanced security measures for tourists during Carnival. If you’re visiting Trinidad during Carnival or attending any events, you should remain vigilant and aware of your surroundings. Incidents of petty theft, street crime and other opportunistic crime do occur.
You should maintain at least the same level of security awareness as you would in the UK. The motive for most attacks on tourists is robbery. Don’t walk alone in deserted areas, even in daylight, and try to avoid travel beyond major populated areas late at night and before dawn. Don’t carry large amounts of cash or wear eye-catching jewellery. Take care when withdrawing money from ATMs.
Theft from vehicles and property occurs in parts of downtown Port of Spain and other towns/cities. Make sure your accommodation is secure and use a hotel safe to store valuables, money and passports. Take particular care when driving, especially at night, and take local advice to avoid straying into areas affected by gang violence. Always drive with windows closed and doors locked. Crimes including rape, assault, robbery and theft have taken place in private cars and maxi taxis.
There have been incidents of violence and fatal accidents caused by drunk driving to and from the airport, particularly on the Beetham/Churchill Roosevelt Highway.
Tobago
Most visits to Tobago are trouble free and incidents of violent crime are rare. However, there have been recent incidents involving tourists (including British nationals) being robbed and raped.
You should maintain at least the same level of security awareness as you would in the UK and make sure your living accommodation is secure. Don’t carry large amounts of cash or wear eye-catching jewellery. Use a hotel safe to store valuables, money and passports. Petty theft from cars is common.
Villas, particularly those in isolated areas, should have adequate security, including external security lighting, grilles and overnight security guards.
Don’t walk alone in deserted areas including beaches even in daylight. Consult your tour operator if in doubt.
Be vigilant at all times and carry a mobile phone with roaming capability for use in emergency.
Road travel
You can drive in Trinidad and Tobago with a valid UK driving licence for up to 90 days. If you’re staying longer/living in Trinidad and Tobago, you will need to get a local Driver’s Permit from the Trinidad and Tobago Licensing Division. You can check the Living in Trinidad and Tobago guide for information on licence requirements for residents.
Take care when driving and observe speed limits. Some roads are narrow and winding, and the surface is of a low standard. Pedestrians often walk on the roads and indicators are not always used.
Take extra care when driving at night as some roads are unlit. Road signs and hazards may not be easily visible.
The standard of driving in Trinidad and Tobago is mixed. High speed road accidents on the main highways in Trinidad often result in fatalities.
Use hotel or pre-booked taxis and drivers who work with set fares. Private taxis in Trinidad and Tobago are unmetered and unmarked but can be identified by vehicle registration plates beginning with ‘H’. They can take the form of either a private car or ‘maxi taxi’ minibus. Some vehicles with ‘P’ registration plates offer informal taxi services illegally.
If you don’t have a vehicle, use hotel taxis to get around, particularly after dark.
Air travel
Safety concerns have been raised about INSEL Air. The US and Netherlands authorities have prohibited their staff from using the airline while safety checks are being carried out. UK government officials have been told to do the same as a precaution.
