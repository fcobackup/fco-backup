Check what you must do to travel abroad and return to England, Scotland, Wales or Northern Ireland.
If you plan to pass through another country to return to the UK, check the travel advice for the country you’re transiting.
Be prepared for your plans to change
No travel is risk-free during COVID. Countries may further restrict travel or bring in new rules at short notice, for example due to a new COVID-19 variant. Check with your travel company or airline for any transport changes which may delay your journey home.
If you test positive for COVID-19, you may need to stay where you are until you test negative. You may also need to seek treatment there.
Plan ahead and make sure you:
can access money
understand what your insurance will cover
can make arrangements to extend your stay and be away for longer than planned
Travel in Cyprus
For fully vaccinated people, the use of crossing points to travel between the Republic and the north is no longer subject to a PCR or Rapid Antigen test.
For those vaccinated with AstraZeneca, Moderna or Pfizer-BioNTech vaccines, validity applies from 14 days after the 2nd dose until 7 months after the administration of the last dose of the primary vaccination – thereafter, proof of having had a booster shot will be necessary to extend validity.
For people fully vaccinated with Sinovac, Sinopharm, Sputnik and Johnson&Johnson vaccines, these are accepted from 14 days after the 2nd dose (or 1st /single dose in the case of Johnson&Johnson) with a vaccine validity period of 3 months from the administration of the last dose of the primary vaccination – thereafter, proof of having had a booster shot will be necessary to extend validity.
Unvaccinated persons, 12 years old and above, and vaccinated persons who have not received a booster dose and whose vaccine validity period has ended will need to present a negative PCR test result taken within 72 hours of crossing or a negative Rapid Antigen test result taken within 48 hours of crossing.
Public spaces and services
The use of a face mask is compulsory in all indoor public spaces for everyone aged 6 and above. Failure to comply with restrictions may result in a €300 fine.
People aged 6 and above require a SafePass to enter venues including malls, catering establishments, some sports facilities etc. See further information on the SafePass regulations and requirements.
You can get a SafePass if you can provide proof of either:
being fully vaccinated (including a booster dose); or
being vaccinated with two doses of the AstraZeneca, Moderna or Pfizer vaccines or with one dose of the Jansen vaccine, provided that your last dose was administered less than seven months ago; or
being vaccinated with the first dose of a COVID vaccine and hold a negative PCR test result not older than 72hrs or a negative rapid test result not older than 48hrs; or
having contracted COVID-19 in the past 6 months.
Cyprus will accept the UK’s proof of COVID-19 vaccination record and proof of COVID-19 vaccination issued in the Crown Dependencies. If you are travelling with a printed PDF proof of vaccination status, it must date from 1 November 2021 to ensure that the certificate can be scanned successfully. Your NHS appointment card from vaccination centres is not designed to be used as proof of vaccination and should not be used to demonstrate your vaccine status.
You can find full details of the latest measures introduced by the Cypriot authorities on this information page and more generally, including on SafePass/CoronaPass, on the Press & Information Office website.
North of Cyprus
Face masks must be worn in indoor spaces at all times. An AdaPass is required to enter most venues. Additional information under Entry to Cyprus.
Healthcare in Cyprus
See the Cypriot Ministry of Health website for information on coronavirus from the Cypriot authorities. If you develop fever and/or respiratory symptoms such as shortness of breath or cough, the Cyprus Government advise that you stay indoors and immediately contact the Ministry of Health’s public health line on 1420 from a Cypriot line.
What to do if you test positive for coronavirus
If you test positive for coronavirus while in Cyprus you must self-isolate for 7 days from the onset of symptoms or, if you are asymptomatic, from the day of the testing.
If you are unable to self-isolate in your current accommodation, the Cypriot authorities will ask you and your close contacts to move to a quarantine hotel. The cost of quarantine hotel accommodation in this situation is covered by the Cypriot government.
You may also be instructed to self-isolate by the test and trace service if you are identified as a close contact of someone who has tested positive for coronavirus.
Further guidance, including for people who have been in close contact with someone who has tested positive for coronavirus, is available at the Press and Public Information Office website.
The Deputy Ministry of Tourism has also set up a dedicated email address to assist travellers with questions; contact travel2021@visitcyprus.com. You can also submit queries via Facebook Messenger.
You can find a list of English speaking doctors online.

Quarantine hotels
If you test positive for COVID-19 in the Republic of Cyprus you may have to enter a quarantine hotel. The cost will be covered by the Cypriot authorities. In the north of Cyprus authority-designated accommodation is at your own expense. You can also use the Güvende Kal application to request an electronic bracelet for quarantining at home. The UK government will not cover mandatory quarantine costs for British nationals. See Demonstrating your COVID-19 status
EHIC or GHIC cards cannot be used to cover any additional expenses you incur whilst staying in a quarantine hotel. Make sure you have access to funds to cover the costs or take out insurance, checking the policy has adequate cover.
If you have or are entitled to an EHIC or GHIC and you need medical treatment while staying at a quarantine hotel, the UK government will fund treatment as usual through the EHIC/GHIC scheme.
Find out more from the NHS website about EHIC and GHIC healthcare cover abroad.
COVID-19 vaccines if you live in Cyprus
Wherever possible British nationals should aim to be vaccinated in the country where they live. We will update this page when the Government of Cyprus announces new information on the national vaccination programme. You can sign up to get email notifications when this page is updated.
The Cyprus national vaccination programme started in December 2020 and is using the AstraZeneca, Moderna, and Johnson & Johnson vaccines. British nationals resident in Cyprus are eligible for vaccination.
UK nationals registered with the General Healthcare System (GeSY) can use the online portal to request a vaccination. UK Nationals who are not GeSY registered, but are legal residents can apply for a vaccination through a dedicated form. In the north of Cyprus a vaccination programme, starting with those most vulnerable, is being rolled out. UK Nationals resident in the north should contact their local health care provider for further information.
Find out more, including about vaccines that are authorised in the UK or approved by the World Health Organisation, on the COVID-19 vaccines if you live abroad.
If you’re a British national living in Cyprus, you should seek medical advice from your local healthcare provider. Information about COVID-19 vaccines used in the national programme where you live, including regulatory status, should be available from local authorities.
If you receive your COVID-19 vaccination in Cyprus, you can get an EU Digital COVID Certificate from the national authorities. The Certificate proves that you have been vaccinated against COVID-19, received a negative test result, or recovered from COVID-19. It will help facilitate your travel within the EU and, in some countries, you can use it to demonstrate your COVID-19 status to businesses and other organisations. For further information visit the European Commission’s EU Digital COVID Certificate page.
