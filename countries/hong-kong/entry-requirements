This page has information on travelling to Hong Kong.
This page reflects the UK government’s understanding of current rules for people travelling on a full ‘British Citizen’ passport from the UK, for the most common types of travel.
The authorities in Hong Kong set and enforce entry rules. If you’re unsure how Hong Kong’s entry requirements apply to you, contact its UK embassy, high commission or consulate.
All travellers
Although Hong Kong is now part of the People’s Republic of China, it remains a Special Administrative Region (SAR) with its own immigration controls. You can visit Hong Kong for up to 6 months without a visa. However, during the COVID-19 pandemic, different entry requirements are being applied in Hong Kong. For up-to-date advice on entry requirements and restrictions, please visit the Hong Kong SAR Government’s website.
Hong Kong residents and vaccinated non-Hong Kong residents who have visited the UK are permitted to enter Hong Kong.
Inbound travellers who have visited the UK or other overseas destinations within the past 7 days are subject to two PCR tests and daily rapid antigen tests are required until day 5 following arrival.
Travellers departing for Hong Kong will need to provide a negative rapid antigen test result for COVID-19, taken no more than 24 hours prior to their departure. They will need to submit in advance an online Health & Quarantine Information Declaration confirming their rapid test result and vaccination record where relevant and present a declaration QR code generated during check-in.
Further details can be found on the Hong Kong SAR Government’s website.
Flights may be subject to scheduling change at short notice. Ensure you keep in close contact with your airline and be prepared to change your plans
Testing on arrival
All travellers ending their journey at Hong Kong International Airport, apart from children under three, will have to undergo a PCR test for coronavirus but do not need to remain at the airport awaiting their test results. Further information is available on the Centre for Health Protection’s website.
If you test negative, you will be issued a QR code under the Vaccine Pass Scheme that allows you to enter a range of venues, including restaurants and bars.
If you test positive, you will be required to self-isolate for a minimum of 5 days. You may be able to stay at your original accommodation or hotel. If your hotel does not allow on-site isolation then you will be required to move to a designated isolation hotel. The Hong Kong authorities may also arrange for admission to a public hospital or a government isolation facility. Travellers may be expected to cover the cost of self-isolation. The decision on whether to send an individual to these facilities is based on their health condition, living arrangements and other risk factors.
If you are deemed to be a contact of a positive case, you may be placed in a Hong Kong Government quarantine centre or hotel for a minimum of 5 days if your current living environment is unsuitable.
You may be separated from your child if one of you tests positive for coronavirus. If this happens to you, you can call +(852) 2901 3000 for 24/7 urgent consular assistance.
Proof of vaccination status
Fully vaccinated travellers are permitted to enter Hong Kong.
Hong Kong will accept the UK’s proof of COVID-19 recovery and vaccination record and proof of COVID-19 vaccination issued in the Crown Dependencies. Your last vaccine dose must have been administered at least 14 days prior to travel. Your NHS appointment card from vaccination centres is not designed to be used as proof of vaccination and should not be used to demonstrate your vaccine status. Children under the age of 12 who are not vaccinated will be allowed to enter Hong Kong.
Travel between Hong Kong, Macao and mainland China
All border crossings with mainland China remain closed indefinitely, with the exception of the Shenzhen Bay Checkpoint and the Hong Kong-Zhuhai-Macao Bridge. All passengers wanting to board a shuttle bus to cross the bridge departing from Hong Kong to Macao must present a certificate confirming that they have tested negative for COVID-19 within 72 hours of their departure. The special ferry service between Taipa Ferry Terminal in Macao and Hong Kong International Airport has now ceased operations. All ferry crossings between Hong Kong and mainland China are currently not in operation with the exception of the service from Shenzhen Shekou Port to Hong Kong International Airport. Kai Tak Cruise and Ocean Terminals are also closed to passengers indefinitely.
Hong Kong residents in mainland China are eligible for the Return2hk scheme, which enables quarantine free travel from mainland China to Hong Kong. Non-residents in mainland China and Macao are eligible for the Come2hk scheme, which offers similar exemptions to entry requirements. You can find further information on the Hong Kong SAR government coronavirus website.
If you’re not fully vaccinated
Hong Kong residents who are not fully vaccinated will be able to enter Hong Kong. Non-residents who are not fully vaccinated and have visited places outside mainland China, Macao or Taiwan within the past 7 days, will be denied entry into Hong Kong.
If you are unable to be fully vaccinated due to medical reasons, you may still be permitted entry to Hong Kong. You will be required to show proof of the relevant medical reason certified by a medical practitioner before boarding a flight to Hong Kong.
Children under the age of 12 who are not vaccinated will be allowed to enter.
If you’ve had COVID-19 in the past year
If you have previously infected with COVID-19 and have received one dose of COVID-19 vaccine, you will be considered fully vaccinated.
After recovering from Covid-19 you may continue to test positive for some time after, however, you may still enter Hong Kong if you can provide evidence of a negative rapid antigen test taken within 24 hours of your scheduled departure time.
Should you test positive on the PCR test required on arrival in Hong Kong, the Department for Health will take recovery certificates into account when deciding on the location and duration of the quarantine order you are issued.
As with all cases of a positive test on arrival in Hong Kong, there is a risk that you will be placed in a hospital for a minimum of 5 days.
Children and young people
More information and detailed guidelines for International Arrivals are available on the Hong Kong SAR Government Coronavirus web page.
Hong Kong residents of any age are permitted to enter Hong Kong, whether they are vaccinated or not.
For non-Hong Kong residents, there are different vaccination and testing requirements depending on the age group. For non-Hong Kong residents:
12-17 years old travellers need to show proof of vaccination to enter Hong Kong. If they have received a BioNTech vaccination, a single dose will be accepted. Those who are not able to get fully vaccinated due to medical reasons may still be permitted entry to Hong Kong. They will be required to show proof of the relevant medical reason certified by a medical practitioner before boarding a flight to Hong Kong.
Children aged 3-11 are permitted to enter Hong Kong, even if they are not vaccinated. However, they are subject to all the same testing requirements as other travellers.
Children under the age of 3 are permitted to enter Hong Kong unvaccinated and are exempt from the testing requirements.
People of any age who test positive for COVID-19, including children, may be isolated in government facilities for a minimum of 5 days. The decision on whether to send an individual to an isolation facility is based on their health condition, living arrangements and other risk factors. Non-residents may be charged for their care.
You may be separated from your child if one of you tests positive for coronavirus. If a child has serious symptoms and is hospitalised in an ICU or paediatric ward, parents may not be allowed to see or visit their child for the duration. If this happens to you, you can call +(852) 2901 3000 for 24/7 urgent consular assistance.
If you’re transiting through Hong Kong
Transit services at Hong Kong International Airport resumed on 1 April.
Transiting through Hong Kong from, but not to, mainland China is now allowed.
Transit passengers travelling through Hong Kong International Airport must have an onward flight booked, which departs within 24 hours of their scheduled time of arrival in Hong Kong.
Transit passengers travelling through Hong Kong International Airport will no longer be required to provide evidence of a pre-departure PCR test before boarding their flight to Hong Kong. If in doubt, you should check with your travel agent or airline before travelling and check the Hong Kong International Airport website.
There is a risk when transiting that you will be placed into isolation in hospital in Hong Kong. All passengers transiting Hong Kong Inter-national Airport will be subject to advanced screening measures, including temperature checks. Passengers deemed to have a high temperature will undergo further checks by the Port Health Office at the airport. If you meet further risk criteria, you will be transferred to a Hong Kong public hospital for mandatory checks/treatment, where it is highly likely you will be asked to complete a mandatory COVID-19 test. If you successfully pass health screening you need to sit in designated areas at boarding gates and use designated queues in dining facilities and shops, in line with Hong Kong International Airport anti-virus measures.
