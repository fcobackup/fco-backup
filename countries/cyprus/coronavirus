Travel in Cyprus
Following policy changes announced by the Republic of Cyprus Government and the administration in the north, all crossing points between the Republic and the north are effectively closed to travellers.
Public spaces and services
The use of a face mask is compulsory in all indoor and outdoor public spaces. The Cypriot authorities have announced additional measures for the districts of Limassol and Pafos from 8pm on 12 November until at least 30 November. This includes a ban on travelling to/from and between the two districts, except for permitted, exceptional reasons.
A night-time curfew is in place in the districts of Limassol and Pafos, between 8pm to 5am. In other parts of the Republic of Cyprus the curfew is in place between 11pm to 5am. Failure to comply with these restrictions may result in a €300 fine.
