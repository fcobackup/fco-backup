According to Belgian law, you must have some form of identification with you at all times.
Possession of drugs and trafficking in drugs are serious offences.
It’s illegal to wear in public places (parks, buildings, public transport, on the street etc) clothing that hides a person’s face largely or completely. People wearing such clothing (eg the burka and nikab) risk a fine of up to €137.50 and/or detention for up to 7 days. There’s no exemption for tourists.
