At least 8 weeks before your trip, check the latest country-specific health advice from the National Travel Health Network and Centre (NaTHNaC) on the TravelHealthPro website. Each country-specific page has information on vaccine recommendations, any current health risks or outbreaks, and factsheets with information on staying healthy abroad. Guidance is also available from NHS (Scotland) on the FitForTravel website.
General information on travel vaccinations and a travel health checklist is available on the NHS website. You may then wish to contact your health adviser or pharmacy for advice on other preventive measures and managing any pre-existing medical conditions while you’re abroad.
The legal status and regulation of some medicines prescribed or purchased in the UK can be different in other countries. If you’re travelling with prescription or over-the-counter medicine, read this guidance from NaTHNaC on best practice when travelling with medicines. For further information on the legal status of a specific medicine, you’ll need to contact the embassy, high commission or consulate of the country or territory you’re travelling to.
While travel can be enjoyable, it can sometimes be challenging. There are clear links between mental and physical health, so looking after yourself during travel and when abroad is important. Information on travelling with mental health conditions is available in our guidance page. Further information is also available from the National Travel Health Network and Centre (NaTHNaC).
Coronavirus
The Foreign and Commonwealth Office (FCO) advise against all but essential travel to Italy, due to the ongoing coronavirus (COVID-19) pandemic and in line with various controls and restrictions imposed by the Italian authorities. British nationals in Italy should follow the advice of the Italian authorities.
The majority of carriers have now ceased operating direct flights between Italy and the UK. Alitalia continue to operate flights on a reduced basis. Other airlines have indicated that they will assist British tourists in Italy who have booked travel with them to return to the UK, which may require travel via other countries. Travellers should therefore contact their airlines as soon as possible.
Only one airport per region will remain open. Rome Ciampino closed for commercial flights on 13 March. Terminal 1 (only) of Rome Fiumicino airport will close on 17 March. Other airports, including Milan Linate, are due to close in the coming days.
Train companies are reducing services, for both domestic and international travel. Some cross-border bus companies are also cancelling their services. Ports remain open although we understand that passengers on cruise ships will not be allowed to disembark for tourism purposes. Passenger ferry schedules remain subject to change and cancellations. Several neighbouring countries have imposed restrictions on people entering from Italy. Please consult travel advice for the country concerned.
All shops are closed apart from pharmacies and shops selling food and other basic necessities. Essential public services, transport, utilities, banks and postal services will remain active. All public gatherings, including religious ceremonies, funerals and sporting events remain suspended. Restaurants, bars, museums, cultural institutions, childcare facilities, schools and universities are closed, as are ski resorts.
You can find more information on measures on the Ministry of Health website (in Italian) and Frequently Asked Questions on the Ministry of Foreign Affairs website (in English).
Call Italy’s 112 emergency number if you believe you have symptoms. English speaking operators are available.
Further information on coronavirus, including advice on preparing for foreign travel and helping reduce the spread of the virus, is available on the TravelHealthPro website.
You can find more information about cases in Italy on the Italian Civil Protection website.
Healthcare
The rules on access to healthcare will stay the same until 31 December 2020.
You should get a free European Health Insurance Card (EHIC) before leaving the UK. After 31 December 2020, your UK-issued EHIC might not be valid.
The EHIC entitles you to state provided medical treatment that may become necessary during your trip. Any treatment provided is on the same terms as Italian nationals. If you don’t have your EHIC with you or you’ve lost it, you can call the Department of Health Overseas Healthcare Team (+44 191 218 1999) to get a Provisional Replacement Certificate.
It is important to take out comprehensive travel insurance that includes cover for emergency medical treatment and associated costs. The existing EHIC arrangements are not an alternative to travel insurance, as some health-related costs, including for medical repatriation, ongoing medical treatment and non-urgent treatment, are not covered. Read more about what your travel insurance should cover.
If you’re living in Italy, you can also find more information on healthcare for residents in our Living In Italy guide.
If you need emergency medical assistance during your trip, dial 118 and ask for an ambulance. If you are referred to a medical facility for treatment you should contact your insurance/medical assistance company immediately.
