Don’t get involved with illegal drugs of any kind. Colombian drug trafficking detection methods are sophisticated and anyone attempting to traffic drugs should expect to be arrested. Conviction leads to severe penalties. British nationals have been arrested for trying to smuggle cocaine out of the country. Pack your own luggage, and don’t carry items for other people.
Carry a colour photocopy of the data page and Colombian visa from your passport at all times for identification.
Homosexuality is legal but not widely accepted, especially in rural areas. See our information and advice page for the LGBT community before you travel.
Photographing of military or strategic government sites is not allowed.
It is a serious criminal offence to have sex with a minor (under 18 years old).
