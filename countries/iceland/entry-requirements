The information on this page covers the most common types of travel and reflects the UK government’s understanding of the rules currently in place. Unless otherwise stated, this information is for travellers using a full ‘British Citizen’ passport.
The authorities in the country or territory you’re travelling to are responsible for setting and enforcing the rules for entry. If you’re unclear about any aspect of the entry requirements, or you need further reassurance, you’ll need to contact the embassy, high commission or consulate of the country or territory you’re travelling to.
You should also consider checking with your transport provider or travel company to make sure your passport and other travel documents meet their requirements.
Entry rules in response to coronavirus (COVID-19)
Entry to Iceland
All passengers arriving by commercial flights in Iceland can chose to be tested for COVID-19 or self-isolate for 14 days upon arrival. The test fee is ISK 11,000 or ISK 9,000 if booked in advance. Children born in 2005 or later will be exempt from both testing and self-isolation.
Until 18 August, if you are normally resident in Iceland or plan to stay for 10 days or more, you must take special precautions for 5 days upon returning to Iceland and be tested for a second time, four to five days after arrival, even if you test negative on arrival.
From Wednesday 19 August, all people travelling to Iceland opting to test instead of the 14 day quarantine must be tested for a second time four to five days after arrival and now follow quarantine measures until the result of the second test is known. This will significantly affect what you can and cannot do on arrival. If you have booked a trip to Iceland you should contact your tour operator and travel insurer about what this means for you and your plans.
You must also fill in a pre-registration form before departure. You can find further information, including exemptions, and a video walk through of the process from the Icelandic authorities at Covid.is (available in English).
Data collection
Upon arrival you will be encouraged to sign up to the contract tracing app Rakning C-19. Further information, including how to download it, data usage, privacy and scope is available on the Rakning C-19 website.
Testing / screening on arrival
If you test positive on arrival you will be required to enter self-isolation (at your hotel or government-provided accommodation) unless further tests determine the infection is inactive.
You may also need to be tested again or enter self-isolation if you are exposed to a possible infection during your trip eg during the flight to Iceland.
Regular entry requirements
Visas
If you hold a British Citizen passport, you don’t need a visa to enter Iceland. If you’re planning to stay longer than 3 months, see our Living in Iceland guide and contact the Icelandic Directorate of Immigration, Útlendingastofnun, Skogarhlid 6, 105 Reykjavík (tel: 510-5400) if you have further questions.
The rules on travel will stay the same until 31 December 2020.
Passport validity
Your passport should be valid for the proposed duration of your stay; you do not need any additional period of validity on your passport beyond this.
The rules on travel will stay the same until 31 December 2020.
UK Emergency Travel Documents
UK Emergency Travel Documents are accepted for entry, airside transit and exit from Iceland.
