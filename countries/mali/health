Warning
FCDO advises against all travel to parts of Mali.

Before you travel check that:
your destination can provide the healthcare you may need
you have appropriate travel insurance for local treatment or unexpected medical evacuation
This is particularly important if you have a health condition or are pregnant.
Emergency medical number
The emergency number is 15 but emergency response capacity is very limited. Take local advice and arrange your own transport to a medical centre or hospital.   
Contact your insurance company quickly if you’re referred to a medical facility for treatment.
Vaccine recommendations and health risks
At least 8 weeks before your trip:
check the latest vaccine recommendations for Mali
see where to get vaccines and whether you have to pay on the NHS travel vaccinations page

You should drink only boiled or bottled water, and avoid ice in drinks.
