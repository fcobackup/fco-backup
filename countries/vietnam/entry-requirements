This page has information on travelling to Vietnam. Check what you must do to return to the UK.
This page reflects the UK government’s understanding of current rules for people travelling on a full ‘British Citizen’ passport from the UK, for the most common types of travel.
The authorities in Vietnam set and enforce entry rules.
All travellers
Vietnam has suspended visa waivers, issuing of visas, and the entry into Vietnam for most foreign nationals, regardless of vaccination status. There are a very small number of exceptions for diplomats on official business and certain high-skilled workers and for foreigners and overseas visitors holding valid permanent or temporary residence cards, visas and visa exemption certificates. These people do not need to obtain prior approval from ministries and local authorities before entering.
Those wishing to enter for tourism may only do so by joining one of the tour groups operating tours to destinations approved by the Ministry of Culture, Sports & Tourism.
All other visitors wishing to enter will be processed on a case-by-case basis. Such applications are required to be led by Vietnamese employers who must work directly through individual provincial government offices. The requirements and process may differ from province to province.
If you are permitted to travel to Vietnam, you must follow the testing and quarantine requirements outlined below.
If you’re fully vaccinated
If you are permitted to enter Vietnam (see further information above) and are fully vaccinated (at least two doses of a vaccine recognised and approved by Vietnam) you must comply with the following testing and quarantine requirements. At least 14 days must have passed since your second dose of the vaccine.
Vietnam recognises the following vaccinations AstraZeneca, Pfizer-BioNTech, Moderna, Janssen (Johnson & Johnson), Sinopharm, Sputnik V, Hayat-Vax and Abdala.
If you are travelling with someone who is not fully vaccinated such as a child, then you must follow the requirements for someone who is not fully vaccinated, even if you are fully vaccinated yourself.
When arriving in Vietnam you must have completed an online passenger entry declaration form (available with an English option). You will need to take a screenshot or print out the QR Code as you’ll need this on entry into Vietnam and may require it at transit points.
You will also need to provide evidence of a negative COVID-19 PCR test taken up to 72 hours before arrival. Some airlines are also instructing passengers to have a rapid (e.g. lateral flow) test within 24 hours of their flight. See information on getting a test before entry.
When entering Vietnam you must quarantine in either a designated hotel or a preapproved residence for 3 days. You will need to take a PCR test on day 3 and self-monitor up to day 14. You will be responsible for paying any hotel charges and for coronavirus testing costs.
Vietnam’s quarantine requirements are mandated by the Vietnamese Ministry of Health. The British Embassy and Consulate General are unable to intervene in having these requirements waived, shortened or changed or to assist in the booking of designated hotels or residence approvals process. Violations carry strict penalties. Once you have completed your quarantine you should receive a document specifying this, which you should keep.
Proof of vaccination status
For those who have permission to travel, Vietnam will accept the UK’s vaccination record and proof of COVID-19 vaccination issued in the Crown Dependencies. Your final vaccine dose must have been administered more than 14 days prior to travel, and no more than 12 months from the day of entry. Your NHS appointment card from vaccination centres is not designed to be used as proof of vaccination and should not be used to demonstrate your vaccine status.
If you’re not fully vaccinated
If you are permitted to enter Vietnam (see further information above) and are not fully vaccinated, or if you are travelling with someone who is not fully vaccinated, even if you are vaccinated yourself, you must comply with the following testing and quarantine requirements.
When arriving in Vietnam you must have completed an online passenger entry declaration form (available with an English option. You will need to take a screenshot or print out the QR Code as you’ll need this on entry into Vietnam and may require it at transit points.

When entering Vietnam you must quarantine in either a designated hotel or a preapproved residence for 7 days. You will need to take a PCR test on days 3 and 7 and self-monitor up to day 14. You will be responsible for paying any hotel charges and for coronavirus testing costs.

If you’re transiting through Vietnam
Currently transiting through Vietnam is not allowed.
Exemptions
Vietnam has suspended visa waivers, issuing of visas, and the entry into Vietnam for all foreign nationals. There are a very small number of exceptions for diplomats on official business and certain high-skilled workers and for foreigners and overseas visitors holding valid permanent or temporary residence cards, visas and visa exemption certificates. These people do not need to obtain prior approval from ministries and local authorities before entering.
All other visitors wishing to enter will be processed on a case-by-case basis. Such applications are required to be led by Vietnamese employers who must work directly through individual provincial government offices. The requirements and process may differ from province to province.
Visas
If you want to stay in Vietnam, you should only do so legally and with the right visa and permission to stay. Immigration offices may close or travel to them may not be possible due to local COVID-19 measures. You should check before travelling whether the immigration offices where you are remain open and working normally.
Those needing to renew their visas can do so by completing the support request form at https://xuatnhapcanh.gov.vn/ or by telephoning the following number: 0283 920 0365 (ideally with the help of a Vietnamese speaker).
Following the resumption of some commercial international commercial flights, from 15 January 2022 those who entered Vietnam on visa waivers, e-visas or tourist visas from 1 March 2020 will no longer be entitled to an automatic visa extension.
If you now plan to leave Vietnam permanently and entered before 1 March 2020 without undergoing mandatory quarantine or treatment for COVID-19, you should contact your local immigration office in order to apply for your exit visa and pay any overstay fees. Going to the airport without an exit visa will result in you being denied boarding for your flight.
Vietnamese visit visas are issued to foreign nationals for a limited duration and on the basis that visitors must leave on or before the date of expiry. Those who come to Vietnam to work are required to apply for a work visa / permit. You should check the visa validity and conditions carefully. Overstaying your Vietnamese visit visa or working illegally is a serious matter and you may be delayed from travel until a fine is paid, deported and may be prevented from visiting Vietnam in the future.
The Embassy and Consulate General will not be able to assist with individual visit visa extensions should you wish to stay in Vietnam, nor sponsor individual applications or sign NA5 forms (which has the same effect) as this involves legal and financial obligations. For those with a valid work visa or resident cards, you can extend these at immigration offices with the assistance and support of your family or employer.
Check your passport and travel documents before you travel
Passport validity
If you are visiting Vietnam, your passport should be valid for 6 months from the date you arrive.
A number of British nationals have been refused entry and exit due to their passport being damaged. Make sure your passport is in good condition before arriving in Vietnam. Being refused entry can result in significant cost and a long stay at the airport.
Check with your travel provider to make sure your passport and other travel documents meet their requirements.
Yellow fever certificate requirements
Check whether you need a yellow fever certificate by visiting the National Travel Health Network and Centre’s TravelHealthPro website.
UK Emergency Travel Documents
UK Emergency Travel Documents are accepted for entry, airside transit and exit from Vietnam. Please contact the nearest Vietnamese Embassy to obtain an appropriate visa before travel. If your ETD has been issued in Vietnam, to replace a lost/stolen passport, you will need an exit visa from the Vietnam Immigration Department before you can travel out of Vietnam. This process normally takes 5 working days. Contact the Immigration Department directly for further information.
Returning to the UK
There is no requirement for testing on departure. Anyone who has tested positive previously may be asked to show their negative test results and release certificates and some airlines may require a negative test certificate to board. If you are transiting through a third country you may also require evidence of a negative test.
