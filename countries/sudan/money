Cash withdrawals from non-Sudanese credit and debit cards at banks or from the majority of ATMs are not possible.
There are also extremely limited options for using foreign credit or debit cards; most businesses do not offer this facility.
You should plan on the basis that credit or debit card transactions may not be possible. Make sure you have enough cash in hard currency with you.
You may be able to exchange US dollars dated 2006 onwards (older ones will not be exchanged), but this will be difficult due to the current conflict. Pounds sterling are rarely exchanged. You should only change money through banks or official bureaux de exchange (e.g. in hotels). Donâ€™t change any money on the street.
