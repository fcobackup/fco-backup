Earthquakes
Fiji is in an earthquake zone and suffers from tremors from time to time. These can trigger tsunami alerts. Make sure you understand local safety procedures in the event of an earthquake or tsunami. To learn more about what to do before, during and after an earthquake, visit the website of the US Federal Emergency Management Agency.
Tropical cyclones
The tropical cyclone season in Fiji normally runs from November to April, but cyclones can occur throughout the year. During this period there is a greater risk of strong winds, heavy rains, flooding, landslides and road closures.
Severe weather may result in flooding, landslides, and disruption to essential services and infrastructure. Monitor approaching storms and follow the advice of local authorities, including any evacuation orders.
Weather updates can also be found in local newspapers and on Radio Fiji 2 on 105 FM. See our Tropical Cyclones page for further advice about what to do if you’re caught up in a storm.
