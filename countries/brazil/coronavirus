International travel
There are currently no restrictions on commercial flights entering Brazil from the UK. Check with your travel provider for the latest information on available routings and flight options. From 8 June 2021, direct flights can arrive in England from Brazil but they must arrive at dedicated terminals at Heathrow and Birmingham airports. Different requirements may apply for arrivals into Scotland, Wales and Northern Ireland.
Entry and borders
See Entry requirements to find out what you will need to do when you arrive in Brazil.
Returning to the UK
Brazil is on the red list for entering England. From 4am on Monday 11 October, Brazil will no longer be on the red list for entering England. Check what you must do to travel abroad and return to England, Scotland, Wales or Northern Ireland.
You are responsible for organising your own COVID-19 test, in line with UK government testing requirements. The Brazilian government has stated that the public health system should not be used for pre-departure tests. Travellers should obtain a test from a private provider.
Be prepared for your plans to change
No travel is risk-free during COVID. Countries may further restrict travel or bring in new rules at short notice, for example due to a new COVID-19 variant. Check with your travel company or airline for any transport changes which may delay your journey home.
If you test positive for COVID-19, you may need to stay where you are until you test negative. You may also need to seek treatment there.
Plan ahead and make sure you:
can access money
understand what your insurance will cover
can make arrangements to extend your stay and be away for longer than planned
Travel in Brazil
Restrictions vary from city to city. The use of face masks in streets, public spaces such as parks, and on public transport including taxis is mandatory across the country. There are additional local requirements for the compulsory use of masks in other places, such as shops and gyms, in various cities including São Paulo, Rio de Janeiro, Belo Horizonte and Brasília. Social isolation measures have been lifted to an extent in some parts of the country, but localised lockdowns continue to varying degrees. You should refer to official guidance in your location for details of what preventative measures are in place and how you can comply with them. Failing to comply with these rules may result in a fine.
Accommodation
Some accommodation options are open such as hotels, hostels and private rentals but this varies area by area. Some popular beach areas remain closed to non-residents. Check with your accommodation provider what facilities, including restaurants, are available.
Public spaces and services
The situation varies around Brazil, each state will determine local measures to limit the spread of COVID-19, and this includes regulation on the opening of non-essential services (shops, restaurants, bars, beaches and other leisure activities). You should refer to official guidance in your location for details of what preventative measures are in place and how you can comply with them. It’s highly possible that public places likely to attract large crowds may be closed at short notice.
Healthcare in Brazil
If you think you have COVID-19 symptoms, you should self isolate for 14 days. You should only go to hospital if you are feeling breathless.
The public healthcare system varies across the country, and in some states in Brazil the additional burden of treating Covid-19 patients might affect services such as accident & emergency care. Some private hospitals are no longer accepting credit card payments for admissions and only accepting patients with valid health insurance.
Check if your travel or health insurance has comprehensive cover for coronavirus and refer to official channels in your location for further details.
