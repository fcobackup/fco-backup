At least 8 weeks before your trip, check the latest country-specific health advice from the National Travel Health Network and Centre (NaTHNaC) on the TravelHealthPro website. Each country-specific page has information on vaccine recommendations, any current health risks or outbreaks, and factsheets with information on staying healthy abroad. Guidance is also available from NHS (Scotland) on the FitForTravel website.
General information on travel vaccinations and a travel health checklist is available on the NHS website. You may then wish to contact your health adviser or pharmacy for advice on other preventive measures and managing any pre-existing medical conditions while you’re abroad.
The legal status and regulation of some medicines prescribed or purchased in the UK can be different in other countries. If you’re travelling with prescription or over-the-counter medicine, read this guidance from NaTHNaC on best practice when travelling with medicines. For further information on the legal status of a specific medicine, you’ll need to contact the embassy, high commission or consulate of the country or territory you’re travelling to.
While travel can be enjoyable, it can sometimes be challenging. There are clear links between mental and physical health, so looking after yourself during travel and when abroad is important. Information on travelling with mental health conditions is available in our guidance page. Further information is also available from the National Travel Health Network and Centre (NaTHNaC).
Coronavirus
There is an ongoing outbreak of coronavirus (COVID-19) in China, some other countries in the region and elsewhere.
On 14 March the Jordanian Government announced that commercial flights in to and out of Jordan will be stopped and all land and sea borders will be closed at 23:59 on Monday 16 March; this decision will be reviewed after two weeks.
British nationals in Jordan or intending to travel to Jordan are strongly advised to immediately review their travel plans and consult their insurance provider; tour operator, and transport or accommodation provider about the impact on their plans.
Additionally the Jordanian Government have announced a number of restrictions in place on public events and gatherings. British nationals in Jordan should comply with local restrictions and monitor local media for updates.
Prior to the 14 March announcement, the Jordanian authorities have introduced a number of precautionary measures, including the following entry restrictions:
• A ban on entry to foreign nationals travelling from China, Iran, South Korea, Italy, Lebanon, Syria, or who have been in these countries in the past 14 days.

Jordanian nationals and those with diplomatic accreditation (UNLP or diplomatic passports) arriving from all countries facing restrictions will be required to undertake a 14 day home quarantine as part of the precautionary measures followed by the Health Ministry.
Jordanian authorities are implementing enhanced screening procedures at points of entry. Those arriving from countries other than those listed above may be quarantined upon entry if they are seen to be displaying flu-like symptoms.
