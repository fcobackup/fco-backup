The information on this page covers the most common types of travel and reflects the UK government’s understanding of the rules currently in place. Unless otherwise stated, this information is for travellers using a full ‘British Citizen’ passport.
The authorities in the country or territory you’re travelling to are responsible for setting and enforcing the rules for entry. If you’re unclear about any aspect of the entry requirements, or you need further reassurance, you’ll need to contact the embassy, high commission or consulate of the country or territory you’re travelling to.
You should also consider checking with your transport provider or travel company to make sure your passport and other travel documents meet their requirements.
Entry rules in response to coronavirus (COVID-19)
Entry to Nepal
The Government of Nepal has restricted entry of all passengers originating from or transiting the UK, effective from 11:59 pm (local time) 23 December until further notice. If you are in the UK with plans to travel, please contact your airline or transport provider in the first instance, as you will likely be denied boarding. In addition, tourist and other visas will not be issued by the Embassy of Nepal in London until further notice.
Entry is currently prohibited for certain foreign nationals, including British nationals. Nepal’s land-based entry crossings into Nepal will remain closed to foreigners from third countries at present.
This does not include trekkers and mountaineers who have made official and approved bookings (however, those arriving from or transiting the UK are currently restricted from entering, as noted above). Those seeking to enter Nepal are required to present certain documentation:
a certificate showing a negative Reverse Transcription Polymerase Chain Reaction (RT-PCR) test, taken within 72 hours of arrival
a visa or prior approval document
a hotel booking that allows at least seven days’ shielding or quarantine in Nepal
insurance coverage of at least US $5,000 per person against COVID-19 illness
You should liaise with your travel or trekking agency for more information. The government of Nepal’s suspension of international commercial flights was lifted on 1 September, though at present, only Nepalis, international passengers from certain employment categories, and their dependants will be admitted. Please check your eligibility with carriers. You will be required to show a valid PCR test demonstrating that you did not have COVID-19, taken within 72 hours of travel. You should not use the NHS testing service to get a test in order to facilitate your travel to another country. You should arrange to take a private test.
