Drugs
Don’t become involved with drugs of any kind. Possession of even small quantities can lead to a long term of imprisonment. Don’t offer to carry any items for anyone else when entering or leaving Ireland.
LGBT+ Travellers
Attitudes in Ireland towards LGBT+ people are liberal. Same-sex marriage is legal in Ireland and rights are protected by legislation tackling discrimination. See our information and advice page for the LGBT+ community before you travel.
