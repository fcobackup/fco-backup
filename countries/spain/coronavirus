Travel in Spain
You should follow the advice of the local authorities on how best to protect yourself and others, including any measures that they bring in to control the virus. Some regional governments have issued advice to visitors and residents, and have imposed controls on opening hours for bars and nightclubs.
The State of Emergency (“Estado de Alarma”), declared on 14 March in response to the coronavirus outbreak, ended on 21 June. Spain has now entered the ‘new normal’ phase of its de-escalation strategy.
Restrictions on movement throughout the country have been lifted and travel between regions is permitted.
A number of local outbreaks of COVID-19 have been identified in Spain since the end of the State of Alarm. You should consult the Ministry of Health map for information on their locations. If you are staying in any of the affected areas, follow the advice of the local authorities.
One of those outbreaks has affected parts of Catalonia (namely parts of Barcelona metropolitan area, and the areas of La Noguera and El Segria), where local authorities have asked residents only to leave their accommodation for essential activities. Meetings of more than 10 people in public or private are prohibited, and the authorities have ordered the closures of nightclubs, gyms, and restrictions to the capacity and opening hours of bars and restaurants. These measures will be in place until 1 August.
The use of face coverings is mandatory for anyone over the age of 6 years old on all forms of public transport in Spain and in many other indoor and outdoor public spaces. Specific rules on the use of face masks may vary from one region to the next, you should refer to local authorities for advice. You should carry a face mask with you and be prepared to wear it throughout your stay.

Local measures and the ‘new normal’ phase
On 21 June, Spain entered the ‘new normal’ phase, which concludes the progressive 4-phase de-escalation plan and sees the return of cross-regional mobility.
