This page reflects the UK government’s understanding of current rules for people travelling on a full ‘British Citizen’ passport, for the most common types of travel.
The authorities in Guadeloupe set and enforce entry rules. If you’re unsure how Guadeloupe’s entry requirements apply to you, contact its UK embassy, high commission or consulate.
Entry rules in response to coronavirus (COVID-19)
From 1 August 2022, the French government announced that all travel restrictions between France and Guadeloupe have been lifted.
You are no longer required to present proof of vaccination
You are no longer required to fill out any forms prior to your arrival; such as a justification for travel or a sworn statement
You are no longer required to show proof of a negative PCR or antigen test upon arrival
You may still face some restrictions for entry to Guadeloupe depending on your vaccination status and your country of departure. You should check the French government’s website (in French) , and the local Prefecture’s website (in French) for details on any remaining local restrictions.

Regular entry requirements
Visas
Guadeloupe is an Overseas Department of France (département d’outre-mer).
If your passport describes you as a British Citizen, you will not need a visa to enter Guadeloupe. Other British passport holders should check the current entry requirements on the website of the French Ministry of Foreign Affairs and if necessary confirm with the nearest French Diplomatic mission.
If the UK leaves the EU without a deal, the current visa policy for British Citizens visiting Guadeloupe may change. We’re working with the relevant authorities to clarify entry requirements and this page will be updated as soon as further information is available. If you would like more details in the meantime, or want to discuss a specific issue, you should consult the French Embassy in London. If you’re a British Overseas Territories Citizen passport holder the current visa policy for travel to Guadeloupe will be unaffected by the UK leaving the EU.
Passport validity
Travellers should ensure that their passport has at least 3 months of validity after the date you intend to leave Guadeloupe.
Check your passport is valid for travel before you book your trip. You will need to renew your passport before travelling if you do not have enough time left on your passport.
Yellow fever certificate requirements
Check whether you need a yellow fever certificate by visiting the National Travel Health Network and Centre’s TravelHealthPro website.
UK Emergency Travel Documents
UK ETDs are accepted for entry, airside transit and exit from Guadeloupe.
