Coronavirus travel health
The number of COVID cases continues to increase across the country. This is increasing pressure on hospitals. Moscow and St Petersburg currently have sufficient hospital capacity to provide proper COVID and non-COVID related medical care. However, the situation can change quickly and varies greatly across the country, particularly in smaller cities and rural areas or remote locations. Check the latest announcements from local authorities before travelling.
Check the latest information on risk from COVID-19 for Russia on the TravelHealthPro website.

Be prepared for your plans to change
A full list of certified clinics and laboratories certified to perform PCR COVID-19 tests is available online (only in Russian).
No travel is risk-free during COVID. Countries may further restrict travel or bring in new rules at short notice, for example due to a new COVID-19 variant. Check with your travel company or airline for any transport changes which may delay your journey home.
If you test positive for COVID-19 while in Russia, you will be required to self-isolate until you have recovered and tested negative for COVID-19 on a PCR test. You should comply with any additional screening measures put in place by the authorities.
Plan ahead and make sure you:
can access money
understand what your insurance will cover
can make arrangements to extend your stay and be away for longer than planned

Public places and services
Social distancing of 1.5 metres is to be followed everywhere except in taxis.

QR codes are typically issued to those either vaccinated with a Russian vaccine, recently recovered from COVID-19 or with a recent negative PCR test. Requirements and procedures for obtaining QR codes vary depending on the region. Foreign nationals may not be required to have a QR code if they present a documentary proof of full vaccination by a Russian vaccine.
Accommodation
Many hotels in Russia remain open.
Healthcare in Russia
If you show any symptoms of coronavirus, such as respiratory illness or a temperature, you and your cohabitants may be required to self-isolate even if you haven’t been tested.
From 2 July 2021, all cases of respiratory illness in Moscow will be treated as high probability COVID cases. All patients displaying symptoms of a respiratory illness will have their PCR and rapid antigen tests taken and need to self-isolate until their PCR test is negative.
