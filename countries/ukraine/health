If you have a health condition, or you are pregnant, you may need specialist healthcare abroad. Check whether your destination country can provide the healthcare you may need and ensure you have appropriate travel insurance for unexpected medical evacuation or local treatment.
See the Coronavirus travel health and Healthcare sections in the Coronavirus page for COVID-19 health information.
FCDO advises against all travel to Ukraine. If you choose to travel, at least 8 weeks before your trip, check the latest country-specific health advice from National Travel Health Network and Centre (NaTHNaC). Each country-specific page has information on vaccine recommendations, any current health risks or outbreaks, and factsheets with information on staying healthy abroad. Guidance is also available from NHS (Scotland) on Fit For Travel .
General information on travel vaccinations and a travel health checklist is available. You may then wish to contact your health adviser or pharmacy for advice on other preventive measures and managing any pre-existing medical conditions while you’re abroad.
Pharmacies
Access to pharmacies and medication is a challenge in Ukraine at this time. Some supply chains are interrupted, so certain medical products are harder to come by. Information on which are operational is provided by local authorities and pharmacy networks.
The Ministry of Health operates a hotline at +380 (0)800 60 20 19 to coordinate access to insulin and other critical medicines for those who need it. The service Tabletki.ua is continuing to operate and attempts to maintain hourly updates about availability of medicines nationwide.
Pharmacies may also close without notice. You should ensure you maintain a stock of essential medication. Pharmacies in smaller towns may not have the same variety of medications available in the bigger cities. They are usually easily identifiable by the presence of a green cross and/or the word “apteka” (аптека). Some stronger medications require a prescription from a doctor, written in Ukrainian.
Emergency Medical Assistance
If you need emergency medical assistance during your trip, dial 103 and ask for an ambulance. You should contact your insurance/medical assistance company promptly if you are referred to a medical facility for treatment.
Medical Treatment
State medical facilities in Ukraine are generally poor. Private clinics and hospitals offer a better standard of care, though these do not always meet western standards and practices. If you require emergency medical treatment, it is likely that you will be taken to a state hospital unless you can show that you have comprehensive medical insurance cover.
English isn’t widely spoken and British patients may face communication difficulties.
The legal status and regulation of some medicines prescribed or purchased in the UK can be different in other countries. If you’re travelling with prescription or over-the-counter medicine, read this guidance from NaTHNaC on best practice when travelling with medicines. For further information on the legal status of a specific medicine, you’ll need to contact the embassy, high commission or consulate of the country or territory you’re travelling to.
