The information on this page covers the most common types of travel and reflects the UK government’s understanding of the rules currently in place. Unless otherwise stated, this information is for travellers using a full ‘British Citizen’ passport.
The authorities in the country or territory you’re travelling to are responsible for setting and enforcing the rules for entry. If you’re unclear about any aspect of the entry requirements, or you need further reassurance, you’ll need to contact the embassy, high commission or consulate of the country or territory you’re travelling to.
You should also consider checking with your transport provider or travel company to make sure your passport and other travel documents meet their requirements.
Restrictions in response to coronavirus
Under current border restrictions, only Spanish citizens, those who are legally resident in Spain, frontier workers or those who can prove they need to enter Spain for essential reasons will be allowed to enter the country.
Only green residency certificates will be accepted as proof of residency in Spain and British travellers who are not resident and/or not in possession of this certificate should not attempt to enter the country. Padron certificates, utility bills and property deeds will not be accepted by Spanish authorities as proof of residency.
British travellers who are not resident in Spain or do not have a residency certificate with them should not travel to Gibraltar and then attempt to enter Spain via the land frontier.
From 15 May, all new international arrivals entering Spain, including Spanish nationals and residents, will be required to self-isolate in their residence or hotel for a period of 14 days.
During this time movement will be limited to essential trips to supermarkets or pharmacies and those affected will be required to wear a facemask at all times in public. They should be contactable by authorities and should report any coronavirus symptoms to regional authorities. Cross-border workers, cabin crew, lorry drivers and healthcare workers are exempt from this measure.
The Spanish authorities have confirmed that travellers transiting through Spain are also exempt as long as they travel home directly and do not spend the night in any establishment in Spain. All passengers should carry their passports, proof of onward travel (i.e. ferry or Eurotunnel tickets) and country of residency. You may also find this letter useful should you be required to explain your reason for travel.
Air, land and sea borders
Only Spanish citizens or those who can prove residency in Spain by presenting a green residency certificate, are allowed to enter Spain through airports, ports or land borders. British travellers who are not resident or are not in possession of this certificate should not attempt to enter the country. Padron certificates, utility bills and property deeds will not be accepted by Spanish authorities as proof of residency.
The following categories of people are also exempt from border restrictions:
frontier workers
health workers
those who are transiting Spain to their country of residence in EU/Schengen area
those with a Schengen visa who are transiting Spain to their country of residence in EU/Schengen area
those who can prove that they need to enter Spain for essential reasons
These measures follow the restrictions on land borders which were introduced on Tuesday 17 March.
While inter-regional travel is not permitted, British travellers will continue to be allowed to leave Spain to return to their country of residence.
Land borders
The land borders remain open for those leaving Spain. British nationals can still drive through France to return to the UK, but you will need to complete an ‘attestation’ (declaration) specifying the reason for being outside.
If you’re planning to use this route, check the latest FCO travel advice for France ahead of your journey. In addition to the required ‘attestation’ you may also find this letter explaining the reason for your journey useful in both France and Spain, see Return to UK.
For information on travel via Gibraltar, see Return to UK.
Passport validity
Your passport should be valid for the proposed duration of your stay; you do not need any additional period of validity on your passport beyond this. This applies to the whole of Spain, including the Canary Islands and the Balearic Islands (Majorca, Menorca, Ibiza and Formentera).
The rules on travel will stay the same until 31 December 2020.

Visas

The rules on travel will stay the same until 31 December 2020.
UK Emergency Travel Documents (ETDs)

Travel between Spain and Gibraltar
Spanish border checks can cause delays when crossing between Spain and Gibraltar.
There is no charge to enter or leave Gibraltar. Don’t hand over money if you’re approached by anyone claiming that there is a charge.
