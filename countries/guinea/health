Before you travel check that:
your destination can provide the healthcare you may need
you have appropriate travel insurance for local treatment or unexpected medical evacuation
This is particularly important if you have a health condition or are pregnant.

Healthcare in Guinea
Medical facilities are poor. Equipment is basic and often not sterile. Carry basic medical supplies and a first aid kit.
For serious medical treatment, medical evacuation to Europe is necessary. Make sure you have adequate travel health insurance and accessible funds to cover the cost of any medical treatment abroad and repatriation.
