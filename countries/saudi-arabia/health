Warning
FCDO advises against all travel to parts of Saudi Arabia.

Before you travel check that: 
your destination can provide the healthcare you may need 
you have appropriate travel insurance for local treatment or unexpected medical evacuation 
This is particularly important if you have a health condition or are pregnant. 
Emergency medical number 
Call 911 and ask for an ambulance. 
Contact your insurance company promptly if you’re referred to a medical facility for treatment. 
Vaccinations and health risks 
At least 8 weeks before your trip check: 
the latest information on vaccination recommendations and health risks in TravelHealthPro’s Saudi Arabia guide  
where to get vaccines and whether you have to pay on the NHS travel vaccinations page 
Other health risks 
Contagious diseases spread quickly, particularly during Hajj and Ramadan. There is an increased risk of heat stroke and dehydration during the summer months. Bring basic medicines with you and consume adequate liquids and salts.
Medication  
The legal status and regulation of some medicines prescribed or bought in the UK can be different in other countries. Some prescribed or over-the-counter medicines are controlled substances in Saudi Arabia. You may need approval from the Saudi authorities to bring some prescription drugs. See rules on bringing prescription drugs to Saudi Arabia. 
If you need to bring controlled or prescription medication, make sure you have an official prescription, hospital note or a letter from your GP, which includes: 
the amount prescribed 
details of the drug and dosage 
your doctor’s signature 
a stamp from the clinic or hospital 
See narcotics and psychotropic substances information from the Saudi government. 
Pharmacies are common and can be found easily, particularly in the big cities. All hospitals will have a dispensing pharmacy and international brands can be found in shopping malls and plazas. UK prescriptions are not honoured in Saudi Arabia. Prescriptions must be issued by a doctor registered and licensed by the Saudi Commission for Health Specialities. 
Read best practice when travelling with medicines on TravelHealthPro. 
The NHS has information on whether you can take your medicine abroad.
