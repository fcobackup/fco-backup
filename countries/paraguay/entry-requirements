This page reflects the UK government’s understanding of current rules for people travelling on a full ‘British Citizen’ passport, for the most common types of travel.
The authorities in Paraguay set and enforce entry rules. For further information contact the embassy, high commission or consulate of the country or territory you’re travelling to. You should also consider checking with your transport provider or travel company to make sure your passport and other travel documents meet their requirements.
Entry rules in response to coronavirus
Paraguay’s borders are open to all travellers.
To enter, you must:
complete an online Traveller’s Health Declaration Form, available from the Ministry of Health’s website, up to 24 hours prior to entry;
present a negative COVID-19 test (RT-PCR, LAMP or NAAT) taken no more than 72 hours prior to travel, or a negative antigen test taken up to 24 hours before travel
show evidence of international health insurance with COVID-19 coverage (Paraguayan nationals and foreign nationals resident in a MERCOSUR member or associate country are exempt of this) and
undertake a COVID-19 PCR test on the 5th day after the pre-travel test, if still in Paraguay at that date, and isolate for 7 days if the test comes back positive. Children of 11 years and younger are exempt of the 5th day after the pre-travel test.
Exceptions
Travellers who have tested positive for COVID-19 14 to 90 days prior to entering the country are exempt from the requirement to provide a pre-departure test, however they must prove this situation with documentation from their health care provider and laboratory results showing positive antigens.
Land transit in border regions for commercial reasons is allowed for up to 24 hours for travellers who are 12 years and older and provide a negative COVID-19 antigen test or COVID-19 vaccination certificate. Only travellers who have completed 14 days since their final dose are considered fully vaccinated.
More information about the new entry requirement policy can be found on the Paraguayan Health Ministry website (in Spanish).
Demonstrating your COVID-19 status
Paraguay will accept the UK’s proof of COVID-19 recovery and vaccination record. Your NHS appointment card from vaccination centres is not designed to be used as proof of vaccination and should not be used to demonstrate your vaccine status.
Visas
Tourists and non-resident foreigners who are still within Paraguayan national territory and whose period of lawful stay in the country has expired, must pay the corresponding penalty when registering their departure at the border post or airport immigration control or when approaching the offices of the Direccion General de Migraciones.
Likewise, foreign citizens whose temporary residence has expired must approach the Direccion General de Migraciones to obtain a new residence card, pay the corresponding penalty in case of being in breach and update their immigration status.
If you are in Paraguay and your period of lawful stay has expired, contact the Direccion General de Migraciones for further information.
You can find more information on the Paraguayan Dirección General de Migraciones website (in Spanish).
Regular entry requirements
Visas
British Passport holders do not need a visa to enter Paraguay. On presentation of a valid British passport you will normally be granted a 90-day stay in the country.
You must make sure on arrival that your passport is stamped by an immigration official, dated and signed. Anybody without an entry stamp in their passport will be fined when they leave the country. This is particularly important for anyone entering Paraguay at a land border, typically the crossing between Ciudad del Este and Foz de Iguazu (Brazil). Sometimes long distance bus drivers tell foreign nationals that they can complete immigration formalities in Asunción. This is not true, and visitors will incur a fine if they do not get their passport stamped at the point of entry.
If you wish to extend your stay for another 90-day period, seek advice from the Direccion General de Migraciones.
If you are travelling to Paraguay to work or study you should contact the Paraguayan Embassy in London.
Passport validity
Your passport should be valid for the proposed duration of your stay. No additional period of validity beyond this is required.
Travelling with children
If you’re under 18, travelling across borders in the region without one or both parents, it’s advisable to have written permission to travel from both parents, duly certified by the Paraguayan Embassy in London, or your nearest Paraguayan Embassy. Single parents or other adults travelling alone with children should be aware that immigration officers often request documentary evidence of parental responsibility before allowing lone parents to enter the country or, in some cases, before permitting the children to leave the country. For more information on this contact the Paraguayan Embassy in London.
Yellow fever certificate requirements
Check whether you need a yellow fever certificate by visiting the National Travel Health Network and Centre’s TravelHealthPro website.
UK Emergency Travel Documents
UK Emergency Travel Documents are accepted for entry, airside transit and exit from Paraguay. The validity requirements are the same as for full validity British passports. If you plan to travel to Argentina or the US you will need a visa in your ETD. You must contact the nearest Embassies of those countries in order to apply.
Be aware that the British Embassy in Asunción does not produce ETDs. In case you require an ETD it will be done so through the British Embassy in Buenos Aires.
