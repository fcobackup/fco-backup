Warning
FCDO advises against all but essential travel to parts of Mexico.

This information is for people travelling on a full ‘British citizen’ passport from the UK. It is based on the UK government’s understanding of the current rules for the most common types of travel. 
The authorities in Mexico set and enforce entry rules. If you’re not sure how these requirements apply to you, contact the Mexican Embassy in the UK.
Passport validity requirements
To enter Mexico, your passport must be valid for the duration of your stay.
The Mexican Embassy in the UK recommends passports be valid for at least 180 days because this is the longest you can stay in Mexico as a tourist.
If you’re travelling through another country on your way to or from Mexico, check the entry requirements for that country. Many countries will only allow entry if you have at least 6 months validity remaining on your passport. 
Visa requirements
If you’re visiting Mexico as a tourist, you do not need a visa. You’ll get a stamp in your passport with the number of days you are allowed to stay.
British nationals entering Mexico by land must fill in an immigration form online.
Applying for a visa
The Mexican Embassy has information on applying for a visa in the UK.
See information on applying for a visa in Mexico (in Spanish).
Travelling through the USA
If you are travelling or transiting through the USA to or from Mexico, see entry requirements in USA travel advice or contact the US Embassy in London. If you do not have an Electronic System for Travel Authorisation (ESTA) visa waiver or the correct visa, you will not be allowed to travel to the USA.
Employment, voluntary work, research and eco activities
Tourists cannot do any type of voluntary or paid work or activity, including human rights work. To work or volunteer, you must get the correct visa from the Mexican Embassy before you travel.
You may need a visa for some adventure or ecotourism activities like caving, potholing or entomology, especially if they involve any scientific or technological research. The Mexican authorities may define scientific or technological research activities far more broadly than other countries. If in doubt, ask the Mexican Embassy in UK well before you travel and ask for written confirmation if necessary.
Airport e-gates for tourists
If you are a tourist aged 18 or over, you can use e-gates in some of the main international airports in Mexico. You must show the printed e-gate ticket when you leave the country, so be sure to collect it.
You can download digital proof of entry and how long you are allowed to stay in Mexico from Portal de Servicios del INM (in Spanish) within the first 60 days of your visit.
Checks at border control
At Mexican border control, you may need to: 
show a return or onward ticket
show proof of your accommodation, for example, a hotel booking confirmation
prove that you have enough money for your stay
If you’re staying in someone’s home, immigration officials may also ask for a ‘letter of invitation’ from the person you’re visiting. This should include as much information as possible, including the host and travellers’:
full names
contact details
address while in Mexico
reason for visit
Make sure you get your passport stamped on entry and exit.  
If you’re entering Mexico from the USA, and there is no immigration officer to stamp your passport, find the nearest immigration office before continuing. Immigration offices are usually near the border, and customs officials should be able to direct you. It is often more complicated to correct immigration issues once you leave the border area.
Travelling with children
If you are travelling with a child, you may be asked for:
evidence of your relationship with them – for example, a birth or adoption certificate, divorce or marriage certificates, or a parental responsibility order
the reason you are travelling with them
Children with dual nationality
Children with dual nationality of Mexico who are travelling without a parent or legal guardian must apply for a permit to leave the country.
Vaccine requirements
For details about medical entry requirements and recommended vaccinations, see TravelHealthPro’s Mexico guide.
Customs rules
There are strict rules about goods you can bring into and take out of Mexico. You must declare anything that may be prohibited or subject to tax or duty.
Check whether you will need to declare anything to customs officials. If you have goods to declare, you must submit a customs form online before travelling to Mexico. If you do not declare goods, customs officials may seize them and you could get a fine.
Entry tax for the state of Quintana Roo
You must pay an entry tax to visit the state of Quintana Roo – you can pay the entry tax online before or during your stay. You can get help paying online at Cancun Airport. You must show proof of payment at the airport before leaving.
Leaving Mexico
To leave Mexico, you must show your passport with the entry stamp showing how many days you were allowed to stay.
If you lose your passport, you must pay a fee to replace the entry stamp. The fee is about 700 Mexican pesos, to be paid at the immigration office by card or in a bank with cash. Migration officers do not accept cash. You can replace the stamp at the immigration office at any international airport in Mexico or start the entry stamp replacement process online. Updated fees should be displayed at the immigration offices.  
Fake immigration officers can operate in international airports. Always refuse offers of help and head directly to the immigration office.
Departure tax
You may need to pay a departure tax when leaving Mexico by air or land. The cost can vary, and some airports or border crossings only accept cash. Most airlines include the cost within the ticket price. If in doubt, check with your airline or tour operator.
