International travel
Guatemala International Airport re-opened on 18 September. You must keep to the social distancing rules and wear a mask at all times while at the airport.
Guatemala does not permit the entry of travellers who have been in the United Kingdom or South Africa in the 14 days prior to their arrival. This measure is not applicable to Guatemalan nationals, diplomats or foreign nationals who are legal residents in the country who must self-isolate for a period of 10 days at their place of residence. This measure came into force on 23 December 2020.
All persons aged 10 or over arriving in Guatemala must present a negative COVID-19 PCR or Antigen test, dated no more than 96 hours before the date of your arrival at a Guatemalan airport. All persons arriving by air must also complete, in advance of arrival, a Health Pass. Airlines will request proof of a negative test and completion of the Health Pass prior to boarding. Health protocols are in effect at ports of entry for the screening of arriving and departing passengers. Non-resident foreigners presenting symptoms of COVID-19 upon arrival may be denied entry into Guatemala.
Local authorities announced that from 6 January 2021, passengers who do not have a negative COVID-19 PCR or antigen test will be required to take a test upon arrival at La Aurora International Airport. This test costs US $ 25 or Q.200 (Quetzales, local currency).

Travel in Guatemala
You might experience some disruption due to migrant caravans attempting to pass through the country.
On 14 January 2021, Guatemala’s President declared a State of Prevention in the departments of Izabal, Zacapa, Chiquimula, Jutiapa, El Progreso, Peten and Santa Rosa, from 14 to 28 January 2021. The declaration seeks to prevent the spread of Coronavirus and to maintain order as the caravans make their way to the United States of America. It prohibits public gatherings, the carrying of weapons and may restrict travel.The restrictions during the state of prevention are:
A ban on open-air meetings, public demonstrations and any type of entertainment, unless authorised by local authorities;
Local authorities have orders to disband by force and without warning any meeting, group or public demonstration carried out without authorisation. This will also apply to authorised meetings, groups or public demonstrations that turn violent or where weapons are involved
Only the Security Forces will have the right to carry weapons
You may be subject to stop and search by Security Forces if travelling by car in any of these areas, or they may ask you to move your car if it is parked. Be prepared to answer questions and cooperate with the local authorities
The State of Calamity for Coronavirus ended on 30 September 2020. The nationwide curfew has also ended. However, the sale of alcohol will remain prohibited between 9pm to 4am. All businesses, entertainment facilities, and public spaces will be permitted to open, with appropriate measures for social distancing.
Local markets will only be open to the public from 5am to 5pm. Supermarkets, malls and shops will be open to the public until 7pm.
All local fairs remain prohibited; attendance at funerals and burials is limited to a maximum of 10 attendees. Everyone should comply with the measures put in place in Guatemala to limit the spread of coronavirus (COVID-19).
Public transport has reopened in Guatemala, however, there are a number of restrictions on capacity and access can still be very limited. If you wish to move to or from the airport you should hire a private taxi or driver.

Restrictions to prevent the spread of coronavirus are in place. If you are in Guatemala you should:
comply with social distancing of at least 1.5 metres
use a face mask in all public spaces, including on the street. People that have recuperated from COVID-19 and those under quarantine must use masks inside their homes
If you do not comply with these measures you could be fined or face criminal charges. Fines range from £700 to £15,000.
While the Guatemalan government’s mandatory curfew ended on 30 September, the system of health alerts remains in effect, with regulations on social distancing to be maintained within businesses and other public facilities based on the health alert level in each location. Each town has been assigned a colour. The colour responds to the number of positive COVID-19 cases reported, with red being the highest number of cases, amber being a high number of cases, yellow being a moderate number of cases and green being a lower number of cases. For information about the specific restrictions in the town where you are, check the Government of Guatemala website.
The list of threat rankings for each department and municipality is available on the Guatemalan government’s website.
The activities that will be permitted at each threat level are summarised on the Guatemalan government website.
You should familiarise yourself with the threat level in the area you live in and to keep up to date with any changes.
When travelling in the country, follow the advice of the local authorities (PROATUR) and monitor local media. See Local travel.
