This page reflects the UK government’s understanding of current rules for people travelling on a full ‘British Citizen’ passport, for the most common types of travel.
The authorities in French Polynesia set and enforce entry rules. If you’re unsure how French Polynesia’s entry requirements apply to you, contact its UK embassy, high commission or consulate.
You should also consider checking with your transport provider or travel company to make sure your passport and other travel documents meet their requirements.

Regular entry requirements
Visas
French Polynesia is an Overseas Collective (collectivité d’outre-mer) of France.
If you hold a British Citizen passport, you don’t need a visa to enter French Polynesia for stays of up to three months. Other British passport holders, and those who plan to stay longer than three months, should check the current entry requirements on the website of the French Ministry of Foreign Affairs and, if necessary, confirm with the nearest French Diplomatic mission.
Passport validity
Travellers should ensure that their passport has at least 3 months of validity after the date you intend to leave French Polynesia.
UK residents in French Polynesia
If you live in French Polynesia, you should carry your residence document, as well as your valid passport when you travel. If you have applied but not yet received your document, carry your certificate of application. You will have received this as an email. If you have not yet applied for a residence document, you should carry evidence that you are resident in French Polynesia. This could include a tenancy agreement or a utility bill in your name, dating from 2020. For more information, including on how to apply for a residence document, see the French government’s website.
