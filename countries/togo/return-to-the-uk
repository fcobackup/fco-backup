There remain commercial options available on Ethiopian Airlines to return to the UK from Togo. If you are usually based in the UK, you are strongly advised to return to the UK now by commercial means. Don’t run the risk of getting stranded.
Air France has operated several special flights for repatriation purposes after its final commercial flight on 18 March but no further flights are confirmed at this time. If further flights are announced, these will likely become available at short notice.
UK special charter flights will only operate for priority countries where commercial flights are not possible. You should not assume these flights will become available in countries where commercial routes are operating. Please do not contact the contracted travel management company if no flight is advertised here.
