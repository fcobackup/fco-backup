The currency of Haiti is the Gourde. You can exchange US dollars cash or travellers’ cheques for local currency in large hotels. Wherever possible, avoid using banks or withdrawing money at cash points (see Crime). Most hotels and shops accept payment in US dollars. Most credit cards can be used in major hotels, and in some shops and businesses in the large towns and cities. Don’t change money on the street.
