FCDO advises against travel to parts of India.
Before you travel check that:
your destination can provide the healthcare you may need
you have appropriate travel insurance for local treatment or unexpected medical evacuation
This is particularly important if you have a health condition or are pregnant.
Local medical facilities are not comparable to those in the UK, especially in more remote areas. For psychiatric illness, specialised treatment may not be available outside major cities. In major cities, private medical care is available but expensive.
The British High Commission in New Delhi publishes a list of the most commonly used hospitals, including those with English-speaking staff.
Emergency medical number
Dial 112 and ask for an ambulance.
Contact your insurance or medical assistance company promptly if you’re referred to a medical facility for treatment.
Air pollution
Severe air pollution is a major hazard to public health, especially during the winter months (October to February). North Indian cities are most affected by extremely high levels of pollution. Children, the elderly, and those with pre-existing medical conditions may be especially affected. If you’re pregnant or have a respiratory or heart condition you may wish to consult a medical practitioner before you travel. More information about outdoor air quality is available from TravelHealthPro (from the UK’s National Travel Health Network and Centre).
Diseases
Mosquito-borne diseases like dengue fever and Chikungunya occur all year round but are more widespread during the monsoon season.
Vaccinations and health risks
At least 8 weeks before your trip check:
the latest information on health risks and what vaccinations you need for India on TravelHealthPro
where to get vaccines and whether you have to pay on the NHS travel vaccinations page
If you might have COVID-19
If you have symptoms of COVID-19 and want more information, contact a registered medical practitioner.
Testing is available on demand from private laboratories. Testing arrangements vary from state to state, but there are a range of providers available. Contact local authorities for information on testing facilities. More details on testing labs are available on the Indian Council of Medical Research website.
COVID-19 contact details
You can call the Government of India 24-hour COVID-19 helpline number toll free on 1075 or visit the Indian Ministry of Health website.
If you need urgent consular assistance, contact your nearest British High Commission or consulate.
Altitude sickness
Altitude sickness is a risk in parts of north and northeast India, including mountainous regions in Himachal Pradesh, Uttarakhand, Ladakh, Sikkim, Arunachal Pradesh, Nagaland, and West Bengal. Certain southern India states, like Kerala and Tamil Nadu, also contain high altitude regions. More information about altitude sickness is available from TravelHealthPro (from the UK’s National Travel Health Network and Centre).
Medication
The legal status and regulation of some medicines prescribed or bought in the UK can be different in other countries.
TravelHealthPro explains best practice when travelling with medicines.
The NHS has information on whether you can take your medicine abroad.
For more  information, contact the High Commission of India in London or view the Indian Ministry of Health website and the Indian Customs website.
Travel and mental health
Read FCDO guidance on travel and mental health. There is also guidance on TravelHealthPro.
Transplant surgery
If you’re travelling to India for organ transplant surgery, check in advance with the hospital to find out what proof they need about your circumstances in the UK. You may need to submit evidence of your marriage and birth of your children before the operation can take place. You can get copies of marriage and birth certificates from the General Register Office in the UK. You may want to have them legalised by the FCDO Legalisation office before travelling. The British High Commission cannot provide guarantees and certificates on your behalf.
