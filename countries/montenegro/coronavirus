COVID-19 vaccines if you live in Montenegro
We will update this page when the Government of Montenegro announces new information on the national vaccination programme. You can sign up to get email notifications when this page is updated.
The Montenegrin national vaccination programme is using the Sinopharm, Sinovac, AstraZeneca, Pfizer-BioNTech and Moderna vaccines. The Government of Montenegro has stated that British nationals resident in Montenegro are eligible for vaccination if they choose to join the programme. This is not dependent on citizenship or whether you are insured with the Montenegrin Health Fund.
The Montenegrin authorities have created an e-portal with information about the local COVID-19 vaccination programme (only available in Montenegrin). Vaccination in Montenegro continues at vaccination centres across the country. Residents of Montenegro can attend with their identity documents without a need for advance registration.
Vaccination is available to children from 12 years of age with parental consent. For children, Pfizer vaccines are used. Vaccines will become available to children 5 to 11 years old when special lower doses for that age group arrive to the country. They will only be administered with parental and paediatrician consent.
Booster vaccines (third doses for vaccines that require two doses or a second dose in case of the Jansen vaccine) are now officially recommended to all adults 5 months after the second dose was administered, and 3-6 months after recovery to those vaccinated who have contracted coronavirus after vaccination. A fourth booster dose is now only recommended for those who are clinically vulnerable, to be administered 3-6 months after receiving a booster dose. Booster doses are not recommended for children.
National vaccination certificates remain valid for 6 months after the second vaccination dose administered. Booster vaccination certificates remain valid after 6 months.
If you cannot go to a vaccination centre you can call 1717 to request a mobile medical team to administer a vaccination at home.
