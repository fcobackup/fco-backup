If you plan to pass through another country to return to the UK, check the travel advice for the country you’re transiting.
Be prepared for your plans to change
No travel is risk-free during COVID. Countries may further restrict travel or bring in new rules at short notice, for example due to a new COVID-19 variant. Check with your travel company or airline for any transport changes which may delay your journey home.
If you test positive for COVID-19, you may need to stay where you are until you test negative. You may also need to seek treatment there.
Plan ahead and make sure you:
can access money
understand what your insurance will cover
can make arrangements to extend your stay and be away for longer than planned
Travel in Malaysia
A Movement Control Order, imposing restrictions on movement, is in place across Malaysia. Enhanced Movement Control Orders may be put in place in certain areas in response to localised outbreaks, which impose even stricter controls, including roadblocks.
Some states have reduced restrictions as they move into new phases of the National Covid Recovery Plan. However, the situation remains changeable and restrictions might be reimposed. Check local government websites, social media channels, and media reporting for up to date information.
For further clarification, you may refer to the Royal Malaysia Police directory and contact the police department near you.
Internal flights from Kuala Lumpur International Airport (KLIA) and Sultan Abdul Aziz Shah Airport (also known as Subang Airport) are operating as usual, but services could be reduced without notice.
You can get to and from the airport by taxi, or using the KLIA express train to/from Kuala Lumpur Sentral station. A bus service does operate from Kuala Lumpur Sentral, but infrequently.
You must wear a face mask at airports, on public transport and in taxis.
Public spaces and services
A Movement Control Order is in place across Malaysia. For further clarification, you may refer to the Royal Malaysian Police directory and contact the police department near you.
You should observe social distancing (1 metre).
You must wear a face mask in public spaces, including in shops, markets, tourist destinations, and cinemas.
To enter many facilities, your temperature will be taken, and they will record your personal contact details, usually on the MySejahtera app.
You must carry your passport at all times. You are no longer required to submit your current passport to HMPO when making a renewal passport application. Your current passport can be submitted when you have received your new passport.
You should follow local news for updates.
If you are found to be in breach of any of the operating procedures in place you may be detained and fined. This has happened to foreign nationals.
Immigration
On 12 April 2021, the Malaysian Immigration Department announced that those who have overstayed on a social visit pass that has expired since 1 January 2020 must leave the country by 21 April 2021. To date we have not received any official notification of this policy, or that this deadline has been extended.
If you have not been able to leave the country and have overstayed your social visit pass, the Immigration Department recommends informing the enforcement division at the local immigration office urgently. You will have to provide a flight ticket dated within 30 days of doing so, and pay a fine based on the number of days from 22 April 2021 to your departure date. The Immigration Department will then issue the special pass and a ‘Check Out Memo’ (COM). Please note the British High Commission is unable to provide any assistance for you to remain in Malaysia, including issuing any document to support your overstay.
The Immigration Department has noted that foreign nationals who do not obtain the special pass and COM can leave via exit points after 21 April 2021, but they will be blacklisted. If you have overstayed, you can go direct to Kuala Lumpur International Airport and present yourself to the Return Recalibration Programme desk (at Level 3 next to the Domestic Arrivals area), and pay a fine of RM500 on your departure. You will not have to visit a local immigration office in addition to this.
You can contact the Immigration Department on +603 8000 8000, by WhatsApp on +601162511223, use the Online Inquiry System, or email pls_g@imi.gov.my if you have any questions relating to your expired visa/pass, or you can seek legal advice.
See our section on financial assistance if you require assistance with funding your flight. When you return to the UK from Malaysia, you should make sure you follow the rules for entering the UK.
