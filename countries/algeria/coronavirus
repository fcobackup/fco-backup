Local measures
From 24 April, the timing of the partial lockdown in Algiers and 8 other wilayas (Ain Defla, Medea, Setif, Oran, Tizi Ouzou, Tipaza, Bejaia and Tlemcen) was amended, and now runs from 5pm to 7am. The full lockdown in the wilaya of Blida was lifted, and replaced with a partial lockdown from 2pm to 7am. The original 7pm to 7am lockdown remains in force for all 38 remaining wilayas.
Across the country, schools, nurseries, universities and mosques have closed; sporting events have been cancelled and many public amenities and public spaces have been shut to the public.
