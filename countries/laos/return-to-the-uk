There are currently only occasional charter flights which allow a return to the UK, via third countries. The UK government is working closely with airlines to make sure options are available for you to return to the UK.
Flights
The British Embassy is aware of a proposal for a commercial flight from Vientiane to Paris organised by Fly Envoy on 20 July 2020. The flight is estimated to cost 1,025 euros per person and is a one-way flight only. Please note that the British Embassy is not involved in the organisation of this flight, and cannot take responsibility for any contractual or availability issues arising should you choose to express an interest or reserve a ticket. We will continue to post updates about other commercial routes as soon as they become known to us.
More details can be found on the Fly Envoy website. For further enquiries, contact info@flyenvoy.com.
A number of commercial flight options are appearing on airline sites. You should consider existing entry / transit regulations carefully before booking flights, including restrictions on foreigners entering or transiting. You should consult FCO Travel Advice in the first instance.
You MUST inform us if you are departing on any flights by emailing BritishEmbassy.Vientiane@fco.gov.uk. Due to new regulations issued by the Lao government it is now a legal requirement for the Embassy to inform the Lao Ministry of Foreign Affairs of departing British Nationals.
Further information
The British Embassy Vientiane is issuing updates on the UKinLaos Facebook page with the latest available information on departure options for British nationals wishing to leave Laos.
