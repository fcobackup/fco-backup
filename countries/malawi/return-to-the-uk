There are currently extremely limited commercial flights from Malawi to the UK. The British High Commission is in contact with airlines and local authorities to explore commercial options to help British travellers return to the UK from Malawi as soon as possible.
Land borders remain open for Malawi nationals and residents only.
Satguru Travels are planning a commercial charter flight, jointly with Ethiopian Airlines, from Lilongwe to Addis Ababa on 30 May from which there are onward flights to multiple destinations including the UK. This is available for British tourists, short term visitors and their direct dependants. This flight will be confirmed if there are enough passengers to cover the operating cost.
Expressions of interest should be made as soon as possible to: mobile number: +265 992 650 650 / +265 992 85 08 50 / +265 888 52 86 59 or email: bharat.tolani@satgurutravel.com/ deepak.bhatt@satgurutravel.com / sales.llw2@satgurutravel.com
Future travel options
You will need to pay for your return travel to the UK. If departure options are available but you cannot afford the travel costs and have exhausted all other options for getting funds, you may be eligible to apply for an emergency loan from the government. This is a last resort option and you would need to repay the loan when you are back in the UK.
For more information, you should contact Corporate Travel Management (CTM). CTM are a commercial partner of the FCO and are authorised to administer such loans on behalf of the FCO.
