The Foreign, Commonwealth & Development Office (FCDO) advise against all travel to:
Ethiopia, except Addis Ababa Bole International Airport.
The FCDO advise against all but essential travel to:
Addis Ababa Bole International Airport
The FCDO advises against all travel to Ethiopia, except Addis Ababa Bole International Airport to which we advise against all but essential travel, because of the risk of the conflict spreading to new areas without prior warning.
There is a military conflict ongoing in Ethiopia. Military clashes are now occurring in Tigray, Amhara and Afar regional states. The conflict may escalate and spread quickly and with little warning. In the coming days we may see the conflict move closer to Addis Ababa. It is possible that Addis Ababa Bole International Airport could close at short notice, or that countries might introduce new travel restrictions due to COVID-19, which could severely limit options for British Nationals to leave Ethiopia.
Consular support is severely limited across Ethiopia. Given the rapidly changing situation in Ethiopia, some staff and dependents in the British Embassy Addis Ababa have been temporarily withdrawn. If you need urgent help, call +251 (0)11 617 0100. If you experience technical difficulties or if you are in the UK call +44 (0)20 7008 5000.
You should leave Ethiopia now while commercial options are still available. It is likely to become much more difficult to leave Ethiopia in the coming days. The deterioration in the political and security situation, means that the assistance the British Embassy can provide is likely to be very limited. Do not rely on the FCDO being able to evacuate you in an emergency. Currently, there are commercial flights to most destinations from Addis Ababa Bole International Airport, with most domestic flights operating normally (except Semera, Dessie, Weldiya and Tigray). There are currently no plans for a UK run charter flight.
Addis Ababa Bole International Airport is a transit hub for flights across Africa and these flights continue to operate safely at this time. All travellers from red-listed countries must book their managed quarantine package for arrival in the UK before their first point of departure travel. British nationals flying from red-listed countries without the correct quarantine booking have been denied onward travel to the UK while transiting Bole International airport. Our ability to provide Consular assistance at Bole airport may be limited.
Our advice remains that you should leave Ethiopia now. However, if you do choose not to leave, you should now make preparations to shelter in a place of safety over the coming weeks. If you do need to collect essential provisions, you should do so quickly, avoiding crowds. We also advise you take note of essential phone numbers, including the British Embassy +251 (0)11 617 0100 and subscribe to FCDO travel advice email alerts. Ensure that your family or friends are aware of your location and your plans.
We cannot guarantee there will be options to leave Ethiopia in the future. You should make sure you are ready to leave quickly if you decide to do so. If you are in the vicinity of military activity and you cannot leave safely, you should stay indoors, away from windows and remain alert to developments that would enable you to leave safely.
You should check that you are prepared for dealing with a crisis overseas Keep your passport, and those of immediate family members, up-to-date, along with any visas that you may require; during a crisis, visa services may be limited or closed, which could make travelling more complicated (see our crisis guidance). If your British passport has expired, you can apply for an Emergency Travel Document. You may also be able to apply for a visa from a third country.
Anyone resident in Ethiopia should ensure their IDs/proof of residency are in order and carried on their person at all times, including when departing from Bole airport. Ensure that your ID/residency is valid and will remain so for the next 3 months. If it has expired or will expire within the next 3 months, you should visit the main Immigration Office in Arat Kilo, Addis Ababa to renew it before you leave the country or you should hand in your ID/residency and seek an exit visa from the main Immigration Office. It is not possible to renew your ID/residency or to seek an exit visa at the airport – failure to complete this in advance could delay your departure.
On 2 November, a nationwide State of Emergency was declared, with further directives being added since that date. Public meetings and demonstrations are banned. Movement without ID will be restricted. Curfews and roadblocks may be introduced with little or no warning. There is an enhanced security presence. Publication of any military activity or views on the conflict that dissent from the Federal Government’s view, including by social media, is banned. Travellers are advised to monitor local news and social media closely and comply with instructions from the authorities. You should carry copies of your identification at all times. You should avoid large gatherings and demonstrations.
The nationwide State of Emergency provides the police with greater powers to arrest and to search property. You should be aware that the police are using these powers where there are security threats or where there is a concern about an individual’s support to banned groups. Those of Tigrayan or Oromo ethnicity may face increased scrutiny, although this power could affect all people, including at the airport and through direct police operations. You should comply with the law, including on carrying ID cards, possession of foreign currency and possession of weapons. You should avoid confrontation and follow the instructions of the authorities. See Addis Ababa

You should be vigilant at all times, especially in crowded areas and public places like transport hubs, hotels, restaurants, bars and places of worship and during major gatherings like religious or sporting events. There is a threat of kidnapping in Ethiopia’s Somali region, and on the southern border with Kenya, particularly in the eastern areas to which the FCDO advise against all travel. See Terrorism
