Flooding
Damage caused by flash flooding earlier in 2019 continues to affect some areas in the south of the Alicante and Murcia regions, causing some disruption to local transport and secondary road closures. If you’re in these areas, you should follow the advice of the local authorities.
Forest fires
Forest fires occur frequently in Spain (including Spanish islands) during the summer months. Take care when visiting or driving through woodland areas.
Causing a forest fire is treated as a criminal offence in Spain even if unintentional. Make sure cigarette ends are properly extinguished, don’t light barbecues and don’t leave empty bottles behind. There are strict regulations across much of Spain against lighting outdoor barbecues in forest areas and penalties imposed include heavy fines. Some regions prohibit the use of outdoor barbecues in public picnic areas during the summer months.
Check on the outbreak of fires with the local civil protection authority and report any you see immediately to the emergency services on 112.
