The information on this page covers the most common types of travel and reflects the UK government’s understanding of the rules currently in place. Unless otherwise stated, this information is for travellers using a full ‘British Citizen’ passport.
The authorities in the country or territory you’re travelling to are responsible for setting and enforcing the rules for entry. If you’re unclear about any aspect of the entry requirements, or you need further reassurance, you’ll need to contact the embassy, high commission or consulate of the country or territory you’re travelling to.
You should also consider checking with your transport provider or travel company to make sure your passport and other travel documents meet their requirements.

Vietnamese authorities have introduced new measures in relation to COVID-19. See Coronavirus
Visas
On 21 March, Vietnam temporarily banned entry into Vietnam for all foreign nationals. There are a very small number of exceptions for diplomats on official business and certain high-skilled workers. However, the systems for managing this are not clear and we are not yet able to provide further clarity.
For those in quarantine, Vietnamese quarantine centres are basic, and most do not meet Public Health England standards.
The ban on foreign nationals entering Vietnam means there are only international flights out of Vietnam to the UK via Incheon, Korea. Should you intend to leave Vietnam, you should do so without delay by commercial means.
Foreign nationals in Vietnam may be required to fill in health questionnaires. False declarations regarding health history could lead to prosecution.
Vietnam will not require people to extend their visas between 1 and 30 April. If you want to stay longer term in Vietnam, you should only do so legally and with the right visa. You should not take it for granted that existing visas or work permits will be extended and decisions on granting extensions of stay are a matter for the Vietnamese authorities. The Embassy and Consulate General will be able to assist British nationals who have been directly impacted by COVID-19 problems (hospital, quarantine, etc) if you are returning imminently to the UK. We will not be able to assist you with individual visa applications should you not wish to return to the UK. Overstaying your Vietnamese visa without authority is a serious matter and you may be delayed from travel until a fine is paid. Check the visa validity and conditions carefully and refer to our Information Note on Visa/Work Permit Extensions for more details.
Vietnamese authorities have shown flexibility in extending visas for people who have been unable to leave Vietnam due to the COVID-19 situation and who have rebooked to leave in the immediate future.
For further information about visa requirements, check with the Vietnamese Embassy in London.
Land borders
Borders with China, Cambodia and Laos are currently closed.
Passport validity
Your passport should be valid for a minimum of 6 months on the date you enter Vietnam for you to be eligible for the 15 day visa exemption.
For periods of stay longer than 15 days, entry into Vietnam may be refused if your passport has less than 1 month validity from the date your Vietnamese visa expires.
The British Government has agreed with the Vietnamese Immigration Department that any passport held by a British national which has an expiry date of 1 January 2020 onwards, or has less than 6 months validity, will now be recognised as expiring on 31 December 2021 when submitted for the purpose of renewing a visa or residence permit.
This is because British nationals in Vietnam are unable to renew their passports at this time due to the closure of the visa application centres due to COVID-19 and the limited processing of passport applications in the UK. The extended expiry date will temporarily enable British nationals with an expiring UK passport to apply for a visa or residence permit renewal in Vietnam without having to apply for a new passport.

If you need to travel from Vietnam, we may be able to issue an Emergency Travel Document (ETD). Please contact us for information about how to apply at:
A number of British nationals have been refused entry and exit due to their passport being damaged. Make sure your passport is in good condition before arriving in Vietnam. Being refused entry can result in significant cost and a long stay at the airport.
Registration
When checking into a hotel, you’ll have to hand over your passport so that the hotel can register your presence with the local police. Make sure your passport is returned and keep it in a safe place. Don’t use your passport as a deposit for renting a hotel room. If you are staying in private accommodation, you will still be expected to register. Ask your host to help you with this as soon as you arrive. You may be fined if you don’t register.
Yellow fever certificate requirements
Check whether you need a yellow fever certificate by visiting the National Travel Health Network and Centre’s TravelHealthPro website.
UK Emergency Travel Documents
UK Emergency Travel Documents are accepted for entry, airside transit and exit from Vietnam. Please contact the nearest Vietnamese Embassy to obtain an appropriate visa before travel. If your ETD has been issued in Vietnam, to replace a lost/stolen passport, you will need an exit visa from the Vietnam Immigration Department before you can travel out of Vietnam. This process normally takes 5 working days. Contact the Immigration Department directly for further information.
