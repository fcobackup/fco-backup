Travel in Italy
All travellers entering Italy must comply with the regulations of the region they are visiting. Public transport links may be less frequent and seating limited to comply with social distancing measures. Masks must be worn on board public services. Taxi and car hire options are widely available.
Train companies have reduced domestic services and international travel is limited. Some cross-border bus companies are also cancelling their services.
From 15 August, Italian flagged cruise ships can recommence sailings, available to residents of Schengen countries. Passenger ferry schedules remain subject to change and cancellations. Speak to your tour operator or transport provider for the latest information.
More information on all these requirements is available from the Ministry of Foreign Affairs or the European Union’s Re-Open EU page.
Public spaces and services
The Italian government is constantly reviewing their coronavirus policy. The following measures are currently in place:
social distancing of one metre must be observed
the use of masks remains mandatory in enclosed public spaces. From 16 August, masks must also be worn in all outdoor spaces between the hours of 6pm and 6am. You should pay close attention to signage and carry a mask with you at all times.
parks have reopened and outdoor exercise is permitted, subject to social distancing
funerals are now permitted to take place with limited attendance. Churches can celebrate mass, weddings and baptisms
restaurants, pubs, bars, shops, hairdressers, salons and beaches have been given permission to open, as have libraries. All must have measures in place to enforce social distancing
from 16 August, dance activity has been suspended, in enclosed nightclubs and open air venues
museums and archeological sites have been given permission to open. Entry must be prebooked online
travel between Italian regions is permitted
schools are expected to remain closed until September
Regional authorities in Italy are empowered to adjust these measures in keeping with local requirements; regional differences may therefore apply in addition to the restrictions listed above.
Note that many restaurants, beach facilities and other venues are asking patrons to provide their name and contact details before using their services.
If you are a British national resident in Italy, we advise carrying proof of your residence in Italy when transiting through airports or other transport hubs.
You can find more information on measures on the Ministry of Health website (in English) and Frequently Asked Questions on the Ministry of Foreign Affairs website (in English).
