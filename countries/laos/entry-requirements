Warning
FCDO advises against all but essential travel to parts of Laos.

This information is for people travelling on a full ‘British citizen’ passport from the UK. It is based on the UK government’s understanding of Laos’s current rules for the most common types of travel. 
The authorities in Laos set and enforce entry rules. If you’re not sure how these requirements apply to you, send a message to the Lao Embassy London Facebook page.
Passport validity requirements
To enter Laos, your passport must have an ‘expiry date’ at least 6 months after the date you arrive and at least 2 blank pages.
Airlines will only let you board your flight if your passport has enough blank pages.
Check with your travel provider to make sure your passport and other travel documents meet their requirements. Renew your passport if you need to.
You will be denied entry if you do not have a valid travel document or try to use a passport that has been reported lost or stolen.
Visa requirements 
You must have a visa to visit Laos.  
To work, study and travel for business or other reasons, you must meet the Lao immigration department’s entry requirements.
