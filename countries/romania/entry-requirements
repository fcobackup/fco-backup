The information on this page covers the most common types of travel and reflects the UK government’s understanding of the rules currently in place. Unless otherwise stated, this information is for travellers using a full ‘British Citizen’ passport.
The authorities in the country or territory you’re travelling to are responsible for setting and enforcing the rules for entry. If you’re unclear about any aspect of the entry requirements, or you need further reassurance, you’ll need to contact the embassy, high commission or consulate of the country or territory you’re travelling to.
You should also consider checking with your transport provider or travel company to make sure your passport and other travel documents meet their requirements.
Entry rules in response to coronavirus (COVID-19)
Entry to Romania
On 25 March 2021 the Romanian Government announced that:
the UK is no longer on Romania’s Yellow List of Highly Infected Countries and travellers arriving from the UK no longer need to have had a negative PCR test before flying or present evidence of vaccination or to self-isolate on arrival to Romania
Otherwise restrictions in place since 1 January 2021 remain. UK nationals and non-EU/EEA nationals resident in the UK are not permitted to enter Romania for non-essential purposes. Essential travel is still permitted. The list of exemptions includes family members of Romanian, EU, EEA and Swiss citizens, business travellers, hauliers, students and diplomatic and consular staff, who will need to show proof of the applicable exemption, with a visa, residence permit or an equivalent document issued either by the Romanian authorities or by the authorities of other states, in accordance with EU law. It is the responsibility of each individual traveller to provide sufficient evidence, which shows that their travel is essential.
These restrictions do not apply to UK nationals who are legally resident in Romania, who will need to show proof of residency to re-enter Romania.
It is the responsibility of the individual to provide clear evidence that their travel is essential, including the provision of supporting documentary evidence such as a work contract. The final decision to admit entry remains with the Romanian Ministry of the Interior.
Further information is provided on the Romanian Ministry of the Interior’s website.
Regular entry requirements
Visas
The rules for travelling or working in European countries changed on 1 January 2021:
you can travel to Romania for up to 90 days in any 180-day period without a visa. This applies if you travel as a tourist, to visit for family or friends, to attend business meetings, cultural or sports events, or for short-term studies or training
visits to other EU or Schengen countries do not count towards your 90-day limit in Romania as it is not in the Schengen area. Visits to Romania do not count towards your 90-day visa-free limit in the Schengen area
to stay longer, to work or study, for business travel or for other reasons, you will need to meet the Romanian government’s entry requirements. Check with the Romanian Embassy what type of visa and/or work permit you may need
if you stay in Romania with a visa or permit, your stay does not count towards your 90-day visa-free limit
Any time you spent in Romania before 1 January 2021 does not count towards the 90-day visa-free limit.
At Romanian border control, you may need to use separate lanes from EU, EEA and Swiss citizens when queueing. Your passport may be stamped on entry and exit.
You may also need to:
show a return or onward ticket
show you have enough money for your stay
Passport validity
Check your passport is valid for travel before you book your trip, and renew your passport if you do not have enough time left on it.
You must have at least 6 months left on an adult or child passport to travel to most countries in Europe (not including Ireland).
If you renewed your current passport before the previous one expired, extra months may have been added to its expiry date. Any extra months on your passport over 10 years may not count towards the 6 months needed.
Parental consent when travelling with minors
Some British nationals travelling with minors who hold Romanian citizenship (irrespective of whether they hold citizenship of other countries) are prevented from leaving the country without notarised parental consent from the minor’s non-travelling parent/s. While enforcement of this may vary at borders, British nationals travelling with minors who hold Romanian citizenship should obtain notarised parental consent before departure from Romania.
A list of the public notaries can be found on the website of the National Union of Public Notaries from Romania.
