The information on this page covers the most common types of travel and reflects the UK government’s understanding of the rules currently in place. Unless otherwise stated, this information is for travellers using a full ‘British Citizen’ passport.
The authorities in the country or territory you’re travelling to are responsible for setting and enforcing the rules for entry. If you’re unclear about any aspect of the entry requirements, or you need further reassurance, you’ll need to contact the embassy, high commission or consulate of the country or territory you’re travelling to.
You should also consider checking with your transport provider or travel company to make sure your passport and other travel documents meet their requirements.
Visas
British passport holders do not need a visa for stays of up to 3 months.
If the UK leaves the EU without a deal, the current visa policy for British Citizens visiting Aruba may change. We are working with the relevant authorities to clarify entry requirements for British nationals and this page will be updated as soon as further information is available. If you would like more details in the meantime, or want to discuss a specific issue, you should consult the Embassy of the Kingdom of the Netherlands in London.
Passport validity
Your passport should be valid for the duration of your stay in Aruba. You will be permitted entry as long as your passport does not expire before the end of your stay.
UK Emergency Travel Documents
UK Emergency Travel Documents (ETDs) are accepted for entry, airside transit and exit from Aruba.
