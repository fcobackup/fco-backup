This page gives you guidance on how to stay safely in Cyprus as a visitor, if you are unable to return to the UK.
Everyone should comply with the measures put in place in Cyprus to limit the spread of coronavirus (COVID-19).
Moving around in Cyprus
Following policy changes announced by the Republic of Cyprus Government and the administration in the north, all crossing points between the Republic and the north are effectively closed to travellers. From 8 June, there will be a gradual reopening of some crossing points, initially to certain categories of Cypriots only.
In the Republic of Cyprus, from 21 May – 9 June, there will be a second phase of easing of restrictive measures, removing movement restrictions and the nighttime curfew. This includes the reopening of cafes and restaurants with outside seating areas only, and unrestricted use of beaches. Further guidance and information is available here.
In the north of Cyprus, from 1 June the night time curfew has been lifted. From 20 May, restaurants, cafes, businesses and public beaches have re-opened. Hotels may re-open from 1 June. Face masks must be worn in public at all times, and social distancing observed.
Closure of hotels
All hotels have ceased operations. The Cyprus government announced on 22 May that some hotels may open from 1 June. The Republic of Cyprus government is using a small number of hotels to accommodate Cypriot nationals and permanent residents who have recently returned from abroad for quarantine purposes.
Health

Finance
There is a range of financial support from the government that you can access while you are unable to return due to coronavirus restrictions.
If you’re in Cyprus, and have exhausted all other options to cover essential living costs while you wait to return home, you could apply for an emergency loan for your living costs from the UK government. You can only apply if you normally live in the UK and you cannot return home. This last-resort option is for those most in need, and you would need to repay the loan when you are back in the UK. Apply for an emergency loan.

If you need urgent consular assistance, contact your nearest British embassy, high commission or consulate. All telephone numbers are available 24/7.
