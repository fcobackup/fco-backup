This information is for people travelling on a full ‘British citizen’ passport from the UK. It is based on the UK government’s understanding of the current rules for the most common types of travel.
The authorities in Poland set and enforce entry rules. If you’re not sure how these requirements apply to you, contact Polish Embassy in the UK.
Passport validity requirements
Poland follows Schengen area rules. Your passport must have:
a ‘date of issue’ less than 10 years before the date you arrive – if you renewed your passport before 1 October 2018, it may have a date of issue that is more than 10 years ago
an ‘expiry date’ at least 3 months after the day you plan to leave the Schengen area (the expiry date does not need to be within 10 years of the date of issue)
Check with your travel provider that your passport and other travel documents meet requirements. Renew your passport if you need to.
You will be denied entry if you do not have a valid travel document or try to use a passport that has been reported lost or stolen.
Dual nationals
If you are a British-Polish dual national, you must enter and exit Poland using a Polish passport or Polish national identity card. There are regular cases of Polish border guards allowing dual nationals to enter on their British passport, but refusing exit on the British passport.
Children born to Polish or British-Polish dual national parents in the UK are automatically granted Polish citizenship, regardless of the child’s place of birth. The requirement to exit Poland using Polish documentation will apply.
Find out how to apply for a Polish passport before travelling to Poland (in Polish). Check with the Polish Embassy in the UK if in doubt about your circumstances.
Visa requirements
You can travel without a visa to the Schengen area, which includes Poland, for up to 90 days in any 180-day period. This applies if you travel:
as a tourist
to visit family or friends
to attend business meetings, cultural or sports events
for short-term studies or training
The requirements for working in Poland are different.
If you’re travelling to other Schengen countries as well, make sure your whole visit is within the 90-day limit. Visits to Schengen countries in the 180 days before you travel count towards your 90 days. If you overstay the 90-day visa-free limit, you may be banned from entering Schengen countries for up to 3 years.
Make sure you get your passport stamped on entry and exit. 
If you’re a visitor, border guards will look at your entry and exit stamps to check you have not overstayed the 90-day visa-free limit for the Schengen area.
If your passport is missing a stamp, show evidence of when and where you entered or left the Schengen area (for example, boarding passes or tickets) and ask the border guards to add the date and location in your passport.
At Polish border control, you may also need to:
show a return or onward ticket
prove that you have enough money for your stay
Staying longer than 90 days in a 180-day period
To stay longer, you must meet the Polish government’s entry requirements. Check which type of visa or work permit you need with the Polish Embassy in the UK.
If you are in Poland with a residence permit or long-stay visa, this does not count towards your 90-day visa-free limit.
See more details about the rules if you live in Poland and read the Polish Border Guards guidance.
New Schengen entry requirements
The EU’s Entry/Exit System (EES) is expected to start in October 2025. It is not currently in operation. The European Union will inform about the specific start date of the EES before its launch.
