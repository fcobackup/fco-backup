Although there’s no recent history of terrorism in Suriname, attacks can’t be ruled out. On 24 May 2018 a message, claiming to be from ISIS, was posted on Facebook. The message referenced the trial of 2 defendants on charges of attempting to recruit personnel in Suriname on behalf of ISIS, and threatened reprisals against the University, some schools and the prison holding the defendants. As a precaution, the police and army have been stationed at these locations. You should take sensible precautions, comply with the local authorities and review your own security arrangements.
