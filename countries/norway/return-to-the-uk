There are currently extremely limited commercial options available to return to the UK from Norway.
Airports remain open but there are no direct links from Oslo to the UK.
UK special charter flights will only operate for priority countries where commercial flights are not possible. You should not assume that these flights will become available in countries where commercial routes are operating. Please do not contact the contracted travel management company if no flight is advertised here.
Flights
BA, SAS, Norwegian Airlines, RyanAir and Wizz Air have suspended direct flights to and from the UK.
Widerøe is offering a limited service from Bergen, currently the only remaining direct route back to the UK.
If you’re travelling from Oslo, you will need to consider transiting via a regional hub such as Frankfurt or Amsterdam. Note that the options for indirect routes are limited. You should consult your travel operator or airline for the latest schedules and information on flight availability, but note that schedules may change.
You will need to pay for your return travel to the UK. If departure options are available but you cannot afford the travel costs and have exhausted all other options for getting funds, you may be eligible to apply for an emergency loan from the government. This is a last resort option and you would need to repay the loan when you are back in the UK. For more information, contact Corporate Travel Management (CTM)](/guidance/coronavirus-covid-19-emergency-loans-for-return-flights-how-to-apply). CTM are a commercial partner of the FCO and are authorised to administer such loans on behalf of the FCO.
