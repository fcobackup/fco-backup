The authorities in the country or territory you’re travelling to are responsible for setting and enforcing the rules for entry. If you’re unclear about any aspect of the entry requirements, or you need further reassurance, you’ll need to contact the embassy, high commission or consulate of the country or territory you’re travelling to.
You should also consider checking with your transport provider or travel company to make sure your passport and other travel documents meet their requirements.
Entry rules in response to coronavirus (COVID-19)
Entry to Italy
Travellers arriving in Italy directly from the UK are now usually exempt from the requirement to self-isolate.
You will only need to self-isolate if:
you travelled outside the UK in the 14 days prior to your arrival in Italy or;
you will be arriving in Italy from a country for which there are still self-isolation requirements (see theMinistry of Foreign Affairs website).
If these conditions apply to you, then you must;
arrive in Italy with a completed ‘Self-Declaration Form for Travel’ stating the purpose of your trip to Italy
report promptly to local health authorities
self-isolate for 14 days
More information on these requirements is available on the Ministry of Foreign Affairs frequently asked questions page. If you are travelling to the island of Sardinia, you are also required by the local authority to register your trip in advance
Many airlines and airports serving Italy are resuming service, but may not be operating to their usual schedules. You are strongly advised to check your airline’s website, as well as the website for the airport you are intending to fly to for the latest information. You should also expect to be asked to wear a face mask throughout your flight and within the airport terminal.
All travellers entering Italy must comply with the regulations of the region they are visiting. Public transport links may be less frequent and seating limited to comply with social distancing measures. Masks must be worn on board public services. Taxi and car hire options are widely available.
Train companies have reduced domestic services and international travel is limited. Some cross-border bus companies are also cancelling their services.
Cruises are not operating at this time. Passenger ferry schedules remain subject to change and cancellations. Speak to your tour operator or transport provider for the latest information.
More information on all these requirements is available from the Ministry of Foreign Affairs or the European Union’s Re-Open EU page.
