The government of Pakistan has suspended normal scheduled international flights to and from Pakistan until at least 21 April.
However, the government of Pakistan continues to allow a number of flights to and from various locations including the UK.
Pakistan International Airlines (PIA) flights
Pakistan International Airlines (PIA) is operating a number of commercial flights to the UK, having already operated 17 flights between 4-10 April. We understand that there is high demand for these flights. Tickets may become available at short notice.
To book tickets on these PIA flights you can call or visit any PIA booking office, or use the PIA website. Some tickets may also be available through travel agents.
You should contact your airline separately to seek refunds for any previous flight tickets that you were not able to use.
We know this is a concerning time for British people trying to leave Pakistan. The British High Commission continues to work hard to secure more flights to the UK, and is in regular contact with the Government of Pakistan, as well as airlines.
PIA’s special booking email address has now closed. If you have emailed this address but have not yet received a response, you should book tickets through PIA booking offices or the PIA website.
On 2 April, the British High Commission requested that British nationals in Pakistan make contact if they wanted to return to the UK. Once PIA opened flights to general booking, we were able to close this mailbox.
Getting to the airport
If you have a confirmed flight ticket and valid travel document, provincial and federal authorities have assured us that you will be able to travel to the airport. If you have been placed into a quarantine centre, or you are in an area that has been quarantined by the authorities, you may have to wait until the quarantine is lifted before being able to travel to the airport. Follow the advice of the relevant local authorities.
Some provinces have limited the number of people that can be in a vehicle and, except a driver, people who do not have a flight ticket may not be allowed to accompany travellers to the airport.
You may have your temperature checked on entry to the airport. Those displaying COVID-19 symptoms, including a high temperature, may not be allowed into the airport to board their flight. If you have concerns about Coronavirus symptoms, please see Coronavirus.
If you cannot leave Pakistan at this time
If you cannot leave Pakistan at this time, you should:
Follow the advice of local authorities, including local measures to help minimise your risk of exposure to Covid-19.
Find accommodation that’s suitable for your needs.
Keep in regular contact with family and friends at home, so they know you are safe and well.
Future travel options
The British High Commission continues to work hard to secure more flights to the UK, and is in regular contact with the Government of Pakistan, as well as airlines to keep commercial routes open. The UK Government is considering all possible routes to get British nationals home. Fares still apply when charters are operated.
The travel advice will be updated when departure options become available. Sign up for travel advice email alerts and follow the British High Commission on Twitter, Facebook and Instagram.
Help and support
If you need urgent consular assistance, you can contact the British High Commission on +92 (0) 51 201 2000. Select the option for emergency assistance for British nationals.
The High Commission cannot provide further information or advice about departure options over the phone. This page will be updated when departure options become available. To get the latest information, sign up for travel advice email alerts.
If you’re trying to get back to the UK and need financial help, see the FCO’s guide on financial assistance.
Visas
The Ministry of Interior has confirmed that all types of visas issued to foreign nationals who are currently in Pakistan that expire between 15 March 2020 and 30 April 2020 will be deemed to be valid until 30 April 2020.
