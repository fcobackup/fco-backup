Cases of coronavirus (COVID-19) have been confirmed throughout South Korea.
While the majority of new and existing cases are within the designated “special care zones”, the number of cases elsewhere in South Korea also continues to rise. The virus may cause more severe symptoms in older people, and those with pre-existing medical conditions. You should exercise caution throughout the country, follow the advice of local authorities, and continue to comply with any additional screening measures put in place. You should ensure you have up to date, comprehensive health insurance.

The South Korean authorities have introduced a number of measures to limit the spread of the virus.
Special care zones
The FCO advise against all travel to the cities of Daegu, Cheongdo and Gyeongsan, which the Government of South Korea has designated as “special care zones” following a high number of cases in these areas.
Medical services in these areas are under pressure and you may experience delays in receiving treatment should you become ill. If you’re already in Daegu, Cheongdo or Gyeongsan, follow the instructions and advice of the local authorities and pay particular regard to virus control testing and measures.
Screening
From 22 March, all travellers from Europe will be subject to testing for COVID-19 on arrival at South Korean ports and airports.
Testing may take up to 24 hours and you may be held in a separate facility during this time. If a person tests positive for the virus they will be transferred to the appropriate healthcare facility. If the results are negative, short term visitors (less than 90 days) will be asked to report their health status daily for 14 days after arrival by phone or through a specialised mobile App. Long term visitors to Korea (90 days+) will need to self-isolate at their place of residence for 14 days. If they do not have an appropriate place to self-isolate they will be provided with government accommodation. Testing and any subsequent treatment will be free of charge.
You should ensure you have with you a mobile telephone with the roaming function enabled, and/or the telephone number of a friend, relative or contact who can update the authorities daily on your state of health. A hotel telephone number is unlikely to be accepted.
Immigration authorities will undertake a test call before travellers leave the airport, and any individual unable to verify their contact details may be denied entry to South Korea.
Entry and borders
The Government of South Korea has announced that foreign nationals who have been in Hubei province in China within the previous 14 days will not be allowed to enter South Korea.
Further information
For British nationals in all affected areas, Public Health England advise that you should maintain good hand, respiratory and personal hygiene and should avoid visiting animal and bird markets or people who are ill with respiratory symptoms. There is a shortage in the supply of facemasks inside South Korea at present. Travellers who wish to use a facemask while in South Korea should aim to bring their own supply with them.
Further advice and details on confirmed cases can be found on the Korean Ministry of Health and Welfare website in English and Korean. South Korea’s Center for Disease Control and Prevention (KCDC) also provides daily updates in English and in Korean.
Further advice on coronavirus is also available from Public Health England and on the TravelHealthPro website.
