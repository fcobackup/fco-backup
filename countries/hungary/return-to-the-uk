There are a growing number of commercial options to return to the UK from Hungary.
Countries neighbouring Hungary (Austria, Croatia, Romania, Serbia, Slovakia, Slovenia and Ukraine) also have certain restrictions in place. Check country-specific FCO Travel Advice for details. Keep up to date with information from your tour operator, transport or accommodation provider on the impact on any existing travel plans. You should also check with your airline or travel company for the latest information.
Flights
Budapest Airport remains open. Airlines continue to operate between London and Budapest on a daily basis. WizzAir and Ryanair are both running one flight each per day in both directions.
WizzAir is running three flights a week (on Tuesday, Thursday and Saturday) between London and Debrecen and two flights per week (on Tuesday and Saturday) between Birmingham and Budapest and between Liverpool and Budapest. WizzAir also flies between Budapest and Edinburgh three times a week, and between Budapest and Glasgow twice a week. Ryanair restarted flights between Edinburgh and Budapest, the East Midlands and Budapest and between Manchester and Budapest, flying twice a week. It will also fly between Bristol and Budapest twice a week starting 4 July. British Airways flights are still suspended until further notice.
You will need to pay for your return travel to the UK. If departure options are available but you cannot afford the travel costs and have exhausted all other options for getting funds, you may be eligible to apply for an emergency loan from the government. This is a last resort option and you would need to repay the loan when you are back in the UK.
For more information, you should contact Corporate Travel Management (CTM). CTM are a commercial partner of the FCO and are authorised to administer such loans on behalf of the FCO.
Your journey home: re-entering the UK
When you return, you must follow the rules for entering the UK. You:
need to provide your journey and contact details up to 48 hours before you’re due to arrive in the UK
are not allowed to leave the place you’re staying for the first 14 days you’re in the UK except in very limited situations (known as ‘self-isolating’)
See also the list of people who are exempt from the border rules.
The National Travel Health Network and Centre (NaTHNaC) also provides advice on how to stay safe as you travel by air.
