Entry rules in response to coronavirus (COVID-19)
Entry to Bulgaria
From 1 July 2021, Bulgaria introduced a new system for classifying travellers arriving in the country based on green, orange and red zones. Since 19 July 2021, the UK has been categorised as a ‘red zone’ country. Children under the age of 12 years old, are exempt from the requirement to present COVID-19 documents irrespective of which country they arrive from.
From 1 December 2021, UK nationals (and their family members) travelling from the UK (or any other European Union member state, European Economic Area country and Switzerland if also in the red zone) must provide the following COVID-19 documentation in order to be allowed entry into Bulgaria:
a vaccination certificate (Bulgaria will accept either certificate of completion of a two dose vaccine course (Pfizer-BioNTech, AstraZeneca, Moderna, Covishield, Sinopharm, Sinovac, Sputnik) or a certificate of receipt of a one dose vaccine (Janssen, Johnson & Johnson). In both cases immunization must have been completed 14 days prior to arrival; or
a negative PCR test performed within 72 hours before entry - this should include name, date of birth, details of the medical institution and date and time of the sample in English;
a certificate of recovery from COVID-19 (either PCR or rapid antigen test dated at least 11 days, but no more than 180 days, before arrival into Bulgaria, in English).
Those who do not present any of these documents will not be allowed to enter the country.
Bulgarian nationals and permanent long-term residents, as well as their family members who do not present any of the above listed documents will be allowed to enter Bulgaria. However, they will be required to complete a mandatory 10-day self-isolation. It is not possible to end this period of self-isolation early via testing.
From 28 November 2021, only Bulgarian nationals and permanent and long-term residents, as well as their family members, will be allowed to enter from the following countries: South Africa, Mozambique, Botswana, Lesotho, Namibia, Eswatini and Zimbabwe. They will be subject to a mandatory 10-day self-isolation and a mandatory antigen testing upon entry.
Children aged 12 to 18 arriving from a ‘red zone’ country must present a negative PCR test only on arrival to Bulgaria.
From 1 September 2021, foreign students holding a type ‘D’ visa for long-term residence for study purposes are eligible to enter Bulgaria, subject to holding the COVID-19 documentation detailed above.
Family members are defined by Bulgaria’s immigration rules, depending on whether the UK nationals are beneficiaries of the Withdrawal Agreement or not.
Family members of a UK national, legally resident in Bulgaria before 31 December 2020, are:
Husband, Wife or common law partner
Children under 18. This includes stepchildren of either parent and those adopted. Can also include older children up to 21 years old who are in full time education
There are also provisions under the rules for other family members who are normally part of the household who are reliant on the resident or Bulgarian national for care and/or accommodation
Family members of a UK national, legally resident in Bulgaria after 31 December 2020, are:
Husband / Wife

It is advisable to bring documentation to demonstrate the family relationship. Family members travelling separately may be turned away without documentary proof.
The measures are in force at all air, road, rail and sea border crossings into Bulgaria.
Exemptions, regardless of nationality, to the entry restrictions in Bulgaria for travellers from UK (and other red list countries) include medical workers, state officials and diplomats, persons traveling for humanitarian reasons, seasonal and tourist workers etc. Other categories of people who can enter Bulgaria without the need to submit documents for COVID-19 include: bus and lorry drivers, crews of vessels and aircraft, border workers, those transiting through the country, students who live in Greece, Turkey, Serbia, Romania or The Republic of North Macedonia and travel daily or at least once a week to Bulgaria for training purposes, travellers between Bulgaria and Romania and between Bulgaria and Czech Republic.
Further information on the full range of exemptions is available on the following Bulgarian Government web site (in Bulgarian). If you fall into one of the exempted categories, you should contact your travel operator in advance of travel for further information on how to demonstrate your exemption from the travel ban.
Many land borders crossings in the region are restricted or closed for passenger traffic. Furthermore, neighbouring countries are implementing additional health requirements for entry to or departure from Bulgaria including declarations and COVID-19 tests. You should check the relevant FCDO Travel Advice.
If you need to travel, plan ahead and before you travel check border information published by the Ministry of Interior (English and Bulgarian) before you travel.
Demonstrating your COVID-19 status
Bulgaria will accept the UK’s proof of COVID-19 recovery and vaccination record. If you are travelling with a printed PDF proof of vaccination status, it must date from 1 November to ensure that the certificate can be scanned successfully. Your NHS appointment card from vaccination centres is not designed to be used as proof of vaccination and should not be used to demonstrate your vaccine status.
