Hurricanes
Tropical storms Marco and Laura are forecast to affect the western and eastern provinces of Cuba respectively during the weekend of 22-23 August, bringing hazardous sea and weather conditions. Storm Laura is currently forecast to move from the east over central Provinces and reach Havana on 23 August. You can follow the storm on the National Hurricane Centre and you should follow the advice and instructions of local authorities, and announcements of the national authority, Defensa Civil.
The hurricane season in Cuba normally runs from June to November. You should monitor the progress of storms on the National Hurricane Centre website, follow local weather advisories and contact your travel company, cruise operator or local tour representative to check for any changes to travel arrangements.
See our Tropical Cyclones page for advice about how to prepare effectively and what to do if you’re likely to be affected by a hurricane or tropical cyclone.
The hurricane season in the Caribbean frequently coincides with heavy rains, which may cause flash floods and landslides. In the aftermath of a hurricane in Cuba, power, communications and water supplies can be disrupted. Even in holiday resorts, utility services can’t be guaranteed. In the event of extreme weather conditions flights to and from Cuba may be delayed or cancelled.
Earthquakes
Cuba is located in an active earthquake zone. Strong earthquakes occur infrequently and most seismic events pass unnoticed. If a natural disaster occurs, follow the advice of the local authorities.
To learn more about what to do before, during and after an earthquake, see this advice from the US Federal Emergency Management Agency.
