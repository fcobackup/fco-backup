You may travel throughout Greece, including to the islands.
If you are travelling via ferry, you will need to complete a health questionnaire and hand it to the ferry operator before boarding. The necessary forms will be provided by the operator: you should contact them directly if you need further information. Temperature checks may also be carried out before boarding; and it is obligatory to wear masks on all ferries, including on open air decks, where capacity is limited to allow for social distancing. No celebrations are allowed on board ferries.
If you are travelling by internal (domestic) flights, you are also required to wear masks throughout the journey.

If your vessel is arriving in Greece from another country, you must comply with specific requirements upon your first landing in Greece. No passengers are permitted on the vessel, except for the crew. Upon arrival, you must present to harbour authorities, who will require the completion of a health declaration, and mandatory testing (to be paid for by the occupants of each vessel).
Changes to what is open or permitted, including international travel options, are subject to change and may occur at short notice. Keep up to date with the latest information and advice from your travel contact or business partners, as well as the sources in this travel advice.

Healthcare in Greece
If you think you have symptoms, including a fever or respiratory difficulties such as shortness of breath or a cough, you should avoid visiting local health facilities, but contact a doctor remotely to see whether a test is recommended. There is likely to be a cost associated with this, for call out, examination and testing, which you will have to pay.
If you are staying in a hotel or resort, your accommodation provider will have a list of private doctors that they will call to assess your symptoms and conduct a COVID-19 test.
If you have arranged your own accommodation you can find details of English speaking, private doctors on our list of healthcare providers.
If you are tested and the result is positive, the Greek authorities will ask you to quarantine or self-isolate. You may be able to remain in your existing accommodation, or be required to transfer into a state hospital or other government-provided accommodation. All costs related to transfer to alternative accommodation and treatment at state healthcare facilities will be covered by the Greek Government.
