Cases of coronavirus (COVID-19) have been reported in Oman. The authorities have introduced a number of measures to limit the spread of the virus.
The Omani government has announced that anyone who entered Oman from 2 March 2020 is required to self-quarantine for 14 days. Failure to follow these instructions could result in prosecution.
The Omani government has also announced that from 18 March, the following places will be closed across Oman: mosques and other places of worship; events and conferences; all tourist sites (including wadis and picnic areas); all shops in shopping malls (except supermarkets, clinics, pharmacies and opticians); souqs and other traditional markets; restaurants and cafes (including in hotels) except for takeaway; gyms, spas and hairdressers. The government has stated that no public gatherings, including on beaches, should take place.
You should comply with any additional screening measures put in place by the local authorities. If you have any questions about these measures or the quarantine instructions, you can call the Ministry of Health in Oman on +968 2444 1999.
