Be prepared for your plans to change
No travel is risk-free during COVID-19. Countries may further restrict travel or bring in new rules at short notice, for example due to a new COVID-19 variant. Check with your travel company or airline for any transport changes which may delay your journey home.
If you test positive for COVID-19, you may need to stay where you are until you test negative. You may also need to seek treatment there.
Plan ahead and make sure you:
can access money
understand what your insurance will cover
can make arrangements to extend your stay and be away for longer than planned

Healthcare in Uganda
There are a number of public and private COVID-19 tests centres in Uganda. For further information on the outbreak in Uganda, please see the Ugandan Government COVID-19 Response website.
If a foreign national tests positive for COVID-19 and wishes to be repatriated for treatment outside of Uganda, they will be expected to cover the costs themselves.
For contact details for English speaking doctors, if you are running low on medication or require emergency medical treatment, you should contact one of the medical practitioners on this list. They will be able to discuss your situation over the phone and advise on the best course of action. Some hospitals and pharmacies are able to deliver medication to you. All major pharmacies in Kampala and surrounding towns are able to read and understand prescriptions issued by UK doctors. UK issued prescriptions are accepted but you should be aware that pharmacies in Uganda do not always stock the same range of medication found in UK pharmacies. British nationals are therefore advised to travel with adequate stocks of their medication for the duration of their stay in Uganda.
Your emotional and mental wellbeing is important. Read guidance on how to look after your mental wellbeing and mental health.
