Cases of coronavirus (COVID-19) have been confirmed in Belize. The government of Belize has announced a nationwide state of emergency for the country. This will go into effect at midnight on Wednesday, 1 April and will include a curfew from 8.00pm to 5.00am every day. The state of emergency is to last for 30 days in the first instance. For its duration, people will be advised to stay at home even during daylight hours and only to come out if absolutely necessary for shopping and doing essential business only. Supermarkets, grocery stores, banks and credit unions will all remain open. Cargo and essential imports will also continue to come into the country.
The Belize authorities will be strictly enforcing the state of emergency, physical distancing, self-isolation, quarantining and other such rules. Anyone who violates these may be liable for imprisonment for one year.
