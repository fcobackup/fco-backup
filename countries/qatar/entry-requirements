The information on this page covers the most common types of travel and reflects the UK government’s understanding of the rules currently in place. Unless otherwise stated, this information is for travellers using a full ‘British Citizen’ passport.
The authorities in the country or territory you’re travelling to are responsible for setting and enforcing the rules for entry. If you’re unclear about any aspect of the entry requirements, or you need further reassurance, you should contact the embassy, high commission or consulate of the country or territory you’re travelling to.
You should also consider checking with your transport provider or travel company to make sure your passport and other travel documents meet their requirements.
Entry rules in response to coronavirus
Entry to Qatar
From 1 August, British nationals currently outside of Qatar and holding a Qatar residence permit are allowed to enter the country, subject to receiving prior approval. Residents’ entry will be organised based on a series of priorities, and a request to return permit must be received through the Qatar Portal website.
From 29 November, any resident leaving Qatar will automatically receive their Exceptional Entry Permit, and there will no longer be a need to apply through the Qatar Portal website. This permit will be available to print from the Ministry of Interior website once the resident’s departure has been registered.
For residents returning to Qatar after 29 November, the quarantine period will be for 7 days. For those returning from a country not included on the Qatar Ministry of Public Health’s ‘Green List’, a mandatory 7 day hotel quarantine will apply. This will be at a government-approved hotel and must be booked through Discover Qatar.
From 22 December, all residents arriving on flights originating in the UK will be required to stay at a designated hotel for their quarantine period. These must be booked through Discover Qatar, where information is also available on moving any reservation already made for another hotel.
Further information on Qatar’s entry and arrival requirements can be found on the Ministry of Public Health website.
Following the opening of the air, land and sea borders between Qatar and Saudi Arabia, all arrivals to Qatar from the Abu Samra border crossing are required to undergo a COVID-19 test and obtain a virus-free certificate no more than 72 hours before travel. Further information can be found from the Government Communications Office statement here.
Transiting Qatar
Transit passengers travelling on to another destination can still transfer through Qatar, and many flights continue to operate. You should check with your airline or travel company for the latest information if you are planning to leave or transit through Qatar. Flights are subject to change or cancellation at short notice.
Whilst in transit at Hamad International Airport, you will receive regular thermal screening and temperature checks.
You should contact your tour operator, transport or accommodation provider for information on the impact on any existing travel plans.
Testing on arrival
Thermal screening and temperature checks will take place on arrival, as will a swab test for coronavirus.
Quarantine requirements
With effect from 29 November, all residents returning from the UK will need to quarantine for 7 days in a government-approved hotel, at their own expense. This must be booked through Discover Qatar.
From 22 December, all residents arriving on flights originating in the UK will be required to stay at a designated hotel for their quarantine period. These must be booked through Discover Qatar, where information is also available on moving any reservation already made for another hotel.
Data collection
Downloading Qatar’s track and trace app, Ehteraz, is mandatory for everyone in Qatar. You will be asked to show the app upon arrival.
Regular entry requirements
Visas
You can get a free 30-day tourist visa-waiver on arrival in Qatar. If you’re travelling for any purpose other than tourism, and/or hold one of the other types of British passport, you must get a visa before you travel.
If you need to stay longer than 30 days, you must extend your visa waiver before it expires through the Ministry of Interior. If you fail to do so, you may receive an overstay fine, which must be paid before leaving Qatar.
You can find further information on visa requirements and extensions on the Qatar Ministry of Interior website
Passport validity
Your passport should be valid for a minimum period of 6 months from the date of entry into Qatar.
UK Emergency Travel Documents
UK Emergency Travel Documents (ETDs) are not valid for entry into Qatar. However, ETDs are accepted for airside transit and exit from Qatar.
Living and working in Qatar
If you’re applying for a residence permit, you will have to undergo a medical test including blood tests and a chest X-ray. The tests screen for diseases including, but not restricted to, HIV/AIDS, Tuberculosis, Hepatitis B and C. Testing positive may lead to further tests and possible deportation.
