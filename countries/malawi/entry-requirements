This page reflects the UK government’s understanding of current rules for people travelling on a full ‘British Citizen’ passport, for the most common types of travel.
The authorities in Malawi set and enforce entry rules. For further information contact the embassy, high commission or consulate of the country or territory you’re travelling to. You should also consider checking with your transport provider or travel company to make sure your passport and other travel documents meet their requirements.
Entry rules in response to coronavirus (COVID-19)
Entry to Malawi
Malawian airspace remains open for a limited number of commercial flights.
On 27 August, Malawi re-opened its borders to non-residents and removed its restrictions on travel to and from Bangladesh, India, Pakistan and Brazil.
Testing/screening on arrival
If you’re eligible for entry, you will need to provide proof of a negative COVID-19 test taken within 72 hours of your arrival.
You should not use the NHS testing service to get a test in order to facilitate your travel to another country. You should arrange to take a private test.
You may also be tested for COVID-19 on arrival at your own expense. Passengers may be required to remain at the airport or a testing centre until their COVID-19 test results are known, usually within 24 hours.
Current information is available from the Malawi Ministry of Health Facebook page.
Quarantine requirements
Individuals testing positive for coronavirus on arrival may be taken for treatment at a government facility.
All other individuals will be required to self-monitor for COVID-19 signs and symptoms for 14 days after arrival. This allows the traveller to interact with others but they will be required to strictly observe physical distancing and hand hygiene, and must always use a mask in public.
Testing/screening on departure
Anyone departing Malawi needs to provide a valid “Travel Certificate” to immigration showing that a negative COVID-19 test has been taken at any of the five government-designated testing centres within 72 hours of departure. Digital verification of COVID-19 certificates has also been introduced, in line with the Africa CDC’s Trusted Travel framework.
Testing centres are located at a number of Government approved facilities, including: Mzuzu Central Hospital (Mzuzu), Kamuzu Central Hospital (Lilongwe), Public Health Institute (Lilongwe), Queen Elizabeth Central Hospital (Blantyre) and Zomba Central Hospital (Zomba).
Please seek guidance from your local medical provider on how you can obtain a COVID-19 test. Mandatory COVID-19 testing will also take place on departure if you fail to produce a valid negative test certificate or if the airport staff judge you to display COVID-19 symptoms. This test will be at your own expense and may delay your departure.
Regular entry requirements
Visas
You need a visa to enter Malawi as a visitor. You can find details of the application process on the Malawi High Commission website. The Malawi authorities strongly advise you to get a visa before travel. If you can’t get a visa before travel, you can get a visa on arrival at any port of entry. For more information check with the Malawi High Commission in London.
Passport validity
Your passport should be valid for minimum period of 6 months on arrival in Malawi.
UK Emergency Travel Documents
UK Emergency Travel Documents (ETDs) are accepted for entry, airside transit, and exit from Malawi. ETDs must be valid for 6 months for entry into Malawi if the holder is not a returning resident.
Yellow fever certificate requirements
Check whether you need a yellow fever certificate by visiting the National Travel Health Network and Centre’s TravelHealthPro website.
