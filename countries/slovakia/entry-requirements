The information on this page covers the most common types of travel and reflects the UK government’s understanding of the rules currently in place. Unless otherwise stated, this information is for travellers using a full ‘British Citizen’ passport.
The authorities in the country or territory you’re travelling to are responsible for setting and enforcing the rules for entry. If you’re unclear about any aspect of the entry requirements, or you need further reassurance, you’ll need to contact the embassy, high commission or consulate of the country or territory you’re travelling to.
You should also consider checking with your transport provider or travel company to make sure your passport and other travel documents meet their requirements.
Entry rules in response to coronavirus
Entry to Slovakia
It is no longer compulsory to enter state quarantine on arrival. You should bring with you a negative COVID-19 test and self-isolate on arrival. The exception to this is if you have spent the previous 14 days only in countries on an approved list. These are currently Hungary, Austria, Czech Republic, Poland, Germany, Lichtenstein, Switzerland, Slovenia, Croatia, Bulgaria, Greece, Cyprus, Malta, Lithuania, Latvia, Estonia, Finland, Norway, Denmark, Iceland, Monaco, Montenegro, and the Faroe Islands. See the Slovak Ministry of Foreign Affairs website for latest information.
If you arrive from the UK or any other country which is not currently listed, or if you visited an unlisted country within the previous 14 days, you will need to be able to show to the police at the border a negative COVID-19 (RT-PCR) test no older than 96 hours in English, German, Czech or Slovak or translated into one of these languages. If there are no police controls at the border, you must present your negative test to the nearest regional Public Health Authority office without delay. You must then enter self-isolation. People living in the same household as you must also enter self-isolation. You must register with your regional Public Health Authority office, who will contact you to arrange a further test after at least 5 days. When you receive this second negative test result, you may end your self-isolation. You can also request a test via the Slovak government website (in Slovak only).
Transiting Slovakia
Exemptions on transit for EU nationals continue to apply equally to UK nationals. You may transit Slovakia in order to return to your country of residence without the need for a negative COVID-19 test, entering self-isolation or applying for permission from the Slovak authorities. You must complete your transit within eight hours and enter Slovakia from Austria, the Czech Republic, Hungary or Poland. If you transit from Ukraine, you will need to show a recent negative COVID-19 test as above .
Transport
Slovakia closed its international airports at Bratislava, Kosice and Poprad to scheduled passenger flights, but flights are beginning to resume to certain permitted destinations (not UK).
Border crossings
As of 20 June, all land border crossings between Slovakia and Austria, Hungary, Poland and the Czech Republic are open.
Border checks remain in place with Ukraine, and the following crossing points are operational: Ubla- Maly Bereznyj, Vysne Nemecke-Uzhorod
See the Slovak Police Facebook page (in Slovak only) for latest information.
Regular entry requirements
Passport validity  
Your passport should be valid for the proposed duration of your stay; you do not need any additional period of validity on your passport beyond this.
The rules on travel will stay the same until 31 December 2020.
Make sure your passport is in a presentable state before you travel. The Slovak authorities can refuse entry if your passport is worn or damaged, or looks as if it’s been tampered with.
Visas
If you hold a British Citizen passport, you don’t need a visa to enter Slovakia. If you’re planning a stay of longer than 3 months, see our Living in Slovakia guide and contact the Slovak Embassy if you have further questions.
The rules on travel will stay the same until 31 December 2020.
Registering with the Slovak authorities
If you plan to stay in Slovakia for a longer period of time, you should register with the police within 3 days of arrival. You’ll need your passport, 2 photographs and proof of accommodation. You’ll have an option to apply for a Slovak ‘green card’, which can be used as proof of your ID, while your passport is kept in a safe place. Visit the website of Ministry of Interior of the Slovak Republic for further information.
UK Emergency Travel Documents
UK Emergency Travel Documents (ETDs) are accepted for entry, airside transit and exit from Slovakia. They are also accepted for a return to Slovakia if you normally live there.
