Following civil unrest across Chile a state of emergency has been declared in Santiago and other cities. You should expect to see a heavy military presence during this time. Further demonstrations are expected in Santiago and other cities in the coming days. The Central Union of Workers has called for a strike on Wednesday 23 and Thursday 24 October.
All of Santiago’s public transport – including the metro and buses – is running a very limited service at this time. Public transport in other cities may be affected. Some banks, shopping malls and supermarkets are operating reduced hours or remaining closed. Night-time curfews have been put in place in urban areas; specific timings and locations are subject to change daily. You should follow the instructions and advice of the local authorities, observe any curfews in place, remain vigilant, monitor local media for updates and avoid protests and demonstrations.
Some domestic and international flights have been delayed or cancelled in recent days. You should contact your airline prior to travel. If you need to travel from Santiago airport during curfew, show your boarding pass to the authorities as this should ensure safe passage to the airport. If you arrive at Santiago airport during the curfew the airport authorities will give you a “salvoconducto” (safe conduct pass) to be able to leave the airport. Airline crews should show their official credentials to be able to travel to and from the airport during curfew.
Various land border crossing points between Chile and the neighbouring countries of Argentina, Bolivia and Peru are currently being closed overnight. If you plan to cross any land border point, check with authorities for exact closure times prior to travel.
Around 80,000 British nationals visit Chile each year. Most visits to Chile are trouble-free. Opportunistic street crime can be a problem in towns and cities, and in areas popular with tourists.
Take care of your personal belongings at all times and be aware of your surroundings. Carry a photocopy of your passport and keep the original document in a safe place. See Crime
