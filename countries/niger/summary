The FCDO advise against all travel to the whole country.

FCDO advises against all travel to Niger, including the capital city of Niamey, for security reasons.
Tell FCDO you’re in Niger
If you are a British national in Niger, FCDO advises you to register your presence. Once you have registered, we will share important updates, including any options to leave.
Leaving Niger
There are no commercial flights known to be arriving or departing Niger and the situation remains volatile.
The French government announced on 1 August that “France is preparing the evacuation of its nationals and those European nationals who would like to leave the country”. Read the evacuation statement on the French government Twitter account.
If you cannot leave Niger
If you cannot leave, or decide to stay in Niger, you should:
follow the curfew, which is in place between midnight and 5 am
avoid protests, gatherings and any military activity
stay indoors where possible
be ready to leave if there is an opportunity
Monitor this travel advice and other media as the situation is changing fast. Follow and contact FCDO travel on Twitter, Facebook and Instagram. You can also get email notifications when this travel advice is updated.

Security situation
There has been a military takeover in Niger, which has led to protests and unrest.
The group who organised the demonstration on 30 July (M62) have called for another on Thursday 3 August, Niger Independence Day. Protests can be violent and the situation could change quickly without warning.
Due to the security situation the British Embassy in Niamey is temporarily reducing the number of its staff.
