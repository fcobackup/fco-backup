On 4-6 September Hurricane Dorian passed the south-east coast of the USA, causing heavy rain, storm surge and hurricane-force winds. States of emergency remain in effect across parts of Florida, Georgia, North Carolina, South Carolina and Virginia and there are power cuts in some areas. Life-threatening storm surge and dangerous winds are expected to continue along portions of the North Carolina coast, portions of south-east Virginia and the southern Chesapeake Bay, where water levels could rise well in advance of the arrival of strong winds. You should monitor the progress of approaching storms on the US National Hurricane Center website and follow instructions issued by the local authorities.
