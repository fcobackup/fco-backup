Transport risks 
Road travel 
If you are planning to drive in Norway, see information on driving abroad and check the rules of the road in the RAC’s Norway guide. The guide lists driving regulations and other legal requirements you need to be aware of.
You can use a UK photocard driving licence to drive in Norway for up to 90 days. If you still have a paper driving licence, you may need to update it to a photocard licence or get the correct version of the international driving permit (IDP) as well.
Drink-driving is a serious offence in Norway. If you are tested and found to have a quarter of England’s legal limit of alcohol in your system you may get a fine and possible imprisonment. There are frequent roadside checks for alcohol.
You must use winter tyres with a minimum 3-millimetre (mm) tread if there is snow or ice covering the roads. You may also need to use studded tyres or snow chains. Truck drivers must use winter tyres with a minimum 5mm tread and have enough snow chains. 
You can get the full tyre requirements from Norway’s State Highways. 
Keep your headlights on, but dipped, during the daytime all year round in all places. 
On roads that are not marked with a priority sign (yellow diamond), you must give way to traffic coming from the right. 
If you commit a driving offence, you could get an on-the-spot fine of up to 10,000 Norwegian krone. 
Arctic travel 
Nearly half of Norway is in the Arctic Circle, including some very remote areas of land and sea. Emergency medical assistance and search and rescue are limited in these areas. See Arctic travel safety advice. 
Extreme weather and natural disasters 
Extreme weather, floods and landslides can happen. You should follow the advice of local authorities. 
Find out what you can do to prepare for and respond to extreme weather and natural hazards.  
Climate and temperature 
The weather can change quickly, producing Arctic conditions even in summer on exposed mountain tops. Extreme weather can cause floods and landslides. 
The winter is long and can last well into April. Temperatures can drop to -25°C and below. There is also a high wind chill factor, particularly in unsheltered areas and mountain ranges. Weather conditions can worsen quickly. 
Wildfires
There is a risk of wildfires, especially during hot and dry periods. Police enforce bans on campfires in many areas.
