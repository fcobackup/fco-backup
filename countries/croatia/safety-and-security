Crime
Crime levels are low and violent crime is rare.
Some tourists have been the victims of overcharging in so-called ‘Gentlemen’s Clubs’, sometimes amounting to thousands of Euros. Victims can be threatened with violence if they refuse to pay.
Take care in busy tourist areas, where pickpockets are known to operate. Avoid carrying large amounts of cash. Don’t leave valuables unattended, particularly on the beach. Use a hotel safe if possible.
Report all incidents of crime to the local police station and get a police report.
Local travel
If you’re planning to travel outside the normal tourist resorts, beware of unexploded mines in war-affected areas like Eastern Slavonia, Brodsko-Posavska County, Karlovac County, areas around Zadar County and in more remote areas of the Plitvice Lakes National Park. For more information about mine-affected areas visit the Civil Protection website (in Croatian only) or contact the Civil Protection offices.
If you’re travelling in these areas, avoid leaving cultivated land or marked paths. If in doubt seek local advice.
If you’re hiking in the mountains, seek expert advice from local guides, however tame the mountain might seem to you. The weather in the Croatian mountains can change quickly, even in summer and temperatures can get very low overnight. There have been reports of hikers getting lost in the mountains when they have gone out alone and left marked paths. You can find tips about mountaineering and direct numbers for regional rescue teams on the Croatian Mountain Rescue page here and on Twitter HrvatskaGSS , as well as their maps. If you get into trouble, call the emergency number 112 and the Croatian Mountain Rescue Service will help you as best they can.
Road travel
In 2019 there were 297 road deaths in the Croatia (source: Department for Transport). This equates to 7.3 road deaths per 100,000 of population and compares to the UK average of 2.6 road deaths per 100,000 of population in 2019.

Licences and documents
UK driving licence holders may drive in Croatia on their UK licence for a period of up to 12 months. An International Driving Permit is not required.
If you bring your own or rented vehicle into the country, you may be asked to provide proof of ownership by presenting a V5 log book both at the border or while driving. If you fail to produce this when asked you will be refused entry or the car might be impounded until you can prove ownership. Contact the Croatian Embassy in London if you have more detailed questions about bringing a vehicle in to the country. The British Embassy is unable to help individuals attempting to bring vehicles into Croatia who do not have the correct documents at the border.
If you’re driving to or through Bosnia and Herzegovina, including the 20km strip of coastline at Neum on the Dalmatian coastal highway, make sure that you have the appropriate paperwork for your vehicle “Zelená karta” Green card that includes cover for Bosnia and Herzegovina. You can’t buy insurance for Bosnia and Herzegovina at the Neum border crossing.

Sea travel
There is zero tolerance on alcohol consumption if you are in charge of a yacht or boat. The penalties for being caught drunk in charge of a boat are heavy. Yacht/boat skippers have been arrested for entering a non-designated entry port without informing the authorities. If you are sailing to Croatia enter only at a designated port/harbour. If this is not possible, contact the local harbour master or the police before entering.
The Croatian Government requires all skippers to have an International Certificate of Competence (ICC). The recognised body for the issue of ICCs in the UK is the Royal Yachting Association (RYA).
