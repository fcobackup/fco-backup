This page has information on travelling to Cape Verde. Check what you must do to return to the UK.
This page reflects the UK government’s understanding of current rules for people travelling on a full ‘British Citizen’ passport, for the most common types of travel.
The authorities in Cape Verde set and enforce entry rules.
All travellers
You need to complete a Traveller Pre-registration Form and, if arriving by air, pay the airport security tax (TSA) before you travel to Cape Verde (see Visas ).
You’ll also need to complete an International Travel Form to enter or travel through Cape Verde. Complete one form per person.
If you’re fully vaccinated
If you’re fully vaccinated, you can enter Cape Verde without needing to test or quarantine but you will need to present proof of your vaccination status when you check-in for your flight to Cape Verde.
Proof of vaccination status
You must present proof that you have been fully vaccinated when you check-in for your flight to Cape Verde.
You qualify as fully vaccinated if you have had both doses of the COVID vaccine plus the booster (or one dose of the Janssen vaccine plus the booster) at least 14 days before you travel.
Cape Verde will accept the UK’s printed version of proof of COVID-19 recovery and vaccination record and proof of COVID-19 vaccination issued in the Crown Dependencies. They will not accept digital proof. Your NHS appointment card from vaccination centres is not designed to be used as proof of vaccination and should not be used to demonstrate your vaccine status.
If you’re not fully vaccinated
If you’re not fully vaccinated, you’ll need to show proof of a negative PCR test (taken no more than 72 hours before you travel) or an antigen test (taken no more than 48 hours before you travel) when you check-in for your flight to Cape Verde. See information on getting a test before you travel.
If you’ve had COVID-19 in the past year
If you’re not fully vaccinated but have tested positive for COVID-19 in the last year, you can enter Cape Verde with a COVID-19 recovery certificate showing you recovered from COVID-19 no less than 11 days and no more than 180 days before you travel. You will not need to take a test.
You can use your UK COVID Pass (printed version only) to demonstrate proof of COVID-19 recovery when checking in for your flight or ferry.
Children and young people
Children and young people aged between 13 and 17 can enter Cape Verde provided they can show:
they have had 2 doses of the vaccine (or one dose of the Janssen vaccine) at least 14 days and no more than 270 days before they travel, or
they have a COVID-19 recovery certificate showing they have recovered from COVID-19 no less than 11 days and no more than 180 days before travel, or
they have proof of a negative PCR test (taken no more than 72 hours before travel) or an antigen test (taken no more than 48 hours before travel). See information on getting a test before you travel.
Children aged 12 and under are exempt from the testing and vaccination requirements.
If you’re transiting through Cape Verde
If you are transiting through Cape Verde on your way to another country and staying in the airport (airside), you do not need to show proof of your vaccination status or take a COVID-19 test.
You should still check the COVID-19 entry requirements for your final destination.
For further information on travelling to Cape Verde, see the Cape Verde government’s Travel Guide.
Check your passport and travel documents before you travel
Check with your travel provider to make sure your passport and other travel documents meet their requirements.
Passport validity
Your passport should be valid for a minimum period of 6 months from the date of entry into Cape Verde.
Visas
If you have a British Citizen passport, you can enter Cape Verde as a visitor for up to 30 days without a visa.
Before you travel, you must complete a Traveller Pre-registration form and, if arriving by air, pay the airport security tax (TSA). This does not apply to children aged 1 and under or those who are resident in Cape Verde.
If you are travelling with a tour operator, check whether they have arrangements in place to complete the form on your behalf.
For further information on the pre-registration process, see this information leaflet.
If you’re travelling on a different type of British passport, are travelling for a purpose other than tourism, or intending to stay longer than 90 days, you should check the entry requirements with the nearest Cape Verde Embassy .
UK Emergency Travel Documents
UK Emergency Travel Documents (ETDs) are accepted for entry, airside transit and exit from Cape Verde.
Yellow fever certificate requirements
Check whether you need a yellow fever certificate by visiting the National Travel Health Network and Centre’s TravelHealthPro website.
