Cases of coronavirus (COVID-19) have been confirmed in Albania. The Albanian authorities have introduced a number of measures to limit the spread of the virus.
International travel
All borders are closed (with the exception of freight) to all nationals.
All flights to and from Albania have been suspended until further notice. Following these measures, and those taken by neighbouring countries, there are now no commercial means of leaving Albania to return to the UK. For information on how to return to the UK from Albania, see Return to the UK
We know this is concerning for British people trying to leave Albania. The UK government is working closely with airlines, the Albanian authorities and other governments to make sure options are available to return to the UK as soon as possible.
What to do
If you cannot leave Albania at this time, you should:
follow the advice of local authorities, including local measures to help minimise your risk of exposure to coronavirus;
find accommodation that’s suitable for your needs;
keep in regular contact with family and friends at home, so they know you are safe and well.
Keep up to date with information from your tour operator, transport or accommodation provider on the impact on any existing travel plans. If you need further information about entry requirements, contact the local immigration authorities or the nearest Albanian Embassy/High Commission/Consulate. You should also check with your airline or travel company for the latest information.
People who have travelled to Italy or Greece in the past 14 days must self-isolate. Failure to do so will result in a Euro 5,000 fine. The state and military police are carrying out spot checks on the streets.
