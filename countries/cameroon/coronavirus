Healthcare in Cameroon
Pharmacies have a green cross on a panel. Most are extremely helpful to clients. Pharmacies in Cameroon tend to accept prescriptions drawn up in the UK. Not all pharmacies have full stocks so you should be prepared to have to visit more than one for some drugs â€“ a pharmacy will usually advise you on other possibilities nearby. Most supermarkets do not have a pharmacy inside. If you are hospitalised in Cameroon and need treatment of any kind, you, or an accompanying person, will have to visit a pharmacy (usually in the hospital) to buy the items (PPE bedding etc) and drugs first and then return to the ward before you can be treated. Not all pharmacies are open after 8pm. Pharmacies on call will usually have a display sign on the windows or doors. If not on call, the pharmacy will carry information on the nearest pharmacy on call. View Health for further details on healthcare in Cameroon.
You should contact local authorities for information on COVID-19 testing facilities.
