This page has information on travelling to New Zealand. Check what you must do to return to the UK.
This page reflects the UK government’s understanding of current rules for people travelling on a full ‘British Citizen’ passport from the UK, for the most common types of travel.
The authorities in New Zealand set and enforce entry rules.
COVID-19 entry restrictions
New Zealand’s borders are re-opening throughout 2022.
The New Zealand Government’s 5-step plan to re-open its borders, phased by country and visa status, commenced on 27 February 2022.
See the New Zealand Government’s COVID-19 website for further guidance on entry requirements.
If the phased border re-opening does not yet apply to you, you may still be able to travel to New Zealand if you are considered to have a critical purpose to travel. Visit the Immigration New Zealand website for criteria. The website also includes information on how to submit a request for travel to New Zealand.
From 1 April 2022 travellers arriving into New Zealand by air must complete the Traveller Declaration and be issued a New Zealand Traveller Pass before travelling to New Zealand.
Start your declaration as soon as you can, to ensure you have time to complete it before you travel.
Travellers will need to provide:
Passport details
Flight information
Proof of vaccination
Travel history for 14 days prior to arriving in New Zealand
Contact details in New Zealand
Emergency contact details.
You need to show your Traveller Pass when you check-in at the airport, and to Customs when you arrive in New Zealand. It can be printed out or saved on your mobile device.
See the New Zealand Government’s Traveller Declaration website for further information.
All travellers
You do not need a visa to enter New Zealand as a visitor for up to 6 months, but you will need to get a New Zealand Electronic Travel Authority (NZeTA) before you travel. The New Zealand Government, have commenced a 5-step reopening plan. Visit the New Zealand Government COVID-19 website for full border re-opening requirements.
The NZeTA costs NZD $9 if applying via the dedicated mobile app, or NZD $12 if completed online. You will also need to pay an International Visitor Conservation and Tourism Levy (IVL) of NZD $35 when you apply. Once issued, the NZeTA is valid for up to two years. The New Zealand immigration authorities recommend that applicants allow up to 72 hours for processing.
On arrival in New Zealand, you will also need to satisfy the Immigration Officer that you meet the criteria for visa-free entry, which includes having an onward ticket and sufficient funds to support you during your stay. You can check the full criteria on the New Zealand Immigration website.
New Zealand’s immigration rules are strict, particularly regarding employment. Visitors cannot work in New Zealand.
For more information about visas, visit the New Zealand Immigration website or contact the nearest New Zealand High Commission.
If you’re fully vaccinated
Non-New Zealand citizens aged 17-years and over arriving into New Zealand, including New Zealand permanent residents and temporary visa holders, must be fully vaccinated. This means travellers need to have had a full course of any of the COVID-19 vaccines that have been approved by a foreign government or approval authority, and which are accepted by New Zealand. You need to have had the last dose at least 14 days before you arrive in New Zealand. Difference vaccines require a different number of doses to be considered a full course. Check the New Zealand COVID-19 website for full vaccination requirements.
Eligible travellers entering New Zealand will be given a pack of rapid antigen tests (RATs) with instructions for use, at the airport. Please see New Zealand Government COVID-19 for full details.
Proof of vaccination status
If you are a non-New Zealand Citizen, you must present proof that you have been fully vaccinated to enter New Zealand if you are aged 17 years or over. You will need to upload proof of your vaccination status to your New Zealand Traveller Declaration.
You need a digital vaccine passport or another form of electronic or paper document from a government health authority confirming you have had a full COVID-19 vaccine course. New Zealand will accept the UK’s proof of COVID-19 recovery and vaccination record and proof of COVID-19 vaccination issued in the Crown Dependencies. For full details, visit the New Zealand Government website. Your evidence must confirm your last dose was at least 14 days before departure for New Zealand.
Your NHS appointment card from vaccination centres is not designed to be used as proof of vaccination and should not be used to demonstrate your vaccine status.
You should check that your first name and your surname on your passport match how they are displayed by your NHS COVID Pass at least 2 weeks before you travel. If the names are different, contact your GP practice to have your details updated.
Residents of the Cook Islands
The current quarantine free travel agreements between New Zealand and the Cook Islands may be fully or partially paused at any time.
You should check the New Zealand government COVID-19 website for details. If your travel plans are disrupted, you should contact your airline.
You need to spend 10 full days before your date of departure in either New Zealand or the Cook Islands, meaning you can travel on day 11 onwards. Travellers from the Cook Islands are exempt from the New Zealand Government COVID-19 pre-departure testing requirements.
For more information please visit the New Zealand government COVID-19 website.
If you’re not fully vaccinated
Only those with an exemption or who meet one of the following criteria do not need to have evidence that they have met COVID-19 vaccination requirements:
a New Zealand Citizen
aged 16 years and under
cannot be vaccinated for medical reasons - you will need electronic or paper evidence from a medical practitioner
a refugee arriving in New Zealand for the first time
a citizen of Afghanistan and you have been evacuated
are arriving from Antarctica
For details on who is eligible to apply and how to apply for an exemption please see the New Zealand Government COVID-19 website.
Some travellers may be able to get an exemption if they are travelling to New Zealand from a country with no, or limited access to COVID-19 vaccines. See the New Zealand Ministry of Health website.
Unvaccinated travellers, and those who do not meet New Zealand’s vaccination requirements, who are eligible to enter New Zealand will be required to enter Managed Isolation and Quarantine.
If you’ve had COVID-19 in the past year
You must meet COVID-19 vaccination requirements to travel to New Zealand, even if you have had COVID-19.
You must have had a full course of any of the COVID-19 vaccines that have been approved by a government health authority or approval authority.
Children and young people
Children aged 16 and under are exempt from the vaccination requirement to enter New Zealand. Children aged 2 years (24 months) and under are exempt from taking a pre-departure test. Children over the age of 2 years (24 months) will need evidence of a negative pre-departure test.
If you’re transiting through New Zealand
Transiting is when you pass through one country on the way to your final destination.
People from visa waiver nationalities on a transit visa waiver transiting to or from Australia and people departing a Pacific country or territory to return home, do not need a transit visa as long as they have a confirmed flight out of New Zealand within 24 hours to a port which will accept them.
In most cases, transit passengers must hold an Electronic Travel Authority (ETA) or transit ETA before travel. These are applied for online. See Information about NZeTA for further detail.
If the passport holder is not from a visa-waiver or transit visa-waiver country or territory, or covered by one of the situations listed above, then they will need to apply for a transit visa. Due to COVID-19, Immigration New Zealand is not currently accepting paper applications for transit visas so have put a temporary process in place for submitting applications by email.
The process for applying for a transit visa via email is available on the Immigration New Zealand website - transits.
If you are staying airside while transiting through New Zealand you do not need to provide a negative COVID-19 pre-departure test (but you may need to be tested as per the requirements of your destination country).
Exemptions
You may be able to travel to New Zealand while the border is reopening in a phased approach if you are considered to have a critical purpose to travel. Please see the Immigration New Zealand website for criteria. The website also includes information on how to submit a request for travel to New Zealand.

Visas
You do not need a visa to enter New Zealand as a visitor for up to 6 months, but you will need to get a New Zealand Electronic Travel Authority (NZeTA) before you travel. The New Zealand government has, however, introduced a temporary border closure at this time.
UK Emergency Travel Documents
UK Emergency Travel Documents (ETDs) are valid for entry into New Zealand when accompanied by a permanent residence, work or study visa. ETDs are accepted for holidaymakers as long as New Zealand is not the final destination. ETDs are also accepted for airside transit and exit from New Zealand.
Quarantine and bio security
New Zealand has very strict bio-security regulations. It is illegal to import most food-stuffs (meat and meat products, honey, fruit, dairy produce) and strict penalties are handed out to those breaking these rules. Take care when importing wood products, golf clubs, footwear, tents, fishing equipment and items made from animal skin. The immigration arrivals card has full details. If in doubt, declare items to a Ministry of Agriculture official or dump them in one of the bins available at the airport. Failure to comply with these regulations can result in a heavy fine of up to $100,000 or imprisonment.
Medication
There are some restrictions on bringing medication into New Zealand. Visit the New Zealand Customs website for more information. If you arrive in New Zealand with any prescription medicines, you must declare it on your passenger arrival card.
All codeine-containing products are classified as prescription only medication (a controlled drug). Codeine is found in many pain relieving medications. You can import controlled drugs for personal use, subject to declaring them on arrival into New Zealand to the Customs Service and demonstrating they have been lawfully supplied for the treatment of yourself or someone under your care. More details on these requirements can be found on the New Zealand Customs website.
