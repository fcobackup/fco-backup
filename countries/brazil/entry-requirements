This page reflects the UK government’s understanding of current rules for people travelling on a full ‘British Citizen’ passport, for the most common types of travel.
The authorities in Brazil set and enforce entry rules. For further information contact the embassy, high commission or consulate of the country or territory you’re travelling to. You should also consider checking with your transport provider or travel company to make sure your passport and other travel documents meet their requirements.
Entry rules in response to coronavirus
Entry to Brazil
Entry by air
Aircraft passengers who have been in the UK, South Africa or India in the 14 days prior to arriving in Brazil must quarantine (for 14 days) at the first city of arrival into Brazil. You will not be permitted to board connecting flights to other cities in Brazil. If your final destination in Brazil is not the city in which your international flight first lands, you may wish to book an alternative routing.
Brazil has temporarily suspended all direct flights from or via the UK, and has temporarily suspended permission for foreigners who have been in the UK during the previous 14 days to board flights to Brazil. There are exemptions, including for resident foreigners, close family members of Brazilian nationals (partners/spouses, children, and parents/guardians), accredited government officials, and professionals working for international organisations. This exemption is subject to a requirement to quarantine on arrival in Brazil for 14 days. Some British nationals have been denied boarding by airlines. You should check with the airline before buying a ticket to confirm you will be allowed to board.
Entry is subject to regular entry requirements. Anyone travelling to Brazil by air needs to present to the airline company at check-in documentary evidence of a negative PCR test for COVID-19 taken within 72 hours of boarding in English, Spanish or Portuguese. All children under the age of 2 are exempt from the requirement to present a negative test. Children under the age of 12 who are accompanied by adult(s) who have proof of a negative test are also exempt.
With effect from 30 December 2020, all travellers to Brazil are required to complete a Travelers Health Declaration form within 72 hours of boarding. This can be done online. The English version is available here.
Further information is available on the website of Brazil’s Consulate General.
Entry by land
Brazil has closed some of its land borders, except to Brazilian citizens, resident foreign nationals and foreign spouses, children, parents or guardians of a Brazilian national. The land border with Paraguay is now open.
Transiting: If you’re in a bordering country and need to cross the land border to board a flight back to your country of residence, you should get in touch with the British Embassy or Consular. You will be permitted to enter Brazil with authorisation from the Federal Police following an official request from the Embassy and on presentation of flight tickets. You should travel straight to the airport once in Brazil.
Sea ports
The Brazilian government has also imposed a ban on foreigners disembarking in any port or other maritime location on Brazilian territory regardless of their nationality. The restriction does not apply to resident foreigners and foreign spouses, children, parents or custodians of a Brazilian national.
Disembarking will only be permitted when medical assistance is required or to catch a connecting flight back to the country of residence.
Transiting Brazil
Passengers are allowed to freely transit as long as they do not leave the international airport area and have a ticket for onward travel. If you intend to transit by land, please read Entry by land.
Visas
From 3 November 2020, the Brazilian government resumed counting visitor length of stay. They had previously suspended this at the start of the pandemic. Anyone whose 90 days immigration deadline would have fallen between the suspension period of 16 March 2020 to 2 November 2020 will not be fined. If your 90 days expired on 3 November 2020 or later, you might be fined for overstaying. If you wish to extend your tourist visa, you should contact the Policia Federal.
Regular entry requirements
Visas
British nationals can normally enter Brazil without a visa as a tourist. For further information about visas, see the website of the Brazilian Consulate in London.
Make sure you comply with Brazilian immigration laws on arrival in the country. You must satisfy the Federal Police (the Brazilian immigration authority) of your intended purpose of visit. You will need to be able to demonstrate that you have enough money for the duration of your stay, and provide details of your accommodation and evidence of return or onward travel. Make sure your passport is stamped. If it is not, you may be fined on departure.
If you wish to extend your stay while in Brazil, you should apply to the Federal Police for an extension. If you overstay your visa, you are likely to be given notice to leave the country at your own expense and you may be fined or deported.
Passport validity
Your passport should be valid for a minimum period of 6 months from the date of entry into Brazil.
Dual nationality
The Brazilian immigration authorities often require dual British/Brazilian nationals visiting Brazil to travel on Brazilian (rather than British) passports.  
Travelling with children
There are additional requirements for British-Brazilian dual nationals under 18 entering or transiting through Brazil without their parents or legal guardian, or travelling with one parent only. These requirements don’t usually apply to foreign nationals, but as a precaution and to avoid any possible delays, British nationals under 18 entering or transiting through Brazil without their parents or legal guardian, or travelling with one parent only, are advised to bring a letter of authorisation to travel from any parent(s) not travelling. This applies particularly to children with a Brazilian parent, even if the child only holds a British passport. Contact the Brazilian Consulate in London for more information and advice.
Yellow fever certificate requirements
Check whether you need a yellow fever certificate by visiting the National Travel Health Network and Centre’s TravelHealthPro website.
UK Emergency Travel Documents
UK Emergency travel documents (ETDs) are accepted for entry, airside transit and exit from Brazil. Your ETD must be valid for a minimum period of 6 months from the date of entry into Brazil.
