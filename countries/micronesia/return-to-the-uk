Coronavirus guidance is being updated.
Read what you can and cannot do

We advise all non-resident British nationals to leave, and for resident British nationals to be aware of border closures and maintain contact with travel providers on flight restrictions.
You will need to pay for your return travel to the UK. If departure options are available but you cannot afford the travel costs and have exhausted all other options for getting funds, you may be eligible to apply for an emergency loan from the government. This is a last resort option and you would need to repay the loan when you are back in the UK.
For more information, you should contact Corporate Travel Management (CTM). CTM are a commercial partner of the FCO and are authorised to administer such loans on behalf of the FCO.
