This page reflects the UK government’s understanding of current rules for people travelling on a full ‘British Citizen’ passport, for the most common types of travel.
The authorities in Zambia set and enforce entry rules. For further information contact the embassy, high commission or consulate of the country or territory you’re travelling to. You should also consider checking with your transport provider or travel company to make sure your passport and other travel documents meet their requirements.
Entry rules in response to coronavirus (COVID-19)
Entry to Zambia
Zambia’s borders are open, but under health screening.
Tourist and business visit visas are available in advance and on arrival in Zambia.
All travellers to Zambia must produce evidence of a PCR COVID-19 negative test taken in the 72 hours prior to departure from the country of origin. Visitors are responsible for monitoring their condition for 14 days after arrival, and should report any occurrence of COVID-19 symptoms to medical authorities.
You should not use the NHS testing service to get a test in order to facilitate your travel to another country. You should arrange to take a private test.
All airports are open to flights, though availability of international flights remains limited. Please check before booking.
Testing/screening on arrival
The following screening measures are now in place at Zambian Points of Entry (PoE).
Port Health officers will conduct general observations of passengers to detect those with signs of illness.
Port Health officers to collect and review health declaration forms, noting country of origin.
Port Health officers to review the SARS-CoV-2 negative certificates being presented by travellers to determine authenticity and validity.
All passengers to undergo thermo-scanning and temperature to be recorded on the health declaration forms.
Anyone entering Zambia with a body temperature equal to, or above 38.0 C will be tested for COVID-19 on arrival, as will anyone with COVID-19 related symptoms. Any other arrivals may be randomly selected for testing. These tests are in addition to the requirement for visitors to show proof that they have tested negative for COVID-19 in the 72 hours prior to departure from the country of origin.
Data collection
Traveller Health Questionnaires are provided on incoming flights for passengers to complete before disembarkation. These should be completed in English and handed in on arrival.
Quarantine requirements
All travellers from countries that have reported the Omicron variant will be required to undergo mandatory quarantine for ten days from the date of arrival;
Returning citizens, residents and permit-holders will be allowed to quarantine at home
Non-residents will be quarantined in designated centres as their own cost.
If your body temperature is equal to, or above 38.0, or you have a COVID-19 related symptom (a cough, shortness of breath, a headache, loss of taste or smell, or a sore throat), you will be tested and taken to either your home or a government facility for treatment and quarantine until your tests results are known.
Exit requirements
From 1 December 2021, travellers leaving Zambia will be required to use a certified Ministry of Health COVID-19 testing laboratory and present a Ministry of Health approved negative COVID-19 PCR travel certificate. Zambia has announced its intention to use the African Union Trusted Travel process for validating COVID-19 tests for passengers. All passengers arriving in, departing from or transiting Zambia should validate their COVID-19 RT PCR test via the African Union Trusted Travel or UNDP Global Haven systems (you will need to register an account on one of these sites). These systems will generate a digital Trusted Travel reference code for your test, which should be presented upon request.
Most testing centres will provide a travel certificate if requested or travellers must take their negative test result to UTH Hospital, the Zambia National Health Public Institute, the District Health Office or the Public Health Office and pay a 200 Kwacha fee. COVID-19 tests must have been taken in Zambia.
Holders of tests taken outside Zambia are not exempt from this requirement, even if the test was taken within the previous 14 days.
There are no direct flights between Zambia and the UK.
Check FCDO travel advice for the latest guidance on transiting through third countries.
Regular entry requirements
Visas
British passport holders need a visa to enter Zambia. You can get a visa from the Zambian High Commission in London before you travel. Single and double entry visit visas are available on arrival at all ports of entry, but multi-entry visas are not. If you plan to get a visa on arrival, make sure you have the correct amount of cash (US dollars) as change may not be available. If you enter through Kenneth Kaunda International Airport, you can make payment for single and double entry visas via credit or debit card at the Zambian Immigration desks.
You should check your visa endorsement for the period of your stay in Zambia. Although you are allowed 90 days per calendar year, the immigration officer will not normally endorse the full length of time upon entry and you will be required to extend the stay at the nearest immigration office.
For further information about entry requirements contact the Zambian High Commission in London at info@zambiahc.org.uk or visit Zambia Department of Immigration.
The KAZA visa is valid for travel between Zambia and Zimbabwe and day trips into Botswana. It’s available at the international airports in Lusaka and Livingstone and at the land borders at Livingstone (Zimbabwe border) and Kazungula (Botswana border). It costs US$50 and it is valid for 30 days.
On leaving Zambia, all air passengers must pay a departure tax of US$25. This is normally included in the cost of an air ticket, you will be asked to pay separately in Zambian Kwacha if it is not.
There is also a Security Charge payable by all departing air passengers. The cost is US$3 per person for domestic flights and US$5 per person for international flights. As above, this is normally included in the cost of an air ticket but you will be asked to pay separately in Zambian Kwacha if it is not.
Passport validity
Your passport should be valid for a minimum period of 6 months from the date of entry into Zambia and have 2 blank pages.
UK Emergency Travel Documents
UK Emergency Travel Documents (ETDs) are accepted for entry, airside transit, and exit from Zambia. ETDs must be valid for 6 months for entry into Zambia if the holder is not a returning resident.
