On 22 May 2021, Mount Nyiragongo volcano, close to the city of Goma, and near the border with Rwanda erupted. You can follow the latest information about the volcano on the website of GeoRiskA. You should follow the advice of the local authorities. The DRC authorities put an evacuation order in place for the following districts of Goma: Majengo, Bujovu, Virunga, Mapendo, Kayembe, Mabanga Nord, Mabanga South, Murara, Mikeno and Le Volcan, but have since announced a progressive return of displaced persons on 7 June. The Prime Minister announced this during a press conference (available in French only). Risks to safety and health remain so you should take appropriate precautions and remain vigilant as the situation could change. Goma International Airport has now reopened. Kavumu Airport in Bukavu has now reopened. If you’re travelling within DRC, you should check the Health section and follow health advice from the National Travel Health Network and Centre (NaTHNaC). If you decide to cross into Rwanda from DRC, you will need a PCR test to leave DRC and then be required to take a PCR or rapid test on arrival in Rwanda. For more information on Rwanda’s entry requirements, see FCDO travel advice for Rwanda.
British nationals who are concerned should contact the British Embassy in Kinshasa online or by telephone on +243 81 556 6200. The UK Government Office in Goma is temporarily closed. The British Embassy in Kinshasa will continue to carry out essential work including providing 24/7 consular assistance and support to British people in DRC. See Safety and Security
The Embassy is not currently open to external visitors. It continues to carry out essential work including providing 24/7 consular assistance and support to British people in DRC.
Public gatherings and demonstrations can occur with little or no notice and can quickly turn violent. See Political situation
The security situation in eastern DRC remains unstable. There are continued reports of attacks and kidnappings. NGO staff have been known to be targeted. From 6 May, for an initial period of 30 days, a “state of siege” will be in place in the provinces of Ituri and North Kivu. Military administrations will replace the civilian administrations during this period. See Safety and security
Consular support is severely limited in parts of DRC. The lack of infrastructure throughout the country and insecurity in eastern DRC often prevent the British Embassy in Kinshasa from being able to extend normal levels of consular assistance to British nationals anywhere in the DRC other than Kinshasa. You should not assume that the FCDO will be able to provide assistance to leave the country in the event of serious unrest or crisis.
Information and updates on Ebola can be found on the WHO website and the Public Health England (PHE) website. Public Health England has guidance for humanitarian or healthcare workers travelling to countries at risk of Ebola. See Health

Terrorists are likely to try to carry out attacks in the DRC. Attacks could be indiscriminate. You should be vigilant, especially in places visited by foreigners. See Terrorism
