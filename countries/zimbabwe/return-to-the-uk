There remain limited commercial options to return to the UK from Zimbabwe. If you live in the UK and are currently visiting Zimbabwe, you’re strongly advised to return now by commercial means. Don’t run the risk of getting stranded.
UK special charter flights will only operate for priority countries where commercial flights are not possible. You should not assume that these flights will become available in countries where commercial routes are operating. Please do not contact the contracted travel management company if no flight is advertised here.
Flights
Commercial airlines have reduced or suspended flights in to and out of Zimbabwe. Ethiopian Airlines have resume flights to the UK as of 4 April from Harare to London, via Addis Ababa. You should check the Ethiopia travel advice.
You will need to pay for your return travel to the UK. If departure options are available but you cannot afford the travel costs and have exhausted all other options for getting funds, you may be eligible to apply for an emergency loan from the government. This is a last resort option and you would need to repay the loan when you are back in the UK. For more information, you should contact Corporate Travel Management (CTM). CTM are a commercial partner of the FCO and are authorised to administer such loans on behalf of the FCO.
Travelling to the airport
The Zimbabwean government announced a 21 day lockdown starting from 30 March. Foreign nationals are exempt from the ban for the purposes of returning to their country of origin, however public transport is now very limited.
Arrival in the UK
