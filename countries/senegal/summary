The Casamance region has suffered for decades from low intensity separatist violence, largely directed at Senegalese security forces. While the security situation has improved significantly since 2012, there are occasionally violent incidents. On 7 January 2018, 14 Senegalese nationals were killed, and a further seven injured in an attack by gunmen in the Casamance region in the south of Senegal. The incident took place in the forest of Boffa-Bayotte, in the département of Ziguinchor. On 5 August 2018, 4 Senegalese nationals involved in gathering wood disappeared in Boussoloum forest, Zinguichor. There’s a lower level of risk in the main tourist areas of the Casamance.
