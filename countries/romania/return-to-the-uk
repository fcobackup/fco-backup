If you’re in Romania and wish to leave, you’re advised to make arrangements to do so as soon as possible. If you are normally resident in the UK, and currently travelling in Romania, we strongly advise you to leave immediately while there are still commercial options available.
Keep up to date with information from your tour operator, transport or accommodation provider on the impact on any existing travel plans. You should also check with your airline or travel company for the latest information.
