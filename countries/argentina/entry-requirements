This information is for people travelling on a full ‘British citizen’ passport from the UK. It is based on the UK government’s understanding of Argentina’s current rules for the most common types of travel. 
The authorities in Argentina set and enforce entry rules. If you’re not sure how these requirements apply to you, contact the Argentine Consulate in the UK.
Passport validity requirements
To enter Argentina, your passport must be valid for the proposed duration of your stay. If you are a resident in Argentina, your passport must be valid for entry.
Check with your travel provider that your passport and other travel documents meet requirements. Renew your passport if you need to.  
You will be denied entry if you do not have a valid travel document or try to use a passport that has been reported lost or stolen. 
Visa requirements
You can visit Argentina without a visa for business or tourism for up to 90 days.
To stay longer, or to work or study, you must meet the Argentine government’s entry requirements. Contact the Argentine Consulate in the UK.
Immigration authorities no longer stamp passports on entry. If you need proof of your entry or exit, contact the Argentine Migration Office (in Spanish).
If you wish to extend your stay for another 90-day period, get advice from the Argentine Migration Office before your current stay ends.
Applying for a visa
If you’re travelling to Argentina for any purpose other than tourism, contact the Argentine Consulate in the UK about the visas or permits you need and how to apply.
Travelling with children
Children aged 17 and under who are resident in Argentina need written permission (‘Autorización de viaje’) from the non-accompanying parents to leave the country.
Non-resident children aged 17 and under who have remained in Argentina for 1 year or more are treated in line with resident children and also need permission. You can get permission from a notary public in Argentina or the Argentine Migration Office (in Spanish).
You can get full information on the requirements from the Argentine Migration Office (in Spanish) or from your nearest Argentine consulate. 
Vaccine requirements

You must declare cash or travellers cheques worth more than 10,000 US dollars (in Spanish).
