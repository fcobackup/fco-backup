The French Government has implemented measures to stem the spread of Coronavirus. These measures include confining people to their homes except for outings for specific purposes. On 13 April 2020, the French Government extended the confinement period until at least 11 May 2020.
There are strict requirements in place for all persons intending to travel to or transit through France to complete certificates and/or declarations to support their travel.
The first requirement is for a certificate for international travel from abroad to mainland France. This certificate (known as an ‘Exempted International Movement Certificate for Travel to Metropolitan France’) should be completed before entering France, in order to be shown to French border authorities on entry and, where appropriate, transportation companies prior to boarding. If you do not complete the certificate, you may not be able to complete your journey. This certificate can be found on the French Government’s official website, under the heading ‘International travel to metropolitan France’. However, you can produce a handwritten copy of the text in the attestation if you are unable to access a printer.
When in mainland France – either travelling within or transiting through – you should also complete either: an ‘Attestation de déplacement dérogatoire’ to certify your reason for travel; or a ‘Justificatif de déplacement professionnel’ if you are travelling for essential professional reasons. These documents are self-declarations and should be completed before starting your journey. If you are entering France, they do not replace the requirement for the ‘Certificate for Travel to Metropolitan France’ described above. These declarations can be found on the French Government’s official website, under the headings ‘Attestation de déplacement’ and ‘Justificatif de déplacement professionnel’ respectively. However, you can produce a handwritten copy of the text in the attestation if you are unable to access a printer.
Travellers should note that these and other restrictions also apply to travel to, from and between the French overseas Départements and Territories. These include French Guiana, French Polynesia, Saint Martin & St Barthelemy, Wallis & Futuna, Martinique, Guadeloupe, Saint-Pierre & Miquelon, New Caledonia and Mayotte. Separate Travel Advice pages apply. Further information is available on the French Ministry of Interior website. Travellers are also advised to see the British Embassy Paris website for information about which form to use when travelling to and within France and its overseas Départements and Territories during the Coronavirus crisis.
Rules associated with the confinement measures remain unchanged. If you live in the UK and are currently travelling abroad, you are strongly advised to return to the UK now. For full information, see Coronavirus

Terrorists are very likely to try to carry out attacks in France. Due to ongoing threats to France by Islamist terrorist groups, and recent French military intervention against Daesh (formerly referred to as ISIL), the French government has warned the public to be especially vigilant and has reinforced its security measures. Check the French government’s advice about what to do if a terrorist attack occurs. See Terrorism
There remain some migrants around Calais, who may seek to enter the UK illegally. There have been instances of migrants seeking to slow down traffic on approach roads to ports, including by placing obstacles on the Calais Port approach road. If this happens you should keep moving where it’s safe to do so, or stop and call 112 if isn’t safe to proceed (keeping car doors locked).
All vehicles, including motorbikes, driving in central Paris, Lyon and Grenoble now need to display a special ‘pollution sticker’. See Road travel
