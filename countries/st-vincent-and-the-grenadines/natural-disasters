Hurricanes
The hurricane season in the Caribbean runs from June to November. You should follow and monitor local and international weather updates from the World Meteorological Organisation and the US National Hurricane Centre and follow the advice of local authorities, including any evacuation orders.
See our Tropical cyclones page for advice about how to prepare effectively and what to do if you’re likely to be affected by a hurricane or tropical cyclone.
Earthquakes
Earthquakes are a potential threat and tremors are felt occasionally in the Caribbean. In the event of an earthquake, you should be directed by the local authorities. To learn more about what to do before, during and after an earthquake, visit the website of the US Federal Emergency Management Agency.
Volcanoes
The SVG Prime Minister reported on 29 December 2020 that La Soufriere volcano on St Vincent was in an active state of effusive eruption.
During the morning of 9 April 2021, there were several explosive eruptions of La Soufriere and an ash plume 6km high. Such activity continued until 22 April, when the last explosive eruption occurred. Since then the volcano has been deemed to be in a state of unrest, and continuing its declining trend.
British Nationals should continue to heed the advice of local authorities.
You should monitor the alert level of the underwater volcano ‘Kick’em Jenny’, located 5 miles off the coast of Grenada. Observe any maritime exclusion zones and follow the advice of the local authorities in the event of increased activity or an eruption.
