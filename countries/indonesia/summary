The Foreign and Commonwealth Office (FCO) advise against all travel within 4 kilometres of the Mount Agung crater in aast Bali due to ongoing volcanic activity. This is an exclusion zone put in place by the local authorities. If you’re in this area, you should leave immediately.
Following several months of increased volcanic activity, Mount Agung in east Bali began erupting on 21 November 2017. This has led to periodic closures at Bali and Lombok airports and disruption to flights in the region. On 10 February 2018, the Indonesian authorities lowered Mount Agung’s alert status from level 4 (highest) to Level 3 (standby). The exclusion zone was also reduced from 6 kilometres to 4 kilometres around the crater. The authorities have indicated that Mount Agung continues to show signs of volcanic activity and the possibility of a volcanic eruption remains. The alert level for Mount Agung may change at little or short notice. See Natural disasters
The current period of increased volcanic activity may continue for some time and further disruption can’t be ruled out; volcanic activity can escalate very quickly with little or no notice. In the event of a major eruption, areas beyond 6km may be affected, and the resulting ash plumes and release of particulate and gaseous pollutants into the air may have an impact on health. You should continue to monitor local media and keep up to date with this travel advice. See Health

Terrorists are very likely to try to carry out attacks in Indonesia. Terrorist groups continue to plan attacks and have the capacity and intent to carry out these attacks at anytime and anywhere in the country.

The threat from Islamist extremism remains high, though the Indonesian authorities continue to disrupt attack planning, including arresting alleged terrorists reportedly in the advanced stages of preparation.
