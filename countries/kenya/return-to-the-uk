Since 25 March, all international flights to and from Kenya have been suspended by the Kenyan government, with the exception of specially negotiated repatriation flights and cargo flights. Crew must observe strict guidelines. This suspension will be lifted on 1 August.
Despite some flights appearing on online bookings sites and airline websites, the Government of Kenya have confirmed airspace remains closed for routine international flights until 1 August. Before making a booking for any flight, confirm with the airline that they have all the necessary government permissions in place as refunds may not be possible.
While there are no direct Kenya to UK repatriation flights planned before the reopening of commercial airspace on 1 August, indirect flight options exist. If you’re in Kenya and wish to register your intention to leave, contact returnfromKenya@fco.gov.uk. See Return to the UK for the full list of details required to register with the British High Commission.
If you cannot afford the travel costs and have exhausted all other options for getting funds, you may be eligible to apply for an emergency loan from the UK government. This is a last resort option and you would need to repay the loan when you are back in the UK. For more information, contact the British High Commission at Nairobi.ConsularEscalations@fco.gov.uk.
Medical certificate requirements
The Government of Kenya and Kenya Airways require passengers and crew on Kenya Airways flights to produce a medical certificate confirming they are free of COVID-19. The cost of a COVID-19 test will not be included in the ticket price.
Once you have paid for your flight, you should follow instructions from Kenya Airways on testing, tests are available from: Aga Khan Hospital, Nairobi Hospital, Nairobi West Hospital, Lancet Labs, Kenya Medical Research Institute (KEMRI), or contact county health officials for test availability in state hospitals in the counties. You will need to pay for your test. Results should take 24 hours. Results will be shared with you, and test results from KEMERI and Lancet Labs will be shared with Kenya Airways. Test results must be from within 72 hours of check-in.
If you test positive the Ministry of Health will be informed, you must follow their instructions.
