Returning to the UK
When you return, you must follow the rules for entering the UK.
You are responsible for organising your own COVID-19 test, in line with UK government testing requirements. You should check that the test result can be provided in the correct format and language.
Be prepared for your plans to change
No travel is risk-free during COVID. Countries may further restrict travel or bring in new rules at short notice, for example due to a new COVID-19 variant. Check with your travel company or airline for any transport changes which may delay your journey home.
Plan ahead and make sure you:
can access money
understand what your insurance will cover
can make arrangements to extend your stay and be away for longer than planned
If you test positive for COVID-19 in Angola before returning to the UK, you must self-isolate in private accommodation or in a hotel, for 10 days. If you are visiting and staying in a hotel, you may be asked to self-isolate in your room.
If you test positive, the Angolan authorities may occasionally conduct wellbeing checks during the period of quarantine, to ensure self-isolation compliance. You are not permitted to leave your accommodation during self-isolation. Food and household essentials can be ordered online and will be delivered to your hotel room or private accommodation.
