Warning
FCDO advises against all but essential travel to parts of Bangladesh.

Before you travel check that:
your destination can provide the healthcare you may need
you have appropriate travel insurance and access to money for local treatment or unexpected medical evacuation
This is particularly important if you have a health condition or are pregnant.
Emergency medical number
Dial 999 and ask for an ambulance.
If you suspect a heart attack, ask for a ‘cardiac ambulance’.
It may be faster to travel to the nearest hospital yourself if you have a vehicle.
Contact your insurance company quickly if you’re referred to a medical facility for treatment.
Vaccine recommendations and health risks
At least 8 weeks before your trip:
check the latest vaccination recommendations for Bangladesh
see where to get vaccines and whether you have to pay on the NHS travel vaccinations page
See what health risks you’ll face in Bangladesh, including:
dengue fever, a mosquito-borne disease that can occur year-round but is more widespread during the rainy season, May to September
other mosquito-borne diseases, including malaria, chikungunya and Zika virus
severe air pollution, especially from November to March
Dengue cases are increasing, including in Dhaka. See insect bite avoidance advice on TravelHealthPro.
Medication
The legal status and regulation of some medicines prescribed or bought in the UK can be different in other countries.
Read best practice when travelling with medicines on TravelHealthPro.
You should carry any medical papers or prescriptions and be prepared to answer questions if stopped by police.
Healthcare in Bangladesh
Medical facilities in Bangladesh are poor. Routine tests and X-rays are unreliable.
FCDO has a list of medical providers in Bangladesh where some staff will speak English.
