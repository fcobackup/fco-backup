If you have a health condition, or you are pregnant, you may need specialist healthcare abroad. Check whether your destination country can provide the healthcare you may need and ensure you have appropriate travel insurance for unexpected medical evacuation or local treatment.
See the Coronavirus travel health and Healthcare sections in the Coronavirus page for COVID-19 health information.
At least 8 weeks before your trip, check the latest country-specific health advice from the National Travel Health Network and Centre (NaTHNaC) on the TravelHealthPro website. Each country-specific page has information on vaccine recommendations, any current health risks or outbreaks, and factsheets with information on staying healthy abroad. Guidance is also available from NHS (Scotland) on the FitForTravel website.
General information on travel vaccinations and a travel health checklist is available on the NHS website. You may then wish to contact your health adviser or pharmacy for advice on other preventive measures and managing any pre-existing medical conditions while you’re abroad.
Due to restrictions on imported goods medical supplies may become increasingly hard to find in country. You should therefore bring any medicines you need with you to Pakistan.
The legal status and regulation of some medicines prescribed or bought in the UK can be different in other countries. If you’re travelling with prescription or over-the-counter medicine, read this guidance from NaTHNaC on best practice when travelling with medicines. For further information on the legal status of a specific medicine, you’ll need to contact the embassy, high commission or consulate of the country or territory you’re travelling to.
While travel can be enjoyable, it can sometimes be challenging. There are clear links between mental and physical health, so looking after yourself during travel and when abroad is important. Information on travelling with mental health conditions is available in our guidance page. Further information is also available from the National Travel Health Network and Centre (NaTHNaC).
Medical treatment
Local medical facilities are not comparable to those in the UK, especially in remote areas. For psychiatric illness, specialised treatment may not be available outside major cities in Pakistan. Private medical care is available in all major cities, but expensive. The British High Commission Islamabad maintains a list of medical facilities in different cities of Pakistan. You’re strongly advised to have comprehensive travel insurance that covers the duration of your stay in Pakistan.
If you need emergency medical assistance during your trip, dial 1122 and ask for an ambulance. You should contact your insurance/medical assistance company promptly if you’re referred to a medical facility for treatment.
If you are planning to travel to Pakistan with your medicine, please consult NHS advice before travel.
Other health risks
You should follow the advice of the National Travel Health Network and Centre.
You should take steps to avoid being bitten by mosquitoes.
Make sure you have adequate travel health insurance and accessible funds to cover the cost of any medical treatment abroad and repatriation.
Take care when purchasing bottled water. A recent government report found a number of bottled water brands to be contaminated.
