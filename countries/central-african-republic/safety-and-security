Local travel
Bangui remains fragile with periodic instances of killings, looting and gunfire. Violent clashes may continue. There are also armed patrols in Bangui and you will encounter several roadblocks (official and unofficial) that are likely to be manned by armed personnel. Take particular care when approaching these and travel in groups if possible.
There are reports of rebel activity, banditry and hostage-taking across the country.
Crime
Incidents of theft and robbery occur regularly and armed gangs are known to operate in the outlying areas of Bangui. Take personal security precautions and be vigilant in public places. Avoid carrying valuables or wearing jewellery in public. Do not walk alone at night. Avoid isolated or poorer areas.
Road travel
You need to have a 1968 International Driving Permit (IDP) to drive in CAR. IDPs previously issued by the UK may no longer be accepted for use in CAR after this date. From 1 February 2019, you can only get IDPs over the counter from 2,500 UK Post Offices. It may be extremely difficult to obtain an IDP in CAR. FCDO recommends buying one in the UK before departure.
Roads are poorly maintained and most need a four-wheel drive vehicle. Road travel is particularly difficult during the wet season (May to November). If you do decide to travel by road, you should keep a private supply of fuel if possible and carry supplies with you if travelling outside Bangui.
Illegal road blocks operate in remote areas. You may be forced to hand over money or possessions in order to continue your journey. There have been indiscriminate and violent attacks on travellers in remote areas. Vehicles have been fired on, and passengers killed or injured. In many of these cases, victims have been robbed or taken hostage and vehicles taken or burnt.
Seek local advice before travelling and FCDO recommends that you do not travel after dark.
Political situation
On 6 February 2019, President Faustin Archange Touadéra signed a peace agreement with all 14 major armed groups in CAR under an AU-led initiative.
Presidential and legislative elections took place on 27 December 2020. On 18 January, the Constitutional Court confirmed incumbent President Faustin Archange Touadéra as the winner of CAR’s Presidential election. A second round of legislative elections took place on 14 March. On 23 May, legislative elections were held across CAR. The last round of legislative elections is scheduled to take place on 25 July.
On 21 June, President Faustin Archange Touadéra appointed a new cabinet, forming a new government.
Consular assistance
Consular support is severely limited in the CAR as there is no British Embassy. However, the British Embassy Kinshasa, in the Democratic Republic of Congo can provide limited remote consular support to British nationals. In an emergency, British nationals should contact the British Embassy Kinshasa, in the Democratic Republic of Congo. The French Embassy in Bangui may also be able to offer some consular assistance (telephone: +236 613 000 or +236 610 584) to those requiring urgent help.
