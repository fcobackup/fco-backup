On 6 April, there were a series of rocket and artillery strikes around the ‘blue line’ between the borders of Lebanon and Israel. Tensions remain high and could escalate without warning. British Nationals are advised to monitor Travel Advice for further updates.
On 30th July, there was an escalation in violence between armed groups within the Ain el Hilweh Camp. The fighting between groups has continued with a number of deaths and injuries. There have been confirmed reports of stray bullets from small arms fire hitting a civilian vehicle along the main Saida Highway. As a precaution, the Lebanese Armed Forces have closed the main highway that runs parallel to the camp and redirected traffic to alternative routes. Tensions remain high and could escalate without warning. British nationals are advised to check this travel advice for updates.
A major earthquake (7.8) hit the Gaziantep region of Southeast Turkey on 6 February 2023. A further earthquake (7.5) was felt later in the day. There have been several strong aftershocks reported in Lebanon and the risk of further aftershocks remains.
Before you travel, check the ‘Entry requirements’ section for Lebanon’s current entry restrictions and requirements. These may change with little warning. Monitor this advice for the latest updates and stay in contact with your travel provider.
If you plan to pass through another country to return to the UK, check the travel advice for the country you’re transiting.
Lebanon is experiencing a prolonged and severe economic crisis. The situation is unpredictable and could deteriorate without warning. If you are in Lebanon at this time, or considering travel, you should read our Safety and security page.
Basic commodities (fuel, medicines, food) are available but may be expensive or difficult to obtain. Electricity in Lebanon is also limited. The availability and quality of medical treatment is affected by the economic crisis and fuel shortages. See ‘Shortages’ and ‘Local medical care’ for further information and how to prepare yourself.
Whilst consular assistance is available 24/7 by phone or online, in-person consular support is severely limited in parts of Lebanon where we advise against all travel and limited where we advise against all but essential travel. In the event of deterioration in the political or security situation, the British Embassy may be increasingly limited in the assistance that it can provide. Do not rely on the FCDO being able to evacuate you in an emergency.
If you’re abroad and you need emergency help from the UK government, contact the nearest British embassy, consulate or high commission.
It is more important than ever to get travel insurance and check it provides sufficient cover. See the FCDO’s guidance on foreign travel insurance.
Crime, including bag theft, property crime and sexual harassment in public spaces, has increased as a result of the economic decline in Lebanon. This includes in Beirut. See Safety and security.
A conflict with Israel could spark with little warning and lead to a rapid escalation in violence. There have been exchanges with the Israeli Defence Forces across the Blue Line in the South of Lebanon. This has included cross-border shelling, rocket fire and air strikes on Lebanon.

Terrorists are very likely to try to carry out attacks in Lebanon. You should be vigilant at all times, avoid crowds and crowded places and follow the advice of the Lebanese authorities. Previous attacks have targeted the security forces, as well as locations where Western visitors may congregate. You should follow the advice of the local authorities, and check local news and this travel advice regularly. See Terrorism
There’s a heightened risk of terrorism against aviation. Additional security measures have been in place on flights departing from Lebanon to the UK since March 2017. You should co-operate fully with security officials.
Groups within Lebanon, including Hizballah, are proscribed under the Terrorism Act 2000 and the Counter Terrorism (Sanctions) (EU Exit) Regulations 2019. Offences committed under the act – including funding and supporting proscribed organisations – may be liable to prosecution in the UK.
On 4 August 2020 a large explosion occurred in the port area of Beirut causing widespread damage to buildings and infrastructure in the city and surrounding areas. Many of the buildings have not been repaired yet. You should exercise caution in affected areas as buildings may not be safe.
There is a high risk of forest fires in Lebanon, particularly during the summer months. See Natural disasters
There are unexploded ordnance and land mines in many places. You should avoid travelling away from established paths, especially when hiking. This is particularly a concern in southern Lebanon. See Local travel
You can contact the emergency services by calling 112.
