If you are caught taking or in possession of drugs for personal use, you may be subject to a fine or another sanction (including the seizure of personal belongings). Selling or trafficking drugs is a criminal offence and subject to severe penalties.
You must show some form of identification if asked by the police or judicial authorities.  In most cases, it should be sufficient to carry a photocopy of the data page of your passport, but you may be asked to produce the original document.
Gambling is only legal in establishments properly licensed by the government, like official casinos. Games of chance, including bingo, are illegal if they’re held on unlicensed premises. The police may act on reports of illegal gambling in unauthorised premises without warning. Organisers, participants and anyone on the premises may be arrested, charged with a criminal offence and fined or imprisoned. If in doubt, you should ask whether the establishment you’re entering is legally licensed. An information leaflet with guidance on gambling is available to download in English from the Portuguese Tourist Authority website.
