This advice reflects the UK government’s understanding of current rules for people travelling on a full ‘British citizen’ passport from the UK, for the most common types of travel.
The authorities in the Czech Republic set and enforce entry rules. If you’re not sure how these requirements apply to you, contact the Czech Republic Embassy in the UK.
COVID-19 rules
There are no COVID-19 testing or vaccination requirements for travellers entering the Czech Republic.
Passport validity requirements
To travel to the Czech Republic, you must follow the Schengen area passport requirements.
To enter the Czech Republic (and all Schengen countries) your passport must:
have a ‘date of issue’ less than 10 years before the date you arrive. Passports issued after 1 October 2018 are now valid for only 10 years, but for passports issued before 1 October 2018, extra months may have been added if you renewed a passport early
have an ‘expiry date’ at least 3 months after the day you plan to leave
Check with your travel provider that your passport and other travel documents meet requirements. Renew your passport if you need to.
You will be denied entry if you do not have a valid travel document or try to use a passport that has been reported lost or stolen.
If you lived in the Czech Republic before 1 January 2021 and have the relevant documentation, you have rights under the Withdrawal Agreement. You can enter and exit the Czech Republic with a valid passport and do not need any additional validity.
Checks at border control
Make sure you get your passport stamped.
If you’re a visitor, your passport must be stamped when you enter or leave the Schengen area (which includes the Czech Republic). Border guards will use passport stamps to check you have not overstayed the 90-day visa-free limit for stays in the Schengen area. If your passport was not stamped, border guards will presume you have overstayed the visa-free limit.
If your passport was not stamped, show evidence of when and where you entered or left the Schengen area (for example, boarding passes or tickets) and ask the border guards to add the date and location in your passport.
Read about passport stamping if you live in the Czech Republic.
At the Czech Republic border control, you may also need to:
show a return or onward ticket
show you have enough money for your stay
Visa requirements
You can travel without a visa to the Schengen area (including the Czech Republic) for up to 90 days in any 180-day period. This applies if you travel:
as a tourist
to visit family or friends
to attend business meetings, cultural or sports events
for short-term studies or training
If you’re travelling to the Czech Republic and other Schengen countries without a visa, make sure your whole visit is within the 90-day limit. Visits to Schengen countries in the 180 days before you travel count towards your 90 days.
To stay longer (to work or study, for business travel or for other reasons), you must meet the Czech Republic government’s entry requirements. Check which type of visa or work permit you need with the Embassy of the Czech Republic .
If you stay in the Czech Republic with a residence permit or long-stay visa, this does not count towards your 90-day visa-free limit.
Vaccination requirements
At least 8 weeks before your trip, check the vaccinations and certificates you need in TravelHealthPro’s Czech Republic guide.
Registering with the police
If you do not have a Czech Republic residence permit, you must register your address with the nearest Foreign Police Department within 3 days of arriving. You can also register through your hotel or accommodation service. If you do not register, you could get a fine of up to 3,000 Czech koruna.
Customs rules
There are strict rules about goods that can be brought into and taken out of the Czech Republic. You must declare anything that may be prohibited or subject to tax or duty.
You cannot take meat, milk or products containing them into EU countries. There are some exceptions such as powdered baby milk, baby food and special foods or pet feed required for medical reasons.
