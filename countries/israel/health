This travel advice covers Israel and the Occupied Palestinian Territories
At least 8 weeks before your trip, check the latest country-specific health advice from the National Travel Health Network and Centre (NaTHNaC) on the TravelHealthPro website. Each country-specific page has information on vaccine recommendations, any current health risks or outbreaks, and factsheets with information on staying healthy abroad. Guidance is also available from NHS (Scotland) on the FitForTravel website.
General information on travel vaccinations and a travel health checklist is available on the NHS website. You may then wish to contact your health adviser or pharmacy for advice on other preventive measures and managing any pre-existing medical conditions while you’re abroad.
The legal status and regulation of some medicines prescribed or purchased in the UK can be different in other countries. If you’re travelling with prescription or over-the-counter medicine, read this guidance from NaTHNaC on best practice when travelling with medicines. For further information on the legal status of a specific medicine, you’ll need to contact the embassy, high commission or consulate of the country or territory you’re travelling to.
While travel can be enjoyable, it can sometimes be challenging. There are clear links between mental and physical health, so looking after yourself during travel and when abroad is important. Information on travelling with mental health conditions is available in our guidance page. Further information is also available from the National Travel Health Network and Centre (NaTHNaC).
Coronavirus
Cases of coronavirus (COVID-19) have been confirmed in Israel and the Occupied Palestinian Territories. The Israeli and Palestinian authorities have introduced a number of precautionary measures.
The Israeli authorities have announced that with effect from Wednesday 18 March, foreign nationals will not be permitted to enter unless they are citizens or residents of Israel. Limited exceptions do apply. Check Israeli Population and Immigration Authority pages for full details. Further restrictions may be introduced at short notice.
Some airlines have suspended or reduced flight operations to Tel Aviv Ben Gurion Airport. Further travel restrictions and flight suspensions may be introduced at short notice. Visitors in Israel or the Occupied Palestinian Territories are advised to re-confirm their travel arrangements with their airline, including double-checking which departure terminal they are leaving from as this may change, and to consider returning home earlier than planned if required.
The Allenby/King Hussein Bridge Crossing between the Occupied Palestinian Territories and Jordan is closed with the exception of: Jordanian citizens returning to Jordan; Palestinian residents (West Bank, Gaza and East Jerusalem ID holders) returning to the Occupied Palestinian Territories; and Israeli citizens returning from Jordan to Israel. Travellers passing through this crossing in either direction may be required to enter quarantine facilities.
The Jordan River / Sheikh Hussein and Yitzhak Rabin/ Wadi Arraba crossings between Jordan and Israel are open to Israeli citizens. Foreign passport holders will not be allowed to enter Israel and the Occupied Palestinian Territories via these crossings.
The Palestinian Authority (PA) has issued restrictions for visitors and residents in the Occupied Palestinian Territories, including in the Bethlehem area. On 5 March 2020 the PA announced a state of emergency lasting 30 days, including closure of educational institutions, reducing movement between cities, cancellation of public gatherings and conferences, and cancellation of tourism reservations and hotel bookings. Foreign nationals are not currently able to cross checkpoints to enter Bethlehem. You should reconfirm your arrangements with your tour operator or hotel before travelling.
You may face delays or restrictions at Israeli controlled checkpoints around the West Bank, including when attempting to leave the West Bank. Foreign nationals are not currently able to cross checkpoints to enter Bethlehem. Foreign nationals who are currently in Bethlehem must leave six hours before their scheduled flight and travel direct to Tel Aviv Ben Gurion Airport. Similar restrictions may be applied to foreign nationals seeking to leave from other parts of the West Bank. If you are part of an organised tour group, you will travel on an Israeli bus which will be escorted by Israeli police direct to the airport. If you are travelling alone, you can take an Israeli taxi to the airport six hours before your flight. No prior coordination with the Israeli authorities is necessary. You will need to show your passport and flight ticket to authorities at the Israeli controlled checkpoint.
Visitors should follow the guidance which is regularly updated on Israel’s Ministry of Health website and be alert to local changes.
Further information on coronavirus, including advice on preparing for foreign travel and helping reduce the spread of the virus, is available from Public Health England and on the TravelHealthPro website.
You can find more information about cases in Israel on the TravelHealthPro website and in the Occupied Palestinian Territories on the TravelHealthPro website.
Local medical care
Healthcare in Israel is not free and medical treatment can be expensive. Hospitals will insist on payment and may take legal action to delay departure until bills are met. Make sure you have adequate travel health insurance and accessible funds to cover the cost of any medical treatment abroad and repatriation.
If you need emergency medical assistance during your trip, dial 101 and ask for an ambulance. You should contact your insurance/medical assistance company promptly if you are referred to a medical facility for treatment.
