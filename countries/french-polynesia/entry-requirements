The information on this page covers the most common types of travel and reflects the UK government’s understanding of the rules currently in place. Unless otherwise stated, this information is for travellers using a full ‘British Citizen’ passport.
The authorities in the country or territory you’re travelling to are responsible for setting and enforcing the rules for entry. If you’re unclear about any aspect of the entry requirements, or you need further reassurance, you’ll need to contact the embassy, high commission or consulate of the country or territory you’re travelling to.
You should also consider checking with your transport provider or travel company to make sure your passport and other travel documents meet their requirements.
Entry rules in response to coronavirus (COVID-19)
Entry to and transiting in French Polynesia
On 8 April 2020, French authorities introduced a requirement to complete a travel certificate to enter the Overseas Territories. This travel certificate should be completed before departing for France Overseas Territories, in order to be shown to French border authorities on entry and, where appropriate, transportation companies prior to boarding.
If you do not complete the certificate, you may be unable to complete your journey. You must carry a physical copy of the declaration; electronic versions will not be accepted. You are able to produce a handwritten copy of the text if you do not have access to a printed form.
More information is available on the Ministry of Interior website.
Travel certificates for travel within French Overseas Territories
In addition to the entry certificate above, when travelling around in or transiting through a French Overseas Territory, you must also complete an Attestation de déplacement dérogatoire to certify your reason for travel. See the Coronavirus section for information.
Testing / screening on arrival 
From 9 March 2020, all travellers (regardless of nationality or travel history) need to present a medical certificate, issued less than 5 days before departure for French Polynesia, certifying their current state of health. They will also have a health check upon arrival, which may result in a period of quarantine.
In the absence of a certificate, the airline will be asked to refuse boarding to a passenger. During the flight everyone will receive a Sanitary Control questionnaire to be handed in to the medical team at the airport on arrival. Everyone arriving in French Polynesia on an international flight will undergo temperature control via a thermal camera.
Regular entry requirements
Visas
French Polynesia is an Overseas Collective (collectivité d’outre-mer) of France.
If your passport describes you as a British Citizen you will not need a visa to enter French Polynesia. Other British passport holders should check the current entry requirements on the website of the French Ministry of Foreign Affairs, and if necessary confirm with the nearest French diplomatic mission.
The current visa policy for British Citizens visiting French Polynesia may change. We’re working with the relevant authorities to clarify entry requirements and this page will be updated as soon as further information is available. If you would like more details in the meantime, or want to discuss a specific issue, you should consult the French Embassy in London. If you’re a British Overseas Territories Citizen passport holder the current visa policy for travel to French Polynesia will be unaffected by the UK leaving the EU.
Passport validity
Your passport should be valid for the proposed duration of your stay. No additional period of validity beyond this is required.
Yellow fever certificate requirements
Check whether you need a yellow fever certificate by visiting the National Travel Health Network and Centre’s TravelHealthPro website.
Emergency travel documents
UK emergency travel documents (ETDs) are accepted for entry, airside transit and exit from French Polynesia.
Working
British nationals who wish to work in French Polynesia should make enquiries, prior to departure, at the nearest French Consulate.
