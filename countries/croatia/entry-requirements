The information on this page covers the most common types of travel and reflects the UK government’s understanding of the rules currently in place. Unless otherwise stated, this information is for travellers using a full ‘British Citizen’ passport.
The authorities in the country or territory you’re travelling to are responsible for setting and enforcing the rules for entry. If you’re unclear about any aspect of the entry requirements, or you need further reassurance, you’ll need to contact the embassy, high commission or consulate of the country or territory you’re travelling to.
You should also consider checking with your transport provider or travel company to make sure your passport and other travel documents meet their requirements.
Restrictions in response to coronavirus
Entry and borders
On 11 May Croatia reopened its borders to visitors from the EU/EEA, and the UK, provided they held an accommodation reservation in the country. Entry rules were also eased to remove the need for a 14 day period of self-isolation. The Croatian government has introduced a new online entry form to expedite the entry of foreign visitors. Visitors should carry a copy of their accommodation booking or proof of ownership of holiday homes / boats when arriving in Croatia. If you’re travelling to Croatia for business you should carry evidence of a business invitation or meetings.
Restrictions on travel may change at any time. You are advised to check the latest regulations before travelling on the Croatian government website. British citizens are permitted to leave Croatia and it remains possible to return to the UK by air and road.
