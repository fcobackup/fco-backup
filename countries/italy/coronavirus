Public spaces and services
On 3 June, the Italian government relaxed some coronavirus measures restricting travel within Italy. Currently, the following measures are in place:
social distancing of 1 metre must be observed
using masks remains mandatory in enclosed public spaces (and in all public spaces in Lombardy and Piedmont)
parks have reopened and outdoor exercise is permitted, subject to social distancing
funerals have recommenced, with limited attendance. Churches can celebrate mass, weddings and baptisms
restaurants, pubs, bars, shops, hairdressers, salons and beaches have been given permission to open, as have libraries. All must have measures in place to enforce social distancing
museums and archeological sites have been given permission to open. Entry must be prebooked online
travel between Italian regions is permitted
schools are expected to remain closed until September
Regional authorities in Italy are empowered adjust these measures in keeping with local requirements; regional differences may therefore apply to the restrictions listed above.
Note that many restaurants, beach facilities and other venues are asking patrons to provide their name and contact details before using their services.
If you are a British national resident in Italy, we advise carrying proof of your residence in Italy when transiting through airports or other transport hubs.
You can find more information on measures on the Ministry of Health website (in Italian) and Frequently Asked Questions on the Ministry of Foreign Affairs website (in English).
