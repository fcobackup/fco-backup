Crime
There have been reports of petty theft and robbery. Beware of pickpockets, avoid unlit streets and parks at night, and be extra vigilant if you’re walking alone. Take extra care of your belongings in busy locations and on public transport. Don’t leave coats and handbags unattended in bars, pubs and clubs.
A small number of tourists have reported incidents on public transport and around the train station area of Vilnius where they have been approached by small groups of people asking for money or help. Be vigilant in these areas.
Don’t leave drinks unattended and be wary of accepting food and drink from strangers in bars, nightclubs and restaurants.
Car theft is a problem in certain areas. Lock unattended vehicles and hide contents. Use guarded car parks in cities, especially overnight.
 
There have been a number of thefts of bicycles in Vilnius.
In an emergency or if you wish to report a crime, call the police on 112.
Local travel
Public transport
On local buses and trolley-buses, remember to activate your ticket (whether it’s pre-purchased or bought from the driver) on the machine on board or you may be fined by undercover inspectors.
Taxis are reasonably priced. Make sure the meter is used. It is cheaper and safer to phone for a taxi from a recognised company than to hail one in the street. Ask your hotel reception to call one. Do not use unregistered taxis.
Klaipeda, Nida and Palanga
If you intend to walk along the Curonian Spit be aware that after a short distance the Spit forms part of Kaliningrad, which is a territory of the Russian Federation.
Road travel
Licences and documentation
You can drive using a UK photo card driving licence. You must have suitable insurance and carry the original vehicle registration documents (copies are not acceptable).
If the UK leaves the EU with a deal, driving licence rules will stay the same until 31 December 2020.
If there’s no deal, you will need to get an International Driving Permit (IDP) to be able to drive in some European countries as a visitor after the UK has left. Check this guidance page for full information. You should also check guidance on driving in the EU after Brexit for information on other additional documents you may need to carry.
If you’re living in Lithuania, check the Living in Guide for information on requirements for residents.
Road safety
In 2018 there were 170 road deaths in Lithuania (source: Department of Transport), equating to 6.1 road deaths per 100,000 of population. This compares to the UK average of 2.8 road deaths per 100,000 of population in 2018.
Take care when driving, particularly at night. Equip your car for severe conditions in winter.

See the European Commission, AA and RAC guides for advice on driving in Lithuania.
Bringing a vehicle into Lithuania
When arriving in Lithuania with a car, border officials will ask for a passport which is valid for the duration of your stay, the original vehicle registration documents (copies are not acceptable) and evidence of international vehicle insurance (Green Card).
Winter travel
Be prepared for extremely cold and possibly hazardous weather if you intend to travel to Lithuania in the winter (October to March). There’s likely to be snow or ice on the ground and temperatures may drop to -25°C or below.
