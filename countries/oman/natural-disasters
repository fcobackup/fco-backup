Tropical Cyclone Tej
Tropical cyclone conditions are possible from Sunday 22 October in the Dhofar and Al Wusta governorates as a result of Typhoon Tej.
A warning has been issued by the Oman Civil Aviation Authority for Tropical Cyclone Tej which has been classed as a category 3. Impacts are expected to be on Monday and Tuesday with extremely heavy rainfall. Storm surges and flash floods may be possible which may impact travel.
While Omanâ€™s climate is generally dry, heavy rains do fall, usually in the winter. Flash floods can cause injuries and deaths. Cyclones from the Indian Ocean occasionally make landfall in Oman in the summer months, resulting in a disruption of services and utilities. You should follow any instructions given in an official weather warning. Check local weather forecasts and seek advice about travelling conditions particularly if you are considering any off-road travel or adventure tourism, including to Wadi areas (dry riverbeds).
You should follow any directives or guidance provided by the Royal Oman Police.
