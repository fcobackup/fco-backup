Coronavirus
The Foreign and Commonwealth Office (FCO) advise against all but essential travel to Eswatini. This is due to the South African authorities announcing measures restricting individuals entering South Africa if they have come from various countries affected by coronavirus (COVID-19), including the United Kingdom. These measures will come in to effect as of 18 March.
British Nationals in Eswatini, particularly those who have been in a coronavirus affected country (including the UK) in the past 20 days, should be aware that it is possible they may not be able to leave Eswatini by road into South Africa after 18 March until South African restrictions are lifted, or amended, or may require a visa to do so. British Nationals will still be able to transit through OR Tambo International Airport in Johannesburg.
Please check the travel Advice for South Africa for the latest information on South African entry requirements.
