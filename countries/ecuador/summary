The national transport strike was called off on the evening of 4 October. However, indigenous groups have convened a national march in protest against the new economic measures, estimated to arrive in Quito on Monday 7 October. This has caused a high level of disruption in the Andes and Amazon regions and along the Panamerican Highway. The Embassy continues to receive reports of demonstrations and road blockage in various cities and towns, including Imbabura, Chimborazo, Azuay, Cotopaxi, Tungurahua, Azuay and Pichincha provinces. You’re advised to seek official information by monitoring closely local media. Where possible, you should remain where you are until you have identified a safe route and means to travel. You should also avoid any large gatherings as some can turn very violent.
You should allow extra time to reach your destination and check your routes before leaving. If you’re due to travel from the airport, you should also check the status of your flight before travelling to the airport. Roads in Quito are currently open, and so are access roads to Quito International Airport. Live updates on roads disruption are being published on the ECU911 emergency services website and via their Twitter account (in Spanish). For Quito district, check the Municipality Transport Agency. For live updates on all flights, monitor the Quito International Airport and Guayaquil International Airport websites (in Spanish).
