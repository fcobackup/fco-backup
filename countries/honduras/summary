Protests can happen anywhere in Honduras. Although normally peaceful, these can rapidly turn violent and be accompanied by a general break-down in law and order, including looting. The police have frequently responded with tear gas. Deaths and injuries have been reported. Although the protests are normally restricted to the main cities (especially Tegucigalpa, San Pedro Sula and La Ceiba), road blocks can occur anywhere at short notice, and can cause significant travel disruptions. Military police and the army have been deployed across the country to restore law and order.
Travel plans can be impacted at short notice. You should avoid all demonstrations, and do not try to pass through blockades.
Please monitor the situation with your tour operator and with the local authorities (COPECO) and the National Institute of Migration and monitor local and social media for updates.
