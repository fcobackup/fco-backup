The FCDO advise against all travel to Transnistria
Since January 2022, the build-up of Russian forces on Ukraine’s borders has increased the threat of military action. Transnistria is outside the control of the Moldovan authorities. Our ability to offer consular support within this region is extremely limited, and in the event of military action on/near the border with Ukraine, would be further reduced. See Safety and security
If you are planning to travel into Moldova from Ukraine see Entry requirements and Safety and security
COVID-19 entry restrictions for Moldova
Before you travel, check the ‘Entry requirements’ section for Moldova’s current entry restrictions and requirements. These may change with little warning. Monitor this advice for the latest updates and stay in contact with your travel provider.
Travelling from and returning to the UK
Check what you must do to travel abroad and return to England, Scotland, Wales or Northern Ireland.
If you plan to pass through another country to return to the UK, check the travel advice for the country you’re transiting. If you will pass through a red list country, book your hotel quarantine package before travelling to the UK.
If you are planning travel to Moldova, find out what you need to know about coronavirus there in the Coronavirus section.
During the COVID-19 pandemic, it is more important than ever to get travel insurance and check it provides sufficient cover. See the FCDO’s guidance on foreign travel insurance.
For information about COVID-19 vaccines, see the Coronavirus page.
Most visits to Moldova are trouble free. You should be alert to the possibility of protests and demonstrations. While these are generally peaceful, the situation could quickly change. If you are in Moldova, keep up to date with developments and take extra care. You should avoid large crowds, remain vigilant and follow the advice of local authorities.
The Moldovan authorities strictly enforce penalties (including deportation) against those who overstay. See Entry requirements
You should be vigilant to petty crime, particularly in Chisinau. Leave your passport, travel documents and other valuable items in a safe place, and carry a photocopy of your passport for identification purposes. See Crime
There are strong penalties for possession or use of drugs. Avoid taking photographs of military or government installations. See Local laws and customs
Although there’s no recent history of terrorism in Moldova, attacks cannot be ruled out. See Terrorism
If you’re abroad and you need emergency help from the UK government, contact the nearest British embassy, consulate or high commission.
