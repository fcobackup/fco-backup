Military activity in the Red Sea area       
Military activity is currently underway in response to attempts by Houthi militants to prevent movement of international shipping in the Red Sea. While the area of activity is limited to the Red Sea and Yemen, there is a possibility that Travel Advice for nearby countries could change at short notice. You should continue to monitor Travel Advice and follow any relevant instructions from local authorities.
Crime
Petty crime is not uncommon in Djibouti. Donâ€™t walk around town alone late at night. Keep valuables, particularly cameras and passports, out of sight.
Local travel
The FCDO advise against all travel to the border with Eritrea. In 2008 there were military clashes between Djibouti and Eritrea after an incursion of Eritrean forces into the disputed Djibouti border region. The situation remains fragile and further conflict is possible.
Take great care if you travel to remote areas of the country notably the border with Somaliland, the north-west of Somalia and on roads north of Tadjoura where there are military roadblocks. You should respect the advice given by those operating the roadblocks and, if required, seek formal military approval for a journey.
Road travel
Avoid travelling outside city centres after dark; vehicles often have no lights and livestock may be on the roads. Driving standards are generally poor and on the main Djibouti-Ethiopia road there are a very high number of large trucks. Many drivers use the (legal) narcotic khat and this contributes to speeding and unsafe driving. Roads are generally narrow, poorly lit and poorly maintained. Police set up wire coils as roadblocks on some of the major roads, which are not clearly visible at night. Stay on paved roads. Unmarked landmines are present in the border region with Eritrea, but in other border areas most landmines have been marked or cleared. The borders between Djibouti and Ethiopia and Djibouti and Somalia are not always clearly identified.
Rail travel
Freight and passenger rail services are running.
Sea travel
The threat of piracy related activity and armed robbery in the Gulf of Aden and Indian Ocean remains significant. Reports of attacks on local fishing dhows in the area around the Gulf of Aden and Horn of Africa continue. The combined threat assessment of the international Naval Counter Piracy Forces remains that all sailing yachts under their own passage should remain out of the designated High Risk Area or face the risk of being hijacked and held hostage for ransom.
