Demonstrations regularly occur over the local weekends in Amman, particularly on Thursday evenings, near the Prime Ministry at 4th Circle. They may also occur in other towns and cities.

Follow the advice of local authorities and stay informed of the security situation through the media and this travel advice.
From time to time, incidents have also occurred on several university campuses. You should remain vigilant at all times.

There’s a heightened risk of terrorism against aviation. Additional security measures have been in place on flights departing from Jordan to the UK since March 2017. You should co-operate fully with security officials. Restrictions on carrying large electronic devices in the aircraft cabin, introduced as part of these measures, have now been lifted for the vast majority of airlines operating from airports in Jordan. However, some airlines have decided to maintain the restrictions for operational reasons. For more information and advice about what items you can take into the cabin on your flight from Jordan to the UK, contact your airline or travel company.
