If you plan to pass through another country to return to the UK, check the travel advice for the country you’re transiting.
Be prepared for your plans to change
No travel is risk-free during COVID. Countries may further restrict travel or bring in new rules at short notice, for example due to a new COVID-19 variant. Check with your travel company or airline for any transport changes which may delay your journey home.
If you test positive for COVID-19, you may need to stay where you are until you test negative. You may also need to seek treatment there.
Plan ahead and make sure you:
can access money
understand what your insurance will cover
can make arrangements to extend your stay and be away for longer than planned

Healthcare in Kazakhstan
As advised by local authorities anyone who has symptoms similar to COVID-19 should not go to the hospital, instead you should call the ambulance 103 or the hospital you’re registered with clearly explaining the symptoms. In most parts of the country COVID-19 infected patients are not hospitalised unless severe danger to health.
