The UAE authorities have introduced measures to limit the spread of coronavirus (COVID-19). On 2 April the UAE Government suspended the entry of all UAE residents returning from abroad and on 8 April introduced a new permit system for any resident wishing to return.
Entry is only permitted to UAE nationals and residents who have applied for re-entry online and have been given permission to re-enter with a unique reference code. This will be used to then book flights back to the UAE with Emirates or Etihad airlines. For full information, see Entry requirements
Inbound and outbound flights stopped on 24 March. As of 9 May there are limited flights operating to and from Abu Dhabi and Dubai and London Heathrow but these could be cancelled at short notice.
If you are a remaining British traveller in the UAE, you should contact the British Embassy if you are in difficulty. For details, see Return to the UK
If you’re visiting UAE and are unable to return to the UK, see Staying during coronavirus

There is a possibility of an increased threat against Western interests, including against UK citizens. You should remain vigilant and keep up to date with the latest developments, including via the media and this travel advice.
