Entry and borders
See Entry requirements to find out what you will need to do when you arrive in the Netherlands.
Returning to the UK
When you return, you must follow the rules for entering the UK. You are responsible for organising your own COVID-19 test, in line with UK government testing requirements. The Dutch Municipal Health Service (GGD) should not be used for pre-travel tests, as explained on the GGD website (in Dutch and English). You should obtain a test from a private provider instead. The Dutch Government has announced they are currently providing free tests for travel. If you choose to use these tests, you should check that the type of test and the test result certificate meets the full testing requirements (e.g. name of the test provider and their contact details, if appropriate) for entry into either England, Scotland, Wales and Northern Ireland. The Netherlands is on the amber list for entering England. Check what you must do to enter England, Scotland, Wales or Northern Ireland.

Be prepared for your plans to change
No travel is risk-free during COVID. Countries may further restrict travel or bring in new rules at short notice, for example due to a new COVID-19 variant. Check with your travel company or airline for any transport changes which may delay your journey home.
If you test positive for COVID-19, you may need to stay where you are until you test negative. You may also need to seek treatment there.
Plan ahead and make sure you:
can access money
understand what your insurance will cover
can make arrangements to extend your stay and be away for longer than planned
Travel in the Netherlands
The latest information on Dutch domestic coronavirus measures can be found on the Dutch government website (in English).
Where possible, the Dutch government advises to avoid crowds and to travel outside peak hours if taking public transport.
As of 26 June 2021, wearing a face mask is no longer compulsory in indoor public spaces. The Dutch Government recommends you continue to wear a face mask in situations where you cannot maintain social distancing of at least 1.5metres. Face masks must be worn on public transport, in stations, on platforms and at bus, tram or metro stops if you are aged 13 and over. If you do not wear a face mask as directed, you may be fined €95. You must observe social distancing of at least 1.5 metres when on platforms and at stations.
For other shared forms of transport, such as taxis, passenger vans and coaches, you must wear a face mask, unless you are the only passenger. If you’re travelling in a car or other private vehicle, you are advised to wear face masks if there are two or more people in the vehicle who belong to different households. On other forms of transport, you must stay 1.5 metres apart where possible.
Children under the age of 13 are not required to wear a face mask.
Schiphol, Eindhoven and Rotterdam Airports

A full overview of measures is available on the Dutch government’s website. Most outdoor and indoor activities are now permitted, as long as 1.5 metres social distancing in observed.
There are no limits on group sizes indoors and outdoors, as long as 1.5metres social distancing is observed. Mandatory reservations, health checks and maximum capacity limits are in place for public venues, such as restaurants, cafes, museums, theatres, amusement parks and zoos.
You must stay 1.5 metres away from other people. This applies to everyone over the age of 18, in the street, in shops and other buildings. It does not apply to members of your household and it does not apply if you are providing assistance to someone, for example pushing a wheelchair. If you notice that it is becoming difficult to keep a distance of 1.5 metres, you should leave. The Dutch government continues to advise people to avoid busy places. If a gathering poses a safety or public health risk, enforcement officers can take action.

The Netherlands’ national vaccination programme started in January 2021 and is currently using Pfizer-BioNTech and Moderna vaccines. Janssen (Johnson and Johnson) may also be available. British nationals resident in The Netherlands are eligible for vaccination including children over the age of 12.
