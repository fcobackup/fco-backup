The US dollar is the official currency in El Salvador.
It is almost impossible to change pounds sterling anywhere in El Salvador, so you should bring a mixture of cash and travellersâ€™ cheques in US dollars. US$50 and US$100 notes are generally not accepted in many smaller restaurants, bars and shops. US$100 and US$50 notes may be exchanged in banks on arrival, but it is advisable to bring smaller denominations with you.
ATMs are widely available. You should inform your bank of your travel plans before you travel to avoid your card being blocked.
