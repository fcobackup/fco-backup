Before you travel check that:
your destination can provide the healthcare you may need
you have appropriate travel insurance for local treatment or unexpected medical evacuation
This is particularly important if you have a health condition or are pregnant.
Emergency medical number
Call 119 and ask for an ambulance.
Unlike in the UK, an ambulance crew will not usually include a paramedic.
Contact your insurance company quickly if you’re referred to a medical facility for treatment.
Vaccine recommendations and health risks
At least 8 weeks before your trip:
check the latest vaccine recommendations for Taiwan
see where to get vaccines and whether you have to pay on the NHS travel vaccinations page

There has been a significant increase in cases of dengue fever in the south of Taiwan (including the cities of Kaohsiung and Tainan). Take precautions to avoid mosquito bites. See key updates from the Taiwan Centers for Disease Control.
Medication
The legal status and regulation of some medicines prescribed or bought in the UK can be different in other countries.
Read best practice when travelling with medicines on TravelHealthPro.
If you’re bringing any prescribed medicine into Taiwan, bring the prescription issued by your doctor, hospital or clinic that shows the medicine is for your personal use. The amount of medication you bring must be consistent with the amount stated on the prescription. You cannot bring cannabis oil or cannabis-derived medication into Taiwan, even if it’s legally prescribed elsewhere.
For further information on the legal status of a specific medicine, contact the Taipei Representative Office in London.
Healthcare facilities in Taiwan
Taiwan’s health and dental facilities offer a range of routine, emergency and outpatient services. Some have English-speaking staff. Hospitals operate on a ’pay as you use’ basis. Make sure you have adequate travel health insurance and accessible funds to cover the cost of any medical treatment in Taiwan including possible repatriation.

COVID-19 healthcare
Taiwan Centers for Disease Control says that if you test positive for COVID-19 and have mild symptoms you do not need to report your case or self-isolate. You should rest at home and wear a mask when outside. Seek medical care if you experience severe symptoms. You can contact the Taiwan Centers for Disease Control helpline on 1922.
