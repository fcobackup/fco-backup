There are many ATMs accepting Cirrus, Maestro and Visa cards. You may be asked to provide identification if you are paying for items with a credit or debit card. Travellers’ cheques are not widely used. When exchanging money, use registered banks or bureaux de change. Don’t change money with people offering attractive rates on the street or on arrival at the airport, as false banknotes are common.
