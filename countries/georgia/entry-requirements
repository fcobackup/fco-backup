The information on this page covers the most common types of travel and reflects the UK government’s understanding of the rules currently in place. Unless otherwise stated, this information is for travellers using a full ‘British Citizen’ passport.
The authorities in the country or territory you’re travelling to are responsible for setting and enforcing the rules for entry. If you’re unclear about any aspect of the entry requirements, or you need further reassurance, you’ll need to contact the embassy, high commission or consulate of the country or territory you’re travelling to.
You should also consider checking with your transport provider or travel company to make sure your passport and other travel documents meet their requirements.
Restrictions in response to coronavirus
The Georgian authorities have introduced new measures in relation to coronavirus.
Foreign citizens are not currently allowed to enter Georgia. The ban also applies to foreigners with Georgian residence permits. Anyone arriving in Georgia will face compulsory 14-day quarantine. You should carry additional supplies of necessary medication in carry-on luggage.
The government has announced that from 1 July Georgia’s land and air borders, as well as international tourism should gradually re-open in line with the principle of safe corridors. No corridors have yet been announced. Details and modalities are not yet specified.
The Georgian authorities recognise that some non-Georgian residents may be unable to renew their entry permits in due time due to border closures. The Government has announced that foreigners legally in Georgia up to 14 March but then unable to leave because of COVID can remain until 30 June 2020 if their overstay was caused by one of the following circumstances, which must be documented:
If the state of citizenship of the person was included in the high risk zone for the relevant period;
If border restrictions were imposed by the relevant state;
If the person was in hospital, quarantine or self-isolation due to health conditions;
If the person was not able to leave the country due to flight cancellation.
The Ministry of Foreign Affairs has informed the British Embassy that if you were legally in Georgia by 14 March and wish to renew your stay beyond 30 June without applying for a residence card, you will need to book an appointment at a Public Service House. You should attend your appointment with a Georgian-speaker if needed as you will need to make your renewal application and be interviewed in Georgian. Your application must include the reason why you could not renew your visa in time or renew it on-line during the State of Emergency. The fee is 50 lari (approx. £13). The Public Service House will review the case and make a decision within three days on whether, and if so, for how long to renew your visa.
If you meet the requirements to apply for a Georgian Residence Permit such as working or studying, you can book an appointment at a Public Service House to start the procedure.
In consideration of the difficulty of renewing UK passports during coronavirus, the Ministry of Foreign Affairs has confirmed that the Georgian authorities will recognise the validity of the following UK passports for residence and visa purposes until the UK Government informs otherwise:
A UK passport that has expired since 6 January 2020 or has less than six months’ validity when presented to Georgian authorities will now be recognised as expiring on 31 December 2021 The UK Government has confirmed that it will continue to recognise any British national holding such passports as British under international law.
These amendments apply to those holding the following passports - British Citizen, British National (Overseas), British Protected Person, British Overseas Citizen and British Subject.
Regular entry requirements
Visas
British nationals don’t need a visa to enter Georgia for visits of up to one year. If you wish to stay for longer, you’ll need to apply for a long term visa. Contact the Embassy of Georgia in London or visit the Georgian Ministry of Foreign Affairs website for more details on entry requirements.
If you’re living in Georgia you should contact the Justice House or Ministry of Foreign Affairs of Georgia for advice.
Passport validity
Your passport should be valid for the proposed duration of your stay. No additional period of validity beyond this is required.
Travel insurance
Make sure you have a valid travel insurance policy as you may be asked to provide evidence of this by your airline at check-in or by the immigration authorities upon arrival in Georgia. You may face difficulties if you cannot provide evidence of valid travel insurance.
Travelling with medicines
Georgia has a very strict anti-drugs policy, which can also cover prescription and non-prescription drugs or medicines, otherwise commonly available in the UK and the European Union. For example, non-prescription medicines containing codeine are illegal in Georgia. This can cause serious problems for travellers and in some cases lead to administrative and criminal proceedings. Before travelling, check Georgia’s medication importation regulations on the Ministry of Health website
If you intend to travel with prescription medicine, you must carry a doctor’s prescription and ideally the original packaging. See Health
UK Emergency Travel Documents
UK Emergency Travel Documents are accepted for entry, airside transit and exit from Georgia.
