The Kazakh authorities have introduced a number of precautionary measures in response to the coronavirus (COVID-19) pandemic.
All travellers to Kazakhstan will be subject to health monitoring on arrival, and mandatory follow-up measures aimed at preventing the spread of coronavirus. These measures may vary according to the severity of the outbreak in the country of origin, and could include: daily health monitoring by telephone call after arrival; health monitoring at the travellerâ€™s place of residence, or quarantine in a hospital for 14 days. You should carry additional supplies of necessary medication and toiletries in carry-on luggage.
The Kazakh Ministry of Foreign Affairs website has further details in English. If you need further information about entry requirements, contact the local immigration authorities or the nearest Kazakh embassy. You should also check with your airline or travel company for the latest information.
Further information on coronavirus, including advice on preparing for foreign travel and helping reduce the spread of the virus, is available from Public Health England and on the TravelHealthPro website.
