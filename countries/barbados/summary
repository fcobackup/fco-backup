On arrival, you will undergo a rapid antigen test. If positive, you will be transferred to the government isolation facility. If negative, you will be required to quarantine at government approved facilities (a designated holding hotel, approved villa or a government facility at your own expense), and undertake a further test 5 days after your arrival. You will need to stay in your hotel room and may be required to wear an electronic tracking bracelet until you receive the results of your second test. If this second test is negative you will no longer be subject to quarantine. The government aims to return results within 48 hours but there have been some delays. Check the Barbados Travel Protocols carefully for full details of these requirements

To secure your pre-departure test, you should visit the Garfield Sobers Gymnasium (open 9.30am-4pm) in Wildey, Bridgetown, during the three days prior to your departure. The process is estimated to last 90 minutes, after which you will receive your result. Cost is 100 Barbadian dollars, payable by card only. We encourage you to get tested as early as possible before your departure. Further information can be obtained by phoning (+1246) 628 4150 or emailing travelprotocols@visitbarbados.org. Information on UK test requirements can be found here.
Protocols can change at short notice. You should regularly monitor and follow the Barbados Government Information Service website and Barbados Travel Protocols. The Barbadian authorities will seek to prosecute people who breach COVID-19 protocols, including those who break quarantine protocols, which may result in a fine and/or prison sentence.
