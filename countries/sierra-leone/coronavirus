Be prepared for your plans to change
No travel is risk-free during COVID-19. Countries may further restrict travel or bring in new rules at short notice, for example due to a new COVID-19 variant. Check with your travel company or airline for any transport changes which may delay your journey home.
If you test positive for COVID-19, you may need to stay where you are until you test negative. You may also need to seek treatment there.
Plan ahead and make sure you:
can access money
understand what your insurance will cover
can make arrangements to extend your stay and be away for longer than planned

Healthcare in Sierra Leone
If you think you have COVID-19 symptoms or have tested positive for COVID-19 you should call the Government of Sierra Leone emergency line on 117 who will advise you further. Most cases will be able to self-isolate at home or in their hotel. If medical treatment is needed, it will be arranged by the Government of Sierra Leone for free at one of the COVID-19 designated facilities, most likely the Medical 34 hospital in Freetown. The Ministry of Health website has additional information.
Local medical care
Hospitals and medical facilities throughout Sierra Leone are limited. Medical supplies are unreliable and availability limited. There is no effective public or commercial accident and emergency or ambulance service in the country. You should carry basic medical supplies. Ensure you have adequate supplies of prescription medication, bearing in mind the risk of delays due to flight cancellations. Make sure you have adequate travel health insurance and accessible funds to cover the cost of any medical treatment abroad, medical evacuation and repatriation.
