The Foreign, Commonwealth & Development Office (FCDO) provides advice about risks of travel to help British nationals make informed decisions. Find out more about FCDO travel advice. 
Dual Chinese-British nationality
Hong Kong does not recognise dual nationality. If you have both British and Chinese nationality, you may be treated as a Chinese citizen by local authorities, even if you enter Hong Kong on your British passport. If this is the case, the British Consulate-General may not be able to offer you consular help.    
If you have formally renounced Chinese citizenship, carry evidence that you have done so.
