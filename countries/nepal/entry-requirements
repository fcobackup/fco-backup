The information on this page covers the most common types of travel and reflects the UK government’s understanding of the rules currently in place. Unless otherwise stated, this information is for travellers using a full ‘British Citizen’ passport.
The authorities in the country or territory you’re travelling to are responsible for setting and enforcing the rules for entry. If you’re unclear about any aspect of the entry requirements, or you need further reassurance, you’ll need to contact the embassy, high commission or consulate of the country or territory you’re travelling to.
You should also consider checking with your transport provider or travel company to make sure your passport and other travel documents meet their requirements.
Visas
You will need a visa to enter Nepal.
To apply for a visa in the UK, contact the Embassy of Nepal, 12A, Kensington Palace Gardens, London, W8 4QU (telephone: +20 7229 1594 or 6231 or 5352). A Nepali visa is valid for entry for three to six months from the date of issue.
If you’re visiting Nepal as a tourist, you can get a 15, 30 or 90-day visa on arrival at Tribhuvan International Airport and at some land borders. You will need to fill in an application form on arrival and provide a passport photograph. Check the Nepali Department of Immigration website for more information.
Multiple-entry visas are useful if you are planning travel to Tibet, Bhutan or India. You can change your single-entry visa to a multiple-entry visa at Kathmandu’s Central Immigration Office for US$20.
You can extend your visa up to 30 days by applying to the Nepali Department of Immigration at Kalikasthan, Kathmandu (telephone: +977 1 4429659).
You must have a valid visa in your passport to leave Nepal. If your visa has expired you will have to arrange an extension at the Department of Immigration, before your departure.
Overstaying without authority is serious. Foreign nationals who overstay in Nepal without a valid visa are subject to (i) a fine of up to 50,000 Nepali Rupees, and/or (ii) deportation from Nepal. Approval of the Ministry of Home Affairs is required for deportation, which could be a lengthy process. The immigration office may detain overstayers until the decision is made by the Ministry of Home Affairs. For more information, check the Nepal Immigration website.
Passport validity
Your passport must be valid for at least 6 months when you submit your application for a visa.
Yellow fever certificate requirements
Check whether you need a yellow fever certificate by visiting the National Travel Health Network and Centre’s TravelHealthPro website.
Medication
If you’re planning to take medication into Nepal, you should bring the prescription with you. For further details contact the Embassy of Nepal.
UK Emergency Travel Documents
UK Emergency Travel Documents (ETDs) are accepted for entry, transit and exit from Nepal with a valid visa.
If you’re issued with an ETD in Nepal to use to exit Nepal, you will need to get an exit visa stamp from the Department of Immigration Office in Kathmandu.
