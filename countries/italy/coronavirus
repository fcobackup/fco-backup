Be prepared for your plans to change
No travel is risk-free during COVID-19. Countries may further restrict travel or bring in new rules at short notice, for example due to a new COVID-19 variant. Check with your travel company or airline for any transport changes which may delay your journey home.
If you test positive for COVID-19, you may need to stay where you are until you test negative. You may also need to seek treatment there.
Plan ahead and make sure you:
can access money
understand what your insurance will cover
can make arrangements to extend your stay and be away for longer than planned
Public spaces and travel within Italy
Public spaces and services
If you are visiting a hospital ward or care home, you must wear a FFP2 mask and you must be able to demonstrate you have had:
a booster dose (in addition to the primary vaccination course) AND a negative test OR
a primary vaccination course AND a negative test OR
a COVID-19 recovery certificate AND a negative test
You must provide a negative test result, regardless of your vaccination status. This can be either a rapid antigen test taken within the previous 48 hours, or a PCR test taken within the previous 72 hours. Self-tests are not accepted.
You can use a “Green Pass” (website only in Italian), also known as an EU digital COVID-19 certificate, to certify vaccination, recovery or negative test result.
Italy will accept the UK’s proof of COVID-19 recovery and vaccination record as the equivalent to a Green or Super Green Pass as long as it is in the form of a verifiable QR code.
You can also obtain a Green Pass valid for 48 hours by testing negative to a rapid COVID-19 test available from local pharmacies and test centres.
Children aged 11 and under are exempt from presenting a Green Pass and Super Green Pass.
Anyone falsifying a certificate is liable to face a fine of up to €3000 or a prison sentence.
Regional and local authorities in Italy are empowered to adjust these measures where required, which may occur at short notice. You should consult the websites for the regions in which you are travelling for the latest information.
Healthcare in Italy
COVID-19 testing is widely available at private clinics. Rapid testing is also available in many pharmacies. You should contact local authorities for information on testing facilities.
Developing symptoms of COVID-19 while in Italy
If you think you have symptoms, you should take a test at a local pharmacy. You can call your regional hotline for advice. Most of the regional hotlines listed have English speaking staff. You can also call your local ASL (Azienda Sanitaria Locale).
You can find details of English speaking doctors on our list of healthcare providers.
EHIC or GHIC covers state healthcare only, not private treatment. You will be responsible for the cost of any treatment provided by a private doctor or private clinic.
Close contact
If you come into close contact with someone who tests positive, you will need to self-monitor and wear a FFP2 mask for 10 days from the last contact. If you develop symptoms you should take a test when the symptoms occur and, if symptoms remain, test again on the fifth day after being in contact with the positive person. Local health authorities have now indicated you can test in a private facility. If you do so, you must send a digital copy of your negative test certificate to the local ASL office.
For further details please see Ministry of Health website (only in Italian).

If you are tested and the result is positive, you must self-isolate for 5 days. In order to be released from self-isolation, you must produce a negative PCR or antigen test. The local health authority determines the type of test they will use and the pattern of testing. You will also need to have been symptom-free for at least 2 days.
If you continue to test positive, you must remain in self-isolation for a maximum of 14 days from the first positive test.
