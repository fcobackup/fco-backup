If you’re unclear about any aspect of the entry requirements, or you need further reassurance, you’ll need to contact the embassy, high commission or consulate of the country or territory you’re travelling to.
You should also consider checking with your transport provider or travel company to make sure your passport and other travel documents meet their requirements.
Restrictions in response to coronavirus
Screening on arrival
All visitors must present a negative PCR test for COVID-19 on arrival to Maldives. The test and negative PCR certificate must be issued no more than 96 hours prior to departure. You should not use the NHS testing service to get a test in order to facilitate your travel to another country. You should arrange to take a private test.
All travellers to the Maldives must fill in a Traveller Health Declaration form 24 hours before departure to and return from the Maldives.
All passengers and airline crew need to complete an Immigration Arrival Card when arriving in the Maldives.
Temperature checks and screening procedures will be in place on arrival. Quarantine facilities have been set up to isolate any suspected cases of COVID-19. Travellers presenting symptoms of COVID-19 upon arrival will be subjected to a PCR test at the traveller’s cost or at the cost of the tourist facility where the traveller is booked to stay in the Maldives. Additionally, local health authorities may conduct random testing, at no cost to travellers.
Quarantine requirements
All non-tourist passengers travelling from the UK (includes 12-hour transit) to the Maldives (such as residents, work visa holders and returning students) that have completed two doses of vaccination will need to provide a negative PCR test of no more than 96 hours and are not required to quarantine on arrival. Those who have not completed vaccinations will need to self-isolate for 14 days and register on the Haalubelun portal. After completing the quarantine, you must do an exit test.
These requirements do not apply to tourists and the government has said it has no plans to quarantine tourists on arrival.
Data collection
All visitors to Maldives are encouraged to install the contact tracing application ‘Trace Ekee’ upon or before arrival into the country.
Testing on departure
Testing services are available in the Maldives for tourists who need COVID-19 test results to return to their countries of origin or another destination.
