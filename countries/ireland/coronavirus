Local advice
On 15 September, the Irish Government published a plan for ‘Living with COVID-19’ in the 6-9 months covering the end of 2020 and early 2021.
The revised strategy includes a ‘Framework for Restrictive Measures’ designed to allow people to understand, anticipate and prepare for the measures the government might introduce to stop escalation of the virus. The Framework consists of 5 Levels, which will be imposed depending on the incidence of COVID-19.
On 26 January Ireland announced Level 5 measures would remain in place until at least 5 March. A summary is provided below, but for full details of measures in place please visit the Irish Government website.
