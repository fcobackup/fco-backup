Healthcare in Afghanistan
There is no guarantee that any local health care will be available in the current security situation.
Healthcare in Afghanistan is very limited. Medical facilities, including those in Kabul, do not have the capacity or capability to effectively deal with the COVID-19 outbreak. The supply of ICU beds and ventilators remains low. There are areas which have no medical facilities with ICU beds and ventilators.
COVID-19 treatment centres in Afghanistan are experiencing severe shortages of commodities and drugs. The vaccination programme only recently resumed and is operating at a very low level.
