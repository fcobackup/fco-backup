Protests and civil unrest
In 2019 and early 2020, large-scale political demonstrations took place throughout Hong Kong, including in areas popular with tourists. There were some violent clashes between police and protesters. Protests are now rare, though may still take place at any time. If you’re in and around areas where there are demonstrations, you should remain vigilant, follow the advice of local authorities and move away quickly to a safe place.
The Hong Kong police have stated that they have discovered Improvised Explosive Devices (IEDs) on a number of occasions since October 2019. The police believe that devices were intended to target police officers, while more recent devices have been aimed at a wider range of targets. No-one has been injured in these incidents to date, but there is a continuing risk of IEDs being used in Hong Kong.
Crime
The level of violent crime is very low but pick pocketing and other street crime can occur. You should take extra care of passports, credit cards and money in crowded areas and when checking in and out of hotels. If you intend to hike in Hong Kong’s Country Parks you should stick to marked trails and avoid carrying valuables.
Personal attacks, including sexual assaults, are rare but do occur, including through drinks being spiked. You should take reasonable precautions - don’t leave drinks unattended and avoid accepting drinks from strangers. Women, travelling alone or with female friends, could be at greater risk. See advice for women travelling abroad.
