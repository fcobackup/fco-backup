The information on this page covers the most common types of travel and reflects the UK government’s understanding of the rules currently in place. Unless otherwise stated, this information is for travellers using a full ‘British Citizen’ passport.
The authorities in the country or territory you’re travelling to are responsible for setting and enforcing the rules for entry. If you’re unclear about any aspect of the entry requirements, or you need further reassurance, you’ll need to contact the embassy, high commission or consulate of the country or territory you’re travelling to.
You should also consider checking with your transport provider or travel company to make sure your passport and other travel documents meet their requirements.
Entry rules in response to coronavirus (COVID-19)
Entry to Gabon
Flight restrictions have eased to allow two flights per airline, per week. Land and sea borders are closed.
UK nationals must receive authorisation from the Gabonese Ministry of Foreign Affairs before travelling to Gabon. Authorisation can be obtained by sending an e-mail addressed to the ‘Minister’ or ‘Secretary General’ at the following e-mail address: ginetedzang2@gmail.com.
All passengers travelling to Gabon must present a valid negative polymerase chain reaction (PCR) test no older than 3 days or a valid COVID-19 vaccination certificate for entry into Gabon. See ‘Demonstrating your COVID-19 vaccination status’
On arrival, all passengers must take a compulsory test for COVID-19 at Libreville Airport. Passengers are then required to self-isolate for 24 hours whilst the COVID-19 test is being processed. If the COVID-19 test is negative, passengers will be issued a test certificate, which is valid for 14 days and can be renewed at the end of this period after another test is undertaken. Holders of vaccination certificates are exempt from the compulsory testing and self-isolation.
If a COVID-19 test taken at the airport is positive, then passengers are required to continue self-isolation and await specific instructions from Gabonese health authorities. All COVID-19 tests taken in Gabon supersede any that were taken before arrival in Gabon.
Demonstrating your COVID-19 vaccination status
Gabon will accept the UK’s solutions to demonstrate your COVID vaccination status. Your NHS appointment card from vaccination centres is not designed to be used as proof of vaccination and should not be used to demonstrate your vaccine status.
Visas
On 16 March 2020, the Government of Gabon announced the suspension of tourist visas for British nationals. All Gabon diplomatic missions abroad are prohibited from issuing entry visas to Gabon without special authorisation. For full information on the visa application process, visit the website of the Gabonese Embassy in the UK.
The Government of Gabon confirmed it would not penalise British nationals whose visas have expired while they were unable to leave the country whilst borders were closed. Now that commercial flights are running, if your visa has expired, you should consider leaving the country.
