Warning
FCDO advises against all travel to parts of Philippines.

Before you travel check that:
your destination can provide the healthcare you may need
you have appropriate travel insurance for local treatment or unexpected medical evacuation
This is particularly important if you have a health condition or are pregnant.
Emergency medical number
Call 911 and ask for an ambulance.
Contact your insurance company promptly if you’re referred to a medical facility for treatment.
Vaccinations and health risks
At least 8 weeks before your trip check the latest information on vaccinations and health risks in TravelHealthPro’s Philippines guide. Risks include:
dengue
tick-borne encephalitis
zika virus
Find out where to get vaccines and whether you have to pay on the NHS travel vaccinations page.
Mosquito-borne diseases are a risk all year round. However, there’s a heightened risk of dengue during the rainy season (June to October). You should take precautions to avoid being bitten by mosquitoes.
Medication
The legal status and regulation of some medicines prescribed or bought in the UK can be different in other countries.
Read best practice when travelling with medicines on TravelHealthPro.
The NHS has information on whether you can take your medicine abroad.
Healthcare facilities in the Philippines
The availability of medical care varies across the Philippines and may not meet the standards of care in the UK, particularly in rural and remote areas. Many places, including some tourist destinations, do not have easy access to emergency medical care.
Private hospital treatment and medical transport is expensive – the daily cost in intensive care units can be more than £1,000. Make sure you have adequate travel health insurance and accessible funds to cover the cost of any medical treatment, including repatriation.
Travel and mental health
Read FCDO guidance on travel and mental health. There is also mental health guidance on TravelHealthPro.
