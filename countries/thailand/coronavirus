Coronavirus travel health
From 1 October 2022, Thailand reclassifies COVID-19 from a dangerous communicable disease to a communicable disease under surveillance. This reduces protocols and restrictions on COVID-19.

If you plan to pass through another country to return to the UK, check the travel advice for the country you are transiting.
Be prepared for your plans to change
No travel is risk-free during COVID-19. Countries may further restrict travel or bring in new rules at short notice, for example due to a new COVID-19 variant. Check with your travel company or airline for any transport changes which may delay your journey home.
Plan ahead and make sure you:
can access money
understand what your insurance will cover
can make arrangements to extend your stay and be away for longer than planned

COVID-related restrictions in Thailand
From 1 October 2022, Thailand reclassifies COVID-19 from a dangerous communicable disease to a communicable disease under surveillance.
Mask wearing is a voluntary practice. However, the Ministry of Public Health continues to recommend that you wear a mask in a crowded or badly ventilated area such as public transportation, hospitals, elderly carehomes, and kindergarten. Inside public buildings, you will need to wear a mask unless you are by yourself or are doing activities in which a mask cannot be worn. More information can be found on the PR Thai Government page.
Accommodation
Hotel and private rental accommodation is available throughout Thailand. However, some hotels, services, and facilities mayremain closed.
Hotels may take your temperature on arrival and ask you to provide information on your recent travel history and any symptoms you may have related to COVID-19. You may also need to follow other disease control measures implemented by the hotel. We advise you to contact hotels directly when booking.
Health
Self-screening for COVID-19 with rapid antigen testing (ATK) is recommended only when present with suspected symptoms.
If you test positive for COVID-19 and present with no or mild symptoms, you are not required to be isolated, but would be advised to strictly follow measures of the distancing, mask-wearing, handwashing, and temperature-checking, and take strict precautions to prevent disease transmission for five days.
If you are at high-risk of contacting COVID-19, you will have to self-monitor for 10 days and conduct rapid antigen testing (ATK) on Day 5 and Day 10.
If you think you have COVID-19 symptoms, you should call the Thai COVID-19 Hotline on 1422.
If you need a COVID-19 test, Thailand’s Ministry of Public Health has compiled a list of private and government-managed testing facilities. These will provide you with a test and normally contact you afterwards with the result. Authorities may also contact you as part of their tracing process.
If you have more severe symptoms Thai public health regulations require that you quarantine at either a hospital, a repurposed hotel with medical capabilities or field hospital.
If you test positive for the Omicron variant your case should be handled in the same way as other forms of COVID-19, but there may be significant variation in treatment in different hospitals and care providers.
You may be separated from your children if they test positive for COVID-19. If this happens and you need help, you can call the Embassy on +66 (0)2 305 8333.
There may also be specific measures in place that impact on maternity services in some hospitals. You should ensure you understand your health care provider’s policies so you can make the choices that work best for you. The WHO has useful guidance on COVID and maternity/post-natal care.
