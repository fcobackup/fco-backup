On 27 March Croatian immigration authorities announced that foreign travellers to Croatia who are unable to leave due to COVID-19 restrictions will not face sanctions for overstaying the conditions of their stay. Those who are unable to leave on time are advised to contact their nearest police station to register their continued stay and to prevent complications upon departure.
