Cases of coronavirus (COVID-19) have been confirmed in Ethiopia. The Ethiopian authorities have introduced a number of measures to limit the spread of the virus.
Entry and borders
On 23 March the Government of Ethiopia announced the closure of the country’s land borders. You should check for updates with local authorities before travelling to the border.
Addis Ababa Bole International Airport (and other international ports of arrival) have put in place additional measures to screen passengers arriving, departing or transiting through Ethiopia. Screening may include temperature measurements and checks on recent travel to affected areas.
Those people displaying symptoms linked to coronavirus may be transferred to a nearby isolation facility for up to 24 hours while further tests are carried out. The Ethiopian Public Health Institute advises that anyone who tests positive for the virus but displays only mild symptoms will be required to remain at the isolation facility for a further 14 days, in line with WHO guidance. Anyone with a pre-existing condition that requires regular medicines should bring sufficient amounts to cover a potential unplanned additional 2 week stay. More serious cases will be transferred to hospital.
Quarantine
All passengers arriving into the country will be subject to mandatory 14 day quarantine in hotels designated by the local authorities. The cost of staying at the hotel during quarantine will be borne by passengers. You may need to demonstrate that you can afford the cost of your hotel quarantine before boarding your flight. Contact your airline for more details.
Passengers with an onward ticket are exempt from quarantine. When booking flights that transit through Addis Ababa, you should avoid flights that will require long transit periods. If you are transiting for more than 8 hours, you will be taken to a designated hotel for the duration of your transfer. If your transit is up to 8 hours, you may remain within the airport.
Local measures
On 8 April the Government of Ethiopia declared a State of Emergency to help limit the spread of coronavirus. The State of Emergency will last for five months and gives the Federal Government and security forces increased power to impose limitations. Measures include:
All meetings of four or more people for religious, government, social or political purposes are prohibited.
For gatherings of three or fewer people, individuals will be expected to ensure that they are 2 adult strides apart at all times. Exceptions for funerals and other essential functions to take place will be considered on a case-by-case basis.
Schools, bars, cinemas, theatres and nightclubs have been closed. Cafes and Restaurants must have no more than three people at a table with tables at least two adult strides apart.
Wearing of face masks is mandatory when visiting ‘service providing’ places such as shops and everyone must stand at least two strides apart.
Greetings by handshake are banned.
All movements across land borders, except for the flow of cargo and essential goods, are suspended.
Public transport will reduce passenger loads on vehicles to ensure social distancing is possible.
Landlords are banned from evicting or increasing rents on private tenants residing in their properties for the duration of the State of Emergency.
All commercial and private employers bound by the Labour proclamation will be prohibited from reducing their workforces or prematurely terminating employment contracts.
Students and teachers are banned from meeting and are only permitted to connect online or by other means that do not contravene social distancing measures.
Although lawyers will still be able to confer with their clients in correctional facilities with the necessary precautions in place, all other prison visits are prohibited.
Sporting activities at all levels are prohibited.
Children’s playgrounds and other such venues will be closed.
Any person failing to comply with the measures could face up to three years imprisonment or a fine of between 1,000 and 200,000 Ethiopian Birr (£25 – £5,000). The security forces can enforce these measures where necessary. You should comply with all such limitations and monitor local media for further updates.
Oromia, Amhara, SNNP, Harari and Tigray regional states have banned or restricted public transport to help limit the spread of coronavirus. Tigray has instituted additional quarantine measures for those travelling from overseas and other parts of Ethiopia and curtailed movement between cities and rural areas in the region. You should follow the advice of the local authorities.
Healthcare
You can call the Ethiopian COVID-19 helplines on 8335 or 952 for advice or if you are experiencing symptoms while in Ethiopia. Current information is available from the Ethiopian Public Health Institute.
Private healthcare facilities used by the international community with the capability to respond to coronavirus cases exist, but capacity is limited. These facilities are also those most frequently recommended by British travel insurance companies for other illnesses or injuries. You should therefore be aware that the ability to access treatment for other ailments is likely to be limited. You should check with your insurance company which facilities they recommend and phone the healthcare facility before you visit.
Crime
There have been reports of abusive behaviour towards foreigners in relation to coronavirus, including a small number of cases of assault. See Crime for advice on crime in Ethiopia.
Further information
Further information on coronavirus, including advice on preparing for foreign travel and helping reduce the spread of the virus, is available from Public Health England, and the TravelHealthPro website.
