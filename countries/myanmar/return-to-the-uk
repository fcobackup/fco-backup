Flights
The military have extended the suspension of normal commercial passenger flights until 31 May 2021. However, the airport is open and some relief flights are available for those seeking to leave Myanmar. Most of these are commercially bookable. Advertised flights can be changed at short notice, so please check with your airline or travel agent before travelling to the airport.
If you wish to book a flight it is important that you do this early. From 21 May 2021 the Ministry of Transport and Communication has instructed airlines to send the list of all passengers, leaving overseas by air, to the Ministry of Foreign Affairs 10 days in advance of the flight
All travellers should check with the embassies of respective transit countries for the latest transit, entry and COVID-19 testing requirements before making ticket purchases.
You should ensure that you meet the baggage allowance restrictions for all your flights, as some travellers have found the allowance on the second leg to be lower than that of the first. If you exceed the allowance on any leg of your journey excess baggage charges will be applied, and will only be payable in US dollars.
Your journey home: before you leave Myanmar
What you must do when you arrive in England from abroad depends on where you have been in the 10 days before you arrive. It is important that you check the full rules and country listings before you travel on the on the UK government website.
We strongly recommend that you complete a passenger locator form before going to the airport due to unpredictable WiFi connectivity at the airport. If you are completing your journey to the UK on the same airline that you used to leave Yangon, you will not be able to complete your locator form in transit because a reference number from Yangon is required.
As of 21 February, you do not need to take a test if you began your journey to the UK from Myanmar. The present situation in Myanmar means that it is not reasonable to seek to obtain a predeparture coronavirus test in that country before departure to the UK. The guidance will be reviewed regularly. Sign up to get an email alert whenever this page is updated.
Passengers travelling to the UK can request a letter from the British Embassy Yangon, outlining the UK position on pre-departure coronavirus tests. You should send full details of name, passport number and confirmed flight details to Yangon.Consular@fcdo.gov.uk with ‘Pre-departure Test Letter Request’ in the subject line.
It is important to note that airlines and transit locations may have their own requirements for COVID tests and you should check this in advance of travel. If you do not have a valid British Passport, the British Embassy can issue emergency travel documents or emergency passports should you need to leave the country in the near future. You should call the Embassy for further assistance or <contact Yangon.Consular@fcdo.gov.uk>. More details can be found on the emergency travel document page.
If you intend to bring a pet back to the UK from Myanmar, you should check the regulations carefully. Your pet will be required to spend four months in quarantine on arrival in the UK due to rabies controls. The only exception to this requirement would be if the pet has been vaccinated against rabies at least three months before travelling and has proof of a positive titre test.
The National Travel Health Network and Centre (NaTHNaC) provides advice on how to stay safe as you travel by air.
