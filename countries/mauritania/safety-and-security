Political situation
Following Presidential elections on 22 June, provisional results issued by the Electoral Commission indicate former Armed Forces Chief, Mohamed Ould Ghazouani won 52.01% in the first round and would therefore be elected automatically without recourse to a second round. Opposition candidates have contested the result while opposition supporters have clashed with police. Final results should be confirmed by the Constitutional Council within 10 days of election day, once any formal complaints have been assessed. Demonstrations in Nouakchott have led to confrontations with security forces; tear gas has been used and the situation remains tense. You should avoid political gatherings and demonstrations and follow the advice of local authorities. Always observe instructions given by the local security forces.
Crime
Crime levels are moderate but steadily increasing. You should avoid the unlit and isolated beach at Nouakchott and ‘Le Cinquième’ district after dark. A number of thefts and violent incidents have been reported there in recent years.
Local travel
Crossing the border into Mauritania can be time-consuming and officials may ask for payments before they allow you to cross. There have been reports that some southern border crossings were closed at the height of the Ebola virus outbreak in Guinea and neighbouring countries. You should check local advice before travelling.
Road travel
The conditions of paved roads in Mauritania are generally poor, and overland travel is difficult. Use four wheel drive vehicles, check the tide times on coastal roads, travel in convoy and make sure you have adequate supplies of water and fuel. Driving standards can also be poor.
You can drive with a valid UK driving licence.
If you’re planning to hire a car, check with your car hire company for information on their requirements before you travel.
Sea travel
Sailing in the port at Nouadhibou can be dangerous because of the number of shallow shipwrecks.
