British travellers who wish to leave Hungary should make arrangements to do so as soon as possible, due to the rapidly changing circumstances and airport closures in neighbouring countries.
Countries neighbouring Hungary (Austria, Croatia, Romania, Serbia, Slovakia, Slovenia and Ukraine) have also introduced restrictions. Please check country-specific FCO Travel Advice for details. Keep up to date with information from your tour operator, transport or accommodation provider on the impact on any existing travel plans. You should also check with your airline or travel company for the latest information.
Budapest Airport remains open until further notice.
