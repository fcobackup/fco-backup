This page reflects the UK government’s understanding of current rules for people travelling on a full ‘British Citizen’ passport, for the most common types of travel.
The authorities in Azerbaijan set and enforce entry rules. For further information contact the embassy, high commission or consulate of the country or territory you’re travelling to. You should also consider checking with your transport provider or travel company to make sure your passport and other travel documents meet their requirements.
Entry rules in response to coronavirus (COVID-19)
Travelling to Azerbaijan
There are a large number of international flights to and from Baku. There are also a limited number of commercial international flights available to and from other regional airports. Check with your travel agent about routes and availability of tickets, and check FCDO Travel Advice for information on transiting other countries.
The use of a medical mask will be required at all times whilst at the airport and on the flight. It is mandatory to keep the mask on at all times except for specific requirements for example at border control, at the request of an airport official or whilst eating.
Azerbaijan’s land borders with all neighbouring countries remain closed.
Screening
British nationals 18 years old and over require either a ‘COVID-19 passport’, a document confirming full vaccination against COVID-19 or a document showing immunity to COVID-19 in order to enter Azerbaijan.
Entry requirements can change with no notice. You should check with your airline before flying for the most up to date information and to see what documentation they will need.
You may be tested for COVID-19 and have your temperature checked on arrival into Azerbaijan. Anyone who displays symptoms of COVID-19 on arrival in Azerbaijan will be directed to the medical station at the airport. From there the case will be reported to the Emergency Medical Services.
There is no longer a requirement for arrivals to Azerbaijan to self-isolate.
Demonstrating your COVID-19 status
Azerbaijan will accept the UK’s proof of COVID-19 recovery and vaccination record. Your NHS appointment card from vaccination centres is not designed to be used as proof of vaccination and should not be used to demonstrate your vaccine status.
Departure from Azerbaijan
Azerbaijan does not require you to produce a negative COVID-19 test to depart the country. However, you should check any testing requirements of the airlines that you are boarding, the country you are travelling to, as well as any countries you may be transiting to see what testing requirement they may have to enable you to travel. You should seek to have any test results you need to produce to fly received via email and printed off, or a paper certificate.
A list of laboratories testing for Coronavirus can be found on Azerbaijan Airlines’ (AZAL) website.
Regular entry requirements
Visas
British nationals travelling to Azerbaijan need to get a visa in advance. The ASAN Visa (e-Visa) service is now open to all British nationals. E-Visas normally take 72 hours to process. An urgent service is available for an additional fee. E-Visas are normally valid for 30 days and are single entry. If you apply for an e-Visa check the ‘Screening’ requirements for entry above.
You can also apply for a visa through the Azerbaijan Embassy-affiliated Visa Service Centre in the UK. When applying for a visa through the Azerbaijan Embassy-affiliated Visa Service Centre you should apply for a visa at least one month ahead of your intended travel date. Check the ‘Screening’ section above before applying for a visa.
Make sure you check the duration of your visa immediately to avoid overstaying unintentionally. Your visa should be valid when departing Azerbaijan.

If you overstay (excluding those with permission to stay through the indefinitely extended e-visa process) you can obtain an ‘Exit Permit’ letter (an official letter giving permission to leave Azerbaijan within 48 hours) from the State Migration Service before you depart. You will be liable to a fine of between AZN300 to AZN400. You should get a receipt.
Passport validity
Your passport should be valid for a minimum period of 6 months when you enter Azerbaijan.
UK Emergency Travel Documents
UK Emergency Travel Documents (ETDs) are accepted for entry, airside transit and exit from Azerbaijan.
Registration
If you’re staying in Azerbaijan for longer than 15 days you must register with the State Migration Service within 15 days of arrival by either visiting the State Migration Service in person or online. Hotels may provide this service for their guests, but visitors staying in apartments or private residences will have to register by themselves. Each traveller is responsible for ensuring that the registration has been completed.
If you’re staying longer than 30 days, you will need to obtain a temporary residence card unless applying to extend your visa on compassionate grounds. For more information refer to the State Migration Service.
Dual nationals
Azerbaijan doesn’t allow adults (18 years or older) to hold dual nationality. You may be refused entry, denied departure or even face criminal liability if you’re 18 years or older and are found to be holding both an Azerbaijani passport and a passport of a different nationality. If you’re a British passport holder with links to Azerbaijan (through birth or otherwise) and wish to check your nationality status contact the State Migration Service before you travel. Children under 18 years old holding a second nationality shouldn’t face any difficulties.
