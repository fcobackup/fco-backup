Be prepared for your plans to change
No travel is risk-free during COVID. Countries may further restrict travel or bring in new rules at short notice, for example due to a new COVID-19 variant. Check with your travel company or airline for any transport changes which may delay your journey home.
If you test positive for COVID-19, you may need to stay where you are until you test negative. You may also need to seek treatment there.
Plan ahead and make sure you:
can access money
understand what your insurance will cover
can make arrangements to extend your stay and be away for longer than planned
Travel in Tonga
Tonga remains subject to two States of Emergency and National COVID-19 Lockdown Restrictions. A State of Emergency for Public Health covering all of Tonga remains in place, as does a second State of Emergency, which was introduced following the Hunga-Tonga Hunga-Ha’apai volcanic eruption. The latter lists locations on Tongatapu and several islands, including in the Ha’apai group, that members of the public are prohibited from visiting.
Under the National COVID-19 Lockdown Restrictions, Tonga operates a Traffic Light Framework which sets the baseline restrictions including timings of the overnight curfew, which is currently in force between 1am - 5am.
For more information on the open border policy framework, States of Emergency and the National COVID-19 Lockdown Restrictions, you should check the latest declarations on the Government of the Kingdom of Tonga’s website.
Public places and services
The National COVID-19 Lockdown Restrictions currently limit the opening times for public places including places of worship, restaurants, bars and nightclubs. For the latest information, check the declarations on the Government of the Kingdom of Tonga’s website.
