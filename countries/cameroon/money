Sterling travellers’ cheques are difficult to exchange throughout Cameroon. Many banks will only allow you to exchange travellers’ cheques if you hold an account with that bank. Euros and US Dollars are the most widely accepted foreign currency.
Cameroon is primarily a cash economy. Payment by credit card is possible in main supermarkets and petrol stations but less acceptable in smaller shops and restaurants; Visa is the most widely accepted. Confirm in advance with your hotel if you plan to settle a bill by credit card.
Some ATMs outside banks in Yaoundé, Douala and other major towns, including at petrol stations, will accept major UK credit cards and supply local currency.
Money transfer agencies can be found throughout Cameroon.
