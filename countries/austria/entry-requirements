The information on this page covers the most common types of travel and reflects the UK government’s understanding of the rules currently in place. Unless otherwise stated, this information is for travellers using a full ‘British Citizen’ passport.
The authorities in the country or territory you’re travelling to are responsible for setting and enforcing the rules for entry. If you’re unclear about any aspect of the entry requirements, or you need further reassurance, you’ll need to contact the embassy, high commission or consulate of the country or territory you’re travelling to.
You should also consider checking with your transport provider or travel company to make sure your passport and other travel documents meet their requirements.
Restrictions in response to coronavirus (COVID-19)
Entry to Austria
Entry to Austria from the United Kingdom is currently prohibited by Austrian law and passenger flights from the UK are not allowed to land in Austria.
The following people are excluded from the entry ban, if you can present a medical certificate confirming a negative coronavirus test. An antigen test cannot be older than 48 hours. For a PCR test 72 hours is acceptable. You must also fill out the Pre-Travel Clearance form. If you are unable to produce a negative test upon entry, you must take a test in Austria within 24 hours. 10-day quarantine is still mandatory, but you can take a self-funded PCR or antigen test after 5 days (the day you arrive in Austria counts as day 0). If the result is negative, you will no longer need to stay in quarantine.

Transit Austria
If you are transiting through Austria without a stopover, you do not need a medical certificate or Pre-Travel Clearance form if you can prove you are transiting.

Regular entry requirements
Visas
The rules for travelling or working in European countries changed on 1 January 2021:
you can to travel to countries in the Schengen area for up to 90 days in any 180-day period without a visa. This applies if you travel as a tourist, to visit family or friends, to attend business meetings, cultural or sports events, or for short-term studies or training
if you are travelling to Austria and other Schengen countries without a visa, make sure your whole visit is within the 90-day limit. Visits to Schengen countries within the previous 180 days before you travel count towards your 90 days
to stay longer, to work or study, for business or for other reasons, you will need to meet the Austrian government’s entry requirements. Check with the Austrian Embassy what type of visa and/or work permit you may need
if you stay in Austria with a visa or permit, this does not count towards your 90-day visa-free limit
Any time you spent in Austria or other Schengen countries before 1 January 2021 does not count towards your 90-day visa-free limit.
At Austrian border control, you may need to use separate lanes from EU, EEA and Swiss citizens when queueing. Your passport may be stamped on entry and exit. You may also need to:
show a return or onward ticket
show you have enough money for your stay
There are separate requirements for those who are resident in Austria. If you are resident in Austria, you should carry proof of residence as well as your valid passport when you travel. For further information on these requirements, see our Living in Austria guide.
Passport validity
Check your passport is valid for travel before you book your trip, and renew your passport if you do not have enough time left on it.
You must have at least 6 months left on an adult or child passport to travel to most countries in Europe (not including Ireland).
If you renewed your current passport before the previous one expired, extra months may have been added to its expiry date. Any extra months on your passport over 10 years may not count towards the 6 months needed.
Travelling with children
If you are a single parent, or travelling with a child who is not your own, you will need documentary evidence of parental responsibility and a letter of consent. For further information on exactly what will be required at immigration contact the Austrian Embassy in London.
