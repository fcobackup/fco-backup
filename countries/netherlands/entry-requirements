The information on this page covers the most common types of travel and reflects the UK government’s understanding of the rules currently in place. Unless otherwise stated, this information is for travellers using a full ‘British Citizen’ passport.
Entry rules in response to coronavirus (COVID-19)
Entry to the Netherlands
General information on coronavirus and travelling to the Netherlands can be found on the Dutch government website (in English).
The Dutch government has adopted the European Union’s recommendation to lift its travel ban for residents of a number of countries from 1 July. The full list of these countries can be found on the European Union’s website. An entry ban remains in place for non-essential travel by non-EU nationals from countries not listed. This ban is not applicable to UK and EU nationals.
A list of airports located in affected areas with high transmission of COVID-19 can be found on the EASA website. This list is subject to regular change.
The authorities in the country or territory you’re travelling to are responsible for setting and enforcing the rules for entry. If you’re unclear about any aspect of the entry requirements, or you need further reassurance, you’ll need to contact the Embassy, High Commission or Consulate of the country or territory you’re travelling to.
You should also consider checking with your transport provider or travel company to make sure your passport and other travel documents meet their requirements.
Testing/screen on arrival
If you’re travelling to or from the Netherlands you must complete a health screening form and have it ready to show on request during your journey, whether you are at the departure airport, on the aircraft or at the arrival airport.
You may be refused permission to travel based on your declaration
On arrival in the Netherlands your declaration will be checked by public health and security authorities.
Quarantine requirements
From 10 July, passengers travelling to the Netherlands from the UK are no longer advised by the Dutch government to self-isolate for 14 days upon arrival.
Regular entry requirements
Visas
If you hold a British Citizen passport, you don’t need a visa to enter the Netherlands. If you’re planning a stay of longer than 3 months, see our Living in the Netherlands guide and contact the Netherlands Embassy if you have further questions.
The rules on travel will stay the same until 31 December 2020.
Passport validity
Your passport should be valid for the proposed duration of your stay; you do not need any additional period of validity on your passport beyond this.
The rules on travel will stay the same until 31 December 2020.
Before you travel, make sure your passport is in good condition. The Netherlands authorities often impound damaged passports and some travellers have had to get an emergency travel document to leave the country.
Travelling with children
Dutch border authorities have strengthened their precautions against child abduction. Parents (particularly fathers) travelling in sole charge of their children are regularly stopped for further checks at Schiphol airport and occasionally prevented from boarding flights.
You should carry a signed authorisation form for travelling abroad with a minor and associated documents (outlined in the above link). See also Get permission to take a child abroad.
UK Emergency Travel Documents
UK ETDs are accepted for entry, airside transit and exit from The Netherlands
Moving to the Netherlands
If you intend to live in the Netherlands, you should get important documents (birth certificate and marriage certificates) officially certified (apostilled) at the FCO Legalisation Office.
