This page has information on travelling to Pakistan.
This page reflects the UK government’s understanding of current rules for people travelling on a full ‘British Citizen’ passport from the UK, for the most common types of travel.
The authorities in Pakistan set and enforce entry rules. If you’re unsure how Pakistan’s entry requirements apply to you, contact its UK embassy, high commission or consulate.
All travellers
You will need a visa to enter or travel through Pakistan as a visitor. For further information consult the High Commission for Pakistan in London.
Passengers aged 12 and above require full vaccination against COVID-19 in order to undertake inbound flights to Pakistan. Some exemptions apply.
If you’re transiting through Pakistan
Transiting is when you pass through one country on the way to your final destination.
Transiting through Pakistan is permitted for travellers who are fully vaccinated.
Land Borders
The Pakistani authorities have closed most land borders with Afghanistan, India and Iran. There are ongoing limited border openings for repatriation and trade. The Torkham border crossing with Afghanistan has been open to those crossing with valid passports and Pakistan visas, which you can apply for on the Ministry of Interior website. All borders with Afghanistan are liable to close at short notice and there are reports of crowding and violence at open crossings. Those crossing into Pakistan may have to comply with coronavirus testing and quarantine measures. The FCDO currently advises against travel to most of the Afghanistan and Iran border areas.
Illegal entry to Pakistan is a serious offence. If you cross from Afghanistan without the correct documentation you may be subject to detention and/or deportation. There is currently no process for regularisation of status for illegal entrants which is necessary for onward travel.
If you’re fully vaccinated
Pakistan accepts vaccines which are currently on the WHO Emergency Use Listing.
On 24 February 2022 Pakistan removed the requirement for a negative COVID-19 PCR test for vaccinated travellers entering the country.
Travellers to Pakistan are no longer required to provide their contact information through the Pass Track App. You may have to fill in a health declaration form on arrival. Pakistan government guidance is available on their COVID-19 website.
Proof of vaccination status
Passengers aged 12 and above must present proof that they have been fully vaccinated to take inbound flights to Pakistan.
Pakistan will accept the UK’s proof of COVID-19 recovery and vaccination record and proof of COVID-19 vaccination issued in the Crown Dependencies. Your NHS appointment card from vaccination centres is not designed to be used as proof of vaccination and should not be used to demonstrate your vaccine status.
If you’re not fully vaccinated
Non-vaccinated passengers who are aged 12 years and above are required to possess a negative PCR test result conducted within 72 hours prior to commencing travel to Pakistan, unless one of the exemptions apply.
Children and young people
Children below 12 years of age do not need to show proof of vaccination to enter Pakistan.
Exemptions to Vaccination Rules
Exemptions to the vaccination rules may apply for:
Passengers who hold a medical certificate stating that they have been medically advised not to receive a COVID-19 vaccine
Passengers who travelled outbound from Pakistan before 1 October 2021 who have connecting flights in Pakistan.
If one of these exemptions apply, you are required to present evidence of a negative COVID-19 PCR test taken up to 72 hours before the start of travel.
Partial, or non-vaccinated travellers seeking further exemption from the vaccination or PCR testing requirement may apply through the relevant Pakistani High Commission to an Exemptions Committee for inbound travel to Pakistan.

Visas
If you’re travelling to Pakistan on a British passport, you will need to get a visa before you travel. Visa violations can be treated as a criminal offence and could result in a fine or detention.
Journalists’ visas often have additional travel restrictions, which you should observe.
For further information consult the High Commission for Pakistan in London, including for information on any changes in visa process during the coronavirus (COVID-19) pandemic.
National Identity Card for Overseas Pakistanis (NICOP)
You can enter Pakistan visa free and remain there for an unlimited period of stay if you hold a valid National Identity Card for Overseas Pakistanis (NICOP) or Smart National Identity Card for Overseas Pakistanis (SNICOP).

UK Emergency Travel Documents
UK Emergency Travel Documents (ETDs) are valid for entry into Pakistan. Holders of an ETD entering or leaving Pakistan will need to have either a valid visa or a National Identity Card for Overseas Pakistanis (NICOP) / Smart National Identity Card for Overseas Pakistanis (SNICOP) issued by the government of Pakistan.
Yellow fever certificate requirements
Check whether you need a yellow fever certificate by visiting the National Travel Health Network and Centre’s TravelHealthPro website.
Returning to the UK
All passengers leaving Pakistan must have a valid visa, a Pakistani national identity card or a valid Pakistani passport. If you are travelling on a British passport and your visa has expired you may not be allowed to board your flight unless you have a visa extension or an exit visa. Contact the Ministry of Interior, or refer to the website of the Directorate General of Immigration and Passports for instructions on visa extensions and exit visas.
If you’re visiting Pakistan for more than 4 weeks, you may need to provide proof of polio vaccination when you leave Pakistan. For more information, see the website of the National Travel Health Network and Centre.
Screening on departure
If you are leaving Pakistan, you may be screened at the airport for any symptoms of COVID-19. You may also be subject to thermal screening for high temperatures. If you are vaccinated and free from symptoms you will be allowed to travel. If you’re suspected of having symptoms of COVID-19, including fever, cough and breathing difficulty, you will be subject to a secondary screening by a medical professional or undergo rapid antigen testing. After which, you may be allowed to board if it is assessed that you do not have symptoms, have not been at risk of exposure and do not have a fever. If the secondary screening assesses that you may have COVID-19 you may be asked to self-isolate 5 days before you can travel. You may also be referred to a medical facility.
