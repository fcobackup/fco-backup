The Foreign, Commonwealth & Development Office (FCDO) advice against all but essential international travel continues to apply for the whole of Jordan.
Additionally, if you’re already in Jordan you should be aware of our pre-existing advice within the country, unrelated to COVID-19:
The FCDO continues to advise against all but essential travel to:
within 3km of Jordan’s border with Syria. See Border areas
Travel to Jordan is subject to entry restrictions
Except for special repatriation flights, Jordan’s airports remain closed to international travel
The Government of Jordan is preparing to open up Queen Alia International Airport to scheduled commercial flights from a list of select countries
See Entry requirements for more information before you plan travel.

If you’re planning travel to Jordan during coronavirus, find out what you need to know about coronavirus there in the Coronavirus section.
During the COVID-19 pandemic, it is more important than ever to get travel insurance and check it provides sufficient cover. See the FCDO’s guidance on foreign travel insurance.
Around 95,800 British nationals visited Jordan in 2019. Most visits are trouble free.
The political situation in Jordan is stable. However, protests and demonstrations sometimes occur, and feelings are running higher because of the pandemic. The majority of demonstrations are peaceful, but you should take sensible precautions and avoid all political gatherings and demonstrations. Follow the advice of local authorities and stay informed of the security situation through the media and this travel advice.
Terrorists are very likely to try to carry out attacks in Jordan. There have been a number of incidents since 2016, some serious. Attacks could be indiscriminate including in places visited by foreigners, particularly hotels, shopping malls and tourist sites. You should take extra care, and in the event of an incident, follow the advice of the Jordanian authorities. See Terrorism
Local laws reflect the fact that Jordan is a predominantly Islamic country. You should respect local traditions, customs, laws and religions at all times and be aware of your actions to ensure that they don’t offend.
You can contact the emergency services by calling 911.
If you’re abroad and you need emergency help from the UK government, contact the nearest British embassy, consulate or high commission. Consular support is limited in the border areas of Jordan where the FCDO advise against all but essential travel, as set out above.
