Entry rules in response to coronavirus (COVID-19)
Entry to Malawi is prohibited except for Malawian nationals and foreign nationals with valid residency visas for Malawi.
Although commercial routes remain closed, there are limited charter flights still operating to Lilongwe from Addis Ababa.
Testing/screening on arrival
The Ministry of Health is now screening all travellers for coronavirus on arrival. If you’re eligible for entry, you will be tested for COVID-19 on arrival. Passengers will be required to remain at the airport or a testing centre until their COVID-19 test results are known, usually within 24 hours.
Current information is available from the Malawi Ministry of Health Facebook page.
Quarantine requirements
Individuals testing positive for coronavirus on arrival may be taken for treatment at a government facility.
All other individuals will be required to self-isolate for 14 days after arrival. Anyone who is unable to self-isolate may be transferred to a local treatment facility for the self-isolation period. Travellers are not permitted to self-isolate in a hotel or lodge.
Regular entry requirements
Visas
You need a visa to enter Malawi as a visitor. You can find details of the application process on the Malawi High Commission website.
