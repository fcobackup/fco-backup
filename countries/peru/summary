In response to the continuing widespread protests following a change of government on 7 December, the Peruvian Government has declared a 30 day nationwide state of emergency. The political situation is volatile. Protests are escalating quickly and include violence. They continue to take place in different parts of the country, including Lima, Apurimac, Arequipa, Cusco, Puno, Ica, and along the Panamericana Highway. This has resulted in the severe disruption of travel, with road blockades, the suspension of train services (including PeruRail and IncaRail train services to/from Machu Picchu) and regional airport closures, including Arequipa, Ayacucho and Juliaca (Puno) airports. Some others have reopened including Cusco airport.
The Peruvian government are organising helicopters to evacuate vulnerable tourists on 17 December from Machu Picchu. British Nationals should register with iPeru through their online form and with local authorities at the Cultural Centre at Avenida Pachacutec in Machu Picchu on 16 December with their passport.
For information on airport closures, please visit the Lima airport website.
British nationals should take particular care to avoid all areas of protests. If possible, you should remain in a safe place. You should also monitor local media, including social media channels, and be aware that travel around the country is extremely difficult. You should plan ahead for severe disruption to any plans.
Travellers arriving in Lima are advised that there is currently no ability to travel to/from many regional areas including Arequipa, and further disruption is possible.
Lima airport is restricting entry to passengers only with valid flight tickets. Travellers should recheck with their airline and tour operator and revisit travel plans ahead of any travel.
British Nationals should also ensure that they respect the government curfew announced on 15 December and effective from 16 December for the next 5 days. The curfew is applicable in some provinces of the following regions: Arequipa (20:00 – 04:00), La Libertad (18:00 – 04:00), Ica (19:00 – 04:00), Apurimac (18:00 – 04:00), Cusco (20:00 – 04:00), Puno (20:00 – 04:00), Huancavelica (19:00 – 04:00), and Ayacucho (20:00 – 04:00).

If you are in need of emergency assistance, contact the nearest British embassy, consulate or high commission. The Peruvian tourist authority i-Peru has separately created an online form for any foreign nationals experiencing transport difficulties to complete, to help them understand who may be affected by the current situation and inform the work of local authorities. This is not a UK Government registration scheme and we will not be contacting those who complete the form.
You should follow the local authorities’ advice and monitor local media closely. Avoid large gatherings and protests. See Safety and Security pages.
Before you travel, check the ‘Entry requirements’ section for Peru’s current entry restrictions and requirements. These may change with little warning. Monitor this advice for the latest updates and stay in contact with your travel provider.
