The information on this page covers the most common types of travel and reflects the UK government’s understanding of the rules currently in place. Unless otherwise stated, this information is for travellers using a full ‘British Citizen’ passport.
The authorities in the country or territory you’re travelling to are responsible for setting and enforcing the rules for entry. If you’re unclear about any aspect of the entry requirements, or you need further reassurance, you’ll need to contact the embassy, high commission or consulate of the country or territory you’re travelling to.
You should also consider checking with your transport provider or travel company to make sure your passport and other travel documents meet their requirements.
Restrictions in response to coronavirus
All those arriving from the UK, regardless of nationality, must self-isolate for 14 days in their homes or other accommodation. On arrival, you will have to complete a form and there will be a requirement to self-isolate for 14 days. Bulgarian authorities will be checking regularly that the quarantine is kept at the address you have provided on the form.
Full information and details of the restrictions currently in place in Bulgaria is regularly reviewed and updated via the Embassy Facebook page.
Commercial flights are operating at a reduced level. Many land borders crossings in the region are restricted or closed for passenger traffic. If you need to travel, plan ahead and before you travel check border information published by the Ministry of Interior (English and Bulgarian)
