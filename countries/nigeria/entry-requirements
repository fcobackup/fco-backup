This page has information on travelling to Nigeria.
This page reflects the UK government’s understanding of current rules for people travelling on a full ‘British Citizen’ passport from the UK, for the most common types of travel.
The authorities in Nigeria set and enforce entry rules. If you’re unsure how Nigeria’s entry requirements apply to you, contact its UK embassy, high commission or consulate.
All travellers
You will need a valid visa to enter or travel through Nigeria as a visitor.
See Visas section for more information.
You may be asked to take part in thermal screening and/or travel history checks when arriving into Nigeria. This is to assist the Nigerian Government in the detection of diseases of public health importance.
All passengers travelling to Nigeria should complete the health questionnaire either on board the aircraft before landing or on arrival at the airport.
If you’re transiting through Nigeria
