There are currently no scheduled commercial flight options available to return to the UK.
The Egyptian authorities announced on 16 March that scheduled flights into and out of the country would be suspended from 19 March until 31 March. The suspension was later extended to 15 April; it may be extended further.
We are now registering British visitors to Egypt who are still here, and still need to return to the UK. We will let those who register with us know as soon as further opportunities to travel arise. These could include flights arranged by the Egyptian authorities to bring home Egyptians stranded in the UK, and flights organised by other countries.
On 30 March the Foreign Secretary announced a new scheme to help British people stranded overseas; in the first instance this will focus on countries where there have been no flights for some time. But we will let you know immediately if flights from Egypt become available.
To register your interest in returning to the UK, please send an email to Cairo.Press@fco.gov.uk. If you need urgent consular assistance, you can contact the Embassy on 02 2791 6000.
You can also follow the British Embassy in Cairo on Facebook and on Twitter.
