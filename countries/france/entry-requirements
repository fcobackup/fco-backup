The authorities in the country or territory you’re travelling to are responsible for setting and enforcing the rules for entry. If you’re unclear about any aspect of the entry requirements, or you need further reassurance, you’ll need to contact the embassy, high commission or consulate of the country or territory you’re travelling to.

Entry rules in response to coronavirus (COVID-19)
Entry to France
From 15 June 2020, travellers arriving in France from the UK and wider European Area (EU, Andorra, Holy See, Iceland, Liechtenstein, Monaco, Norway, San Marino and Switzerland) are no longer required to demonstrate their travel is essential or hold an international travel certificate.
Arrivals from outside the UK and wider European Area will still need to complete an international travel certificate, which certifies that your journey is essential and confirms that you have not been suffering from a set of listed symptoms associated with Covid-19. This travel certificate is available on the French Ministry of the Interior’s website. You should also produce any supporting paperwork to substantiate the essential nature of your travel.
Arrivals from the UK and from outside the wider European Area (listed above) are asked to self-isolate for 14 days on arrival in mainland France. This does not apply to arrivals from within the wider European Area.
Full details and a list of exemptions to self-quarantine in France are set out in a Ministry of Interior press statement (in French) and its translation (in English).

All travellers to French overseas territories will also have to carry out a mandatory 14 day quarantine.
Border checks may also be in place at points on France’s land borders with Italy, Spain, Belgium and Germany.
All travellers to French overseas territories also have to carry out a mandatory 14 day quarantine on arrival, though for Guadeloupe, Martinique, Réunion, St Martin and St Barthelemy this is cut to 7 days for those who, on arrival, present a negative RT-PCR Covid-19 test taken in the previous 72 hours and test negative again after 7 days in quarantine.
