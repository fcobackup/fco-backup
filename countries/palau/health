Serious medical conditions requiring hospitalisation or evacuation may be very expensive. Emergency treatment or treatment for serious conditions is limited and so you may be medically evacuated to another country. Costs can escalate quickly, so make sure you have adequate travel health insurance and accessible funds to cover the cost of any medical treatment abroad and repatriation. 
If you need emergency medical assistance during your trip, dial 911 and ask for an ambulance. You should contact your insurance/medical assistance company as soon as you’re referred to a medical facility for treatment.
