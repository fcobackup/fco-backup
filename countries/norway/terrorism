Terrorist attacks in Norway can’t be ruled out. Attacks could be indiscriminate, including in places visited by foreigners.
There was a shooting incident in the city of Oslo in the early hours of Saturday 25 June. Following that incident, the authorities have raised the national Terrorism Threat scale from Level 3 (moderate) to Level 5 (extraordinary threat situation) – the highest level on the Norwegian scale.
The authorities advise that raising the Terrorism Threat scale to Level 5, “does not itself require any measures or response from the public, except for increased awareness”.
