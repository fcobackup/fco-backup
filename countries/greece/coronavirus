Coronavirus travel health
Check the latest information on risk from COVID-19 for Greece on the TravelHealthPro website.
See the TravelHealthPro website for further advice on travel abroad and reducing spread of respiratory viruses during the COVID-19 pandemic.
Entry and borders
See Entry requirements to find out what you will need to do in order to enter Greece.
If you plan to pass through another country to return to the UK, check the travel advice for the country youâ€™re transiting.
Be prepared for your plans to change
No travel is risk-free during COVID-19. Countries may further restrict travel or bring in new rules at short notice, for example due to a new COVID-19 variant. Check with your travel company or airline for any transport changes which may delay your journey home.
What to do if you test positive while in Greece
If you test positive for COVID-19 while in Greece you must self-isolate for 5 days from the date of the positive test result. You may leave self-isolation after 5 days if you have not had a fever in the past 24 hours, otherwise you should continue to self-isolate.
There is an exception for tourists leaving Greece to return home. You may leave self-isolation before the end of the 5 day isolation period in order to travel back to your country of origin, provided you wear a high protection mask and do not have a fever.
If you test positive for COVID-19 you should inform your accommodation provider. If you have serious symptoms you may be transferred to a medical centre dedicated to COVID-19 treatment. The UK government will not cover quarantine costs for British nationals.
The above guidance may not apply in the case of variants of special interest. These cases will be assessed by the EMEA (Greek health authority) and appropriate instructions will be given.
Plan ahead and make sure you:
can access money
understand what your insurance will cover
can make arrangements to extend your stay and be away for longer than planned
EHIC or GHIC cards cannot be used to cover any additional expenses you incur while self-isolating. Make sure you have access to funds to cover the costs or take out insurance, checking the policy has adequate cover.
Find out more from the NHS website about EHIC and GHIC healthcare cover abroad.
Wearing a mask
It is mandatory to wear a mask on all public transport, including taxis and indoor spaces on boats, and in hospitals and care facilities for the elderly.
It is also advised to wear a mask in pharmacies.
Public spaces and services
Regional Units have imposed local measures in the past, when the spread of Covid-19 has been particularly high and hospital capacity limited. Travellers should check the latest local guidance.
Accommodation
All hotels are permitted to open, and other types of accommodation, including e.g. Airbnb, private rentals and hostels, are also available. However, you should note that many operators are likely to reduce their offer and close some accommodation during the winter months.
Healthcare in Greece
If you think you have symptoms of Covid-19, including a fever or respiratory difficulties such as shortness of breath or a cough, you should avoid visiting local health facilities, but contact a doctor remotely to see whether a test is recommended. There is likely to be a cost associated with this, for call out, examination and testing, which you will have to pay.
If you are staying in a hotel or resort, your accommodation provider will have a list of private doctors that they will call to assess your symptoms and conduct a COVID-19 test.
If you have arranged your own accommodation you can find details of English speaking, private doctors on our list of healthcare providers.
For more information, consult the Greek National Public Health Organisation (NPHO) online or via telephone (dial 1135, or 210 521 2054, from within Greece).
Your emotional and mental wellbeing is important. Read guidance on how to look after your mental wellbeing and mental health.
