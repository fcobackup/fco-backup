Accommodation is generally open at the current time.
Public places and services
Gatherings of over 50 people are prohibited. Restrictions on bars, restaurants and entertainment spots have been lifted.
Visits to public institutions, including government buildings, have been limited.
You must wear a face mask in public spaces and there is systematic sanctioning of those people found to have breached restriction and confinement measures imposed on them.
Schools and other educational establishments have reopened, except in the North West and South West regions, where many remain closed due to the ongoing conflict.
Healthcare in Cameroon
Pharmacies and health centres remain open. They have a green cross outside. Most are extremely helpful to clients. Pharmacies in Cameroon tend to accept prescriptions drawn up in the UK. Not all pharmacies have full stocks so you should be prepared to have to visit more than one for some drugs – a pharmacy will usually advise you on other possibilities nearby. Most supermarkets do not have a pharmacy inside. If you are hospitalised in Cameroon and need drugs of any kind, you, or an accompanying person, will have to visit a pharmacy (usually in the hospital) to buy the drugs first and then return to the ward before you can be treated.

The Medicines and Healthcare Products Regulatory Agency (MHRA) is the UK authority responsible for assessing the safety, quality and efficacy of vaccines. It has authorised the Pfizer/BioNTech, Oxford/AstraZeneca and Moderna vaccines for temporary supply and use in the UK. Find out more about MHRA approval for these vaccines.
