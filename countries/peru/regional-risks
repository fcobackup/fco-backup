Warning
FCDO advises against all but essential travel to parts of Peru.

This section has safety advice for regions of Peru. It only covers regions where the Foreign, Commonwealth & Development Office (FCDO) has specific advice. 
You should also read FCDO’s overall travel advice and safety and security advice. 
Peru-Colombia border
FCDO advises against all but essential travel to areas within 20km south of the Putumayo River and the border between Peru and Colombia (Loreto region) except for: 
the Amazon River
the area of the triple border with Brazil and Colombia from and including the towns of Caballococha in Peru up to the actual triple border at Santa Rosa de Yavari town
This is due to a high level of violence from organised criminal gangs who produce and traffic illegal drugs.  
Putumayo River
The advice against all but essential travel applies to the Peruvian side of the Putumayo riverbank, though not on the river itself. If you are planning to leave a boat on the Colombian side of the river, check Colombia travel advice.
The Putumayo River forms most of Peru’s border with Colombia. The area is known for intensive cocaine and marijuana production. Drug trafficking and other violent organised crime takes place on and around the river.
Valley of the Apurímac, Ene and Mantaro rivers (VRAEM)
FCDO advises against all but essential travel to the Valley of the Apurímac, Ene and Mantaro Rivers, also known as the VRAEM region.
Remnants of the Shining Path guerrilla group occasionally attack the police, military forces and local authorities in this area. They do not usually target tourists. However, you could be a victim of violence due to mistaken identity or by getting caught up in a security incident involving others.
There is little assistance available in this area from the Peruvian authorities, and any British Embassy assistance is severely limited.
Note that some parts of the Apurimac River in the Departments of Cusco and Arequipa are not within the VRAEM.
Amazon River
Armed criminals operate along the Amazon River and have targeted solo travellers and foreign nationals. These include:
thieves, known locally as ‘river pirates’
organised criminal gangs, who transport and smuggle illegal drugs
Travel with a reputable commercial or travel company if you are visiting the Amazon River. Stay on your boat where it passes through areas where FCDO advises against all but essential travel.
There is little assistance available in this area from the Peruvian authorities, and any British Embassy assistance is severely limited.
States of emergency
States of emergency have been declared in some parts of Peru. You can read a list of the areas with a state of emergency in El Peruano official newspaper (in Spanish). For more information on your destination, contact the iPeru information service. 
In these areas you may notice an increased security presence. You should:
comply with the instructions of local authorities
avoid crowds
monitor the situation closely
Peru-Ecuador border
The Peruvian government has taken preventive measures in northern Peru in response to the security situation in Ecuador. You may notice an increased security presence.
If you are travelling to northern Peru or plan to cross land border checkpoints, ensure you follow the advice of local authorities.
If you wish to enter Ecuador by crossing a land border from Peru, you must show the Ecuadorean authorities certain documents. See Ecuador travel advice.
Only cross the Peru-Ecuador land border at official checkpoints. Other parts of the border may still have unexploded landmines. Some tourists have been robbed by fake taxi drivers. Be extremely vigilant in these areas.
There is little assistance available in this area from the Peruvian authorities, and any British Embassy assistance is severely limited.
Inca trail 
Only basic medical services are available at Machu Picchu. Several climbers have died or suffered serious injuries after falling while climbing Huayna Picchu, a peak near Machu Picchu. 
You should:
always register when entering national parks
be particularly careful in steep and slippery areas, or those that are unfenced or unmarked
The ‘Inca Jungle Trail’ can be difficult for vehicles due to poor road conditions. There have been fatal road accidents.
Lake Titicaca
Armed robbers have attacked travellers walking on their own. You should:
always take care
contact the local tourist information centre for advice about known safe zones
travel with a group at the southern end of Lake Titicaca if walking at night
Nazca Lines
If you are planning to fly over the Nazca Lines, check the airline company is licensed and has a good safety record before you book. There have been several fatal accidents in recent years.
You can ask the iPeru information service for advice about booking flights.
