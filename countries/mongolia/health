Before you travel check that:
your destination can provide the healthcare you may need
you have appropriate travel insurance for local treatment or unexpected medical evacuation
This is particularly important if you have a health condition or are pregnant.
Emergency medical number
Call 103 and ask for an ambulance.
Contact your insurance company quickly if you’re referred to a medical facility for treatment.
Vaccine recommendations and health risks
At least 8 weeks before your trip:
check the latest vaccine recommendations for Mongolia
see where to get vaccines and whether you have to pay on the NHS travel vaccinations page
See what health risks you’ll face in Mongolia.
Altitude sickness is a risk in parts of Mongolia. Read more about altitude sickness on TravelHealthPro.
The high levels of air pollution in Ulaanbaatar, especially in winter, may aggravate bronchial, sinus or asthma conditions. Children, the elderly and those with pre-existing medical conditions may be especially affected. You can check the levels for Ulaanbaatar on the Real-time Air Quality Index.
Medication
The legal status and regulation of some medicines prescribed or bought in the UK can be different in other countries.
Read best practice when travelling with medicines on TravelHealthPro.
It is best to bring prescription medication and a first aid kit with you. Medical products in pharmacies are mainly from China and Russia, so you may not easily recognise what you need.
Healthcare in Mongolia
There are no reciprocal healthcare agreements between the UK and Mongolia, so you cannot get free healthcare in Mongolia.
If you are injured or become ill in a remote part of the country, it may be a long journey to the nearest medical facility. Outside Ulaanbaatar, the standard of healthcare is limited, and doctors may not speak English.
At hospitals, you will have to pay 80% of the treatment cost in advance. Make sure you have access to funds and that your insurance covers:
full medical expenses
an air ambulance, in case you need to be flown home
bringing a body home in the event of a death
bringing your family home, if one of you is seriously ill or injured
FCDO has a list of medical providers in Mongolia where some staff will speak English.
