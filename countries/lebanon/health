Medication
Medical supplies can occasionally be hard to find in country. Take any medicines you need with you to Lebanon. The legal status and regulation of some medicines prescribed or purchased in the UK can be different in other countries.

Healthcare in Lebanon
The availability and quality of medical treatment available in Lebanon has been affected by the economic crisis and fuel shortages, although the situation has stabilised for private healthcare/hospitals in Beirut.
Medical care in Lebanon can be expensive. Most medical providers and hospitals are insisting on significant cash deposits before admitting patients, including in emergency situations. Make sure you have adequate travel health insurance and accessible funds to cover the cost of any medical treatment abroad and repatriation.
Doctors are generally well qualified, though nursing standards vary. Most medical staff speak French and English.
FCDO has a list of medical providers in Lebanon where some staff will speak English.
