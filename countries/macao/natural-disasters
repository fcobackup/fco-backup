The typhoon season normally runs from April to October. Typhoons very occasionally hit Macao and may cause flooding and landslides. Warning is given in advance. Public offices shut down when the ‘Typhoon 8’ signal is hoisted. You should follow advice issued by the local authorities.
Monitor local and international weather updates from the World Meteorological Organisation, the China Meteorological Administration and the Japan Meteorological Agency. See our Tropical cyclones page for advice on what to do if you’re caught up in a tropical storm.
