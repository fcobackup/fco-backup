The information on this page covers the most common types of travel and reflects the UK government’s understanding of the rules currently in place. Unless otherwise stated, this information is for travellers using a full ‘British Citizen’ passport.
The authorities in the country or territory you’re travelling to are responsible for setting and enforcing the rules for entry. If you’re unclear about any aspect of the entry requirements, or you need further reassurance, you’ll need to contact the embassy, high commission or consulate of the country or territory you’re travelling to.
You should also consider checking with your transport provider or travel company to make sure your passport and other travel documents meet their requirements.
Visas
Martinique is an Overseas Department of France (département d’outre-mer). 
If your passport describes you as a British Citizen you will not need a visa to enter Martinique. Other British passport holders should check the current entry requirements on the website of the French Foreign Ministry and if necessary confirm with the nearest French diplomatic mission.
If the UK leaves the EU without a deal, the current visa policy for British Citizens visiting Martinique may change. We are working with the relevant authorities to clarify entry requirements for British nationals and this page will be updated as soon as further information is available. If you would like more details in the meantime, or want to discuss a specific issue, you should consult the French Embassy in London.
Passport validity
Your passport should be valid for the proposed duration of your stay. No additional period of validity beyond this is required.
Yellow fever certificate requirements
Check whether you need a yellow fever certificate by visiting the National Travel Health Network and Centre’s TravelHealthPro website.
UK Emergency Travel Documents
UK ETDs are accepted for entry, airside transit and exit from Martinique.
