Flights to Sri Lanka have been suspended since 19 March. If you are visiting Sri Lanka, you should make arrangements to leave while commercial means are available. Speak to your airline or tour company as soon as possible, as it is likely that flight options will become more restricted in coming days. Emirates Airlines have announced that they will suspend including flights out of Colombo by 25 March.
Your hotel or travel agency should be able to help book transport to the airport. The government has established a helpline for tourists who are facing problems booking taxis to the airport for departure:

If you are already in Sri Lanka, the government has announced that visit visas will be extended to 12 April if necessary. The government has confirmed that you can either visit the Department of Immigration and Emigration in Colombo on 8-9 April to pay the relevant fee and get this endorsed in your passport; or complete the process at the airport on departure. Be aware that there could be long queues for this service at the airport.
