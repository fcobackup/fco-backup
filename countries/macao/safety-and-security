Crime

passports, credit cards and money in crowded areas
your belongings when checking out of hotels
your wallet and other valuables when visiting casinos late at night
Laws and cultural differences
Safeguarding National Security Law  
You could face criminal charges if you take part in activities that the authorities believe threaten national security. This includes activities in and outside the Macao SAR, including in the UK. The Safeguarding National Security Law (NSL) outlines the types of activities that are illegal, such as preparing for or carrying out treason, secession or subversion against the central government.
The police have the right to access an individual’s social media and private communications to gather evidence of NSL crimes.   
Illegal drugs and prison sentences
Do not become involved with drugs. Possession of drugs can lead to imprisonment.
Taking photos in secure areas
Do not take photos of military installations.
Transport risks
Road travel
If you are planning to drive in Macao, see information on driving abroad.
You can drive in Macao with a Hong Kong, Chinese or Portuguese driving licence.
If you are using a UK driving licence, you need a 1949 international driving permit (IDP) as well. You cannot buy an IDP outside the UK, so get one before you travel.
You will also need to register to drive in Macao for more than 14 days.
Car hire
Some car hire companies have additional requirements, such as at least a year of driving experience and a minimum age of 21.
Unlicensed taxis
Uber is illegal in Macao. The Macao police will take action against drivers and passengers of unlicensed taxi services, including Uber.

Be aware of local warning signals issued in advance and follow advice issued by the local authorities.
