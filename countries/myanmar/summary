The Foreign, Commonwealth & Development Office (FCDO) advises against all but essential travel to Myanmar, based on recent political events and the current assessment of the COVID-19 risk.
Entry to Myanmar is subject to entry restrictions
The FCDO advise against all but essential travel to Myanmar. If you are considering travelling to Myanmar, or planning to re-enter Myanmar, you should note the following entry restrictions for Myanmar:
Residents of the United Kingdom, or those who have visited the United Kingdom within the previous 14 days, are currently unable to enter Myanmar.
Arrivals must comply with Myanmar’s COVID-19 quarantine requirements.
See Entry requirements for more information before you plan to travel, and find out what you need to know about coronavirus there in the Coronavirus section.
Returning to the UK
Myanmar is on the amber list for entering England. Check what you must do to enter England, Scotland, Wales or Northern Ireland.
As of 1 February 2021, the Myanmar military declared a state of emergency and assumed control. Following the coup, the security situation in the country has worsened and since 29 April we advised UK citizens to leave Myanmar. The security situation in Myanmar is unpredictable. Protests and acts of violence, including the use of explosive devices, can occur anywhere and a further deterioration in the security situation remains possible. If you are in Myanmar you should read our Security section.
If you decide your presence in Myanmar is essential, you should maintain a low profile and keep up to date with developments, sign up to receive email alerts when this travel advice is updated. Always avoid any protests or gatherings and follow the instructions of the local authorities. Some areas in Myanmar are under a state of martial law, whilst others have curfews and ‘Stay at Home’ orders in place. You should ensure you are aware of local rules and restrictions.
The FCDO will continue to provide consular support 24/7 through our global network, but this may be limited for some areas of Myanmar. If the situation in Myanmar deteriorates further, the ability of the British Embassy to provide assistance to British nationals will become increasingly limited and Consular support is severely limited in parts of Myanmar.
There is a risk that you could be arbitrarily detained or arrested. The criminal justice process followed in such cases falls below international standards. Myanmar does not recognise dual nationality.
If you’re in Myanmar and you need urgent help (for example, you’ve been attacked, arrested or someone has died), call +95 (01) 370863. If you’re in the UK and worried about a British national in Myanmar, call 020 7008 1500.
There may be disruptions to local phone networks. If you are unable to get through to the Embassy on any of these numbers, call +44 020 7008 1500. Please note that this is an international number and you may be charged a different rate.
The banking sector is seeing widespread disruption with many banks closed and ATMs empty. Electronic payments continue to function within the country but you should ensure you will be able to make payments in advance. See Money
Terrorists are likely to try to carry out attacks in Myanmar. You should remain vigilant and follow the advice of local authorities. See Terrorism
UK health authorities have classified Myanmar as having a risk of Zika virus transmission. For information and advice about the risks associated with Zika virus, visit the National Travel Health Network and Centre website.
Urban areas, particularly Yangon and Mandalay, can experience poor air quality. See Health.
If you’re abroad and you need emergency help from the UK government, contact the nearest British embassy, consulate or high commission. You should not assume that the FCDO will be able to provide assistance to leave the country in the event of serious unrest or crisis. If you’re arrested or detained, ask police or prison officials to notify the British Embassy immediately.
