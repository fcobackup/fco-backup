There are currently no commercial options available to return to the UK from Yemen. All borders are closed and air travel suspended.
What to do
The British government can’t provide consular support or any form of assisted departure to British nationals in Yemen.
If you need urgent consular assistance, call the FCO in London on +44 (0)20 7008 1500.
The FCO can’t offer advice on the safety of travelling to any potential departure point. You should therefore consider carefully whether you want to pursue any options that become available. You should use your own judgement to move towards a departure point only if and when you judge it is safe to do so.
The British government’s ability to facilitate onward travel from countries in the region is limited and you’ll be expected to cover the cost of visas, accommodation, insurance and onward travel yourself. Any travel options you pursue are taken at your own risk.
If you cannot leave Yemen at this time, you should:
follow the advice of local authorities, including local measures to help minimise your risk of exposure to coronavirus (COVID-19)
find accommodation that’s suitable for your needs
keep in regular contact with family and friends at home, so they know you are safe and well

The National Travel Health Network and Centre (NaTHNaC) also provides advice on how to stay safe as you travel by air.
When you arrive back in the UK, follow the guidance for when you return to the UK on steps you should take to protect yourself and others.
