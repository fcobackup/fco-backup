There is a general threat from terrorism. There may be increased security in place over the festive period, including at Christmas markets and other major events that might attract large crowds. You should remain vigilant and follow the advice of the local authorities.
Around 9,000 British nationals visit Bosnia and Herzegovina every year. Most visits are trouble-free.

If you are travelling by road, check local information before setting off.
For information on weather conditions, see meteoalarm pages for Bosnia and Herzegovina.
