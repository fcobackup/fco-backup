A nationwide curfew is in effect from 11pm to 4am each night. Gatherings of up to 100 individuals are now allowed. This applies to weddings, funerals, conferences, community gatherings, cafes and restaurants. Domestic travel is returning to normal following the end of the suspension of travel to Fiji’s outer islands. Fiji’s authorities are encouraging social distancing, good hand hygiene and are urging those who have cold/flu symptoms to stay at home. Fiji government is also encouraging residents to download the careFiji contact tracing app. In some instances, such as at the airport, you will need to show you have this on your phone. Full details on the government’s response can be found on the Ministry of Health and Medical services website
If you’re looking to leave Fiji and are visiting the outer islands, you’re advised to return to the main island of Viti Levu immediately. Further cases of COVID-19 in Fiji could see the reintroduction of restrictions on internal travel and/or a lockdown of affected areas. More information on the latest restrictions are available on the Fiji government website.
