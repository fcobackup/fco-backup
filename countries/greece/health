Healthcare in Greece  
Treatment and facilities are generally good on the mainland, but may be limited on the islands. The standards of nursing and aftercare, particularly in the state sector, is not to the usual standard of the UK. The public ambulance service is basic. There are serious shortages of ambulances on some islands.
If you are uninsured, you may not be able to get medical treatment or diagnostic tests from private doctors in Greece, only from public hospitals and primary healthcare centres.
FCDO has a list of medical providers in Greece where some staff will speak English. On some Greek islands, local staff in bars or airports my direct you to private first aid or medical centres rather than to the public hospital.
There is also information if you’re hospitalised in Greece.
Health insurance cards
To get medically necessary state healthcare in Greece, you need a Global Health Insurance Card (GHIC) or a European Health Insurance Card (EHIC).
