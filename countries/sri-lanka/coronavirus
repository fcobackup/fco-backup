You can spread the virus even if you donâ€™t have symptoms.

Cases of coronavirus (COVID-19) have been confirmed in Sri Lanka. The Sri Lankan Government is taking measures to prevent the spread of the virus. You should comply with screening measures put in place by the authorities.
Flights to Sri Lanka have been suspended since 19 March. If you are visiting Sri Lanka, you are strongly advised to leave now, while commercial means are available. See Return to the UK
A nationwide curfew is in place. There have been reports of food distribution problems in some areas. In addition, the authorities have quarantined a number of towns where they judge the immediate risk to be highest. Curfews are subject to last-minute changes. Checkpoints have been introduced in a number of places, and those not adhering to the restrictions risk arrest. Speak to your hotel or travel agent for the latest information, and follow the instructions of the security forces at all times.
If you are already in Sri Lanka, the government has announced that visit visas will be extended to 12 May. The government has confirmed that you can pay the relevant fee and complete the process at the airport on departure.
No new visas will be issued to British nationals currently outside Sri Lanka, and any British nationals arriving in Sri Lanka are now subject to mandatory 14-day quarantine period in military-run quarantine camps.
A small number of tourists have reported problems with hotels trying to cancel bookings made by foreign visitors, and some incidents of harassment. Speak to your travel agent about any accommodation booking problems, and report any incidents of harassment to the police first and then to the British High Commission.
The government has announced that people who arrived in Sri Lanka after 1 March should register with the police by telephone via the emergency 119 service or by calling the local station. Speak to your hotel or tour company for assistance.
The government has said that cruise ship passengers will not be allowed to disembark in the country, including for temporary shore visits. You should speak to your tour operator for further information on the impact on any existing travel plans.
If you decide to remain in Sri Lanka because you have family, business or employment reasons to do so, a serious outbreak of coronavirus will place significant strain on the healthcare system, and may impact on the availability of consular services. Private hospitals are not currently permitted to offer treatment for coronavirus. You should ensure that you have sufficient accommodation, funds and immigration clearance for your stay. Flights out of Sri Lanka may also be seriously affected, and availability cannot be guaranteed should you decide to leave at a later date.
Further information on coronavirus, including advice on preparing for foreign travel and helping reduce the spread of the virus, is available from Public Health England and on the TravelHealthPro website.
