Be prepared for your plans to change
No travel is risk-free during COVID. Countries may further restrict travel or bring in new rules at short notice, for example due to a new COVID-19 variant. Check with your travel company or airline for any transport changes which may delay your journey home.
If you test positive for COVID-19, you may need to stay where you are until you test negative. You may also need to seek treatment there.
Plan ahead and make sure you:
can access money
understand what your insurance will cover
can make arrangements to extend your stay and be away for longer than planned
Public spaces and services
Macao has introduced a QR three-colour code system, which replaces the previous digital health declaration needed at border checkpoints and when entering public administration premises, casinos and other venues. The new code requires its users to confirm whether they have been in COVID-19 quarantine at home or in a government-run facility and consists of three colours: red, yellow, green. Visitors receiving red or yellow codes may be subject to testing, hospitalisation or restrictions on their movements.
The Macao SAR Government may impose COVID-19 restrictions at short notice. This may include regular COVID-19 testing for certain groups of workers. You should check the latest information on the Macao Information Bureau website.
Bus services between Hong Kong and Macao, using the Hong Kong-Zhuhai-Macao Bridge, recommenced a limited service on 8 May. Contact the service provider for the latest schedule.
