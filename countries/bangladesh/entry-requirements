The information on this page covers the most common types of travel and reflects the UK government’s understanding of the rules currently in place. Unless otherwise stated, this information is for travellers using a full ‘British Citizen’ passport.
The authorities in the country or territory you’re travelling to are responsible for setting and enforcing the rules for entry. If you’re unclear about any aspect of the entry requirements, or you need further reassurance, you’ll need to contact the embassy, high commission or consulate of the country or territory you’re travelling to.
You should also consider checking with your transport provider or travel company to make sure your passport and other travel documents meet their requirements.

Visas
You’ll need a visa to enter Bangladesh. You can get a visa from the Bangladesh High Commission in London. Bangladesh authorities have suspended issuing visas on arrival from 16 March to 7 May. Foreign nationals currently in Bangladesh with valid visas have the option of extending their visas by three months. Visa extensions are available at the Department of Immigration and Passport of Bangladesh. You should be aware that overstaying your visa could risk the imposition of penalty fines.
If you intend to use Dhaka as a hub to visit other countries in the region, make sure you get a multiple entry visa. If you’re intending to work in Bangladesh make sure you get the correct visa before you travel.
If you have had your passport renewed in Bangladesh, you’ll need a new visa. The Bangladesh Immigration & Passport Department (telephone: 880 2 8159878 / 8123788 / 8123323) is able to issue an ‘exit visa’ or a ‘no visa required’ stamp. Officers there are unlikely to speak English, so you may need an interpreter.
Make sure you have an entry stamp placed in your passport on entry into Bangladesh otherwise you may have problems on departure.
Passport validity
Your passport should be valid for at least 6 months when applying for a visa to visit Bangladesh.
UK Emergency Travel Documents
UK Emergency Travel Documents (ETDs) are accepted for entry, airside transit and exit from Bangladesh. Holders of an ETD must apply for the appropriate Bangladesh visa to enter Bangladesh.
