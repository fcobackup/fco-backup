Coronavirus guidance is being updated.
Read what you can and cannot do

All scheduled flights, train and bus services to and from Ukraine are suspended until 22 May, with many border crossings closed. Although airlines are selling tickets for commercial flights after this date, there is no guarantee that the Ukrainian government will lift the international travel suspension on 22 May.
Special flights
There are extremely limited commercial options available to return to the UK from Ukraine. There will be a SkyUp Airlines flight from Kyiv to London on Thursday 14 May. For more information or to book, please check the SkyUp Airlines website.
SkyUp and Ukrainian Airlines have also run a series of non-scheduled special flights from Kyiv to a number of European destinations. If you manage to book a flight to leave Ukraine via a third country, you will need evidence of onward travel, for example, a flight ticket to your next destination.
Measures imposed by some third countries to combat coronavirus include restricting entry of foreign nationals and suspending flight operations in those countries. Please check FCO Travel Advice for other countries on your route and with any airlines for flights you may wish to take. You should consult Customer Service’s interactive map for information on the status of checkpoints at Ukraine’s borders.
We know that this situation is concerning for British people trying to leave Ukraine. The UK government is working closely with airlines and other governments to make sure options are available for you to return to the UK as soon as possible.
Future travel options
You will need to pay for your return travel to the UK. If departure options are available but you cannot afford the travel costs and have exhausted all other options for getting funds, you may be eligible to apply for an emergency loan from the government. This is a last resort option and you would need to repay the loan when you are back in the UK.
For more information, you should contact Corporate Travel Management (CTM). CTM are a commercial partner of the FCO and are authorised to administer such loans on behalf of the FCO.
