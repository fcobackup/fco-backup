Myanmar has put measures in place to limit the spread of coronavirus (COVID-19).

If you are in Myanmar and able to leave, you should do so. This is due to potential pressures on medical facilities and the risk of air routes out of Myanmar being cancelled.
Entry and borders
Myanmar has suspended all visas for foreign nationals except diplomats accredited to Myanmar, UN officials and air and sea crew operating to and from Myanmar.
Local measures
The Myanmar Government has imposed restrictions on large public events (including festivals) and cinemas until the 15 May. It will then be reviewed. Some tourist resorts have been ordered to close. Restaurants in Yangon have been instructed to close except for delivery service.
Additional movement restrictions have been introduced in 10 Yangon townships: South Okkalapa, Pabedan, Bahan, Mayangone, Insein, Shwe Pyithar, Hlaing Tharyar, Mingaladon, Tamwe, and Botahtaung. All residents must stay at home but can leave the house for work. When outside the home residents must wear a mask at all times and carry ID.
It is recommended that foreigners carry their passport, Form C (immigration document), Foreigner’s Registration Certificate, Myanmar Driver’s Licence (if you own a car), a copy of 1) your passport information page, 2) your Myanmar visa, and 3) your immigration stamp showing when you last entered Myanmar.
Cars are only allowed in these townships if these belong to residents. Only two people are allowed in a car. A curfew of 10pm-4am is still in place across all Yangon townships between 23 April and the 23 June. It will then be reviewed.
The police will be enforcing these restrictions. You risk arrest if you do not comply.
We have heard reports that some local authorities are carrying out checks to make sure all foreign tourists are staying in registered hotels and guest houses, not in private apartments. If you are on a tourist visa and are not currently staying in a registered hotel or guest house, you should move into one now. This is a requirement under Myanmar law and is a condition of your visa.
In some areas there may be local requirements for visitors from other parts of the country to quarantine or self-isolate for 28 days on arrival.
Healthcare
If you are currently in Myanmar and are displaying symptoms of coronavirus, you should consult your healthcare provider. You may then be asked to notify the Myanmar National Hotline for Coronavirus (+95 67 3420268) and be transferred to a public health facility for testing.
If you test positive for the virus, you are highly likely to be transferred to a Government quarantine hospital until you have recovered. Patients are obliged to use a government facility even if they have private insurance. Patients in government hospitals are expected to make their own arrangements for bringing in food and other essential supplies. Lone travellers will not be allowed out of isolation to purchase food or make phone calls.
The coronavirus pandemic is expected to put significant pressure on Myanmar’s medical facilities. They may not be able to offer routine care.
It may be difficult for you to travel to a neighbouring country for medical attention. You should check your personal arrangements with your healthcare provider.
