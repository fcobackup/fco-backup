The information on this page covers the most common types of travel and reflects the UK government’s understanding of the rules currently in place. Unless otherwise stated, this information is for travellers using a full ‘British Citizen’ passport.
The authorities in the country or territory you’re travelling to are responsible for setting and enforcing the rules for entry. If you’re unclear about any aspect of the entry requirements, or you need further reassurance, you’ll need to contact the embassy, high commission or consulate of the country or territory you’re travelling to.
You should also consider checking with your transport provider or travel company to make sure your passport and other travel documents meet their requirements.
Visas
On 21 March, Vietnam temporarily banned entry into Vietnam for all foreigners and advised that all foreigners who have entered Vietnam in the last 14 days self-isolate for a total period of 14 days. There are a very small number of exceptions for diplomats on official business and certain high-skilled workers. However, the systems for managing this are not clear and we are not yet able to provide further clarity.
For those in quarantine, Vietnamese quarantine centres are safe but basic, and most do not meet Public Health England standards. With the increased number of people in quarantine, it is likely that the standards of quarantine facilities will reduce further.
The ban on foreigners entering Vietnam means there are very few remaining international flights out of Vietnam. These are reducing rapidly. Should you intend to leave Vietnam, you should do so without delay by commercial means.
Foreign nationals arriving in Vietnam will be required to fill in a health questionnaire and undertake basic health tests on arrival. False declarations regarding health history could lead to prosecution.
It is unclear whether work permits for foreign nationals in Vietnam will be extended and the mechanism or timeline for doing this. British nationals nearing the end of their current stay in Vietnam should not take it for granted that existing visas or work permits will be extended and should contact Vietnamese authorities to ensure that they remain in compliance with Vietnamese laws and regulations. Decisions on granting extensions of stay are a matter for the Vietnamese authorities. Overstaying your Vietnamese visa without authority is a serious matter and you may be delayed from travel until a fine is paid. Check the visa validity and conditions carefully.
For further information about visa requirements, check with the Vietnamese Embassy in London.
Land borders
There are a number of local crossing points on the borders with Cambodia and Laos which are for nationals of Cambodia, Laos and Vietnam only and so don’t allow British nationals to cross. Check locally before travelling to these points.
Passport validity
Your passport should be valid for a minimum of 6 months on the date you enter Vietnam for you to be eligible for the 15 day visa exemption.
For periods of stay longer than 15 days, entry into Vietnam may be refused if your passport has less than 1 month validity from the date your Vietnamese visa expires.
A number of British nationals have been refused entry and exit due to their passport being damaged. Make sure your passport is in good condition before arriving in Vietnam. Being refused entry can result in significant cost and a long stay at the airport.
Registration
When checking into a hotel, you’ll have to hand over your passport so that the hotel can register your presence with the local police. Make sure your passport is returned and keep it in a safe place. Don’t use your passport as a deposit for renting a hotel room. If you are staying in private accommodation, you will still be expected to register. Ask your host to help you with this as soon as you arrive. You may be fined if you don’t register.
Yellow fever certificate requirements
Check whether you need a yellow fever certificate by visiting the National Travel Health Network and Centre’s TravelHealthPro website.
UK Emergency Travel Documents
UK Emergency Travel Documents are accepted for entry, airside transit and exit from Vietnam. Please contact the nearest Vietnamese Embassy to obtain an appropriate visa before travel. If your ETD has been issued in Vietnam, to replace a lost/stolen passport, you will need an exit visa from the Vietnam Immigration Department before you can travel out of Vietnam. This process normally takes 5 working days. Contact the Immigration Department directly for further information.
