This page reflects the UK government’s understanding of current rules for people travelling on a full ‘British Citizen’ passport, for the most common types of travel.
The authorities in St Lucia set and enforce entry rules. For further information contact the embassy, high commission or consulate of the country or territory you’re travelling to. You should also consider checking with your transport provider or travel company to make sure your passport and other travel documents meet their requirements.
Entry rules in response to coronavirus (COVID-19)
From 3 December 2021 there are new rules for unvaccinated travellers (both resident and non-resident) arriving in St Lucia, that restrict accommodation and movement for the first 14 days.
Cruise ship passengers should read entry protocols for anyone arriving on a cruise ship.
Testing and Quarantine requirements on arrival
All travellers must complete a Pre-Arrival registration form on the St Lucia COVID-19 page prior to arrival and receive the Travel Authorisation from the St Lucia Tourism Authority (or airlines will not allow boarding). Reservations for either a government operated quarantine facility or a COVID-19 certified property must be confirmed before travel.
Pre-testing prior to travel is now mandatory. All travellers aged 5 years and over must provide certified proof of a negative PCR (Polymerase Chain Reaction) COVID-19 test taken five days or less before travel to St Lucia. Passengers will be refused boarding if they do not have proof of a negative test. You will need to check with an accredited healthcare provider in the UK or your country you are travelling from for PCR testing options. You should not use the NHS testing service to get a test in order to facilitate your travel to another country. You should arrange to take a private test.
All arriving passengers will be screened, including temperature checks, at the airport. All passengers will advance through immigration, baggage claim, customs and, except those from the Travel Bubble, arrivals for transportation to their COVID-19 certified property or government operated quarantine facility.
Quarantine requirements
The St Lucia Tourism Authority website has the protocols for unvaccinated residents and unvaccinated non-residents that apply for the first 14 days. Unvaccinated residents must go into state quarantine and send a confirmed booking in advance, or get exemption for home quarantine in advance of travel. Unvaccinated non-residents must stay in COVID-certified accommodation. The website has details of certified activities for this period.
Any symptomatic passengers will be isolated and tested and required to remain in quarantine/isolation at your hotel or Government operated quarantine facility until the test result is obtained. If the test is positive all visitors and nationals will be transferred to a treatment facility until they receive two negative test results and are clinically stable.
Lifting of Quarantine for Fully Vaccinated Persons
Persons who have been fully vaccinated will not be required to go into quarantine on arrival. Persons must have received their second dose 14 days prior to arrival on island. All other protocols must be adhered to such as mask wearing and social distancing. Complete list of protocols are on https://www.stlucia.org/en_UK/.
If you are travelling with children aged 5-17 years and you would like them to also be exempt from quarantine they will need to be retested on arrival at your cost, and they must remain in quarantine until the results of the test are known. Once the test is negative they will not be required to quarantine.
Demonstrating your COVID-19 status
St Lucia will accept the UK’s proof of COVID-19 recovery and vaccination record. Your NHS appointment card from vaccination centres is not designed to be used as proof of vaccination and should not be used to demonstrate your vaccine status.
