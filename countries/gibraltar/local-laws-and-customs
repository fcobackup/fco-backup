There is a low tolerance of any alcohol or drug-related crime (e.g. being drunk in a public place).
Attitudes towards LGBT people are generally tolerant in Gibraltar. Same-sex marriage has been legal in Gibraltar since December 2016. There is an active gay community, but given the small size of Gibraltar there are few places which are exclusively LGBT orientated. See our information and advice page for the LGBT community before you travel.
