As of Tuesday morning, 17 March, flights between Mauritania and all other countries were suspended. All land border crossings are now closed. There is no Consular support available from the British Embassy in Nouakchott.
If you’re a UK tourist still in Mauritania, you should contact Consular Services at the British Embassy in Rabat, Morocco, here (telephone number: +212 (0) 537 63 33 33). If you are resident in Mauritania, our current advice is that you should remain at home. For regular updates, please follow us on Facebook.
