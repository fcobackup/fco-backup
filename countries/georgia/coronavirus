Entry and borders
From midnight 18 March, until further notice, foreign citizens will not be allowed to enter the country. The ban will also apply to foreigners with Georgian residence permits. Anyone arriving in Georgia from 20 March will face compulsory 14-day quarantine. You should carry additional supplies of necessary medication in carry-on luggage.
The Georgian authorities recognise that some non-Georgian residents may be unable to renew their entry permits in due time due to border closures.

The British Embassy in Tbilisi will publish the revised rules on Facebook and Twitter, once confirmed by the Georgian Government
