This page gives you guidance on how to stay safely in Spain as a visitor, if you are unable to return to the UK.
Everyone should comply with the measures put in place in Spain to limit the spread of coronavirus (COVID-19).
Moving around in Spain
For information on entering Spain, see Entry Requirements
The State of Emergency (“Estado de Alarma”) declared on March 14 in response to the coronavirus outbreak, ended on June 21 and Spain has now entered the ‘new normal’ phase of its de-escalation strategy.
Restrictions on movement throughout the country have been lifted and travel between regions is permitted.
Social distancing measures and other safety precautions should continue to be observed at all times. See ‘Use of face masks’ and ‘Local measures and the ‘new normal’ phase’.
Local measures and the ‘new normal’ phase
On June 21, Spain entered the ‘new normal’ phase, which concludes the progressive 4-phase de-escalation plan and sees the return of cross-regional mobility. Protective protocols and safety measures remain in place and you should observe the guidelines set out by the Spanish Government at all times. You should also refer to regional authorities for any additional local measures where you are as this may vary from one region to the next.
Key ‘new normal’ measures include:
social distancing of 1.5-metres
obligatory use of face masks in public spaces (see ‘Use of facemasks’).
track and trace – all shops, businesses and transport companies are obliged to keep passengers’ contact information (where provided) for up to 4 weeks for tracking and tracing purposes.
Use of face masks
The use of face masks is obligatory to anyone over the age of 6 years old in all public spaces in Spain, where it is not possible to maintain social distancing of 1.5 metres. Face masks must cover the nose and mouth. Penalties may be imposed if you do not comply.
Those with respiratory problems or those unable to wear a mask due to other health conditions or disabilities are exempt from this rule. For details, please see here.
While not mandatory, the use of face masks on children between three and five years of age is recommended.

If you cannot travel back to the UK due to ill health or reduced mobility, you may wish to consider looking for longer-term accommodation in Spain until the State of Emergency is lifted. If you need medical treatment, the UK EHIC is still valid for the rest of 2020.

Finance
There is a range of financial support from the government that you can access while you are unable to return due to coronavirus restrictions.
If you’re in Spain, and have exhausted all other options to cover essential living costs while you wait to return home, you could apply for an emergency loan for your living costs from the UK government. You can only apply if you normally live in the UK and you cannot return home. This last-resort option is for those most in need, and you would need to repay the loan when you are back in the UK. Apply for an emergency loan.
