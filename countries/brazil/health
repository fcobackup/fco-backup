If you’re taking medication, take a good supply with you, as they may not be available locally. Bring a prescription or letter from your doctor confirming your requirement to carry the medication. Counterfeit drugs can also be an issue, so it’s always better to travel with your own supplies. Rules for carrying personal medication vary and can change, so check with the Brazilian Consulate before you travel.
If you need emergency medical assistance during your trip, dial 192 and ask for an ambulance. You should contact your insurance/medical assistance company promptly if you are referred to a medical facility for treatment.
