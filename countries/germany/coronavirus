Entry and borders
Germany has intensified border controls at airports and land borders. Unless travellers are resident in Germany, can demonstrate a compelling reason for their travel to Germany, or are border workers commuting between Germany and neighbouring countries, they will be refused entry. Frontier workers and goods traffic are not currently affected.
If you intend to fly to Germany, check with your airline before you travel and ensure you bring any supporting documents you need to justify your travel. If you are transiting through an airport in Germany in order to travel to the UK, you will need to have onward travel, and, if necessary, temporary accommodation booked before you will be permitted to enter Germany.
If you’re living in Germany, you can return as long as your habitual place of residence is Germany and you can provide proof of this. Proof of residence might include:
Certificate of registration of address (also available online)
Payslip (with German address)
Free movement certificate (not issued any longer)
Other official documents evidencing residence in Germany
You should bear in mind that the situation is changing quickly and that border police in some regions may take a more strict approach.
Local measures
There are nationwide rules in place restricting movement and limiting activity:
gatherings of more than two people are prohibited, excluding families and members of the same household
all contact with other individuals should be kept to a minimum, and a distance of 1.5m should be maintained at all times.
commuting, exercising outdoors or offering assistance to others are permitted. Meetings deemed absolutely necessary for business and official purposes are also allowed
restaurants may only offer takeaway or delivery services
body care services, such as hairdressers, nail and tattoo salons remain closed, though treatments deemed medically necessary such as therapeutic massages and rehab centres remain permissible.
workplaces must have specific hygiene rules for staff and visitors
visits to hospitals and care homes may also be restricted.
Regulations are being enforced by the police and regulatory authorities. The German government has announced that these restrictions will remain in place until at least 3 May, although states are gradually relaxing these.
There are plans to require the wearing of face masks in certain public areas in all of Germany’s 16 states. The rules vary from state to state - check the latest local guidance.
Further restrictions vary by region, so you should follow the latest local guidance, much of which is available in English.
