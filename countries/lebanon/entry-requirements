This page reflects the UK government’s understanding of current rules for people travelling on a full ‘British Citizen’ passport, for the most common types of travel.
The authorities in Lebanon set and enforce entry rules. For further information contact the embassy, high commission or consulate of the country or territory you’re travelling to. You should also consider checking with your transport provider or travel company to make sure your passport and other travel documents meet their requirements.
Entry rules in response to coronavirus (COVID-19)
Entry to Lebanon
Beirut’s Rafik Hariri international airport is open and there are direct and indirect commercial flights operating daily. There are currently restrictions on passenger capacity as part of COVID-19 mitigation measures.
From 15 December 2021, all passengers arriving in Lebanon must register on the Ministry of Public Health (MOPH) platform to obtain a MOPH pass.
You should ensure you make all necessary preparations prior to travelling to Lebanon. These measures change frequently so you should check details regularly.
Any passenger who shows symptoms of illness including COVID-19 will not be allowed to board the aircraft.
Demonstrating your COVID-19 status
The Lebanese Directorate General of Civil Aviation have said that they will accept any official document that confirms vaccination status. You should check with your airline what proof is required.
Lebanon will accept the UK’s proof of COVID-19 recovery and vaccination record. Your NHS appointment card from vaccination centres is not designed to be used as proof of vaccination and should not be used to demonstrate your vaccine status.
Self-isolation requirements and tests after arrival
From 15 December 2021, all passengers travelling to Lebanon, apart from children under the 12 years old, must have a negative PCR result issued within 48 hours prior to arrival in Lebanon. You should upload the PCR result to the MOPH platform, which will generate a unique QR code that will be sent via text message. The QR code will be checked upon arrival at Beirut airport.
All passengers (apart from children under the age of 12 and members of UNIFIL) will be required to take a PCR test at Beirut International Airport on arrival, which is provided at the airline’s expense. From 15 December 2021, passengers should remain in self-isolation until they receive their test result. This should arrive within 24 hours via text message. If the result is negative, you will be released from self-isolation. If the result is positive, you must immediately call the COVID-19 hotline on 1787 unless contacted by the MoPH.
From 10 January 2022, the payment method for the PCR test on arrival will change. All passengers (apart from children under the age of 12 and members of UNIFIL) must pay $30 in advance via the MOPH platform to take this test. This payment will allow you to obtain the MOPH pass required for arrival into Lebanon.
Passengers who can prove:
that they have received both doses of the COVID-19 vaccine (or one complete dose, if the vaccine is made up of only one dose) at least 2 weeks before departure to Lebanon, or
that they have had and recovered from COVID-19 within 90 days prior to travel, or
that they have travelled out of Lebanon and returned within one week
are exempt from taking a pre-departure PCR test, provided that they upload certificates or official documentation as proof in order to obtain a MOPH pass.
You should not use the NHS testing service to get a test in order to facilitate your travel to another country. You should arrange to take a private test.
The Lebanese government is keeping these measures under review and they may change at short notice. You must comply with any amended regulations for testing and self-isolation. You should check with your airline and the Embassy of Lebanon in the country you are travelling from before travel.
Transit passengers
There are no testing or additional COVID-19 related procedures required for transiting travellers. Passengers with a short transit time will be allowed to proceed directly to their gate, those with a longer transit time will have to wait at a designated gate where a cafeteria is available.
Regular entry requirements
Visas
British citizens can normally apply for a free single entry tourist or family visit visa on arrival. British Overseas Citizens and British Protected Persons will need to get a visa before travelling to Lebanon. Persons of Palestinian origin may also require a visa before travelling, or may be required to carry additional documentation with them when travelling. Entry requirements are subject to change, so you should check with the Lebanese Embassy before you travel.
Overstaying without the proper authority is a serious matter. You may be refused permission to leave until a fine has been paid.
Passport validity
Your passport should be valid for a minimum period of 3 months from the date of entry into Lebanon.
UK Emergency Travel Documents
UK Emergency Travel Documents (ETDs) are accepted for entry, transit and exit from Lebanon. You can find more information on how to get an ETD on gov.uk.
If your passport is lost or stolen during your stay in Lebanon and you require an ETD to leave, you will need to visit the Public Prosecution in Adlieh building (central Beirut) to report the loss or theft. Once the police report is finalized, you will need to obtain an Exit visa prior to your departure in order to leave the country, either from the General Security’s Department of Passport and Immigration or from the General Security Office at the airport. You will need to show the police report and the ETD. You should factor the time this will take into any new travel plans.
Previous travel to Israel
If your passport contains an Israeli stamp you may be refused entry to Lebanon even if you hold a valid Lebanese visa.
Stop matches
Lebanese Immigration Authorities check all visitors’ names on arrival against a database of those wanted for, or convicted of, offences in Lebanon. If a name matches against an entry on the database the individual may be detained (or on occasion allowed entry upon surrender of their passport) until they can prove that the record does not relate to them. It’s often possible to do so by producing a copy of a birth certificate or other official documentation that allows parents’ names to be checked against the database. You should consider carrying this kind of supporting documentation.
