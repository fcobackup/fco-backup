Terrorism
There is a high threat of terrorist attack globally affecting UK interests and British nationals, including from groups and individuals who view the UK and British nationals as targets. You should remain vigilant at all times.
UK Counter Terrorism Policing has information and advice on staying safe abroad and what to do in the event of a terrorist attack. Find out how to reduce your risk from terrorism while abroad.
Terrorism in Slovenia
Although there’s no recent history of terrorism in Slovenia, attacks cannot be ruled out.
Laws and cultural differences
Personal ID
Carry a copy of your passport at all times as a form of identification.
Public offences
There are heavy on-the-spot fines for jaywalking. You should only cross the road at designated crossing points. If you cannot pay an on-the-spot fine the police or authorities can confiscate documents or assets until the fine is paid.
LGBT+ travellers
Read advice for LGBT+ travellers.
Tour guides
All tour guides are required to display a tour guide card to show they have met the conditions to operate as a guide in Slovenia.
Outdoor activities and adventure tourism
Skiing and mountaineering
If you are planning a skiing or mountaineering holiday, check online for advice on weather, safety conditions and risks before travelling. Off-piste skiing is highly dangerous as there is a risk of avalanches in some areas.
Hiking
If you plan to hike in Slovenia, consider the level of difficulty and distance, and plan for the weakest member of your group. Some demanding mountain trails can include sections of Via Ferrata (steel wires and metal rungs) which need a climbing harness and helmet. Use a printed or digital map with marked paths and their descriptions. Inform family and friends of your plans. Check whether mountain cabins are open. Do not use hiking trails that have been closed or take shortcuts. If you need mountain rescue assistance, call 112.
Transport risks
Road travel
You can drive in Slovenia on your UK driving licence for up to 90 days. For any longer, you need a 1968 international driving permit (IDP). You cannot buy an IDP outside the UK, so get one before you travel. You can buy an IDP in person from some UK post offices – find your nearest post office branch that offers this service.
If you live in Slovenia, check the driving requirements for residents.
If you are planning to drive in Slovenia, see information on driving in the EU and read the rules of the road in RAC’s Slovenia guide.
By law, you must have your headlights on at all times when driving in Slovenia. You also need to carry a reflective jacket, a warning triangle and a first aid kit in the vehicle.
The police can impose on-the-spot fines for offences including speeding, driving under the influence of alcohol and for using mobile phones without wireless headsets.
If you plan to drive your own car, you need a UK sticker. Since 2021, UK stickers have replaced GB stickers. Check which UK sticker to display.
For the latest traffic conditions, go to the PIC Traffic Information Centre website. Travel updates and information on border crossings and international rail journeys can be found at the Slovenian Traffic Information Centre.
Tolls
If you drive on Slovenian motorways, you must buy an ‘e-vignette’. E-vignettes are available weekly, monthly or yearly. You can buy them at petrol stations, post offices and DARs (the Slovenian Motorway Company) offices in Slovenia as well as outlets in neighbouring countries near the Slovenian border. You can also buy e-vignettes online at the DARs website including in advance of arrival in Slovenia. If you are getting an e-vignette online, use the official DARs website.
Drivers of vehicles over 3.5 tonnes can use Slovenia’s electronic tolling system on motorways and expressways. You’ll need to register your vehicle under the DarsGo system and collect the DarsGo unit from a DarsGo service point when you enter Slovenia for the first time.
Driving in winter
Winter equipment is mandatory from 15 November until 15 March and whenever there are winter weather conditions (eg at times of snowfall, blizzards or black ice).
Private cars and vehicles up to 3.5 tonnes must be equipped with winter tyres on all 4 wheels, or summer tyres on all 4 wheels plus snow chains in the car boot. The minimum tyre tread depth is 3mm. Vehicles over 3.5 tonnes must have winter tyres on the driving wheels or summer tyres on all 4 wheels plus snow chains in the boot.
You can be fined 125 euros for not having this equipment, or 417 euros if you also cause a delay on the road.
Extreme weather and natural disasters
You can monitor current weather forecast and warnings at MeteoAlarm (in English).
Storms
All parts of Slovenia can experience extreme storms, including strong winds and rain, lightning, and powerful and large hailstorms. Such storms can occur suddenly during summer, particularly at times of extreme heat across Europe. Seek shelter and follow local advice until the storm passes.
Forest fires
During especially hot and dry periods there is a danger of forest fires. It’s illegal to do anything that starts a fire that poses a danger to human life or could cause significant material damage.
Flooding
Flash floods can occur with very little warning and can lead to dangerous water flows and disruption to transport and other networks. Keep a close eye on weather forecasts and follow the advice of local authorities.
Earthquakes
Western Slovenia is on an earthquake fault line and is subject to occasional tremors.
