Paraguay-Brazil border
Transnational criminal organisations carry out drug trafficking and arms smuggling along Paraguay’s eastern border with Brazil. Most activity is from Pedro Juan Caballero south to Ciudad del Este, and to the Tri-Border Area where the borders of Paraguay, Brazil and Argentina meet.
Violent crime is on the increase in this area – take particular care in the departments (‘departamentos’) that border Brazil:
Amambay Department
Concepción Department
Alto Paraná Department
San Pedro Department
Canindeyú Department
Salto del Guairá Department
A small guerrilla-style group calling itself the Ejercito del Pueblo Paraguayo (EPP) operates in the north of the Department of San Pedro and the south of the Department of Concepción. The group typically targets police and the military. They attack the ranches of major landowners, often stealing large numbers of cattle. Their attacks can be violent, and include the use of explosives and firearms. In the last decade, they have kidnapped several high-profile people for ransom, most recently in 2022. Three people are still in captivity.   
Paraguay-Bolivia border
