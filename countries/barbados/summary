Travel to Barbados is subject to entry restrictions
All travellers from the UK must arrive with a negative PCR test taken by a certified or accredited laboratory within 3 days of arrival but there are different rules on arrival for vaccinated and unvaccinated travellers.
You must complete and submit an online immigration/customs form 24 hours prior to travel. This can also be done via the BIMSafe app.
Unvaccinated travellers will be required to quarantine at government approved accommodation (a licensed holding hotel or an, approved apartment or villa at your own expense), and undertake a further PCR test 5 days after your arrival. You will need to stay in your hotel room and may be required to wear an electronic tracking bracelet until you receive the results of your second test. If this second test is negative you will no longer be subject to quarantine. The government aims to return results within 48 hours but there have been some delays. Check the Barbados Travel Protocols carefully for full details of these requirements.
A new protocol is in place for fully vaccinated travellers (2 vaccine doses administered more than 14 days prior to arrival). On arrival, you will undergo a rapid PCR test and then quarantine at government approved quarantine accommodation (hotel, apartment or villa) until a negative test result is received. This may be on the day of arrival but the authorities recommend that you book two nights’ accommodation. Check the Barbados Travel Protocols carefully for full details, including what evidence is required to prove that you have been vaccinated. If you cannot provide sufficient proof that you have been vaccinated, you will be treated as if you have not been vaccinated.
