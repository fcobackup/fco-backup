You will be required to take a PCR test at Beirut International Airport upon arrival (which is provided at the airline’s expense), and then self-isolate at your accommodation for 72 hours before taking another PCR test (that you must arrange yourself) and waiting in self-isolation for the results. If both tests are negative, you may leave self-isolation.

Travel in Lebanon
On 21 December the Lebanese government amended the curfew hours that had previously been in place. Movement is now prohibited between 3am and 5am though this may become more restrictive from 2 January.
Restaurants, bars, pubs and nightclubs will operate at 50% capacity. Bars, pubs and nightclubs can remain open under certain conditions, such as if they serve food. Public and private gatherings, including social and cultural events, are permitted at 50% capacity. You must abide by social distancing, keeping two metres between individuals, and avoid crowds.
Beirut International airport will remain open, as well as sea and land borders. All passengers are required to have their tickets with them when transferring to and from the airport. Some exemptions to COVID-19 restrictions are applied to aid workers. For further clarification, aid workers should contact the United Nations for advice.
When traveling around Lebanon, including to and from the airport, private cars should have no more than four people in them (including the driver). Wearing masks for all passengers is obligatory.
Fabric masks covering the mouth and nose must be worn when outside the home and in vehicles (unless travelling alone, or exercising). Those over the age of 65 years old are advised to stay home and not go out unless absolutely necessary.
Lebanese authorities may issue fines, impose road blocks, or imprison those violating these measures for up to three years. You should comply with all measures introduced by the Lebanese authorities and obey the instructions of the security forces. These measures may be changed at short notice.
Keep up to date with information from your tour operator, transport or accommodation provider on the impact on any existing travel plans.
