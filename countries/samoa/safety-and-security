Crime
The level of serious crime is low, but incidents of petty theft are fairly common.  Do not leave your belongings unattended. Use hotel safes for passports and valuables.
Road travel
Samoa switched to driving on the left in 2009, however, many vehicles still have the steering wheel on the left of the vehicle. You should take care when driving on the roads, observing speed limits.
You should avoid driving at night out of built-up areas. Vehicle safety regulations are not consistently enforced and traffic violations occur routinely. Roads in Samoa often cross small streams. Take care when crossing these streams.
Swimming
Tide changes can produce powerful currents in ocean lagoons. Take local advice before swimming. Fatal accidents have occurred at popular beaches.
