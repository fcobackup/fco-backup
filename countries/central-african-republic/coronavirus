Be prepared for your plans to change
No travel is risk-free during COVID. Countries may further restrict travel or bring in new rules at short notice, for example due to a new COVID-19 variant. Check with your travel company or airline for any transport changes which may delay your journey home.
If you test positive for COVID-19 while in CAR you will need to stay where you are to isolate. You must test negative before traveling. You may need to seek treatment where you are. The government does not provide any assistance for treatment, this would need to be covered by your insurance. This applies to all, including those under 18.
Plan ahead and make sure you:
can access money
understand what your insurance will cover
can make arrangements to extend your stay and be away for longer than planned
