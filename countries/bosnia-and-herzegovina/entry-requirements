In light of the ongoing coronavirus (COVID-19) pandemic, the authorities in Bosnia and Herzegovina have introduced serious restrictions on entry. See below
The information on this page covers the most common types of travel and reflects the UK government’s understanding of the rules currently in place. Unless otherwise stated, this information is for travellers using a full ‘British Citizen’ passport.
The authorities in the country or territory you’re travelling to are responsible for setting and enforcing the rules for entry. If you’re unclear about any aspect of the entry requirements, or you need further reassurance, you’ll need to contact the embassy, high commission or consulate of the country or territory you’re travelling to.
You should also consider checking with your transport provider or travel company to make sure your passport and other travel documents meet their requirements.
Entry rules in response to coronavirus (COVID-19)
Entry to Bosnia and Herzegovina
British Nationals, including those with residence in Bosnia and Herzegovina, need a negative COVID-19 (PCR) test result that is not older than 48 hours. Some groups are exempt from this rule, including: diplomats accredited to and resident in Bosnia and Herzegovina, EUFOR/NATO staff, freight drivers and crew, and foreigners in transit to their country of residence. Changes to restrictions may be introduced at short notice. You should comply with any screening measures put in place by the authorities. You should not use the NHS testing service to get a test in order to facilitate your travel to another country. You should arrange to take a private test.
A number of restrictions are in place at border crossing points into and out of Bosnia and Herzegovina. The Border Police of Bosnia and Herzegovina are publishing regular updates. Countries neighbouring Bosnia and Herzegovina have also introduced restrictions. Please check FCDO Travel Advice for Croatia, Serbia and Montenegro for details.
Transiting Bosnia and Herzegovina
Transit through Bosnia and Herzegovina is possible without the need for a negative test result for British nationals returning to the UK or their country of residence, or travelling from one place in Croatia to another via Neum in Bosnia and Herzegovina. Freight drivers are also allowed to transit.
Visas
The Bosnian authorities have advised that where individuals’ visas or residence permits have expired due to current restrictions on travel meaning they were unable to leave the country, the Bosnian authorities will adopt a case by case approach. If your visa or residence permit has expired, you should contact your nearest Field Office of the Service for Foreigners’ Affairs.
