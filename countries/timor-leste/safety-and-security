Crime
Crime continues to be a problem in Timor-Leste, including gang-related violence, robbery (in some cases armed), and assault.
Be vigilant at all times and avoid displaying expensive items of jewellery or carrying large sums of money. There have been reports of harassment and violence against women.
There are occasional incidents of fighting between groups in various districts around Timor-Leste, often but not always related to martial arts groups. These incidents often involve stone throwing and occasionally machetes and knives. Most happen at night. Foreigners haven’t been targeted, but leave the area immediately if you’re aware of fighting.
Local travel
Take care if you go outside after dark. Avoid travelling alone or to isolated areas. 
Be particularly vigilant in border areas.
Crocodiles are frequently seen on the south coast and have even been seen at beaches near Dili.
Road travel
Poor road quality makes driving in Timor-Leste hazardous. Accidents are frequent especially involving motorcycles.
Drivers must hold a current driving licence valid for the class of vehicle they plan to drive. Take extra care when it’s wet. Outside of Dili, travel in convoy whenever possible. Main routes are often single-track mountain roads, which can deteriorate rapidly and become impassable, particularly during the rainy season (November-April).
Sea travel
There have been incidents of piracy and armed robbery against ships in neighbouring waters. Mariners should be vigilant, reduce opportunities for theft, establish secure areas onboard and report all incidents to the coastal and flag state authorities.
Political situation
The UN peacekeeping operation ended its mandate in December 2012. The security situation in Timor-Leste has improved but underlying tensions remain especially during election periods where the security situation could deteriorate with little warning.
If you become aware of any nearby military activity you should leave the area immediately. If you are inside and become aware of military operations in your immediate area you should take cover away from windows.
Avoid any demonstrations and large crowds, as these have the potential to deteriorate quickly and turn violent.
Make sure your travel documents are up-to-date and available in case you need to leave at short notice. Keep a photocopy of the relevant pages of your passport to avoid any complications.
