This page reflects the UK government’s understanding of current rules for people travelling on a full ‘British Citizen’ passport, for the most common types of travel.
The authorities in Belize set and enforce entry rules. For further information, contact the embassy, high commission or consulate of the country or territory you’re travelling to. You should also consider checking with your transport provider or travel company to make sure your passport and other travel documents meet their requirements.
Entry rules in response to coronavirus (COVID-19)
Entry to Belize
Fully vaccinated visitors no longer require a negative COVID test but must show proof of immunisation for entry at Belize’s airport, land borders or sea ports. If unable to show proof of being fully vaccinated or if unvaccinated, you must present a negative result from a PCR test taken within the 72 hours prior to arrival or an approved rapid antigen test (home testing kits are not accepted) taken within the 48 hours prior to arrival, or a test can be administered at the airport for a fee of BZ$100 or US$50 (which must be paid in cash).
If you receive a positive result on arrival, you will be required to undertake a mandatory quarantine at an approved quarantine hotel at your own expense. The Ministry of Health will monitor each case. A negative test is required as proof of recovery.
Foreign tourists are required to pay BZ$36 (US$18) for Belize Travel Health Insurance – this is mandatory even if you already have personal travel insurance and helps protect against incurred medical and non-medical expenses should you test positive for COVID during your stay in Belize. It covers up to a 21 day stay; an extended coverage can be purchased if you are staying longer. It is recommended to buy this in advance via Belize Travel Insurance though it can be bought upon arrival at the Philip Goldson International Airport, Santa Elena Border (Northern border) or the Belize Western border. Foreign nationals with long stay status, airline crew and personnel, cruise ship passengers and crew, travellers staying in Belize for 1 day or less and foreign government officials and diplomats are exempt.
Importing COVID-19 rapid antigen home test kits is not allowed without the prior permission of the Belize Ministry of Health. Home test kits found during entry without a Ministry of Health permit will be confiscated.
There are no direct flights between the UK and Belize. The regulations of countries that you may pass through and / or UK requirements on travel from transit countries may affect your travel. For more information see FCDO Travel Advice on the countries through which you may travel or transit.
Protocols and procedures are subject to change at short notice. Further information is available from the Belize Tourism Board, Travel Belize or Belize Port Authority.
Demonstrating your COVID-19 status
Belize will accept the UK’s proof of COVID-19 recovery and vaccination record and proof of COVID-19 vaccination issued in the Crown Dependencies. A digital or hard copy of an up to date NHS COVID pass showing two doses of an approved vaccine (or one for Johnson and Johnson) is accepted as proof of immunisation / full vaccination.
Your NHS appointment card from vaccination centres is not designed to be used as proof of vaccination and should not be used to demonstrate your vaccine status.
Regular entry requirements
Visas
British nationals do not need a visa to enter Belize. On arrival, you’ll be allowed to enter for one month. Any extension to remain in the country will incur a fee of BZD$200 for each month’s extension.
Passport validity
Your passport should be valid for a minimum period of 6 months from the date of entry into Belize.
Yellow fever certificate requirements
Check whether you need a yellow fever certificate by visiting the National Travel Health Network and Centre’s TravelHealthPro website.
UK Emergency Travel Documents
UK Emergency Travel Documents are accepted for entry, airside transit and exit from Belize.
Travelling with children
Single parents or adults travelling with children under the age of 18 are required to provide notarised documentary evidence of parental responsibility, or consent to travel from those with parental responsibility. Such documentation is often required before being allowed to enter Belize and, in some cases, before permitting children to leave the country.
Departure tax
When leaving by air the departure tax is BZD$111 or US$50, though it’s often included in the air fare. Make sure you have enough cash with you, as it isn’t always possible to pay by card.
When leaving by land the departure tax is BZD$40 or US$20, which must be paid in cash.
