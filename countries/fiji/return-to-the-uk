Flights
Fiji Airways have indicated they will continue to operate ad hoc flights. Monitor this travel advice and announcements on the Fiji Airways Twitter page.
Fiji Airways have indicated they will operate a repatriation flight from Nadi-Sydney-Nadi on 22 May. FJ1911 will depart Nadi at 0900 and is scheduled to arrive in Sydney at 1140 (all times local). If you are interested in using this flight to transit Australia to return home we ask that you contact us at SuvaCS@fco.gov.uk. Details of rules on transiting Australia are online.
A UK-organised special flight left Nadi on 29 April. As this enabled all visitors to return home, we do not anticipate further UK charter flights at this time.
You will need to pay for your return travel to the UK. If departure options are available but you cannot afford the travel costs and have exhausted all other options for getting funds, you may be eligible to apply for an emergency loan from the government. This is a last resort option and you would need to repay the loan when you are back in the UK. For more information, you should contact Corporate Travel Management (CTM). CTM are a commercial partner of the FCO and are authorised to administer such loans on behalf of the FCO.
