Warning
FCDO advises against all but essential travel to parts of Rwanda.

This information is for people travelling on a full ‘British citizen’ passport from the UK. It is based on the UK government’s understanding of Rwanda’s current rules for the most common types of travel.
The authorities in Rwanda set and enforce entry rules. If you’re not sure how these requirements apply to you, contact the Rwandan High Commission in the UK.
Passport validity requirements
To enter Rwanda, your passport must have an ‘expiry date’ at least 6 months after the date you arrive and at least one blank page for entry stamps.
Check with your travel provider that your passport and other travel documents meet requirements. Renew your passport if you need to.
You will be denied entry if you do not have a valid travel document or try to use a passport that has been reported lost or stolen.
Visa requirements
You must have a visa to enter Rwanda as a visitor. As a citizen of a Commonwealth country, you can get a free 30-day visa on arrival.
Rwanda’s immigration department has information on visa requirements.
Applying for a visa
You can also apply for a visa from the Rwandan High Commission in London.
You must get a UK Police Certificate before you travel if you’re applying for a resident, business or missionary multiple-entry visa. It usually takes at least 10 working days to process.
Travel between Rwanda and the Democratic Republic of the Congo
Land border crossing opening hours between Rwanda and the Democratic Republic of the Congo at Gisenyi-Goma and Cyangugu-Bukavu vary. The FCDO currently advises against all but essential travel to parts of the Rubavu and Rusizi Districts.
You may experience immigration difficulties if you do not have residency status and regularly cross between the two countries.
Vaccine requirements
To enter Rwanda, if you’re coming from a country listed as a transmission risk, you must have a certificate to prove you’ve had a yellow fever vaccination.
For full details about medical entry requirements and recommended vaccinations, see TravelHealthPro’s Rwanda guide.   
Customs rules
There are strict rules about goods you can take into or out of Rwanda. You must declare anything that may be prohibited or subject to tax or duty.
You must declare drones when you arrive. They may be confiscated or held until you leave the country.
