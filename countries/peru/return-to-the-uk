There are currently no commercial options available to return to the UK from Peru. Borders are closed from 16 March until at least 12 April.
We know this is concerning for British people trying to leave Peru. The UK government is working closely with airlines, the Peruvian authorities and other governments to make sure options are available for you to return to the UK as soon as possible.
What to do
If you cannot leave Peru at this time, you should: * follow the advice of local authorities, including local measures to help minimise your risk of exposure to coronavirus * find accommodation that’s suitable for your needs. IPERU, the Peruvian Tourism Information Agency, is offering details of suitable accommodation. * keep in regular contact with family and friends at home, so they know you are safe and well

Upon your return to the UK, you should follow the UK government advice that applies to everyone; go straight home from the airport, avoiding public transport where possible. Passengers will be expected to make their own arrangements on arrival in the UK and HMG will not fund the cost of onward travel. You should then stay at home and only go outside for food, health reasons, daily exercise or work if you absolutely cannot work from home.
