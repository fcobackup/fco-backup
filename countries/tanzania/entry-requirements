This page has information on travelling to Tanzania.
This page reflects the UK government’s understanding of current rules for people travelling on a full ‘British Citizen’ passport from the UK, for the most common types of travel.
The authorities in Tanzania set and enforce entry rules. If you’re unsure how Tanzania’s entry requirements apply to you, contact its UK embassy, high commission or consulate.
All travellers
All travellers including Tanzanians, returning residents and members of the crew/layovers are required to truthfully fill in an online Traveller’s Health Surveillance Form for Tanzania mainland.
If you’re fully vaccinated
If you can prove that you’re fully vaccinated, you do not need to take a COVID-19 test before you travel to Tanzania or a Rapid Antigen Test on arrival.
To prove you’re fully vaccinated, you must show a valid vaccination certificate upon arrival. The certificate must:
confirm you have been vaccinated with a vaccine approved by the Tanzanian authorities and the World Health Organization, and;
have a valid QR code.
Proof of vaccination status
You can use the UK COVID Pass to demonstrate your vaccination record when entering Tanzania.
If you’re not fully vaccinated
You must present a negative COVID-19 RT- PCR or NAATs test certificate or take a Rapid Antigen Test on arrival.
The test certificate must:
confirm that you took the test no more than 72 hours before your departure, and;
have a valid QR code.
If you’re not fully vaccinated and arrive without a RT-PCR or NAAT test certificate, you will be tested for COVID-19 upon arrival using a Rapid Antigen Test. The test will be at your own expense and costs 10 USD (TZS 23,000) on the Tanzania mainland. Children aged 12 and under and aircraft crew are exempt.
If you test positive, the authorities will test you with a RT- PCR test for confirmation. You will need to pay 50 USD for the test.
For Zanzibar, you can pay for the test before arrival.
Children and young people
Children aged 12 years and below are exempt from both RT PCR and Rapid Antigen Test requirements.
If you’re transiting through Tanzania
If you’re transiting Tanzania by air, you are exempt from both vaccination and COVID-19 testing requirements.
Your carrier or final destination country may have separate rules on vaccination and testing requirements. Check with your transport provider or travel agent for their COVID-19 requirements before you travel.
Exemptions
There are no exemptions to Tanzania’s entry requirements.
Check your passport and travel documents before you travel
Passport validity
If you are visiting Tanzania, your passport should be valid for 6 months from the date you arrive.
If you are a resident in Tanzania, your passport must be valid for 6 months from the date you arrive.
Check with your travel provider to make sure your passport and other travel documents meet their requirements.
Visas
All British passport holders need a tourist or business visa to enter Tanzania. Tanzania has introduced an ‘e-visas’ system through which applications can be submitted and approved online in advance of travel. It is no longer possible to get a visa from the Tanzanian High Commission in London.
It is also possible to get a tourist or business visa for a single entry on arrival at main ports of entry to Tanzania, subject to the fulfilment of all immigration requirements. You may be asked to provide proof of your return journey. You will not be able to get a multiple entry visa on arrival. For further information about visas visit the Tanzanian immigration website.
If you are planning to work or volunteer, you will need a valid work permit which can also be applied for online via the Tanzanian immigration website. Your employer or volunteer organisation should arrange this before you travel.
If you overstay the validity of your visa or permit you can be arrested, detained and fined before being deported. Reports made to the British High Commission by Black, Asian and Minority Ethnic (BAME) British passport holders have indicated that they are experiencing additional levels of harassment from immigration officials. In these circumstances, you should stay calm and request that the Consular section of the British High Commission is immediately informed.
Yellow fever certificate requirements
Check whether you need a yellow fever certificate by visiting the National Travel Health Network and Centre’s TravelHealthPro website.
UK Emergency Travel Documents
UK Emergency Travel Documents, with a minimum of 6 months’ validity, are accepted for entry, airside transit and exit from Tanzania.
