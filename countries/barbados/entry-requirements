The information on this page covers the most common types of travel and reflects the UK government’s understanding of the rules currently in place. Unless otherwise stated, this information is for travellers using a full ‘British Citizen’ passport.
The authorities in the country or territory you’re travelling to are responsible for setting and enforcing the rules for entry. If you’re unclear about any aspect of the entry requirements, or you need further reassurance, you’ll need to contact the embassy, high commission or consulate of the country or territory you’re travelling to.
You should also consider checking with your transport provider or travel company to make sure your passport and other travel documents meet their requirements.
Entry rules in response to coronavirus (COVID-19)
Entry to Barbados
Barbados has published travel protocols setting out its entry requirements in relation to COVID-19. Visit the Visit Barbados website for full details. You should read these before your departure and monitor the pages on a regular basis as the requirements may change at short notice. Masks should be worn at all times during your travel to Barbados and your passage through the airport. Social distancing and hygiene protocols are in place.
Arrive with a COVID 19 negative test
The government of Barbados advises that from 19 September all travellers must present a valid COVID-19 negative test result taken no more than 72 hours in advance of your flight’s arrival that meets their entry requirements. You should check the protocols to confirm and understand all requirements. Relevant test accrediting bodies and standards authorities include: ISO 15189, CAP, UKAS or the equivalent. All passengers are also required to submit an Embarkation/Disembarkation (ED) card 24 hours prior to travel, to which they should upload their negative test result via travelform.gov.bb.
If you arrive in Barbados from the UK without a valid negative PCR test, you may be denied entry to the country. On arrival all passengers are also subject to a health screen.
All arrivals from the UK are subject to daily monitoring for seven days following arrival. (Monitoring includes interviews with and calls by public health professionals.) You are required to take a second COVID-19 PCR test 5-7 days after arrival. If this second test proves negative, no further monitoring will be required. If you refuse to take the test, you will be subject to quarantine for a further seven days at government approved accommodation. You should refer to the Barbados Entry protocols for full details.
You may also be required to quarantine or undergo a further COVID test at any stage of your visit if the Government of Barbados deems that you have come into close contact with a COVID-19 positive individual, or daily monitoring highlights potential COVID symptoms.
If you test positive for COVID-19 at any stage of your stay and you are asymptomatic, you may request the option to isolate at your own expense at a government approved hotel or villa. You should check all the conditions at Visit Barbados website. Alternatively, you will be transferred to the government isolation centre at Harrison’s Point, where you’ll be required to remain under medical supervision until the Barbados authorities are satisfied that you have returned two consecutive negative COVID-19 tests. This may mean a mandatory stay of several weeks.
All passengers in transit must arrive with a negative PCR test and will be subject to a health screen on arrival.
You can find full and definitive details of the protocols at Visit Barbados website and are advised to read and understand the requirements carefully before departure.
You should also monitor the website on a regular basis as the Government of Barbados may change the requirements without notice.

Visas

It’s an offence to overstay the entry period or to work without a work permit.

Your passport should be valid for the proposed duration of your stay. No additional period of validity beyond this is required.
