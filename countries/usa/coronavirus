Travel in USA
Many airports in the USA have implemented safety measures designed to limit the spread of COVID-19. You should check the website of the airport you are flying into or transiting to see how these could affect you.
New York, New Jersey and Connecticut issued a travel advisory Wednesday 24 June that requires people arriving from US states with significant community spread of COVID-19 to quarantine for 14 days. The list of states to which that advisory applies is updated daily and can be found on the websites of New York, New Jersey and Connecticut’s state governments.
A number of US states have mandated the use of masks and face coverings while in public. These will vary from state to state. You should consult the website of the state to which you are travelling. Contact details are found on the US.GOV site .
Further restrictions will vary locally with some states relaxing lockdown procedures while others are pausing or reversing their re-openings.
