From Thursday evening, 26 March, the last Airlink flight will leave Eswatini. After that date it will no longer be possible to leave Eswatini by commercial aircraft until further notice. South African airspace will close to commercial aircraft as of midnight Thursday 26 March. Follow our travel advice for South Africa.
British nationals will still be able to transit through OR Tambo International Airport in Johannesburg until that time.
You will need to pay for your return travel to the UK. If departure options are available but you cannot afford the travel costs and have exhausted all other options for getting funds, you may be eligible to apply for an emergency loan from the government. This is a last resort option and you would need to repay the loan when you are back in the UK. For more information, you should contact Corporate Travel Management (CTM). CTM are a commercial partner of the FCO and are authorised to administer such loans on behalf of the FCO.
