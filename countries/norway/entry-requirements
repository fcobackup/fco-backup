This advice reflects the UK government’s understanding of current rules for people travelling on a full ‘British citizen’ passport from the UK, for the most common types of travel.
The authorities in Norway set and enforce entry rules. If you’re not sure how Norway’s entry requirements apply to you, contact the Norwegian Embassy in London.
COVID-19 rules
Countries may restrict travel or bring in rules at short notice. Check with your travel provider for changes.
You should also read TravelHealthPro’s general COVID-19 advice for travellers.
Entry to Norway
There are no COVID-19 testing or vaccination requirements for travellers entering Norway.
Passport validity requirements
Your passport must:
have a ‘date of issue’ less than 10 years before the date you arrive. Passports issued after 1 October 2018 are now valid for only 10 years, but for passports issued before 1 October 2018, extra months may have been added if you renewed a passport early
have an ‘expiry date’ at least 3 months after the day you plan to leave
Contact the Norwegian Embassy in London if your passport does not meet both these requirements.
Check with your travel provider that your passport and other travel documents meet requirements. Renew your passport if you need to.
You will be denied entry if you do not have a valid travel document, or try to use a passport that has been reported lost or stolen.
Checks at border control
Make sure you get your passport stamped.
If you’re a visitor, your passport must be stamped when you enter or leave the Schengen area (which includes Norway). Border guards will use passport stamps to check you have not overstayed the 90-day visa-free limit for stays in the Schengen area. If your passport was not stamped, border guards will presume you have overstayed the visa-free limit.
If your passport was not stamped, show evidence of when and where you entered or left the Schengen area (for example, boarding passes or tickets) and ask the border guards to add the date and location in your passport.
Read about passport stamping if you live in Norway.
At Norwegian border control, you may also need to:
show proof of your accommodation, for example, a hotel booking confirmation or proof of address for a second home
show proof of your travel insurance
show a return or onward ticket
prove that you have enough money for your stay – the amount varies depending on your accommodation
Svalbard
You’ll need your passport to travel to and enter the Svalbard archipelago.
Customs rules
There are strict rules about goods that can be brought into and taken out of Norway. You must declare anything that may be prohibited or subject to tax or duty.
It is illegal to import whale meat from Norway into the UK or EU. You could get a fine of up to £5,000 or be imprisoned.
Taking money into Norway
You can take up to 25,000 Norwegian krone into Norway without declaring it. If you bring in any more than this, you must declare it to customs on arrival. If you do not declare it, you could get a substantial fine and temporary confiscation of the excess currency, which may then be released only through a bank.
