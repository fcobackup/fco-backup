There are currently limited commercial options available to return to the UK from Pakistan. The CAA have confirmed that the Government of Pakistan has extended the suspension of scheduled international flights until April 30, 2020, 23:59 PST.
We know this is concerning for British people trying to leave Pakistan. The UK government is working closely with airlines, the Pakistan authorities and other governments to make sure options are available for you to return to the UK as soon as possible.
UK special charter flights
The UK is currently operating a series of special charter flights from Pakistan for British nationals who normally live in the UK and their direct dependants to return to the UK.
This round of charter flights, from 21 to 27 April, includes three direct flights from Islamabad to Heathrow, four direct flights from Islamabad to Manchester, two direct flights from Lahore to Heathrow, and one direct flight from Lahore to Manchester. We are currently allocating places for the remaining flights. Demand has been high and not all those who have registered have been allocated to a flight in the first round. As a result, we are organising a second round of charter flights from 30 April to 5 May. This will include one direct flight from Karachi to London Heathrow, four direct flights from Islamabad to Manchester, two direct flights from Lahore to Manchester, one direct flight from Islamabad to London Heathrow, and one direct flight from Lahore to London Heathrow.
If you are on a short-term visit to Pakistan and have not already registered on our booking portal, you should take the earliest available opportunity to do so, as the portal will close on 1 May. There is no guarantee that there will be further charter flights after the second round. Those already registered for charter flights from Islamabad and Lahore do not need to do so again. Passengers on existing wait lists will be prioritised for the second round of charters.
All those wishing to travel from Karachi to London Heathrow need to register via the link below. We have closed the ‘expressions of interest’ form we used previously to assess demand for this route.
The UK Government’s focus is on bringing home stranded British nationals, and foreign nationals travelling with close family members who are British nationals. We are currently prioritising individuals in these categories for flights. Vulnerable non-British UK residents with Indefinite Leave to Remain, and other foreign nationals, may only be accommodated if there is sufficient capacity. Your eligibility for flights, including your UK address, will be checked before your tickets are issued.

If you have exhausted all other options available to you for getting funds, you may be eligible to apply for an emergency loan from the government to cover the cost of the ticket.

Do not contact the High Commission directly to reserve a seat as we are unable to take your booking.
Do not travel to the airport without a confirmed ticket, as tickets will not be on sale at the airport.
A small number of particularly vulnerable people may receive a call to alert you to these flights and recommend you book. To protect you from scams, callers will identify themselves to you using personal information you have already submitted to the High Commission. However, do not wait for a call – if you want to board one of these flights, register to book a flight now.
More information on the flights themselves, including cost and baggage allowances, is available when you book through CTM. Although in-flight meals will be provided, shops may not be open at the airport, so you should bring your own food and a refillable water bottle. You should also bring your passport and travel documentation, a face mask, and a printed copy of your confirmation email if possible, and if not bring an electronic copy.
If a flight is cancelled with no replacement offered, refunds will be processed within 14 working days by CTM. If you cancel your flight less than 24hrs before a flight’s scheduled departure, you will not be eligible for a refund.
Other flights
Pakistan International Airlines (PIA) have announced they intend to operate a limited number of flights, including to Manchester, Birmingham and London, from 19 to 28 April. You should contact PIA offices for further information. PIA operated 22 commercial flights between 4 and 12 April. There was high demand for these flights.
We understand Qatar Airways (QA) is planning some special flights to London from Lahore on 25, 28 and 29 April and from Peshawar on 29 April. All flights will be via Doha. To book tickets on these QA flights you can call or visit any QA booking office, or use the QA website. Some tickets may also be available through travel agents.
If departure options are available but you cannot afford the travel costs and have exhausted all other options for getting funds, you may be eligible to apply for an emergency loan from the government. This is a last resort option and you would need to repay the loan when you are back in the UK. For more information, you should contact Corporate Travel Management (CTM). CTM are a commercial partner of the FCO and are authorised to administer such loans on behalf of the FCO.

Travel to the airport
You will need to arrange your own travel to the airport.
Due to government restrictions, public transport is limited, and the authorities have discouraged all non-essential use of public transport. If you are travelling to Islamabad or Lahore Airport you should, if possible, carry printed copies of your flight confirmation and have your passports easily to hand. If you cannot get a printed flight confirmation, carry an electronic copy.
We have secured assurances from provincial and federal authorities that, if you have a confirmed flight ticket and valid travel document, you will be able to travel to the airport. If you have been placed into a quarantine centre, or you are in an area that has been quarantined by the authorities, you may have to wait until the quarantine is lifted before being able to travel to the airport. Follow the advice of the relevant local authorities. If you are not allowed to travel across a checkpoint or if you are moved to a quarantine facility, call us on 051 201 2000.
Some provinces have limited the number of people that can be in a vehicle. In addition, people who do not have a flight ticket, except the driver, may not be allowed to accompany travellers to the airport.
You are strongly advised not to travel to the airport if you are displaying any COVID-19 symptoms, including a high temperature. When you enter the airport, you will be thermal scanned by the Pakistani authorities. If you have a high temperature or other COVID-19 symptoms, you will not be permitted to fly. The Pakistan government are likely to take you to a quarantine facility, where you will be tested after 48 hours. If you test positive, will likely be moved to a hospital isolation facility. If you test negative, you will be released with instructions to self-isolate for a period of time determined by relevant authorities. Call us on 051 201 2000 if you are moved to a quarantine facility.
If you travel, you must wear a face mask at the airport, and you will need to bring your own masks with you. Airlines and airport authorities will not provide masks.
If you travel on the specially arranged charter flights, you should arrive at the airport at least 4 hours before the flight is due to depart.

You must follow the guidance for when you return to the UK on steps you should take to protect yourself and others.
