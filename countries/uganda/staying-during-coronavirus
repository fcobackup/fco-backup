This page gives you guidance on how to stay safely in Uganda as a visitor, if you are unable to return to the UK.
Everyone should comply with the measures put in place in Uganda to limit the spread of coronavirus (COVID-19).
Moving around in Uganda
The Ugandan authorities have introduced measures to limit the spread of coronavirus. Some internal lockdown measures have been extended to 23 June and could be further extended:
It is mandatory for everyone aged 6 or above to wear a face mask when outside your house.
A curfew is in place from 7pm to 6:30am until 23 June.
Movement by personal vehicles is permitted (except in districts with an international border) but limited to 3 people per car (including the driver).
Travel by public transport (including minibus taxis, buses, coaches, passenger trains) will be allowed from 4 June at 50% occupancy, except in districts on an international border where the suspension is indefinite. Tuk tuks and boda bodas (motorbike taxis) are not allowed to carry passengers.
Vehicles delivering goods and food, and ambulances, security, refuse and government vehicles are exempt where restrictions apply. Only cargo transport and security vehicles are exempt during curfew hours.
Gatherings of more than 5 people are prohibited. Public exercise is banned.
Shopping arcades are closed. Shopping malls are allowed to open from 4 June. Supermarkets, pharmacies and shops outside shopping malls and arcades are allowed to open. Hotels and restaurants are open with social distancing measures in place and food delivery services (such as Jumia) remain operational outside of curfew hours.

Visas
Immigration offices in Uganda are closed until further notice.

Finance
There is a range of financial support from the government that you can access while you are unable to return due to coronavirus restrictions.
If you’re in Uganda, and have exhausted all other options to cover essential living costs while you wait to return home, you could apply for an emergency loan for your living costs from the UK government. You can only apply if you normally live in the UK and you cannot return home. This last-resort option is for those most in need, and you would need to repay the loan when you are back in the UK. Apply for an emergency loan.

If you need urgent consular assistance, contact your nearest British embassy, high commission or consulate. All telephone numbers are available 24/7.
