If you plan to pass through another country to return to the UK, check the travel advice for the country you’re transiting.
Be prepared for your plans to change
No travel is risk-free during COVID. Countries may further restrict travel or bring in new rules at short notice, for example due to a new COVID-19 variant. Check with your travel company or airline for any transport changes which may delay your journey home.
If you test positive for COVID-19, you may need to stay where you are until you test negative. You may also need to seek treatment there.
Plan ahead and make sure you:
can access money
understand what your insurance will cover
can make arrangements to extend your stay and be away for longer than planned

Testing positive for COVID-19 in Austria
If you get a positive PCR test result, you will have to self-isolate immediately. You should contact the health authorities for further instructions by calling 1450.
If you test positive with a lateral flow test, you will be treated as a “suspected case” and must self-isolate immediately, following the instructions of the health authorities. A lateral flow test will usually be followed up with a PCR test. If the PCR test is negative, you can leave self-isolation.
Options for self-isolation vary by region. In Vienna, a free hotel is available for visitors who test positive and have nowhere else to self-isolate.
Rules for ending self-isolation after a confirmed infection vary by region and may require a negative PCR test. They should be communicated to you as part of the official order to self-isolate (“Absonderungsbescheid”).

COVID-19 vaccines if you live in Austria
Wherever possible British nationals should aim to be vaccinated in the country where they live. We will update this page when the Government of Austria announces new information on the national vaccination programme. You can sign up to get email notifications when this page is updated.
The Austrian national vaccine programme started in December 2020 and is using a range of vaccines: Moderna, AstraZeneca and Janssen on the eligible population over 18 years of age, and Pfizer-BioNTech vaccines for those aged over 12 years of age. British nationals resident in Austria are eligible for vaccination. The Austrian authorities have issued guidance on how to register your interest in being vaccinated (only available in German). The guidance provides information and links on how you can register depending on which region of Austria you live in. Individuals over 80 years of age or who are in a high risk group can use the dedicated regional email addresses for further information. This service is separate to the need to register interest in being vaccinated. The Austrian government has published a range of key documents in English.
Find out more, including about vaccines that are authorised in the UK or approved by the World Health Organisation, on the COVID-19 vaccines if you live abroad.
If you’re a British national living in Austria, you should seek medical advice from your local healthcare provider. Information about COVID-19 vaccines used in the national programme where you live, including regulatory status, should be available from local authorities.
If you receive your COVID-19 vaccination in Austria, you can get an EU Digital COVID Certificate from the national authorities. The Certificate proves that you have been vaccinated against COVID-19, received a negative test result, or recovered from COVID-19. It will help facilitate your travel within the EU and, in some countries, you can use it to demonstrate your COVID-19 status to businesses and other organisations. For further information visit the European Commission’s EU Digital COVID Certificate page.
