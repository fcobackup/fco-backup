Airports are closed to international traffic until 1 September provisionally.
UK special flights
On 1 and 4 May, the FCO organised 2 special flights from Colombia to help British tourists, short-term visitors and their direct dependents return to the UK. There are currently no further government-organised flights planned from Colombia.
Future travel options
The British embassy is in contact with airlines, the Colombian authorities and other governments to make sure commercial options for returning to the UK are available as soon as possible.
This travel advice will be updated when departure options become available. Sign up for email alerts and follow the British Embassy on Twitter page and Facebook.
Call the British Embassy on +57 1 326 8300 or complete the contact form with your details (full name, location and description of your situation), to be alerted when options become available.
If you cannot leave Colombia at this time, see advice on staying in Colombia during coronavirus.
You will need to pay for your return travel to the UK. If departure options are available but you cannot afford the travel costs and have exhausted all other options for getting funds, you may be eligible to apply for an emergency loan from the government. This is a last resort option and you would need to repay the loan when you are back in the UK. If you need to discuss financial assistance for other departure options please call the British Embassy on +57 1 326 8300.
Travel to the airport
To facilitate the departure of British nationals on any possible future commercial or humanitarian flight, when travel arrangements are confirmed, the British embassy will obtain the necessary transport permits from the Ministry of Foreign Affairs of Colombia.
