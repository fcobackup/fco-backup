Warning
FCDO advises against all travel to Syria.

Your travel insurance could be invalidated if you travel against advice from the Foreign, Commonwealth & Development Office (FCDO).
FCDO advises against all travel to Syria
FCDO advises against all travel to Syria due to the ongoing conflict and unpredictable security conditions.
If you are a British national in Syria, leave by any practical means.
If you are affected by escalated hostilities in Syria, shelter in place until you can identify safe means to leave. Some curfews may be imposed in affected areas. Follow local advice and exercise caution.
UK government support
Consular support is not available from the British government from within Syria, as all British Embassy services in Damascus are suspended. The FCDO may become aware of support provided by other organisations which can be shared with British nationals. If you need help, call the FCDO in London on +44 (0)20 7008 5000.
Travel insurance
If you choose to travel against FCDO advice, research your destinations and get appropriate travel insurance. Insurance should cover your itinerary, planned activities and expenses in an emergency.
