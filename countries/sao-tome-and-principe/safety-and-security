Coronavirus guidance is being updated.
Read the Prime Minister’s statement for the latest information.

Crime
Crime rates are generally low, but burglaries and armed robberies do occur. Safeguard valuables and cash, particularly at the beach. Use a hotel safe where practical, and keep copies of important documents, including your passport.  
Road travel
You should bring a valid International Driving Permit if you wish to hire a car. Traffic is light but the majority of roads are in poor condition, particularly outside the capital. Most roads are unlit. You should avoid being on the road at night (there are animals on the roads) and during periods of heavy rainfall (landslips and mudslides can occur).
Taxis and motorbike taxis (known as “motoqueiros”) are the only forms of public transport. You should note that it is common practice for taxis to be shared. You should take the same safety precautions as in the UK and check your travel insurance.
Air travel
The EU has published a list of air carriers that are subject to an operating ban or restrictions within the community.
Seats on the small aircrafts used to fly between the islands of São Tomé and Príncipe should be booked a week or two in advance as seats may be limited.
Political Situation
São Tomé and Príncipe is generally peaceful. Economic difficulties and political rows over the handling of investments in the islands’ development occasionally lead to civil unrest.
