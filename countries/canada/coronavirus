Travel Restrictions and borders
The Canadian authorities are now barring entry to Canada, including at its border with the US, to most foreign nationals, including British nationals. This exclusion will not apply to Canadian citizens and permanent residents or their immediate families, temporary foreign workers, and some international students. Further details are available on the Immigration, Refugees and Citizenship Canada website. Canada Border Service Agency has published the following helpline: 1 800 461 9999.
At point of departure, air operators are required to complete a basic health assessment of every passenger. No passengers (regardless of citizenship) who are showing symptoms of coronavirus will be allowed to board. Further details and latest information are available on the website of the Canadian government. If you have any questions, contact the local immigration authorities or the nearest Canadian High Commission, Embassy or Consulate.
Only Toronto Pearson (YYZ); Montreal Pierre Elliott Trudeau (YUL); Calgary International Airport (YYC); and Vancouver International Airport (YVR) are operating international flights. Domestic flights, as well as flights from the United States, some destinations such as Mexico and the Caribbean, and from St. Pierre-et-Miquelon, are currently not affected by this measure. You should check with your airline before you travel for the most up to date information.
Boats and cruise ships carrying more than 500 people are banned from docking at Canadian ports until July 2020.
Health screening
All persons arriving in Canada are now legally required to self-isolate for 14 days. Heavy penalties apply for failure to comply. From 15 April, you must also produce a credible self-isolation plan. An inadequate plan would include scenarios such as planning to stay with elderly family members or failing to have a set destination. Travellers who are unable to produce a credible plan will be placed in a quarantine location, such as a hotel, for a two-week period.
All air passengers must have a non-medical mask or face covering to cover their nose and mouth during travel. Passengers on all flights arriving at or departing from Canadian airport must demonstrate they have the necessary mask or face covering during the boarding process otherwise they will be stopped from continuing their journey. You can find further information on Transport Canada’s website.
Individuals displaying symptoms of coronavirus upon arrival in Canada may not use public transportation to travel to their place of isolation. They also may not isolate in a place where they will be in contact with vulnerable people, such as seniors and individuals with underlying health conditions.
You should comply with any additional screening measures put in place by the authorities.
For questions about travel during the coronavirus pandemic, check the Health Canada website.
Visa Extensions
If you are already in Canada and your visa has expired, or is about to expire, please see the guidance on Immigration, Refugees and Citizenship Canada’s website.
Local measures
To help curb the spread of coronavirus, provincial governments have introduced a number of measures. There are some regional variations, but they generally include:
a ban on social gatherings
closure of schools, colleges and many public facilities, museums, cinemas and theatres.
closure of bars, restaurants and non-essential stores in many cities and regions.
some public transport offering only a limited service.
The authorities are urging people to stay at home where possible, and many businesses are closed.
Anyone exhibiting symptoms associated with coronavirus will be barred from domestic flights and some inter-city train services. From 20 April, non-medical face masks or face coverings are required for all flights to and from Canadian airports. The Canadian authorities strongly encourage the use of non-medical face masks or face coverings for marine, rail and bus transportation.
Both the federal and provincial governments may introduce further restrictions at short notice, including closure of provincial borders, internal travel restrictions, a provisional ban on temporary foreign workers, or mandatory self-isolation for people arriving other provinces. You should comply with the rules and advice of local authorities in relation to coronavirus. Check guidance for each province.
