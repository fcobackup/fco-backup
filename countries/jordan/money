Cash machines are available throughout Amman and in other major towns and cities. ATMs are less widely available in rural areas, though most petrol stations on major roads offer ATMs.
The Central Bank of Jordan announced on 17 March that banks will be closed until 31 March. But ATM machines will remain available and continue to be refilled. Citizens and those in Jordan are currently not permitted to visit ATMs due to the curfew.
