Cases of coronavirus (COVID-19) have been confirmed in North Macedonia. The Macedonian authorities have introduced a number of measures to limit the spread of the virus.
On 16 April, the President of North Macedonia declared a State of Emergency for the whole territory of North Macedonia for a period of 30 days.
On 23 March the Government of the Republic of North Macedonia introduced a curfew, which all citizens, with a few exceptions for key workers, must obey.
Effective from Wednesday 8 April there will be a curfew for all citizens, Monday to Friday from 4pm until 5am. On weekends there is a complete ban on the movement of all citizens from Friday at 4pm until Monday 5am.
The Government of North Macedonia has announced that there will be a nationwide curfew over the upcoming public holiday from 4 pm on Friday 17 April until 5 am on Tuesday 21 April. Police, army, health workers, pharmacies, and markets and restaurants that deliver products are exempted from the ban.
Additional curfew measures continue for those people aged under 18 and over 67. There is a complete ban on movement of people aged under 18 except for 1pm to 3pm on Monday to Friday. For people aged above 67 years of age, there will be a complete ban from Monday to Friday apart from 10am to 12pm.
The general curfew does not apply to members of law enforcement bodies, army members, firefighters and people in need of emergency medical assistance, or those in a life-threatening condition and people undergoing dialysis treatments. Public transportation will not be available during this time. Availability of taxis will be limited and taxi drivers will be allowed to transport people only to a healthcare facility or a pharmacy.
On 25 March, the Government of the Republic of North Macedonia also announced new restrictions in Kumanovo. There will be no public transportation within the municipality – that includes between Kumanovo and other cities and within the city. All shops still open in semi-open malls will also be closed.
From 13 March, the “state of crisis” in Debar and Centar Zhupa has ended and the Government of North Macedonia has removed the additional restrictions that were effective only in these municipalities. Restrictions and curfews in these areas are now in line with the rest of the country.
In the whole of the territory of North Macedonia, restaurants, cafés, bars and shopping malls are closed to the public, but grocery stores are permitted to open. Some supermarkets and restaurants are operating via online/telephone orders. Limits are placed on the number of people entering shopping facilities at any time.
Other measures include cancellation of cultural and sporting events; closure of parks; and closure of schools and universities.
Citizens are not allowed to move in public places in groups of more than two people, with the exception of children under the age of 14, if they are accompanied by a parent in the group of two
Entry and borders
Anyone entering North Macedonia from COVID-19 affected areas, regardless of nationality or residency status, are subject to mandatory 14-day quarantine at a state organised quarantine centre, and should follow the standard procedure if symptoms occur.
Effective from Monday 13 April, anyone, returning to North Macedonia from a high-risk country, which currently includes the UK, will have to go into quarantine at a state organised quarantine centre for 21 days instead of 14 days.
The British Embassy Skopje is issuing regular updates on Facebook and Twitter with the latest available information.
Visas
British passport holders do not need a visa to travel to North Macedonia for up to 3 months.
On 23 March, the Government of the Republic of North Macedonia published on its website additional information on visas for foreigners staying in North Macedonia during the State of Emergency. Foreigners who are staying in the Republic of North Macedonia for a short period (with or without a visa), may stay in the territory of the Republic of North Macedonia, even after the expiry of a visa, for the duration of the State of Emergency. The validity of a temporary residence permit and a permanent residency permit whose period of validity has expired is extended during the duration of the State of Emergency.
