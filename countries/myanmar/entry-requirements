This page has information on travelling to Myanmar Check what you must do to return to the UK.
This page reflects the UK government’s understanding of current rules for people travelling on a full ‘British Citizen’ passport from the UK, for the most common types of travel.
The authorities in Myanmar set and enforce entry rules.
All travellers
COVID-19 rules and requirements can change at short notice. Confirmation should be sought from the relevant Myanmar Embassy or Consulate well in advance of your departure.
Insurance
All visitors to Myanmar need to purchase COVID-19 medical insurance from Myanma Insurance. This is required regardless of any other insurance cover you may have.
Diplomats, UN officials and their family members do not need to purchase Myanma Insurance and can instead show proof of health insurance from their countries of origin.
Data collection
All arrivals will need to complete a Health Declaration Form when they arrive, which should be provided by the airline or the airport authorities.
Testing on arrival
You will be expected to take a COVID-19 Rapid Antigen Diagnostic Test at the airport, regardless of your vaccination status. You should bring 15,000 MMK with you or be prepared to convert cash at one of the exchange counters.
If the test result is negative, you will be free to leave. Travellers who display symptoms or test positive will be isolated and taken to a hospital or hotel designated by the Ministry of Health at their own expense.
This is in addition to the test you need to take 48 hours before your arrival. Which test you can take depends on if you are vaccinated or not vaccinated.
If you’re fully vaccinated
On arrival in Myanmar, you should present:
proof that you were fully vaccinated at least 14 days before your arrival in Myanmar with an accepted vaccine
a negative result from a COVID-19 Rapid Antigen Diagnostic test, taken no more than 48 hours prior to your arrival in Myanmar
The following vaccines are accepted by the Myanmar authorities:
CoronaVac (Sinovac Biotech Ltd)
AstraZeneca or Covishield (AstraZeneca & University of Oxford/ SK BioScience (Korea) / Siam BioScience / Serum Institute of India (SII))
