Health
If you think you have been in contact with anyone with COVID-19 or you have symptoms yourself, you should self-isolate for 14 days.
COVID-19 testing is available at testing centres in Abidjan and around the country. Results will take at least 24 hours but may take longer.
Unlike in the UK, you will need to go to pharmacy to obtain most over-the-counter medicines as these are not generally available in supermarkets. Many items that would require a prescription in the UK do not require one in Côte d’Ivoire. For items that do require a prescription in Côte d’Ivoire, UK prescriptions will be accepted but the duty doctor at the pharmacy may need to authorise the purchase. Pharmacies are usually identified by a green cross outside and will display a list showing which pharmacies are on duty (‘de garde’) out of hours.
The Government of Côte d’Ivoire is encouraging those seeking any information or who have concerns about coronavirus to call these local free hotline numbers: 143 or 101. You can also send a text message to 1336 to receive information about coronavirus by text.
