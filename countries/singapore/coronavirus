You can spread the virus even if you don’t have symptoms.

Cases of coronavirus (COVID-19) have been confirmed in Singapore.
The Singapore authorities have introduced a number of measures to limit the spread of the virus. Until at least 1 June all but essential workplaces, including most shops, are closed, as are all schools and education institutions.
You should not socialise with anyone outside your immediate household. Unless your workplace is deemed essential you should stay in your place of residence other than for essential journeys within your neighbourhood for food, medical needs and exercise, and stay at least 1 metre away from anyone when out. If you have to go out, you should go alone unless unavoidable. Read about the restrictions on the Singapore Ministry of Health website. The wearing of facemasks is compulsory for everyone when leaving their place of residence, except children under 2 or those engaged in strenuous exercise.
Those who do not comply with these measures will be fined. Repeat offenders will face further fines and/or prosecution. Be aware that restrictions and penalties are subject to change at short notice.
Visitors
No short-term visitors from anywhere in the world are able to enter Singapore. If you need to visit Singapore in extenuating circumstances, you should make a request to the Singapore government by submitting a Form 14 to the Immigration and Checkpoints Authority and wait for a response before attempting to travel.
All long-term pass holders (those who hold long-term visit passes or student passes, or in-principle approval for a long-term pass) need approval before entering or returning to Singapore. Permission requests must be made to Singapore’s Immigration and Checkpoints Authority, by email, to ICA_nCoV_request@ica.gov.sg.
Work pass holders and Permanent Residents
All work pass holders must comply with all Singapore government regulations or face their passes being revoked and/or fines/jail.
The Singapore Ministry of Manpower will only allow work pass holders and/or their dependents to enter Singapore if they have obtained prior approval of the Ministry. Employers of work pass holders are required to obtain approval from the Ministry before pass holders travel to Singapore. Any work pass holders or dependents who are granted permission to enter Singapore will be issued with a 14-day Stay at Home Notice (SHN). Further details can be found on the Ministry of Manpower website. Work pass holders will be refused entry or risk deportation if they do not comply with this requirement. They also risk having their work pass revoked.
Arrivals from anywhere in the world entering Singapore will be required to serve a 14 day period isolated in a hotel room or similar accommodation provided by the Singapore government. Whilst you are serving this period of 14 days isolation you will not be allowed to leave your room. The 14 day period cannot be reduced, even if you wish to leave Singapore. Failure to comply carries a fine and a jail term of up to six months.
Please see ‘Questions about the dedicated SHN facilities for returnees answered’.
Permanent Residents and approved work pass holders with permission to enter Singapore must submit an online health declaration in advance of their arrival into Singapore. Otherwise it will need to be completed upon entry and may result in delays to immigration clearance.
Transit
Transit through Singapore is not permitted. If your planned journey requires you to transit through Singapore, you should contact your airline immediately.
The number of flights operating worldwide are reducing and continuing to change at short notice.
You should check with your airline regularly ahead of your scheduled flight.
The UK government is continuing to work to find alternative routes for British nationals to return home.
