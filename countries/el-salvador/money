The US dollar is the official currency in El Salvador. Although some prices are still quoted in the Salvadoran Colon, payment is expected in dollars. The exchange rate is fixed at US$1.00 = 8.75 Salvadoran Colón.
It is almost impossible to change pounds sterling anywhere in El Salvador, so you should bring a mixture of cash and travellers’ cheques in US dollars. Bring some low denomination US dollar notes, as US$50 and US$100 notes are not accepted in many smaller restaurants, bars and shops. US$100 and US$50 notes may be exchanged in banks on arrival.
ATMs are widely available.
