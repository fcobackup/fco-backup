There remain commercial options to return to the UK from Japan.
If you live in the UK and are currently visiting Japan, you are strongly advised to return now by commercial means. Do not run the risk of getting stranded.
UK special charter flights will only operate for priority countries where commercial flights are not possible. You should not assume that these flights will become available in countries where commercial routes are operating. Please do not contact the contracted travel management company if no flight is advertised here.
Flights
Japan Airlines (three times a week) and All Nippon Airways (twice a week) are operating direct flights from Tokyo Haneda airport to London Heathrow. Book direct with the airline.
British Airways has now suspended its direct flights until further notice. If you have flights booked, contact British Airways to make alternative arrangements to return home.
There are also a number of indirect flights to the UK transiting via a third country. These include:
Qatar Airways from Tokyo Narita (daily)
Lufthansa from Tokyo Haneda. Telephone: +81 3 4333 7656
KLM from Tokyo Narita and Kansai. Telephone: + 81 3 6634 4984

You will need to pay for your return travel to the UK. If departure options are available but you cannot afford the travel costs and have exhausted all other options for getting funds, you may be eligible to apply for an emergency loan from the government. This is a last resort option and you would need to repay the loan when you are back in the UK. For more information, you should contact Corporate Travel Management (CTM). CTM are a commercial partner of the FCO and are authorised to administer such loans on behalf of the FCO.
Travelling to the airport
There are no restrictions on travelling to airports, and public transport continues to operate.
Your journey home: re-entering the UK
When you return, you must follow the rules for entering the UK. You:
need to provide your journey and contact details up to 48 hours before you’re due to arrive in the UK
are not allowed to leave the place you’re staying for the first 14 days you’re in the UK except in very limited situations (known as ‘self-isolating’)
See also the list of people who are exempt from the border rules.
The National Travel Health Network and Centre (NaTHNaC) also provides advice on how to stay safe as you travel by air.
If you cannot leave Japan
If you cannot leave Japan at this time, see advice on staying in Japan during coronavirus.
