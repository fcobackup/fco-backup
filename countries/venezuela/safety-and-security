Warning
FCDO advises against all travel to parts of Venezuela.

This guide also has safety advice for regions of Venezuela.
Terrorism
There is a high threat of terrorist attack globally affecting UK interests and British nationals, including from groups and individuals who view the UK and British nationals as targets. Stay aware of your surroundings at all times.
UK Counter Terrorism Policing has information and advice on staying safe abroad and what to do in the event of a terrorist attack. Find out how to reduce your risk from terrorism while abroad.
Terrorism in Venezuela
Terrorist attacks in Venezuela cannot be ruled out.
Political and economic situation  
The UK does not accept the legitimacy of the current administration put in place by Nicolás Maduro.
The situation in Venezuela is currently tense, monitor developments closely and keep up to date with this travel advice.
There is currently an increased risk of demonstrations and protests. These may become violent and could be dispersed by the use of force, including with the use of rubber bullets and tear gas. Avoid political rallies, demonstrations and crowds, and do not cross security-force lines or barricades.
There is currently a more visible security presence across the country, including with military deployments. There are strict controls at border crossings, both via land and at airports. Some foreigners, including British nationals, have been questioned extensively on the reasons for their visit. This can involve being held at the airport for hours or days and can result in deportation. Whilst checks are being carried out you may not be allowed to contact relatives, friends or the British Embassy.
Since July, some foreign nationals, including Europeans, have been detained and accused of terrorism. In some cases, the relevant embassy has not been yet able to support those detained. Support from FCDO to any British nationals who are detained may be severely limited.
Basic public services including health care and security, and the supply of electricity, water and fuel, have deteriorated in the last decade. Prolonged power cuts affect living conditions and cut mobile networks and internet. There are sometimes shortages of some everyday essentials. Consider storing tinned food and water.
Caracas International Airport is often affected during power failures, causing flights to be delayed or cancelled. Keep in close contact with your airline or travel agent to see if your flight is affected. Given the current situation you should allow extra time to travel to the airport.
Crime
Venezuela has one of the highest murder rates in the world. Armed robbery, mugging, carjacking and burglary are all very common and often accompanied by extreme violence. Do not resist an attacker. Remain alert and avoid displaying electronics or valuables while on the street or in a vehicle.
Private security services are becoming standard for business and official visitors and residents. Armoured vehicles are commonly used in Caracas, especially after dark and for transport to and from the airport.
Avoid public transport. A number of robberies at gunpoint have taken place on the Caracas metro. There are regular reports of passengers being robbed on public buses.
Use pre-booked taxis only. Hotels will normally book a taxi from a reputable company or supply their own service.
Laws and cultural differences
Personal ID
Always carry identification with you. You can carry copies of the photo page of your passport and your entry stamp. Keep your passport in a safe place where you can access it quickly if you need to. Local security forces may ask you to show ID at any time, particularly at police checkpoints. If you cannot produce it, you could be arrested and detained pending an investigation.
Illegal drugs and prison sentences
Drug trafficking is a serious crime in Venezuela. Detection methods are sophisticated, and drug traffickers should expect to be arrested. Conviction leads to a lengthy prison sentence of between 8 and 15 years. Conditions in Venezuelan jails are harsh, dangerous, and among the worst in the region.
Using cameras and binoculars in secure areas
It is illegal to photograph military or strategic installations, including military airports and the presidential palace. Avoid plane spotting.
Networks and internet
Internet service is generally slow as high speed connections are not widely available. Mobile network operators run modern 4G (LTE) networks in most major cities, while they also operate slower legacy 3G (WCDMA) networks for their nationwide voice and data services.
Power cuts can affect mobile signals and internet across the whole country, including Caracas. Keep in contact with your airline or travel agent as flights can be delayed or cancelled when there are power cuts.   
LGBT+ travellers
Same-sex relationships are not illegal. However, showing affection in public will most likely be frowned on by locals and may receive negative attention from the police and other security forces. Venezuelan law does not recognise same-sex partnerships, so same-sex partners have no rights as next of kin.
Read more advice for LGBT+ travellers.
Age of consent
The age of consent in Venezuela is 18 and sex with anyone 17 and under is illegal. Offenders face long jail sentences.
Outdoor activities
Swimming safety
The waters of the Caribbean can be deceptive. There are strong currents and undertows in some areas that can make swimming hazardous. Lifeguards and warnings are not normally in place.
See water safety on holiday from the Royal Life Saving Society.
Transport risks     
Travelling to and from Maiquetia Airport, Caracas
Be especially vigilant around Maiquetia airport as this is a known hotspot for criminal activity, from low-level pickpocketing to armed robberies. You could be targeted at the arrival or departure terminals, at the airport’s car park and during travel to or from the airport. If you show signs of wealth this could lead to targeting by criminals. 
You are at most risk when travelling to and from the airport at night. There have been armed robberies on buses on this route. Ideally, arrange for friends, business contacts or your tour operator to meet you at the airport. If that’s not possible, consider travelling by licensed taxi from the official taxi rank outside the arrivals hall. Do not accept offers of transport in the arrivals hall and do not get into a taxi if there are passengers already in the car. 
The National Guard carries out random drug and security checks at Maiquetia Airport, particularly on departure. Departing passengers are sometimes asked to accompany an officer to a local hospital for an X-ray. Beware of fake security officials. If you’re in any doubt ask other airline or airport staff.
Road travel
If you are planning to drive a hire car or a UK vehicle, see information on driving abroad.
You can use a UK photocard driving licence to drive in Venezuela for up to one year, and after that you will need a Venezuelan driving licence. If you still have a paper driving licence, you may need to update it to a photocard licence or get the correct version of the international driving permit (IDP) as well.
Heavy rains and lack of maintenance can affect road conditions. Get local advice about your route before you set out, leave plenty of time for your journey and keep to the main roads. Avoid travelling after dark. All vehicles must carry a spare tyre, wheel block, jack and reflector triangle.
Fuel shortages are common across all parts of the country. You must pay a set amount of US dollars for the amount of fuel you need, rather than simply filling up the tank. Pay the correct price, as petrol stations do not usually give any change. You should check the local situation ahead of any travel.
There are regular police and National Guard checkpoints throughout the country. Drive slowly through these and stop if asked. There have been reports of attempts by the police and National Guard to extract bribes for traffic offences, so ask for a written record giving details of the offence and the officer’s details.
Driving under the influence of alcohol is illegal but common, especially at weekends. Many vehicles are in poor condition and drivers routinely ignore red lights.
If you’re in a traffic accident, you must stay at the scene until the traffic police arrive. Police can seize your vehicle if you cannot show them your insurance documents, driving licence and passport. You can show a copy of your passport as long as you can show both the photo page and the entry stamp. Insurance companies will not pay claims on vehicles that have been moved without a police accident report.
Air travel
Flights between Venezuela and Panama, the Dominican Republic and Peru have been suspended. The land border with Colombia is closed and flights between Venezuela and Colombia have been suspended for 72 hours until 13 January 2025. Contact your airline or travel agent/tour operator if your flight is affected.
The UK Air Safety List (ASL) lists all known airlines in Venezuela that do not meet international safety standards and are banned from operating commercial air services to and from the UK. Check the ASL when considering which airlines to fly with. The list is maintained by the Department for Transport, based on advice from the UK Civil Aviation Authority. The UK Civil Aviation Authority.
Check whether your tour operator has concerns about airlines in Venezuela.
Sea travel
There have been incidents of piracy and armed robbery in and around Venezuela’s waters, especially east of Puerto La Cruz and in waters between Venezuela and Trinidad and Tobago. 
If you’re travelling by sea, read about the regional risks at sea.
Extreme weather and natural disasters
Find out what you can do to prepare for and respond to extreme weather and natural hazards.
Hurricanes
The hurricane season runs from June to November and affects parts of northern Venezuela. Follow the weather reports on local TV and radio. You can also monitor weather updates online from the World Meteorological Organization and the US National Hurricane Center. Always follow the advice of the local authorities.
Flooding
During the rainy season from May to November there may be flooding in low-lying areas (for example, the Llanos) and in some valleys in the Andes, mainly in Merida State. There may be disruption to transport, services and infrastructure.
Earthquakes
There is a risk of earthquakes in Venezuela. These are mostly tremors but there are occasionally more serious quakes. Monitor media reports and follow the advice of the local authorities. The US Federal Emergency Management Agency website has advice about what to do before, during and after an earthquake.
