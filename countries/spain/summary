The FCDO advises against all but essential travel to:
Spain, including the Balearic Islands but excluding the Canary Islands, based on the current assessment of COVID-19 risks.
The requirement to self-isolate on return to the UK from the Canary Islands was lifted on 25 October. You must still self-isolate if returning to the UK from any other part of Spain. Some exemptions apply. Check the latest guidance for England, Northern Ireland, Scotland and Wales.
Travel is subject to entry restrictions
On arrival, travellers entering Spain from the UK will not be required to self-isolate. However, from 23 November, all passengers (including children) travelling to Spanish airports and ports from ‘risk’ countries (the website is in Spanish, the list of ‘at risk’ countries is at the end of the document), as determined by the European Centre for Disease Prevention & Control will be required to present a negative PCR (swab) test taken within no more than 72 hours prior to arrival, in order to enter the country. The UK is currently on the ‘risk’ countries list and passengers arriving from the UK are therefore subject to this requirement.
You should not use the NHS testing service to get a test in order to facilitate your travel to another country. You should arrange to take a private test.
You will also be subject to the additional three requirements at the point of entry:
it is mandatory for all passengers travelling by air or sea to Spain to fill out and sign an online Health Control Form 48 hours prior to travel, providing the Spanish Ministry of Health with:
contact information;
details of any known history of exposure to COVID-19; and
confirmation that you are able to provide evidence (electronically or hardcopy) that you have undertaken a PCR (swab) test within 72 hours of arrival and have tested negative for COVID-19.
You can do this on the Spain Travel Health website or downloadable app. On completion, you will be issued a personal and non-transferable QR code which you must show (electronically or hardcopy) at airport health controls on arrival.
temperature check
undergo a visual health assessment
Overland travellers to Spain are exempt from the abovementioned entry requirements and are therefore not currently required to present a PCR test or Health Control Form on entry by road or rail.
Travellers to the Canary Islands will need to provide a negative COVID-19 test when checking-in to regulated tourist accommodation.
See Entry requirements for more information before you plan to travel.
