Given the rise of the number of cases of coronavirus (COVID-19) the Government of Liberia has announced the suspension of all commercial flights (except cargo, charter and special flights) for 21 days, effective 23:59 GMT 23 March. Currently there are no scheduled passenger services to Liberia. Special charter flights are allowed with prior permission; cargo flights are still permitted.
Currently all land borders (with Sierra Leone, Guinea and Côte d’Ivoire) are closed to travellers.
Future options
The British Embassy is in contact with airlines and local authorities to ensure British people can return to the UK from Liberia as soon as possible.
Whilst we have no information regarding options to return to the UK at this stage, we are collecting details of British nationals in Liberia who wish to do so. If you want to let us know that you wish to return to the UK you should email us at Monrovia.GeneralEnquiries@fco.gov.uk with the following information:
full names of British nationals interested in returning to UK

You will need to pay for your return travel to the UK. If departure options are available but you cannot afford the travel costs and have exhausted all other options for getting funds, you may be eligible to apply for an emergency loan from the government. This is a last resort option and you would need to repay the loan when you are back in the UK. For more information, you should contact Corporate Travel Management (CTM). CTM are a commercial partner of the FCO and are authorised to administer such loans on behalf of the FCO.
