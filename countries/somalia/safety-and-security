Crime
There is a dangerous level of criminal activity by armed militia throughout Somalia. There have been murders, armed robbery and a number of incidents of kidnapping. There is ongoing serious violence between opposing factions in many parts of the country. Civilians of all ages have been killed in fighting, which often involves heavy weapons.
Local travel
British government officials serving in Somalia live and work under strict security rules. All British officials live in secure, guarded accommodation and travel with close protection teams at all times.
Humanitarian needs are great in Somalia, with over 5.4 million people in need of assistance. Displaced people living in settlements and other vulnerable groups will remain ‘food insecure’.
The displacement and overpopulated refugee camps may lead to a significant increase in disease, increased risk of crime over food security and a heightened security threat to foreigners.
Localised political disputes in Somaliland means there is a risk of protests at short notice. Sporadic protests may take place across Somaliland, including in Hargeisa. You should exercise a heightened level of vigilance and take care in public places where people gather. Monitor local and international media to avoid any demonstration, rally, large crowds or disturbance taking place. Leave any area of unrest quickly and don’t attempt to watch or photograph it.
Political and community-based violence
Political and community-based violence is commonplace across Somalia and can flare up with little warning. There was fighting between pro-government and opposition forces in Baidoa, South West State, in December 2022. More recently, violence broke out in Garowe, Puntland State, between pro-government and opposition forces in June 2023.
On 11 August 2023, violent clashes occurred between the clan militia based in the Ga’an Libah Mountain and the Somaliland Security Forces in Go’da Yar near the mountain. On 9 August, the clan militia carried out activities in Dabagorayaale, close to Oodweyne town. Protests also took place in Burco and Erigavo.
Renewed violence broke out between the Somaliland army and clan militias in Las Anod, Sool Region, on 6 February 2023 and is ongoing. This follows a series of violent clashes and protests in the area since December 2022. The FCDO advises against all travel to the regions of Toghdeer, Sanaag, and Sool. If you do travel the situation remains volatile, you should exercise extreme caution.
Border areas
Land borders with countries neighbouring Somalia may close at short notice. You should check with local authorities before travelling to the border. You should also monitor Travel Advice for Ethiopia, Kenya or Djibouti. You should not cross the border without the correct documents. You may face a large fine or detention for illegally crossing borders and you may be prevented from onward travel.
Sea travel
There is a continued threat of maritime crime in the territorial waters and international waters off Somalia. Piracy has been suppressed but not eradicated.
The combined threat assessment of the international Naval Counter Piracy Forces remains that all sailing yachts under their own passage should remain out of the designated High Risk Area for their own safety. The Southern Red Sea area also is a hotspot for maritime crime and security incidents. For more information and advice, see our Piracy and armed robbery at sea page.
