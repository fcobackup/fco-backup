Travel is subject to severe entry restrictions
The authorities have announced a temporary ban on foreign nationals entering, or transiting, Taiwan, with the exception of residents. These measures will be effective from 19 May until 18 June and will be adjusted on a rolling basis depending on the latest COVID-19 situation. Exceptions may be made for emergency or humanitarian reasons. Anyone entering Taiwan will be required to follow the quarantine requirements set out below.
Starting from 10 April 2021, all passengers arriving directly from the UK, or those who have been in the UK in the previous 14 days, will no longer be required to complete their mandatory 14 day quarantine at a designated quarantine centre in Taiwan. These travellers instead will be permitted to complete their 14 day quarantine at either a designated quarantine hotel, or follow the one person per residence requirement to complete the mandatory quarantine period at their residential property.
Foreign nationals entering Taiwan must provide a negative COVID-19 test report completed in the three working days prior to boarding their flight.
There are currently limited direct flights between Taiwan and the UK.
Travellers from destinations designated as low risk by local authorities may be eligible for a reduced self-isolation period.
