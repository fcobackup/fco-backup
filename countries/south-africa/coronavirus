International travel
International commercial air travel to South Africa has resumed, but strict health protocols are in place. You will be required to produce a paper copy of a negative PCR (polymerase chain reaction) test upon arrival in South Africa. The test must have taken place no more than 72 hours before your departure. You should carry several paper copies of your test, as you may need to present it at different points on your journey. If you do not present proof of a test upon arrival, you may be required to quarantine in a government quarantine facility at your own cost. See Entry requirements
Entry and borders
See Entry requirements to find out what you will need to do before and when you arrive in South Africa.
Travel in South Africa
Some internal flights are operating.
You must wear a mask if using public transport, which is operating with strict hygiene requirements and reduced passenger numbers.
You are required to wear a cloth face mask when in public. Children aged 24 months or younger are not required to wear a face mask due to the associated risks. However, children aged two to five years should be encouraged to wear a face mask while in public.
Failure to comply with South African government regulations could result in a fine or arrest.
Accommodation
Hotels, guest houses and private rental accommodation are allowed to open subject to government regulations. Upon arrival at your accommodation, you will normally be subjected to a temperature test and asked to declare that you do not have coronavirus symptoms. Some accommodation providers will request your travel history. You should contact your accommodation provider for more information.
Public spaces and services
The South African authorities have published COVID-19 guidelines and advice and have introduced a number of measures to limit the spread of the virus. Failure to comply could result in a fine or arrest.
South Africa has introduced a risk-based, five-level approach to lockdown restrictions. The whole of South Africa is currently under level one restrictions, which are the lowest tier. The government reserves the right to introduce different restrictions in provinces and districts affected by coronavirus. You may wish to check with the local authorities before you travel.
There is a countrywide curfew between midnight and 4am.
Beaches and public parks are now open, but are subject to strict health protocols. There are strict rules regarding gatherings of people.
You should comply with any regulations set out by the South African government during the lockdown. See details on guidelines and relief.
Healthcare in South Africa
If you take regular medication, make sure you can access a repeat prescription in the event of travel delays. Most medicines that require a prescription from a doctor in the UK will require one in South Africa. If necessary, you should obtain an electronic prescription from your medical practitioner in the UK to enable a local doctor to write a script (‘script’ is the widely used term in South Africa for ‘prescription’).
Private hospitals in South Africa are prepared to treat COVID-19, and the standard of care may be higher than in government hospitals. Our experience suggests that only people who are showing symptoms of COVID-19 are able to get a test, at both private and public healthcare facilities.

If you think you have COVID-19 symptoms, you should contact your health insurer for advice. You can also call the South African government local emergency hotline (0800029 999) or consult the online advice.
