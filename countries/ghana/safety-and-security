Political situation
Demonstrations in the capital Accra are normally well policed and peaceful, but sometimes they occur at short notice and can cause disruption. See Local travel.
Crime
Most visits to Ghana are trouble free, but criminal activity does occur and can range from incidents of petty crime to violent crime. There was an increase in robbery, burglary and serious assault in 2021, and such attacks can include the use of weapons. There have been cases of violent robberies involving foreign nationals who have been attacked and robbed at gun-point. Street crime like pick-pocketing and bag snatching is on the increase in Accra. Take sensible precautions. Avoid carrying large sums of money or valuables, use a hotel safe whenever possible and be particularly vigilant when withdrawing cash from ATMs. Be particularly vigilant at night (after 6:30pm), and avoid travelling alone.
Attacks on passengers in vehicles are also on the increase. Take particular care when stationary. Keep windows up and doors locked. Some of these attacks on vehicles also involve the use of weapons. A British national died in one such attack in August 2021. Make long trips during daylight hours, travel in convoys, and seek advice from local police before travelling along long sections of open road (see Road travel). Local police also highlight the risk of attacks on vehicles when driving the Tamale-Wa road, at any time of day.
Take care at public beaches and avoid going to the beach on your own. Theft is the main problem, but there have been isolated incidents of violent crime and sexual assault in areas popular with tourists.
Theft of luggage and travel documents occurs at Kotoka International Airport and in hotels. Make sure your passport is secure at all times and don’t leave baggage unattended. Be wary of offers of help at the airport unless from uniformed porters or officials. All permanent staff at the airport wear an ID card showing their name and a photo. ID cards without a photo are not valid. If you are being collected at the airport, confirm the identity of your driver by asking for ID. British nationals have been robbed by impostors who have approached them before the main arrivals area pretending to be their driver.
The main locations of risk in Greater Accra highlighted by the police are: Graphic Road, George Walker Bush Highway, Accra Mall Roundabout, Awudome Cemetary Road, Pokuase-Amasaman Road, Teshie-Nungua road, Labadi beach area, GIMPA road and surrounding areas, and the Kokrobite beach area. You should be especially vigilant in these locations.
Make sure you lock windows and secure accommodation both at night and before you go out. There have been cases of burglaries in areas used by the international community, including Airport Residential, Cantonments, Ridge and Kokrobite, with increased frequency over the Christmas period.
There have been reports in the media of criminally-motivated kidnapping in Accra, Takoradi, and Kumasi, including the targeting of foreign nationals. Kidnaps can be for financial or political gain, or can be motivated by criminality. If you’re kidnapped, the reason for your presence in Ghana is unlikely to serve as a protection or secure your safe release.
The long-standing policy of the British government is not to make substantive concessions to hostage takers. The British government considers that paying ransoms and releasing prisoners increases the risk of further hostage-taking.
Scams
British nationals are increasingly being targeted by scam artists operating in West Africa. The scams come in many forms - romance and friendship, business ventures, work and employment opportunities, and can pose great financial risk to victims. You should treat with considerable caution any requests for funds, a job offer, a business venture or a face to face meeting from someone you have been in correspondence with over the internet who lives in West Africa.
If you or your relatives or friends are asked to transfer money to Ghana you should make sure that it is not part of a scam and that you have properly checked with the person receiving the money that they are requesting it. If the caller claims to be in distress, you should ask whether they have reported the incident (by phone or e-mail) to the British High Commission in Accra.
If you have sent money to someone you believe has scammed you and are contacted by a police officer for more money to help get your money back, then this is possibly another part of the scam. Scam artists have also been known to use the identity of officials at the British High Commission in Accra. If you receive an email from someone claiming to be an official at the British High Commission, contact the officer using the phone numbers or contact details for the British High Commission.
Local travel
As a result of occasional local Chieftaincy, land disputes and political tension, isolated inter-ethnic violence and civil unrest can occur at any time across Ghana.
Localised outbreaks of civil unrest can occur at short notice, and can become violent (sometimes involving weapons). Avoid large crowds and political protests. If you’re in these areas, you should remain vigilant, exercise caution and follow the advice of local authorities. If this does happen, local police may impose curfews to contain the situation. Curfews usually run from 7pm to 5am but these times can vary. The Interior Ministry may put out a press release.
There is an increased Ghanaian military presence in Upper East to strengthen security, centred around Bawku. An 8pm to 5 am curfew was introduced in Bawku on 5 January and motorbikes and smocks have been banned. Travellers should expect more frequent security cordons, and be prepared to show identification for themselves and their drivers. If you need to travel to Bawku and the surrounding area you should take extra care and carefully check media and Government of Ghana updates on the situation before you travel. You should contact the regional Police Headquarters in Bolgatanga town should you require further advice on the latest situation and to discuss your plans to visit the Bawku area.
You should be prepared for the security response to change without notice and follow the advice of local authorities.
Flooding is common in the Upper West, North East, Northern and Savannah regions during the rainy season (March to November). You should monitor local weather reports and expect difficulties when travelling to affected areas during this season.
If you are transiting through Burkina Faso, read the Burkina Faso travel advice.
In an emergency, visitors should contact Police on 191, and follow the advice of emergency services.
Road travel
You can drive in Ghana using an International Driving Permit or a local driving licence. A UK driving licence is not valid. If you’re applying for a local driving licence from the Ghana DVLA, you must get your UK driving licence authenticated by the UK DVLA. You should carry your driving licence or International Driving Permit with you at all times when driving. An International Driving Permit is usually valid for a year and it cannot be renewed in Ghana.
Roads can be in a poor condition, particularly in rural areas. Street lighting is poor or non-existent. Avoid travelling by road outside the main towns after dark, when the risk of serious road accidents is much greater, and there is a heightened risk of attacks on vehicles (see Crime section). Grass or leaves strewn in the road often means an accident or other hazard ahead. If you choose to drive at night be aware of impromptu police checkpoints. Do not give cash to the police.
Safety standards of taxi services in Ghana are often low. There have also been isolated incidents of crime taking place in all types of taxis (including licensed taxis, ‘Tro Tros’ and app-based taxi services). If you travel by taxi, we recommend you use licensed taxis only, making sure to check driver IDs and the vehicle condition before you travel. Avoid travelling alone in taxis after dark.
Unlike official taxis, drivers of ‘Tro-Tros’ and popular app-based taxi services are not centrally licensed. Driver training and vehicles standards will vary from those expected from similar service providers in the UK, and app-based safety features are rarely monitored centrally. Don’t use ‘Tro-Tros’ outside the major towns and cities.
Air travel
The FCDO can’t offer advice on the safety of individual airlines. However, the International Air Transport Association publishes a list of registered airlines that have been audited and found to meet a number of operational safety standards and recommended practices. This list is not exhaustive and the absence of an airline from this list does not necessarily mean that it is unsafe.
A list of recent incidents and accidents can be found on the website of the Aviation Safety network.
In 2006 the International Civil Aviation Organisation carried out an audit of the level of implementation of the critical elements of safety oversight in Ghana.
Sea travel
There have been attacks against ships in and around Accra’s waters. Be vigilant and take appropriate precautions.
Swimming
Swimming is dangerous on the beaches along the southern coast of Ghana due to rip tides and undertows. There are periodic reports of fatalities, including adults and children.
