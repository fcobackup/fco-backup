Coronavirus guidance is being updated.
Read what you can and cannot do

Flights in and out of the country have been suspended, and land and sea borders are closed. The Government of Jordan has confirmed that these measures will remain in place until 25 May, and there are strong indications that the flight suspension and border closures will continue beyond this date.
Some commercial operators have been able, in exceptional cases, to negotiate flights out of Jordan. Booking for a Royal Jordanian flight from Amman to London on 15 May has now closed.
Future travel options
There are currently no commercial options available to return to the UK from Jordan.
In the event that flights become available, the British Embassy will do all it can to facilitate access to flights for British nationals and provide appropriate support in arranging your departure. In the case of flights departing to a third country, you will need to ensure that onward travel to the UK from the flightâ€™s destination is possible.
This travel advice will be updated if and when departure options become available. Sign up for travel advice email alerts and check travel advice for any country that you will transit on the way back to the UK.
If you cannot leave Jordan at this time, see advice on staying in Jordan during coronavirus.
You will need to pay for your return travel to the UK. If departure options are available but you cannot afford the travel costs and have exhausted all other options for getting funds, you may be eligible to apply for an emergency loan from the government. This is a last resort option and you would need to repay the loan when you are back in the UK. For more information, contact Corporate Travel Management (CTM). CTM are a commercial partner of the FCO and are authorised to administer such loans on behalf of the FCO.
