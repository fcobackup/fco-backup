If you’re planning travel to the Democratic Republic of Congo, find out what you need to know about coronavirus there in the Coronavirus section.
During the COVID-19 pandemic, it is more important than ever to get travel insurance and check it provides sufficient cover. See the FCO’s guidance on foreign travel insurance.
There are currently no further UK special flights organised from DRC.
Given the rapidly changing situation in DRC we have temporarily withdrawn a limited number of UK staff and their dependants from our Embassy. The Embassy will continue to carry out essential work including providing 24/7 consular assistance and support to British people in DRC.
Public gatherings and demonstrations can occur with little or no notice and can quickly turn violent. You should follow local media for updates. In all instances, you should remain vigilant and be aware of disruptions to journeys. If a demonstration or disturbance takes place, leave quickly and don’t attempt to watch or photograph it.
The security situation in eastern DRC remains unstable. The continued presence of armed groups, military operations against them, intercommunal violence and an influx of refugees from neighbouring countries all contribute to a deterioration in the security and humanitarian situation. There are continued reports of attacks and kidnappings. NGO staff and Ebola response workers have been known to be targeted. See Safety and security
Consular support is severely limited in parts of DRC. The lack of infrastructure throughout the country and insecurity in eastern DRC often prevent the British Embassy in Kinshasa from being able to extend normal levels of consular assistance to British nationals anywhere in the DRC other than Kinshasa. You should not assume that the FCO will be able to provide assistance to leave the country in the event of serious unrest or crisis.
On 1 June 2020, the Government of DRC confirmed cases of Ebola in Equateur Province. A separate outbreak of Ebola in Eastern DRC was declared over on 25 June 2020. If you are in these areas you should take precautions to minimise your risk of exposure. Further advice is available on the World Health Organisation website. Public Health England’s Returning Workers Scheme provides guidance for British nationals who will be returning to the UK from areas affected by the outbreak. See Health
Street crime and robbery is common. You should avoid using any taxis in DRC. If you must take a taxi, use a privately booked one. Don’t hail taxis in the street. Beware of gangs promising you cut price gold and diamonds. See Crime
Terrorists are likely to try to carry out attacks in the DRC. Attacks could be indiscriminate. You should be vigilant, especially in places visited by foreigners. See Terrorism
If you’re abroad and you need emergency help from the UK government, contact the nearest British embassy, consulate or high commission.
