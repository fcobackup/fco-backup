Terrorists are very likely to try to carry out attacks in France.
UK Counter Terrorism Policing has information and advice on staying safe abroad and what to do in the event of a terrorist attack. Find out more about the global threat from terrorism.
Attacks could be indiscriminate. Due to ongoing threats to France by Islamist terrorist groups, and recent French military intervention against Daesh (formerly referred to as ISIL), the French government has warned the public to be extra vigilant and has reinforced its own domestic and overseas security measures. You should be vigilant in public places and follow the advice of local French authorities.
There have been a number of high profile terrorist attacks since 2015 across France, including:
On 11 December 2018, a man attacked civilians with a revolver and a knife at a Christmas market in Strasbourg, killing 5 and wounding 11.
On 14 July 2016, 84 people were killed when a truck was driven through a crowd of people on the promenade in Nice.
On 13 November 2015, terrorist attacks at multiple sites across Paris killed 130 and injured hundreds more.
There’s a heightened threat of terrorist attack globally against UK interests and British nationals from groups or individuals motivated by the conflict in Iraq and Syria. You should be vigilant at this time.
