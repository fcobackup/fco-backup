This travel advice covers Israel and the Occupied Palestinian Territories
FCDO advises against all but essential travel to Israel and the Occupied Palestinian Territories, and against all travel to the following locations:
Gaza
within 5km of the border with Lebanon. The Israeli military has announced that the area is a closed military zone and entry into the area is prohibited
the Sheba’a Farms and Ghajjar

Your travel insurance could be invalidated if you travel against FCDO advice. Consular support is also severely limited where FCDO advises against travel.
Register your presence
If you are in Israel and the Occupied Palestinian Territories, including Gaza, you are advised to register your presence with the FCDO. We can then share important updates, including information to support you to leave the country. Fill in the form for every member of your family or group who is a British national.
Conflict in Israel and the Occupied Palestinian Territories
There was a large scale terrorist attack by Hamas in southern Israel. Hamas continues to launch rockets into Israel. There are Israeli air strikes into Gaza.
The Israeli military announced on the morning of 13 October that the entire population of Gaza north of Wadi Gaza should relocate to southern Gaza within the next 24 hours.
We advise following this advice issued by the Israeli authorities. We recognise this a fast-moving situation that poses significant risks.
Events in Israel/OPTs are fast moving and the situation has potential to deteriorate quickly and without warning. This could disrupt air and road links out of the country. If your reason to remain in Israel is not essential you should consider leaving if it is safe to do so. Given the disruptions to commercial flights, the British Government is assisting British nationals to return to the United Kingdom - see further information below.
If you are in an area affected by the fighting, follow the instructions of Israeli Home Front Command. To find these:
visit the Israeli Home Front Command website (available in Israel only)
call 104 if you are in Israel
The Israeli government has declared a state of emergency across the whole country. International borders (air and land) in Israel and the Occupied Palestinian Territories (OPTs) could close at short notice. You should check our Travel Advice for any neighbouring country that you are planning to travel to or through.
Before travelling within Israel/OPTs you should check the local measures in place, that roads are open and, where appropriate, that scheduled train and bus services are operating before you travel.
Due to the security situation, some family members of staff at the British embassy in Tel Aviv and British Consulate in Jerusalem have been temporarily withdrawn. The Embassy and Consulate continue with essential work including services to British nationals
Monitor this travel advice and other media as the situation is changing fast. Follow and contact FCDO travel on Twitter, Facebook and Instagram. You can also get email notifications when this travel advice is updated.

Assisted departure
The UK government is facilitating commercial flights from Ben Gurion in Tel Aviv to the UK to help British nationals wanting to leave Israel following the Hamas attack. The booking portal for flights will close at 1000 UK time/midday Israel time on 18 October; any British national wishing to depart on an HMG assisted flight should make a booking before this time.
Travel within or out of Israel is at your own risk.  You are encouraged to follow the advice of local authorities, for example on which routes are open or when to take shelter, and monitor this Travel Advice, which is regularly updated. Register your presence to receive important updates, including information on support to leave the country.
Travelling to Egypt from Gaza 
If you are a British national in Gaza who wants to enter Egypt, check the status of the Rafah crossing into Egypt before you travel. Movement to the Rafah crossing and beyond is at your own risk. You should only travel if you judge it is safe to do so. Check the Egypt travel advice.
