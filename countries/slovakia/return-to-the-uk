British travellers in Slovakia are allowed to leave, but international airports at Bratislava, Kosice and Poprad are closed to regular scheduled passenger flights.
A commercial charter company, Charter Advisory, is cooperating with the Slovak Ministry of Foreign Affairs to enable Slovak nationals in the UK to return to Slovakia. They have offered seats for sale to UK nationals to depart Slovakia. Please note these are NOT UK government organised flights, and all arrangements are between passengers and the company concerned. Please note the conditions of carriage carefully. It is the operator which decides who boards and who is eligible. Anyone travelling must have appropriate and valid identity documents for the UK. We understand that seats on the flights are offered on a “first come, first served” basis. Announcements about future flights are on the company facebook page (in Czech only). The Embassy will post updates on our social media when flight details are known.
International rail and bus services have also ceased. Taxis are no longer permitted to carry passengers.
Exit via road to Austria is currently permitted but this may change at short notice. There are restrictions on entry for most British nationals at the borders with Poland, Hungary, Czech Republic and Ukraine.
The situation may change rapidly, including in neighbouring countries. Keep up to date with travel advice for all countries you plan to travel through.
