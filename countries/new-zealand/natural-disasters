New Zealand is located in a seismic zone and is subject to earthquakes. Tsunamis may occur along the coastlines. There are also a number of active volcanoes in New Zealand. Flooding and landslides can occur, resulting in road closures and infrastructure damage. Follow the advice of the local authorities and emergency services in the event of a natural disaster.
As part of your own contingency plans, you should make sure you have easy access to your passport and other important documents such as nationality documents and birth and marriage certificates, as well as any essential medication. You can read our crisis overseas page for further information and advice, including sections on what you can do to prepare effectively, what you should do in the event of a crisis abroad, and how we can help you. You can also find specific information on how to prepare for and react to a natural disaster. To learn more see the National Emergency Management Agency and Get Ready websites.
Earthquakes and tsunamis
As New Zealand is in a major earthquake zone you should familiarise yourself with safety procedures in the event of an earthquake or tsunami, and take note of instructions in hotel rooms, public areas and on your local emergency services social media pages. Information on earthquakes and any impact on towns and cities in New Zealand, including tsunami warnings are published by the Civil Defence, National Emergency Management Agency (NEMA).
To learn more about what to do before, during and after an earthquake, see the Get Ready Get Thru website. Local Civil Defence Emergency Management Groups have tsunami evacuation zone maps and advice. Make sure you know where to go, whether you are at home, at work or out and about.
