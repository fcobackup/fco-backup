Outdoor activities and adventure tourism
Hiking, mountaineering and other adventure sports have specific risks.
You should:
read the Safe Travel Iceland guides
leave travel plans and contact details with your hotel, or on Safe Travel Iceland
take a phone with you
Going too close to the ocean, cliff edges and hot springs are common causes of accidents in Iceland.
Hiking and mountaineering
When hiking, choose a trail suited for your level of experience. Conditions in Iceland could be different to what you’re used to.
Take enough food, equipment, clothing and emergency rations for the worst-case scenario. Use a map, compass, GPS and phone.
Transport risks
Road travel
If you are planning to drive in Iceland, please see information on driving abroad and read the RAC Iceland guide.
You must:
obey speed limits – fines for speeding are high
keep dipped headlights on all the time – you could get a fine if you do not
follow drink-drive laws – alcohol limits are much stricter than in the UK
use winter tyres from 1 November to 15 April – exact dates can vary
You could get a fine for using studded tyres after 15 April (20,000 krona per tyre), unless there are exceptional circumstances.
Distances between towns can be large, roads are narrow and winding, and speed limits are low. On gravel and loose surfaces reduce your speed.
Check road and weather advice from the Icelandic Road Administration. They also have information on off-road driving, which is strictly controlled.
Many highland tracks are only open for a short part of the summer. In the highlands you should use a 4-wheel drive vehicle. Drive slowly (5 to 10 kilometres per hour) when you cross rivers. River levels can change quickly, even within the same day.
The weather can change quickly. Infrequent strong winds can cause sand and ash storms. British tourists have had to pay large amounts of money to repair damage to hire cars caused by sand and ash.
Breakdown recovery costs, especially in remote areas, can be high.
Licences and permits
You need either a 1968 international driving permit (IDP) or a valid UK driving licence to drive in Iceland. The 1949 IDP is not accepted anymore. You cannot buy an IDP outside the UK, so get one before you travel. You can buy an IDP in person from some UK post offices – find your nearest post office branch that offers this service.
Driving a British car abroad
You may need a UK sticker to drive your car outside the UK. Since 2021, UK stickers have replaced GB stickers. Check the government guidance on displaying number plates for more information on what to do if you are driving outside the UK.
