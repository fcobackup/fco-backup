The FCDO advises against all but essential travel to:
the whole of Guadeloupe based on the current assessment of COVID-19 risks.
If you are returning to the UK from Guadeloupe, you will need to self-isolate on your return (unless you are exempt). Check the latest guidance for England, Northern Ireland, Scotland and Wales.
Travel is subject to entry restrictions
Entry into Guadeloupe is restricted at present. For further information, see the local Prefecture website.
Travellers entering Guadeloupe will have to produce a negative result of a PCR test carried out less than 72 hours before departure. Arrivals to Guadeloupe will be required to self-isolate for seven days, before taking another PCR test.
Travellers may also need to produce a self-certified document affirming that they have no COVID symptoms and that to their knowledge they have not been in contact with any person confirmed positive within the last 14 days.
These entry requirements are subject to change. For further information on the entry restrictions in place for French Overseas Territories, see the French government’s website before travelling.
Preparing for your return journey to the UK
If you’re returning to the UK from overseas, you will need to:

check if you need to self-isolate on your return
If your return journey to the UK transits another country, you should check whether it is subject to a travel ban or any other additional requirements. If so, contact your travel provider.
