Travelling from and returning to the UK
Check what you must do to travel abroad and return to England, Scotland, Wales or Northern Ireland.
If you plan to pass through another country to return to the UK, check the travel advice for the country you’re transiting.
If you are unable to return to the UK before the expiry of your visa/permit or visa-free limit due to C-19 restrictions, you should contact your local immigration office (Extranjería) for advice. You can also call 060 from a Spanish phone line.
Be prepared for your plans to change
No travel is risk-free during COVID. Countries may further restrict travel or bring in new rules at short notice, for example due to a new COVID-19 variant. Check with your travel company or airline for any transport changes which may delay your journey home.
If you test positive for COVID-19, you may need to stay where you are until you test negative. You may also need to seek treatment there.
Plan ahead and make sure you:
can access money
understand what your insurance will cover
can make arrangements to extend your stay and be away for longer than planned
Travel in Spain
You should follow the advice of the local authorities on how best to protect yourself and others, including any measures that they bring in to control the virus.
Public health measures to reduce the transmission of COVID-19 remain in force across Spain and may vary between regions. Handwashing hygiene, air ventilation rules and the use of face masks both indoors and at some large outdoor events, must continue to be observed at all times. See Use of face masks and Public spaces and services for further information.
Regional governments retain legal powers to ease or tighten restrictions within their region if deemed necessary to control the spread of the virus (e.g. partial lockdowns; limiting the capacity and opening hours of retail, hospitality establishments and public events, COVID passports).
Local and regional restrictions may be introduced at short notice. You should consult regional incidence levels, refer to the advice of local authorities in your destination and ensure you are aware of the specific measures in place prior to travel.
Road travel
Land borders are open.
The Spanish government has implemented health requirements for those travelling overland from France into Spain by road or rail. See Entry requirements for details.
If you are planning to travel through France or Portugal, please check the latest FCDO travel advice for France and FCDO travel advice for Portugal ahead of your journey.
Inter-regional travel may be restricted if your point of origin and destination fall within a confined area where entry and exit restrictions are in place. You should check the advice of local authorities in your destination prior to travel.
Transiting confined areas is permitted; however, you should be prepared to show evidence of your onward journey such as train or flight tickets to your final destination.
If travelling with people who are not from the same household, all passengers must wear a face mask covering the nose and mouth. Penalties may be imposed if you do not comply. See Use of face-masks.
Public spaces and services
Social distancing measures and other public safety precautions should continue to be observed at all times.
You must continue to observe the following rules regardless of your whereabouts in Spain:
social distancing of 1.5 metres
obligatory use of face masks in enclosed public spaces and at some large outdoor events (see Use of facemasks)
abide by any safety measures put in place by establishments such as hotels, bars, shops and restaurants to reduce the risk of COVID-19
wash your hands frequently and thoroughly and use hand sanitizer gel where soap and water is not available
Rules may vary between regions. You should refer to local and regional authorities for advice.
Spain will accept the UK’s COVID-19 vaccination record. If you are travelling with a printed PDF proof of vaccination status, it must date from 1 November to ensure that the certificate can be scanned successfully, if domestic certification is required. Your NHS appointment card from vaccination centres is not designed to be used as proof of vaccination and should not be used to demonstrate your vaccine status.
Use of face masks
The use of face coverings is mandatory for anyone over the age of 6 years old on all forms of public transport in Spain and in many other indoor public spaces. Face masks are also mandatory at large, open air, standing events and seated events where social distancing of 1.5m cannot be observed. There are no other requirements to wear face masks outdoors.
You should carry a face mask with you at all times and be prepared to wear it during your stay. Face masks must cover the nose and mouth.
While not mandatory, the use of face masks on children between 3 and 5 years of age is recommended.
As specific rules on the use of face masks may vary from one region to the next, you should refer to local authorities for advice. Penalties may be imposed if you do not comply.
Those with respiratory problems or those unable to wear a mask due to other health conditions or disabilities are exempt. More details are available from the Ministry for Health (in Spanish).

COVID-19 vaccines if you live in Spain
Wherever possible British nationals should aim to be vaccinated in the country where they live. We will update this page when the Government of Spain announces new information on the national vaccination programme. You can sign up to get email notifications when this page is updated.
The Spanish national vaccination programme started in December 2020 and is using the AstraZeneca, Janssen (Johnson and Johnson), Moderna and Pfizer-BioNTech vaccines. British nationals resident in Spain are eligible for vaccination. Spain operates its health system regionally, therefore the way people access the vaccine will differ depending on where you live. You should refer to your regional health authority for information regarding the vaccination plan in your area. If you are already registered for public healthcare you should be contacted by your regional health service to make an appointment when it is your turn to be vaccinated.
Further information is available below if you live in Spain but are not registered for public healthcare, for example, if you have private health insurance.
For more general information from the Spanish government regarding vaccines in Spain, see their vaccination strategy (only available in Spanish).
