Wearing of masks at all times outdoors
Indoor gatherings limited to five people, outdoor gatherings limited to 10 people
Some places of business and public venues are closed, with the exception of essential services, police departments, hospitals, and government buildings. The authorities have said that work places and schools will continue to operate as long as pandemic plans are in place, and flexible working is being encouraged
Masks and social distancing required at all businesses or venues that remain open
In areas where community transmission has taken place, residents are restricted to a set perimeter and must submit to COVID-19 testing
Further information is available on Taiwan’s Centres for Diseases Control website
In the rest of Taiwan face masks must be worn in the following types of public venues: healthcare facilities, public transportation, places of consumption, learning facilities, sports and exhibition venues, entertainment venues, religious and places of worship, offices and business venues.
If individuals choose to dine at the above-mentioned public venues, as long as social distancing is maintained or partitions are installed inside those locations, masks can be temporarily removed while eating.Members of the public who do not wear a face mask as required in Taiwan face fines of up to NT$15,000.
Travel in Taiwan
There are no domestic travel restrictions in Taiwan.
Travelling to and from the airport
On arrival in Taiwan, you will be required to take an allocated taxi to your designated quarantine destination. For more information about self-isolation see Entry requirements.
Taxis and public transport systems are operating normally in Taiwan. The wearing of face masks is mandatory on all public transport. If you use public transport and are not wearing a face mask, you may be fined up to NT$15,000. Be aware that some taxi drivers may refuse to take a passenger who is not wearing a face mask.
Accommodation
Any passenger arriving directly from the UK, or those who have been in the UK in the previous 14 days will be required to complete their quarantine at a designated quarantine centre. See Entry requirements for more information.
Due to an increased number of travellers now entering Taiwan, demand for the limited number of hotels permitted to host self-isolating travellers has increased, and you may find it difficult to find accommodation at short notice.
For a list of designated quarantine hotels in Taipei, please visit Taipei City Government’s FAQ page. If you are planning to stay in a hotel outside of Taipei, you may need to contact the local authority in that area prior to booking or making final arrangements. For more information and contact details, please visit the Taiwan Tourism Bureau’s ‘Taiwan Stay’ website.
If you have access to private accommodation in Taiwan, you may choose to self-isolate there rather than in a hotel. You should confirm that you will be permitted to self-isolate in your preferred accommodation before travelling.
Healthcare in Taiwan
If you are in Taiwan and believe you may have been exposed to or may have contracted coronavirus, your first point of contact should be the Taiwan Centers for Disease Control (CDC) helpline which is 1922. If you are unable to speak to anyone at the CDC you can telephone the British Office, Taipei for support.

COVID-19 vaccines if you live in Taiwan
The Taiwanese authorities have not announced any plan for foreign nationals to be vaccinated as part of their vaccine programme. As information is available about Taiwan’s vaccination programme, this page will be updated.
The Medicines and Healthcare Products Regulatory Agency (MHRA) is the UK authority responsible for assessing the safety, quality and efficacy of vaccines. It has authorised the Pfizer/BioNTech, Oxford/AstraZeneca and Moderna vaccines for temporary supply and use in the UK. Find out more about MHRA approval for these vaccines.
British nationals living overseas should seek medical advice from their local healthcare provider in the country where they reside. Information about vaccines used in other national programmes, including regulatory status, should be available from the local authorities. This list of Stringent Regulatory Authorities recognised by the World Health Organisation may also be a useful source of additional information. Find out more information about the COVID-19 vaccines on the World Health Organization COVID-19 vaccines page.
