Security situation
While most visits for British nationals are trouble-free, insecurity is increasing across Nigeria. Kidnapping, violent crime, and inter-communal violence occurs throughout all regions of Nigeria. Other threats, such as terrorism and militant groups, are heightened in specific regions. Refer to local travel below for FCDO guidance in the region you are travelling or working in.
Local travel
Gubernatorial and State Houses of Assembly will take place on 18 March 2023. During the election period there is a heightened risk of protests and violence. See ‘Protests and Demonstrations’. On election days only law enforcement personnel and Independent National Electoral Commission (INEC) accredited election observers will be allowed to drive vehicles along the roads. See ‘Road Travel’.
South West
Violent crime such as mugging, kidnapping, car-jacking and armed robberies are common, particularly in the larger cities. Large scale attacks are rare in the region but Islamic State West Africa has claimed two attacks in 2022, see terrorism for further detail. Intercommunal violence is prevalent. Whilst these attacks have not targeted foreign nationals, caution should be exercised to avoid being caught up in such incidents.
You should be vigilant at all times and take into account any security advice given by your hotel, employer or your hosts.
South East and South South
The FCDO advise against all travel to the riverine areas (ie the river and swamp locations accessible by boat, but not by road) of Delta, Bayelsa, Rivers, Akwa Ibom and Cross River States.
The FCDO advise against all but essential travel to Abia State and non-riverine areas of Delta, Bayelsa and Rivers States.
Militant groups are active across the Niger Delta region and have carried out a number of attacks on oil and gas infrastructure. There’s a high risk of armed robbery, criminality and criminal kidnap in the Niger Delta region.
There have been a number of attacks and targeted killings in the South East and South South regions of Nigeria. Some of these attacks have been on isolated roads and in remote locations, but there is a chance that they could occur in metropolitan areas. There is also a heightened risk of indiscriminate attacks on police and security infrastructure, which may inadvertently affect bystanders. A number of states have imposed curfews. Travellers to these regions are advised to exercise caution if travelling in remote areas at night and follow local news and information outlets for further information, including on local curfews.
Secessionist groups are active in the South East and attacks and violent clashes often occur with the military and other security forces. Although foreign nationals are not normally targeted, there is a risk you could be caught in an attack. You should be alert to local government announcements and media reporting.
North Central and the Federal Capital Territory, including Abuja
The FCDO advises against all but essential travel to Niger, Kogi, and Plateau States due to criminal and militant activity and incidents of inter-communal violence.
The outer suburbs of Abuja, within the Federal Capital Territory can be prone to varying levels of violence, and the safety of daily activity is unpredictable. Violent crime, often involving firearms, has also increased in recent months and has spread from the outer suburbs to more central and wealthier areas of the city.
The risk of terrorism in Abuja and the Federal Capital Territory area has increased in 2022. Islamic State West Africa (ISWA) has claimed responsibility for attacks, including an attack on Kuje Prison in the Federal Capital during which an unknown number of prisoners escaped, including suspected terrorists. The risk is present across the Federal Capital Territory, including Abuja, and particularly in the border areas of the Federal Capital Territory. For information on terrorism, see Terrorism page
You should be cautious and vigilant when travelling in the Federal Capital Territory, take advice from trusted contacts, and be prepared to cancel or curtail your plans.
There are regular protests in Abuja, which have the potential to turn violent. You should monitor local media, avoid any demonstrations or large gatherings and follow any instructions from local police and security forces.
North West
The FCDO advise against all travel to Kaduna State, Katsina State, and Zamfara State.
The FCDO advise against all but essential travel to: Kano State, Jigawa State, and Sokoto State; and within 20km of the border with Niger in Kebbi State.
Banditry and violent attacks are frequent in the region and there is a high threat of kidnap. Incidents of inter-communal violence occur and trains are vulnerable to attack. If you’re travelling in the North West against FCDO advice, you should exercise extreme caution and monitor local media.
North East
The FCDO advises against all travel to Borno State, Yobe State, Adamawa State, Gombe State.
The FCDO advises against all but essential travel to Bauchi and Taraba States.
There is a high and increasing threat from extremists linked to Boko Haram or Islamic State West Africa, particularly around transport hubs, religious areas and large gatherings. Humanitarian personnel, vehicles, supplies and infrastructure can be targeted by terrorists and criminals. For recent attacks, see Terrorism. Further attacks may occur without warning.
There is a high threat of kidnap, violent attacks and inter-communal tensions which can lead to outbreaks of violence. During the dry season (which normally runs from around October to March) this risk is likely to be heightened.
Regular military operations are ongoing in Adamawa, Borno and Yobe states. There is a risk of retaliatory attacks.
If you’re in the North East against FCDO advice, keep in touch with the authorities and the wider community on the security situation and make sure your procedures and contingency plans are up to date. If you are working, you should be fully confident in your employer’s ability to extract you in the event of any emergency. If in Maiduguri you should be aware that if security were to deteriorate any further, there is a significant likelihood that it could be extremely difficult for you to leave the city. We do not advise travelling by road.
Nigeria borders
Additional checks are in place at the Nigeria-Benin, Nigeria-Niger and Nigeria-Cameroon land borders. If you’re planning to make a land crossing from Nigeria, check with the local authorities for the latest information before travelling. All land borders will be closed from 00:00 hours on Saturday 18 March to 18:00 hours on Saturday 18 March as part of election travel restrictions.
Protests, demonstrations and intercommunal violence
Political rallies, protests and violent demonstrations can occur with little notice throughout the country.
Gubernatorial and State Houses of Assembly elections are scheduled for 18 March 2023. During the election period there is a heightened risk of protests and violence. You should exercise caution, follow the instructions of local authorities, and ensure in advance that you have a sufficient supply of essential goods.
Be vigilant and take local advice on areas to avoid. Take particular care if you’re visiting crowded public places or attending events which attract large crowds. Keep yourself informed of developments and if you encounter a threatening or intimidating situation, don’t try to make your way through it. Turn round and move to safety.
Incidents of inter-communal violence occur frequently throughout Nigeria. Attacks can occur without warning. Although foreign nationals are not normally targeted, there is a risk you could be caught in an attack. You should be alert to local government announcements and media reporting.
Criminal kidnaps
There’s a high threat of terrorist and criminal kidnaps in Nigeria.
Those engaged in tourism, humanitarian aid work, journalism or business are viewed as legitimate targets. If you are kidnapped, the reason for your presence is unlikely to serve as protection or secure your safe release.
Incidents of criminal kidnap can occur in any part of the country, at any time, with an increased risk in:
the northern and middle belt states of Adamawa, Bauchi, Borno, Gombe, Kaduna, Kano, Katsina, Nassarawa, Niger, Plateau, Sokoto, Taraba, Benue, Yobe and Zamfara
the Niger Delta states of Abia, Akwa Ibom, Anambra, Bayelsa, Delta, Imo and Rivers
Edo State
Criminal groups target whole communities or individuals. Kidnaps are sometimes take place along major highways, such as the Abuja – Kaduna highway and Enugu-Awka-Onitsha expressway in Anambra.
There is a high threat of kidnapping and other armed attacks targeting oil and gas facilities and workers in the Niger Delta region. This also applies to facilities at sea.
Travellers wishing to travel to any of the locations above should be alert to the threat of kidnap, and pay attention to local government announcements and media reporting.
The great majority of kidnapping victims remain ordinary Nigerians. Foreigners as well as Nigerian businessmen, traditional rulers and politicians are often targeted in the expectation of a high ransom reward. When arranging meetings in Nigeria make sure those who attend are known to you and hold the meeting at a secure location.
British nationals may be targeted. Foreign nationals, including British nationals, have been kidnapped in the past, and in some cases killed. British nationals of Nigerian origin visiting friends and relatives are often perceived as being wealthier than locals and are at particular risk of kidnap for ransom. There is a possibility that criminal groups would sell hostages on to terrorist organisations. See Terrorism.
The long-standing policy of the British government is not to make substantive concessions to hostage takers. The British government considers that paying ransoms and releasing prisoners increases the risk of further hostage taking. The Terrorism Act (2000) also makes payments to terrorists illegal.
Curfews and telecommunication blackouts
Curfews and restrictions on the movement of vehicles, can be imposed, amended and lifted at short notice throughout Nigeria.
Failure to comply with all curfews and movement restrictions could put you at significant risk. You should check with the local authorities or someone with local knowledge for up to date information on curfews and restrictions before you travel.
Telecommunication operators in Nigeria have in the past been ordered to suspend services in certain areas, including mobile telecommunications and WiFi. Future shutdowns may happen at short notice and may also be extended to new areas without advanced notice.
Maritime security
There have been armed robberies and incidents of piracy in Nigerian waters, the wider Gulf of Guinea, and on the rivers and harbours in the Niger Delta area. Mariners should seek professional security advice, be vigilant and take appropriate precautions.
Crime
Throughout Nigeria there are high levels of violent street crime including muggings, kidnappings, car-jackings and armed robbery.
Criminals have targeted visiting British nationals as their perceived wealth makes them an attractive victim.
You should be vigilant at all times, even if staying with friends and family, follow the security guidance offered by employers or hosts and limit road travel at night as far as possible. Avoid carrying large amounts of cash and don’t wear valuable watches, jewellery or items of sentimental value. If you suspect danger, move to a safer area.
If you’re caught up in an armed robbery, you should immediately comply with the attackers’ demands.
Scams
British nationals are increasingly being targeted by scam artists operating in West Africa. The scams come in many forms including romance and friendship, business ventures and work or employment opportunities. Scams can pose great financial risk to victims. You should be very cautious about any requests for funds, a job offer, a business venture or a face to face meeting from someone you have been in correspondence with over the internet who lives in West Africa. You can read more about scam or ‘419’ emails and letters on the Action Fraud website.
If you or your relatives or friends are asked to transfer money to Nigeria you should make absolutely sure that it is not part of a scam and that you have properly checked with the person receiving the money that they are requesting it. If the caller claims to be in distress, you should ask whether they have reported the incident (by phone or e-mail) to the British Deputy High Commission in Lagos.
People have received scam e-mails claiming to be from a British High Commission office in Nigeria. If you receive an email that appears to be from any British High Commission office in Nigeria asking for bank details or money, you should immediately contact the Consular Section of the British Deputy High Commission in Lagos.
If you’re considering fertility treatment in Nigeria, you should be cautious. There have been a number of staged fake births (commonly called ‘miracle babies’) which result in visitors being falsely led to believe they have given birth. You should be aware of the risks associated with bringing a child who is not biologically related to you into the UK without following appropriate legal procedures. The UK has restricted overseas adoption of children from Nigeria.
Road travel
Gubernatorial and State Houses of Assembly elections are scheduled for 18 March 2023. On this day only law enforcement personnel and Independent National Electoral Commission (INEC) accredited election observers will be allowed to drive vehicles along the roads in states where elections will take place from 00:00 to 18:00 on Saturday 18 March. Movement in the Federal Capital Territory will not be restricted.
Road travel across Nigeria can be chaotic and slow moving. You should take a mobile telephone and a supply of bottled water with you when travelling by car.
You can drive in Nigeria with a valid UK driving licence for up to 3 months. If you’re staying longer, you will need to get a Nigerian Driver’s Licence. You can contact the Federal Road Safety Corp on their website.
You should limit travel after dark outside city centres as far as possible; and avoid quiet and poorly lit roads. You should be particularly vigilant when sitting in traffic jams or at traffic lights. Keep car windows up and doors locked, and make sure valuables are out of sight. If you feel your vehicle is being followed, drive to the nearest place of safety (eg the nearest police station).
You should take particular care when driving outside cities and consider travelling in convoy and avoid travel after dark.
In Lagos, eating, smoking or using a mobile phone while driving and riding a motorcycle without a helmet are prohibited. Motorists face fines or imprisonment for violations.
There are authorised and unauthorised vehicle checkpoints throughout Nigeria. Some are for security checks, others to extort small payments of money. You should slow down at any type of checkpoint and use common sense at all times.
Since October 2019, there has been an increasing trend of illegal vehicle checkpoints on major supply and commercial routes in Northern Nigeria. This includes attacks on major roads into Maiduguri, Borno State, including the A3 Maiduguri-Damaturu road. These attacks have directly targeted civilians, security forces and aid workers.
There are frequent reports of robberies and car-jackings, some involving armed gunmen, on Nigeria’s urban and rural road network.
Public transport throughout Nigeria is dangerous. Taxis and long distance buses are often poorly maintained, uninsured and driven by unqualified drivers. Most major hotels offer cars for hire with drivers. You should use these where possible.
If you are expecting a greeter or driver to collect you at any of Nigeria’s international airports, make sure they have properly identified themselves before you set off. Bogus greeters are a problem.
Air travel
You can find a list of recent incidents and accidents on the website of the Aviation Safety network.
The FCDO can’t offer advice on the safety of individual airlines. However, the International Air Transport Association publishes lists of registered airlines that have been audited and found to meet a number of operational safety standards and recommended practices – IATA Operational Safety Audit and IATA Standard Safety Assessment. These lists aren’t exhaustive and the absence of an airline from this list doesn’t necessarily mean that it’s unsafe.
The International Civil Aviation Organisation has carried out an audit of the level of implementation of the critical elements of safety oversight in Nigeria.
Med-View airline has been refused permission to operate services to the EU due to safety deficiencies. However, Med-View airline may continue to operate services to the EU using aircraft leased from other airlines. You can find a full list of airlines banned from operating within the EU on the European Commission website. Refusal of permission to operate is often based on inspections of aircraft at EU airports. The fact that an airline isn’t included in the list doesn’t automatically mean that it meets the applicable safety standards. British government employees travelling within Nigeria have been advised to use carriers that aren’t subject to the EU operating ban.
In states where gubernatorial polls are taking place, domestic flights will not operate between 00:00 and 18:00 hours on Saturday 18 March, due to travel restrictions imposed during the gubernatorial elections.
Swimming
Swimming off the coast of Nigeria is dangerous due to rip tides and undertows, drownings occur each year. You should take care and seek local advice.
Political situation
President Muhammadu Buhari of the All Progressives Congress Party was democratically re-elected for a second term in February 2019.
Before President Buhari took office, Goodluck Jonathan of the People’s Democratic Party was President from 2010 – 2015.
The current Nigerian Constitution was enacted in 1999 and restored democratic rule to Nigeria, bringing an end to 30 years of military rule.
Nigeria’s National Day falls on 1 October, and marks the anniversary of Nigeria’s independence from Britain in 1960.
