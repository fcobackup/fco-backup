Entry and borders
See Entry requirements to find out what you will need to do when you arrive in Cyprus.
Returning to the UK
When you return, you must follow the rules for entering the UK.
You are responsible for organising your own COVID-19 test, in line with UK government testing requirements. The Cypriot government has advised that travellers should contact local authorities for information on testing facilities by calling 1450 or 1412.
Be prepared for your plans to change
No travel is risk-free during COVID. Countries may further restrict travel or bring in new rules at short notice, for example due to a new COVID-19 variant. Check with your travel company or airline for any transport changes which may delay your journey home.
If you test positive for COVID-19, you may need to stay where you are until you test negative. You may also need to seek treatment there.
Plan ahead and make sure you:
can access money
understand what your insurance will cover
can make arrangements to extend your stay and be away for longer than planned

In line with a UN statement, all crossing points between the Republic and the north re-opened on 4 June 2021 subject to a Red, Orange, Green categorisation system. Under current conditions, Orange status applies which means that all categories of traveller must present a negative PCR or Antigen (rapid) test result, taken within the last 7 days, in order to cross.

Quarantine hotels
If you test positive for COVID-19 you may have to enter a quarantine hotel. The UK government will not cover mandatory quarantine costs for British nationals. In Cyprus, the Cypriot authorities will pay the cost of your quarantine.
EHIC or GHIC cards cannot be used to cover any additional expenses you incur whilst staying in a quarantine hotel. Make sure you have access to funds to cover the costs or take out insurance, checking the policy has adequate cover.
If you have or are entitled to an EHIC or GHIC and you need medical treatment while staying at a quarantine hotel, the UK government will fund treatment as usual through the EHIC/GHIC scheme.
Find out more from the NHS website about EHIC and GHIC healthcare cover abroad.
COVID-19 vaccines if you live in Cyprus
Wherever possible British nationals should aim to be vaccinated in the country where they live. We will update this page when the Government of Cyprus announces new information on the national vaccination programme. You can sign up to get email notifications when this page is updated.
The Cyprus national vaccination programme started in December 2020 and is using the AstraZeneca, Moderna, and Johnson & Johnson vaccines. British nationals resident in Cyprus are eligible for vaccination.
UK nationals registered with the General Healthcare System (GeSY) can use the online portal to request a vaccination. UK Nationals who are not GeSY registered, but are legal residents can apply for a vaccination through a dedicated form. In the north of Cyprus a vaccination programme, starting with those most vulnerable, is being rolled out. UK Nationals resident in the north should contact their local health care provider for further information.
Find out more, including about vaccines that are authorised in the UK or approved by the World Health Organisation, on the COVID-19 vaccines if you live abroad.
If you’re a British national living in Cyprus, you should seek medical advice from your local healthcare provider. Information about COVID-19 vaccines used in the national programme where you live, including regulatory status, should be available from local authorities.
If you receive your COVID-19 vaccination in Cyprus, you can get an EU Digital COVID Certificate from the national authorities. The Certificate proves that you have been vaccinated against COVID-19, received a negative test result, or recovered from COVID-19. It will help facilitate your travel within the EU and, in some countries, you can use it to demonstrate your COVID-19 status to businesses and other organisations. For further information visit the European Commission’s EU Digital COVID Certificate page.
