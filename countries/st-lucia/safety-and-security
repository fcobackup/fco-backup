Crime
Most visits are trouble-free, but there have been incidents of crime including murder, armed robbery and sexual assault.
There is a continuing serious risk of homicides, primarily gang related and involving guns. Some incidents have taken place in populated and public areas. You should remain vigilant at all times and in all locations.
You should maintain at least the same level of personal security awareness as you would in the UK and make sure your accommodation is secure. This also applies if you are staying on a yacht. Be vigilant at all times. Take care when walking alone off the busy main roads and avoid isolated areas, including beaches, particularly after dark.
Only use licensed taxis and take particular care at late night street parties. Don’t carry large amounts of cash or jewellery. If possible, leave valuables and travel documents in a safety deposit box or hotel safe. You should check that the hotel safe is securely fixed before using it to store your items.
Road Travel
Driving is on the left. To drive on the island, a visitor without a Saint Lucian driving licence must get a local temporary driving permit. You will need a:
valid driving licence
passport
passport size photo of yourself
54 Eastern Caribbean Dollars
You must go in person to the Department of Transport at the Ministry of Infrastructure, Ports, Transport, Physical Development and Urban Renewal located at the Union Complex, in Union, Castries. You can call +1 758 468 4300 for the latest opening hours.
Some car hire companies are able to get the permit on behalf of visitors, enquire with the company beforehand if this is a service they can provide.
Take care when driving on the roads as there can be potholes and speed bumps. Observe the speed limits. You should take extra care on minor roads and in rural areas where there are narrow roads and blind corners. Pedestrians often walk on the roads and indicators are not always used.
Take extra care when driving at night as some roads are unlit. Road signs and hazards may not be easily visible.
Don’t stop if you’re flagged down by pedestrians. Keep car doors locked when driving.
In the event of an accident, call the police and don’t move the vehicle.
Taxis aren’t metered. Standard taxi fares exist for most destinations. Agree the fare in local currency with the driver before you set off. You can often pay in US dollars as well as EC dollars.
Take care especially on the main east coast road to and from Hewanorra International Airport.
Public transport is available and cheaper. Minibuses drivers may drive above the speed limit.
Air travel
You can find a list of recent incidents and accidents on the website of the Aviation Safety network.
The FCDO can’t offer advice on the safety of individual airlines. However, the International Air Transport Association publishes lists of registered airlines that have been audited and found to meet a number of operational safety standards and recommended practices – IATA Operational Safety Audit and IATA Standard Safety Assessment. These lists aren’t exhaustive and the absence of an airline from this list doesn’t necessarily mean that it’s unsafe.
The International Civil Aviation Organisation has carried out an audit of the level of implementation of the critical elements of safety oversight in St Lucia.
Swimming
Take great care at all times when swimming as currents can be deceptively strong and not all beaches have lifeguards and/or warning flags. You should monitor all beaches carefully and obey any local warnings.
