The information on this page covers the most common types of travel and reflects the UK government’s understanding of the rules currently in place. Unless otherwise stated, this information is for travellers using a full ‘British Citizen’ passport.
The authorities in the country or territory you’re travelling to are responsible for setting and enforcing the rules for entry. If you’re unclear about any aspect of the entry requirements, or you need further reassurance, you’ll need to contact the embassy, high commission or consulate of the country or territory you’re travelling to.
You should also consider checking with your transport provider or travel company to make sure your passport and other travel documents meet their requirements.
Restrictions in response to coronavirus
Health screening is in place at VC Bird International Airport for all international arrivals. The measures are subject to change but may include mandatory temperature and travel history checks, and “rapid testing” for Coronavirus. You should expect long waiting times on arrival. Visitors subject to a Coronavirus test on arrival must pay a fee of US$ 100 or local equivalent in cash. The local authorities may instruct you to enter government-provided quarantine, for which a further fee is payable, depending on the results of their screening and testing procedures. Those with pre-booked hotel accommodation will normally be permitted to travel to their accommodation after screening. Those staying with family, friends, or their own place of residence, must spend their first night in mandatory government quarantine and will be subject to an interview to determine their suitability to leave for their private accommodation arrangements. Those not deemed to have suitable private accommodation arrangements will be obliged to remain in government quarantine for between seven and 14 days.
All maritime vessels must enter Antigua and Barbuda via the Nevis Street Pier.
Until further notice, any non-Antigua and Barbuda national with a travel history in Canada, China, any country in Europe, Iran, South Korea, Japan, Singapore, and the USA within 28 days will not be permitted entry into Antigua and Barbuda.
