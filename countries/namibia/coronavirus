Cases of coronavirus (COVID-19) have been confirmed in Namibia. The Namibian authorities have introduced new measures to limit the spread of the virus.
Travel
Namibia declared a state of emergency on 17 March and has closed its borders and ports to foreign nationals and non-residents entering the country. All commercial flights in and out of the country have been suspended.
Namibian nationals and permanent residents returning to Namibia from high-risk countries are required to enter supervised quarantine in a government facility for a period of 14 days.
If you need further information about entry requirements, contact the local immigration authorities or the nearest Namibia High Commission. You should also check with your airline or travel company for the latest information.
Local measures
The Government of Namibia has extended movement restrictions until midnight of 4 May throughout the entire country. All residents may leave their homes only to visit pharmacies, food stores, banks or for medical reasons. Exercise is also allowed in groups of three or less. Standard four seater vehicles are permitted to carry no more than three passengers. Social gatherings should be limited to 10 persons. Visitors to public places should respect social distancing requirements (no closer than 1 meter).
Visas
British nationals currently in Namibia and unable to leave due to the restrictions on travel in response to coronavirus, should contact the Ministry of Home Affairs and Immigration in order to extend their entry stamp or visa.
