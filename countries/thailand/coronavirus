You will be required to wear a face mask when using public transport, including planes, trains, buses and taxis.
COVID-related restrictions in Thailand
An emergency decree is in place until 15 January 2021. A number of measures are in place, including instructions that you must not:
enter high risk areas
hoard essential goods
attend public gatherings
propagate false information
There has been an increase in COVID-19 cases across Thailand. You can find the latest information on case numbers on the Department of Disease Control website. As a result of this increase, the Thai authorities have introduced a number of disease control measures at national and local levels:
National level:
A Red / Orange / Yellow / Green rating for each of Thailand’s 76 provinces is in place (according to the number of COVID-19 cases recorded). Varying degrees of restrictions are in place in each province depending on the colour category and any additional local restrictions.
In provinces categorised as Red, also known as ‘Maximum Control Areas’, a two-tier system of restrictions will be in place from 4 January to 1 February.
Restrictions include:
Tier 1: Businesses face restricted operating hours; restrictions on public gatherings; closure of some schools; working from home encouraged where possible; inter-provincial travel discouraged.
Tier 2 (these are not currently in place and will only come into force if the situation does not improve): wider restrictions on businesses, including possible forced closures; ban on inter-provincial travel; stricter rules to ensure as many people as possible work from home; tighter monitoring and inspection of high-risk activities and locations; possible introduction of curfews.
Restrictions vary in provinces categorised as Orange, Yellow or Green. You should follow the advice of local authorities and comply with disease control measures.
The Thai government advises that you should avoid unnecessary travel, avoid crowded places, and scan the ‘Thai Chana’ QR code when visiting public places.
Local level:
Additional restrictions are in place in different provinces and in Bangkok. Restrictions vary from province to province and may change at any time. You should follow the advice of local authorities and comply with disease control measures.
Keep up to date with the latest health advice provided by Thailand’s Ministry of Public Health and updates from the Thai government on the situation, including daily video briefings in English provided by the Thai Ministry of Foreign Affairs.
Accommodation
Hotel and private rental accommodation is available throughout Thailand. However, some hotels remain closed so we advise that you contact hotels directly when booking.
The majority of hotels will ask to take your temperature on arrival and ask you to provide information on your recent travel history and any symptoms you may have related to COVID-19.
Some services and facilities in hotels may not be available e.g. leisure facilities.
Public spaces and services
Public places and services face restrictions that can change at any time – see the ‘COVID-related restrictions in Thailand’ section above.
