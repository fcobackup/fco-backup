Uzbekistan has put measures in place to limit the spread of coronavirus (COVID-19).

Up-to-date statistics on COVID-19 cases in Uzbekistan are available from a dedicated Uzbekistan Government website - coronavirus.uz (in Uzbek and Russian only).
Entry and borders
Uzbekistan has closed land and air borders to non-Uzbek nationals. It may be possible for foreign nationals to depart Uzbekistan via its land borders, but this is unlikely and dependent upon restrictions in place in the country of destination (please also see FCO Travel Advice for Afghanistan, Kazakhstan, Kyrgyzstan, Tajikistan and Turkmenistan). All commercial flights in and out of the country have been suspended.
Local measures
Under measures introduced by the Uzbek authorities, any person subject to quarantine or self-isolation who breaches such controls is liable to a minimum fine of 11 Million UZS (approximately £900) or up to 10 years imprisonment.
From 23 March, it is compulsory to wear a facemask while outside - individuals may be fined (up to approximately £100) for violation of this regulation.
Further restrictive measures introduced by the Uzbekistan authorities include:
prohibition of entry/exit from Tashkent by any mode of transport, with the exception of goods transportation and foreign nationals wishing to depart Uzbekistan (other cities, including Samarkand, are subject to similar restrictions)
closure of restaurants, cafes, bars, fitness centres, entertainment venues, shopping malls and non-essential shops (supermarkets excluded)
ban on holding of public events and some private events, including weddings and other family celebrations
suspension of all public transport
suspension of all domestic flights
severe penalties (fine, community service and prison terms) for individuals found to be spreading false information regarding COVID-19
These measures may be subject to change. Entry requirements may vary and further restrictions could be applied at short notice by the Uzbek authorities.
