Coronavirus guidance is being updated.
Read the Prime Minister’s address for the latest information.

There are currently extremely limited commercial options available to return to the UK from Tajikistan. The Tajik Civil Aviation Agency temporarily suspended all scheduled flights to and from Tajikistan on 20 March 2020. Airlines flying to the UK from regional hubs are liable to cancel or suspend flights at short notice. You should monitor the airlines’ information channels for updates.
A very small number of scheduled Somon Air flights from Tajikistan to Europe have been arranged since international flights from Dushanbe were suspended on 20 March, often at very short notice. If you wish to leave Tajikistan on a Somon Air flight, should another one be announced in the future, you should register your interest with Somon Air by contacting their representative Firuz Davlatov on +992 908 085 666. You should also inform the British Embassy of your interest by email to consular.dushanbe@fco.gov.uk

You will need to pay for your return travel to the UK. If departure options are available but you cannot afford the travel costs and have exhausted all other options for getting funds, you may be eligible to apply for an emergency loan from the government. This is a last resort option and you would need to repay the loan when you are back in the UK.
For more information, you should contact Corporate Travel Management (CTM). CTM are a commercial partner of the FCO and are authorised to administer such loans on behalf of the FCO.
