This page reflects the UK government’s understanding of current rules for people travelling on a full ‘British Citizen’ passport, for the most common types of travel.
The authorities in Angola set and enforce entry rules. For further information contact the embassy, high commission or consulate of the country or territory you’re travelling to. You should also consider checking with your transport provider or travel company to make sure your passport and other travel documents meet their requirements.
Entry rules in response to coronavirus (COVID-19)
Entry to Angola
There are a number of indirect commercial flights between the UK and Angola operated by TAP Air Portugal, Lufthansa, Air France, Brussels Airlines, Turkish Airlines, Emirates and Ethiopian Airlines. Because of ongoing conflict in Ethiopia, you should check our Ethiopia Travel Advice if you plan on transiting through Ethiopia.
Angola’s borders are temporarily closed to all foreign nationals, except those with resident and/or work permits and those on official, humanitarian or business visits. This restriction is due to be reviewed on 13 February 2022.
Advance passenger information requirement
All passengers are required to show evidence of a negative COVID-19 PCR test completed 72 hours before travel to Angola.
All passengers are required to complete an Advance Passenger Information form (FRV form) 72 hours before travel to Angola. Several travel documents must be uploaded onto the form in PDF format to be accepted before entry to Angola.
Testing prior to arrival and departure
In addition to the requirement to show evidence of a negative COVID-19 test completed 72 hours before arrival in Angola, all arriving passengers are required to undergo a rapid COVID-19 test immediately on disembarkation from the plane. The cost of the test is approximately USD $20 and is payable by Angolan bank card, credit card or in cash on arrival. The test is undertaken in a hangar at the airport, but can take time. It usually takes approximately 20 to 40 minutes, depending on the number of passengers being processed, but it is advisable to carry water and a refreshment in case there is a long wait.
All departing passengers are required to show evidence of negative COVID-19 PCR test completed 72 hours before departure from Angola.
Demonstrating your COVID-19 status
Angolan and foreign nationals are required to show proof of vaccination.
Angola will accept the UK’s proof of COVID-19 vaccination record and proof of COVID-19 vaccination issued in the Crown Dependencies. It is recommended that you carry a printed copy whilst in Angola. Your NHS appointment card from vaccination centres is not designed to be used as proof of vaccination and should not be used to demonstrate your vaccine status.
Quarantine requirements
On 14 January 2022, the Angolan authorities announced that all passengers who are fully vaccinated and test negative on disembarkation are exempt from any quarantine requirements.
Those who are not vaccinated and test negative on disembarkation will need to undertake compulsory self-quarantine for 7 days before undergoing a further COVID-19 test. A negative test is required to obtain a Titulo De Alta (ALTA) from the approved health centre and to be discharged from quarantine.
Any passenger (vaccinated or not) receiving a positive COVID-19 result will go immediately into mandatory quarantine at a government facility for observation and further testing.
Regular entry requirements
Visas
You must apply for a valid visa and/or work permit before travelling to Angola, otherwise you may be detained at the airport and then deported. The deportation process can take a long time. You should check all entry requirements with the Angolan Consulate in London well in advance of travel.
If you’re applying for a tourist visa, you can submit documentation online in advance of travel and be granted a pre-approval, normally within 72 hours. This allows you to receive your physical visa on entry into Angola, subject to a fee equivalent to USD $120, paid in cash (preferable) or by Visa or MasterCard to the immigration officer on arrival. Further information can be found on the online application portal.
You may be fined 15,000 Kwanzas (Angolan currency) per day if you overstay your visa. You may not be allowed to leave the country until your fine has been paid. Legal action may be taken against you if you don’t pay your fine. This may include being detained, deported or not being allowed to re-enter Angola.
Fines are in place for a wide range of visa offences including (but not limited to) working, studying or residing without the correct visa, changing employment without notifying the authorities, employing staff with incorrect visas, failing to renew residence cards, or changing address without notifying the authorities.
Passport validity
Your passport should be valid for a minimum period of 6 months from the date of entry into Angola.
UK Emergency Travel Documents
UK Emergency Travel Documents (ETD) are not valid for entry or transit into Angola. However, ETD are accepted to exit Angola.
