This page has information on travelling to Cyprus. Check what you must do to return to the UK.
All travellers
As of 18 April 2022, passengers must fulfil the following preconditions and carry with them the required documentation:
If you’re fully vaccinated or have recovered from COVID
Vaccinated or recovered passengers, regardless of nationality, will be able to travel to Cyprus from any country of departure, without the need for a COVID-19 test, provided that they fulfil one of the following conditions:
They hold a valid COVID-19 Certificate of Vaccination or Recovery (the NHS Covid Pass is acceptable).
They hold a valid vaccination certificate from the competent authorities of any third country, provided that the required doses of a vaccine accepted by the Republic of Cyprus have been completed.
For further information, including on the validity of vaccination and recovery certificates, check the COVID-19 Destination Protocol of Cyprus.
Upon arrival, passengers must present their vaccination certificate or recovery certificate in printed or electronic form. Passengers should follow any instructions given upon arrival. This may include random selection for testing.
You should continue to track developments through the Press and Information Office.
Proof of vaccination status
Cyprus will accept the UK’s proof of COVID-19 vaccination record and proof of COVID-19 vaccination issued in the Crown Dependencies. Your final vaccine dose must have been administered at least 14 days prior to travel. Your NHS appointment card from vaccination centres is not designed to be used as proof of vaccination and should not be used to demonstrate your vaccine status.
If you’re not fully vaccinated don’t have a certificate of recovery
Passengers who have not been vaccinated or do not hold a valid vaccination or recovery certificate, regardless of nationality, may travel to and enter the Republic of Cyprus from any country of departure, if they provide certification of a negative result from either:
a laboratory COVID-19 test (RT-PCR) taken 72 hours prior to departure, or
a Rapid antigen test taken 24 hours prior to departure.
Persons under the age of 12 are not required to present a negative PCR or rapid test certificate.
Passengers aged 12 years or over, who do not hold a vaccination or recovery certificate must present their test result in printed or electronic form.
Results from self-administered tests from passengers are not accepted for travelling to Cyprus.
You may be asked to do a further test upon arrival to Cyprus. Refusal to comply will result in you needing to quarantine at your own expense.
Exemptions
Cypriot citizens and family members (alien spouses and their underage children), and persons legally residing in the Republic have the option to take a test only upon arrival in the Republic of Cyprus, provided you; have received at least the first dose of a two-dose vaccine accepted by the Republic of Cyprus; are aged 12–15; or cannot be vaccinated for proven medical reasons. If you meet one of these conditions and choose this option, you must remain in mandatory self-isolation for 72 hours upon arrival. At the end of the 72-hour period you must undergo another PCR test. If the repeat test is negative you must submit this online to the Cyprus Flight Pass platform and then you can end your isolation.
Children and young people
Children aged 11 and under are exempted from the testing requirement. Children aged 12 and over who have not completed a full vaccination programme need to follow the guidance for unvaccinated adults.
If you’re transiting through Cyprus
Passengers who travel from the UK via Cyprus, without disembarking and continue their travel on the same flight do not need to compete a Cyprus Flight Pass. Passengers who disembark in Cyprus and continue their travel on a connecting flight must complete a Cyprus Flight Pass. See the Cyprus flight pass website for further information.
Visiting the north of Cyprus
Unvaccinated travellers visiting the north of Cyprus from the UK must provide a negative result from a PCR test, taken within 72 hours or a rapid test taken within 24 hours prior to entry. Unvaccinated travellers are also required to take an additional COVID-19 test within 72 to 120 hours after entry.
Fully vaccinated travellers do not require a negative test result upon entry. You are considered fully vaccinated if you have received a booster shot or have received two doses of Sinovac, Pfizer Biontech, Sinopharm, Astrazeneca, Janssen, Sputnik, Moderna, Novavax, Covishield, Covaxin or Canisobio and 14 days have passed since your second shot. If more than 270 days have passed since your second shot, you will be deemed unvaccinated.
All travellers must complete a Passenger Country Entry Form before travel and, as relevant, you must upload your negative PCR test result or vaccination certificate bearing a QR code or proof of having previously contracted COVID-19 (in the form of a positive PCR test result obtained 30 to 180 days before the date of arrival). You must also carry printed copies of these documents.
Check your passport and travel documents before you travel
Passport validity
If you are planning to travel to an EU country (except Ireland), or Switzerland, Norway, Iceland, Liechtenstein, Andorra, Monaco, San Marino or Vatican City, you must follow the Schengen area passport requirements.
Your passport must be:
Issued less than 10 years before the date you enter the country (check the ‘date of issue’)
valid for at least 3 months after the day you plan to leave (check the ‘expiry date’)
You must check your passport meets these requirements before you travel. If your passport was issued before 1 October 2018, extra months may have been added to its expiry date.
Contact the embassy of the country you are visiting if you think that your passport does not meet both these requirements. Renew your passport if you need to.
Visas
For more information on crossing to and from the north of Cyprus, see Local travel.
Cyprus is not part of the Schengen area, Visits to Cyprus do not count towards your 90-day visa-free limit in the Schengen area.
Visits to other EU or Schengen countries do not count towards your 90-day visa-free limit in Cyprus.
You can travel to Cyprus for up to 90 days in any 180-day period without a visa. This applies if you travel as a tourist, to visit for family or friends, to attend business meetings, cultural or sports events, or for short-term studies or training.
To stay longer, to work or study, for business travel or for other rea-sons, you will need to meet the Cypriot government’s entry requirements. Check with the Republic of Cyprus High Commission what type of visa and/or work permit you may need.
If you are travelling to Cyprus for work, read the guidance on visas and permits.
If you stay in Cyprus with a Cypriot residence permit or long-stay visa, this time does not count towards your 90-day visa-free limit for Cyprus.
If you’re a resident in Cyprus, you are advised to carry your Republic of Cyprus-issued residency documents when entering/exiting the Republic of Cyprus.
The Republic of Cyprus does not recognise the self-declared ‘Turkish Republic of Northern Cyprus’ in the north of Cyprus, nor residence permits issued by the administration there.
The Republic of Cyprus authorities will count time spent in the north of Cyprus towards the 90 day visa free total. If you overstay, you will potentially face difficulties at the airport on exit or re-entry.
Passport stamping
As a visitor, your passport will be stamped when you enter and exit Cyprus. Border guards will use the passport stamps to check you’re complying with the 90-day visa-free limit for short stays in Cyprus.
If you enter or exit the Schengen area through Cyprus as a visitor, check that your passport is stamped. This will show border guards that you are complying with the 90-day visa-free limit for Cyprus and the separate 90-day visa-free limit for the Schengen area.
If the relevant entry or exit stamp is not in your passport, border guards will presume that you have overstayed your visa-free limit. If you show evidence eg transport tickets to prove when you entered or exited Cyprus, border guards should add this entry or exit date and the location in your passport.
You may also need to:
show a return or onward ticket
show you have enough money for your stay
If you have a Withdrawal Agreement residency document for another country, your passport might still be stamped if you are a visitor to Cyprus.
If you are resident in Cyprus, read our Living in Cyprus guide for passport stamping information.
UK Emergency Travel Documents
UK Emergency Travel Documents (ETDs) are accepted for entry, air-side transit and exit from Cyprus.
