This page reflects the UK government’s understanding of current rules for people travelling on a full ‘British Citizen’ passport, for the most common types of travel.
The authorities in Bulgaria set and enforce entry rules. For further information contact their embassy, high commission or consulate. You may also check with your transport provider or travel company to make sure your passport and travel documents meet their requirements.
If you are travelling to Bulgaria for work, read the guidance on visas and permits as the rules have changed since 1 January 2021.
Entry rules in response to coronavirus (COVID-19)
Entry to Bulgaria
Bulgaria has a system of classification for travellers arriving in the country based on green, orange and red zones. From Monday 19 July the UK will be categorised as a ‘red zone’ country. This means that only Bulgarian nationals, long-term residents in Bulgaria and family members travelling from UK are allowed to enter the country.
Eligible travellers are required to present a negative result from a PCR test performed within 72 hours before entry into Bulgaria. The document must contain the names of the person in English, date of birth, type of test (PCR) and ‘Negative’ written in English, details of the medical institution that performed the test (name, address or other contact details), date and time of the test sample, the country in which the test has been performed and the authority that issued the document.
Eligible travellers who do not present a negative result from a PCR test will be required to complete a mandatory 10-day quarantine. This 10-day quarantine period can be shortened if they present a negative PCR test within the first 24 hours after their arrival in Bulgaria. The quarantine will be revoked within 24 hours after submission of the document showing a negative result of the PCR test to the respective Regional Health Inspectorate.
Children under 12, arriving from ‘green’ and ‘orange’ zone countries are exempt from the requirement to present Covid-19 documents upon their arrival in Bulgaria.
Immediate family members of Bulgarian citizens or long-term residents are restricted to the following categories: wife, husband, or a person you live with in a relationship akin to marriage; and dependent children under the age of 18 years of age. You will be expected to show documentation to prove relationship status (e.g. birth or marriage certificate) if you are not in possession of a Bulgarian residence permit.
A list of places offering PCR testing in Bulgaria is available from the Bulgarian government (in Bulgarian). You should submit the document showing a negative result of the PCR test to the respective Regional Health Inspectorate. For Sofia Health Inspectorate, submit your document to the following email address: director@srzi.bg. Due to an increased amount of inquiries, the health authorities may not have enough capacity to respond to each email individually so you should call them directly to find out if your quarantine has been lifted. Contact numbers are listed here.
The measures are in force at all air, road, rail and sea border crossings into Bulgaria.
Exemptions, regardless of nationality, include medical workers, state official and diplomats, persons traveling for humanitarian reasons, seasonal and tourist workers, those transiting the country and bus and lorry drivers.
Further information on the full range of exemptions is available on the following Bulgarian Government web site (in Bulgarian). If you fall into one of the exempted categories, you should contact your travel operator in advance of travel for further information on how to demonstrate your exemption from the travel ban.
Many land borders crossings in the region are restricted or closed for passenger traffic. Furthermore, neighbouring countries are implementing additional health requirements for entry to or departure from Bulgaria including declarations and COVID-19 tests. You should check the relevant FCDO Travel Advice.
If you need to travel, plan ahead and before you travel check border information published by the Ministry of Interior (English and Bulgarian) before you travel.
Demonstrating your COVID-19 vaccination status
Bulgaria will only accept the letter format from the UK to demonstrate your COVID vaccination status. You should not use apps to demonstrate your COVID-19 vaccination status. Your NHS appointment card from vaccination centres is not designed to be used as proof of vaccination and should not be used to demonstrate your vaccine status.
Quarantine requirements
From 19 July, the UK will be added to Bulgaria’s red list and only Bulgarian nationals, long-term residents and their immediate family members are eligible to enter from the UK.
Eligible travellers to Bulgaria are required to quarantine for 10 days unless they have provided negative PCR antigen test.
Check the list of UK private providers of Coronavirus testing and make arrangements for your test in good time. It may not be possible to secure a test at short notice.
The 10-day quarantine on arrival can be shortened if they present a negative PCR test performed within 24 hours of arriving in Bulgaria. The quarantine requirement will be revoked within 24 hours of submitting the document demonstrating the negative PCR test result.
A list of places offering PCR testing in Bulgaria is available here in Bulgarian.
You should submit the document showing a negative result of the PCR test to the respective Regional Health Inspectorate.
For Sofia Health Inspectorate, submit your document to the following email address: director@srzi.bg.

Contact numbers are listed here.
A very small number of travellers are exempted from both the quarantine requirement, and the need to provide evidence of a negative PCR test. These include people transiting through Bulgaria and hauliers and transport crew members of vessels or aircraft who do not remain in Bulgaria following their work-related duties. Check the latest information on the Ministry of Interior website (English and Bulgarian).
Regular entry requirements
Visas
The rules for travelling or working in European countries changed from 1 January 2021:
you can travel to Bulgaria for up to 90 days in any 180-day period without a visa. This applies if you travel as a tourist, to visit for family or friends, to attend business meetings, cultural or sports events, or for short-term studies or training
visits to other EU or Schengen countries do not count towards your 90-day limit in Bulgaria as it is not in the Schengen area. Visits to Bulgaria do not count towards your 90-day visa-free limit in the Schengen area
to stay longer, to work or study, for business travel or for other reasons, you will need to meet the Bulgarian government’s entry requirements. Check with the Bulgarian Embassy what type of visa and/or work permit you may need
if you stay in Bulgaria with a residence permit or long-stay visa, this does not count towards your 90-day visa-free limit
*any time you spent in Bulgaria before 1 January 2021 does not count towards the 90-day visa-free limit.
At Bulgarian border control, you may need to use separate lanes from EU, EEA and Swiss citizens when queueing. Your passport may be stamped on entry and exit. You may also need to:
show a return or onward ticket
show you have enough money for your stay
Passport validity
Check your passport is valid for travel before you book your trip, and renew your passport if you do not have enough time left on it.
You must have at least 6 months left on an adult or child passport to travel to most countries in Europe (not including Ireland).
If you renewed your current passport before the previous one expired, extra months may have been added to its expiry date. Any extra months on your passport over 10 years may not count towards the 6 months needed.
There are separate requirements for those who are resident in Bulgaria. If you are resident in Bulgaria, you should carry proof of residence as well as your valid passport when you travel. For further information on these requirements, see our Living in Bulgaria guide.
UK Emergency Travel Documents
UK Emergency Travel Documents (ETDs) are accepted for entry, airside transit and exit from Bulgaria.
