There are still commercial options to return to the UK from Saudi Arabia.
If you live in the UK and are currently visiting Saudi Arabia, you’re strongly advised to return now by commercial means. Don’t risk getting stranded.
Flights
There is no longer any need to register your details with the Embassy for flights to the UK. Saudia is now advertising UK flights on its website. These can be booked online at www.saudia.com. Please remember to select ‘One Way’. Please note that not all of these flights are supported by the Embassy.
We will only be able to assist British nationals and residents with transport and permissions for certain flights. So if you need our help to reach the airport, please check details of Embassy-supported flights before booking. We will publish these on our social media channels: Facebook and Twitter.
If you book a flight on a different date, we cannot provide permissions letters or help with transport.
You will need to pay for your return travel to the UK. If departure options are available but you cannot afford the travel costs and have exhausted all other options for getting funds, you may be eligible to apply for an emergency loan from the British Government. This should be a last resort option and you would need to repay the loan when you are back in the UK. Contact the British Embassy Riyadh for information on how to apply.
Future travel options
The British Embassy has been working closely with airlines and the Saudi authorities to arrange a regular commercial flight option to the UK as soon as possible.
We are working hard to ensure that there are more opportunities to buy tickets for flights in the coming months. However, it is not possible to say when flights will depart. Depending on demand, it may not be possible for all Britons to buy tickets when they wish to travel. If you need to return to the UK, buy a ticket for the next British Embassy-supported flight.
Your journey home
The National Travel Health Network and Centre (NaTHNaC) provides advice on how to stay safe as you travel by air.
