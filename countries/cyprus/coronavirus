Cases of coronavirus (COVID-19) have been confirmed in Cyprus. The Cypriot authorities have introduced measures to limit the spread of the virus.
British nationals that wish to leave Cyprus should contact their travel operator or airline to make arrangements to do so as soon as possible. British nationals in Cyprus should follow the advice of the Cypriot authorities, which includes vacating their tourist accommodation by 21 March. For information on how to return to the UK from Cyprus, see Return to the UK.
Travel Restrictions
On 15 March, the Republic of Cyprus government declared a state of emergency. From 15 March, UK nationals (and other non-Cypriots) are not be permitted to enter the Republic of Cyprus for tourism. UK nationals may enter if they are legal residents in the Republic of Cyprus, working in the Republic, attending educational institutions in the Republic or, with prior authorisation, have unavoidable professional obligations.
Essential travel to Cyprus for those in these categories is currently difficult because of the restrictions imposed by the Republic of Cyprus government. The Republic of Cyprus currently requires that all UK travellers to Cyprus have a medical certificate issued in the past four days to show they have tested negative for COVID-19. UK health institutions do not issue negative COVID-19 medical certificates. Without a certificate passengers will be refused entry. Even with the certificate, passengers will have to enter 14 days quarantine in state facilities.
The Republic of Cyprus has stipulated exemptions to medical certificate requirements for:
Individuals who travelled outside Cyprus for medical reasons and those that accompanied them.
Individuals who travelled outside Cyprus on short trips for business or professional obligations.
These individuals will be subject to quarantine on arrival.
Instead of a medical certificates, individuals falling into the above categories will be expected to obtain a certificate from Cyprus’ High Commissions, Consulates or Embassies abroad. These will be issued when the interested party presents documentation on the reason they travelled. We do not have any further detail on the documentation required.
Additionally, anyone arriving from these categories will still be required to stay in quarantine for 14 days, in facilities designated by the Republic of Cyprus, although there may be exemptions for those who travelled for medical reasons. Until further details are published by the government of Cyprus you should clarify your specific circumstances with your local Cypriot High Commission, Consulate or Embassy.
On 17 March, the Republic of Cyprus announced that a complete ban on flights (except cargo and humanitarian flights) to and from Cyprus would apply from 03:00 (local time) on 21 March until 4 April.
Neighbouring countries including Greece and Turkey have also introduced restrictions which may impact on travel. Check country-specific FCO Travel Advice for details.
Closure of Hotels
On 15 March, the Republic of Cyprus government instructed all hotel and tourist accommodation to cease operations by 21 March, and to remain closed until 30 April. The government has stated that all tourists will need to leave their accommodation by 21 March. The Republic of Cyprus government is using a small number of hotels to accommodate Cypriot nationals and permanent residents who have recently returned from abroad for quarantine purposes.
Other Measures
Following policy changes announced by the Republic of Cyprus Government and the administration in the north, all crossing points between the Republic and the north are effectively closed to travellers.
On 23 March, the Republic of Cyprus government announced further measures including movement restrictions and closure of public places until 13 April. Starting from 18:00 on 24 March, until 13 April, anyone going outdoors must complete and carry a printed form explaining the reasons for going outdoors and present these to Cyprus police if stopped. There is one form which employers should complete for their employees in order to travel to work. There is a separate form for individuals to request exemption from movement restrictions for non-work reasons. The forms are currently available here alternatively, people may use their mobile phone to send an SMS message (free of charge) requesting permission to go outdoors. Further guidance is available from the Cypriot authorities at www.mof.gov.cy and www.pio.gov.cy/coronovirus.
The administration in the north of Cyprus has introduced a total ban on entry for all foreign nationals, including the UK. This includes those holding residency, work, or student permits. In addition, all ‘citizens’ of north Cyprus returning from abroad will be quarantined for 14 days in centres organised by the administration. On 22 March the administration in the north imposed a partial curfew which includes movement restrictions. Only essential businesses will remain open until the 6 April. In response to coronavirus (COVID-19), there are currently no flights between Turkey and the north of Cyprus.
