We recommend that you carry your passport (or, if a resident your Croatian ID card) at all times. They are the only officially recognised form of identification in Croatia.
Keep a photocopy of the biographical details page in a safe place, including details of your next of kin. If your passport is lost or stolen, you should report it to the police and get a police report. You need to do this before applying for an Emergency Travel Document; advice on how to apply can be found online
In some Croatian town centres, authorities may issue on the spot fines for behaviour which is locally considered inappropriate, such as:
walking through towns shirtless or in swimwear
wearing clothing that promotes drug use
sleeping in public areas
climbing on top of monuments
urinating in public spaces
drinking alcohol near protected public spaces (e.g. schools)
vomiting in public areas
You can also be fined up to â‚¬4000 for actions considered to be disturbances to public order. These include fighting, verbal abuse and drunken behaviour.
Most towns have signage to advise about actions that are prohibited by local law. Take notice of your surroundings, including signage, and seek local advice.
Drug related offences are punishable with fines and jail sentences.
Taking food and drink into the EU
You cannot take meat, milk or products containing them into EU countries. There are some exceptions for medical reasons, for example certain amounts of powdered infant milk, infant food, or pet food required for medical reasons. Check the rules about taking food and drink into the EU on the European Commission website.
