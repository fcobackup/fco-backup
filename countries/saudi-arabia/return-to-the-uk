There are still commercial options to return to the UK from Saudi Arabia.
If you live in the UK and are currently visiting Saudi Arabia, you’re strongly advised to return now by commercial means. Don’t risk getting stranded.
UK special charter flights will only operate for priority countries where commercial flights are not possible. You should not assume that these flights will become available in Saudi Arabia because commercial routes are operating. Please do not contact the contracted travel management company if no flight is advertised here.
Flights
The following flights are now operating:
• Riyadh to London Heathrow on Friday 8 May at 10.55am. We are arranging transport from Dammam for this flight.
• Jeddah to London Heathrow on Monday 11 May at 11.55am. We are arranging transport from the Western Regions for this flight.
Tickets are available from the Saudia website: www.saudia.com. Please remember to select ‘One Way’ when booking.
Travelling to the airport
If you need transport from Dammam, please email KSA.Info@fco.gov.uk with DAMMAM TRANSPORT in the title.
We will arrange transport from a limited number of locations within the Western Regions to Jeddah. If you need transport, please send your contact details and location to KSA.Info@fco.gov.uk with WESTERN REGIONS TRANSPORT in the title.
If you are already in Riyadh or Jeddah, you will need to arrange your own transport to the airport using the commercial options available.
You will need to pay for your return travel to the UK. If departure options are available but you cannot afford the travel costs and have exhausted all other options for getting funds, you may be eligible to apply for an emergency loan from the government. This is a last resort option and you would need to repay the loan when you are back in the UK. Contact the British Embassy Riyadh for more information on how to apply.
Future travel options
The British Embassy has been working closely with airlines and the Saudi authorities to arrange a regular commercial flight option to the UK as soon as possible. This travel advice will be updated with further information once departure options are available. Sign up for email alerts and follow the British Embassy Riyadh on Twitter.
We are working hard to ensure that there are more opportunities to purchase tickets for flights in the coming months. However, it is not possible to say when flights will depart. Depending on demand, it may not be possible for all Britons to buy tickets when they wish to travel. If you need to return to the UK, buy a ticket for the next available flight.
Your journey home
The National Travel Health Network and Centre (NaTHNaC) provides advice on how to stay safe as you travel by air.
When you arrive back in the UK, follow the guidance for when you return to the UK on steps you should take to protect yourself and others.

find accommodation that’s suitable for your needs
keep in regular contact with family and friends at home, so they know you are safe and well
