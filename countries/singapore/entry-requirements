The authorities in Singapore set and enforce entry rules. For further information contact the embassy, high commission or consulate of the country or territory you’re travelling to. You should also consider checking with your transport provider or travel company to make sure your passport and other travel documents meet their requirements.
Entry rules in response to coronavirus (COVID-19)
Entry to Singapore
Only Singapore citizens and permanent residents can enter Singapore without prior permission unless you are travelling on one of Singapore’s Vaccinated Travel Lane schemes.
If you’re a long-term resident (holder of an employment pass, S Pass, work permit, foreign domestic work permit, long-term visit pass, or student pass), you may enter Singapore without travelling on a Vaccinated Travel Lane if you are fully vaccinated and if the Singapore government has approved your application to enter. See Singapore’s Safe Travel website for updated information.
Singapore has introduced varying entry permissions depending on your vaccination status, country of origin, and purpose of visit (such as on compassionate/medical grounds). You should use the self-help tool on the Safe Travel website for more details.
Demonstrating your COVID-19 status
Singapore will accept the UK’s proof of COVID-19 recovery and vaccination record. Your NHS appointment card from vaccination centres is not designed to be used as proof of vaccination and should not be used to demonstrate your vaccine status.
The digital vaccination certificates issued by some other countries are also accepted.

Before applying for entry into Singapore, contact your port agent and/or the Maritime and Port Authority to find out what prevailing Covid-19 measures are in place.
Quarantine requirements
Everyone granted permission to enter Singapore will be tested for COVID-19 upon arrival and arrivals from most destinations not travelling on a Vaccinated Travel Lane will be issued with a ‘Stay at Home Notice’ (SHN). For arrivals from the UK this is for 7 days and can be at in your place of residence in Singapore or otherwise it must be in a hotel room. The cost must be met by the traveller.
Testing and quarantine rules vary depending upon your travel history. Full details of exemptions including testing requirements and quarantine information can be found on the Singapore Immigration and Checkpoints Authority (ICA) ‘Arrival in Singapore’ and ‘SafeTravel’ webpages. You should check these websites for updates and review SHN details before travelling.
Everyone aged over 12 who is in home quarantine will need by law to wear an electronic tag for the duration of their quarantine period. The tags are about the size of a watch and are worn on the wrist.
All arrivals must pay for COVID-19 tests. For arrivals from the UK there is a PCR test on arrival and a further PCR test on day 7. While you’re serving quarantine you will not be allowed to leave your room/place of residence. The quarantine period cannot be reduced, even if you wish to leave Singapore. Failure to comply carries a fine and a jail term of up to six months. More details can be found on the Singapore government website.

Singapore’s Changi Airport allows transit of passengers only in certain circumstances. Check with your airline before undertaking a journey via Singapore. You should also familiarise yourself with new transit procedures for Changi Airport before travelling.
