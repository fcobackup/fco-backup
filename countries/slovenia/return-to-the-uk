If you’re visiting Slovenia, you’re strongly advised to return to the UK as soon as possible. Contact your travel operator to make arrangements to do so as soon as possible.
Flights
On 11 May, airports in Slovenia re-opened for passenger flights. A return to a scheduled service is expected to start from late-May 2020. You should consult airlines for details of flight options to and from Slovenia.
There are indirect commercial routes available to the UK from Vienna and Zagreb. You should check details with commercial operators.
Taxi companies are able to cross the border with Austria, provided that you can prove that you are departing on a flight from Vienna on the same day. Stopping is not permitted in Austria, apart from drop-off at Vienna International Airport. Please check Austria travel advice for further details.
It is possible to travel to Zagreb Airport from Slovenia in order to take a flight. However, it is likely that you will need to change taxis at the border, as well as show evidence of a flight departing on the same day. If you do not have this evidence, you are likely to be refused entry. Please check Croatia travel advice for further details.
Travel via neighbouring countries
Neighbouring countries have introduced restrictions on entry from Slovenia. Check travel advice for any country that you will transit on your journey. Be aware that all requirements can be subject to short notice change or alteration.
Passenger trains connections between Slovenia and Austria remain suspended.
Future travel options
You will need to pay for your return travel to the UK. If departure options are available but you cannot afford the travel costs and have exhausted all other options for getting funds, you may be eligible to apply for an emergency loan from the government. This is a last resort option and you would need to repay the loan when you are back in the UK.
For more information, you should contact Corporate Travel Management (CTM). CTM are a commercial partner of the FCO and are authorised to administer such loans on behalf of the FCO.
