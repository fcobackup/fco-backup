Volcanoes
There are numerous volcanoes in the Philippines, any of which can erupt without warning. Sudden steam and ash explosions may occur at any time. . Check news reports and follow local advice before travelling to volcanic areas. Avoid volcanic areas during and immediately after heavy rainfall when there’s increased risk of lava flows. You can find more information about volcanoes on the Philippine Institute for Volcanology and Seismology (PHIVOLCS) website.
The lake Taal volcano 60km south of Manila has been experiencing increased volcanic activity since 12 January 2020. On 14 February the Philippines’ authorities reduced the alert level from 3 down to 2. This should not be interpreted that unrest has ceased, or that the threat of a hazardous eruption has disappeared. The volcano is under constant monitoring by Philippine authorities and the alert level will be raised again if an increase in activity is detected. You should follow updates on the PhiVolcs official website.
The eruptive activity of the Mayon volcano in Albay Province (Bicol region) has reduced since 2018, although it remains at a moderate level of unrest with a risk of sudden eruptions, lava collapses and ash fall. The Philippine Institute of Volcanology and Seismology (PHIVOLCS) has lowered the alert to level 2 but an exclusion zone remains in place. If you’re in Albay Province, you should follow the advice of the local authorities, including the advice not to enter the designated danger zone. You should remain vigilant and follow developments on the PHIVOLCS website.
Ash plumes can affect air quality and have an impact on health. A properly fitted face mask may provide some protection. If you have any pre-existing respiratory conditions, you might be at increased risk of triggering or worsening your symptoms. Additional advice on the potential health hazards can found on the International Volcanic Health Hazard Network website.
The capacity of the Philippine emergency and rescue services to deal with large natural disasters is limited.
