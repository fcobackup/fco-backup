There are currently extremely limited commercial options available to return to the UK from Guinea. Guinea’s borders have been closed since 27 March. Conakry airport is officially closed to commercial passenger flights but there remain occasional commercial options with Air France.
If you live in the UK and are currently visiting Guinea, you’re strongly advised to return now by commercial means. Don’t run the risk of getting stranded.
UK special charter flights will only operate for priority countries where commercial flights are not possible. You should not assume that these flights will become available in countries where commercial routes are operating.

You will need to pay for your return travel to the UK. If departure options are available but you cannot afford the travel costs and have exhausted all other options for getting funds, you may be eligible to apply for an emergency loan from the government. This is a last resort option and you would need to repay the loan when you are back in the UK. For more information, contact Corporate Travel Management (CTM).
