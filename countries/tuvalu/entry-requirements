The information on this page covers the most common types of travel and reflects the UK government’s understanding of the rules currently in place. Unless otherwise stated, this information is for travellers using a full ‘British Citizen’ passport.
The authorities in the country or territory you’re travelling to are responsible for setting and enforcing the rules for entry. If you’re unclear about any aspect of the entry requirements, or you need further reassurance, you’ll need to contact the embassy, high commission or consulate of the country or territory you’re travelling to.
You should also consider checking with your transport provider or travel company to make sure your passport and other travel documents meet their requirements.
Passport validity
Your passport should be valid for a minimum period of six months from the date of entry into the country.
In the event of a lost or stolen passport, the Tuvalu authorities can issue emergency travel documents which will allow you to travel as far as Fiji. If you need to travel within the minimum full validity passport processing time of 3-4 weeks, you should contact the British High Commission in Suva. You may be eligible for an Emergency Travel Document (ETD).
Keep a photocopy of the relevant pages of your passport to avoid any complications.
Visas
Visas are not required for British nationals visiting for periods of up to one month. An extension of stay for a maximum period of three months is available from the Department of Immigration.
