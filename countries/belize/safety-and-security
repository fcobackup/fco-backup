Crime
Belize has one of the highest per capita murder rates in the world. While the murder rate declined in 2022, the per capita rate remains high and incidents of other crime (armed robberies, burglaries, theft, rape and sexual assaults) increased.
Armed criminal gangs have also been known to operate in the past in the densely forested areas of Belize, particularly around the border area with Guatemala, close to tourist sites. These incidents are uncommon and the areas are patrolled by the Belize Defence Force.
The majority of muggings occur in Belize City but can also occur elsewhere, including tourist destinations such as San Pedro, Caye Caulker, Placencia and San Ignacio. Avoid dark alleys, do not hitchhike or accept lifts from strangers, keep valuables out of sight and be aware that wearing expensive jewellery could attract unwanted attention. If possible, travel in groups and use a qualified guide for trips off the beaten track.
Serious gang-related violence does occur in Belize City, most commonly in the area to the south of the Haulover Creek (known as Southside). While tourists are not normally the targets of gang violence, anyone in the vicinity of an incident could be affected. Follow the advice of your hotel and the local authorities and remain vigilant of your surroundings.
A month-long State of Emergency was put in place in July 2023 for parts of the Southside of Belize City in response to recent gang-related shootings. This has now been lifted, however tensions between gangs remains high in Southside, and shootings occurred within days of the lifting. A State of Emergency may be introduced again if gang-related murders and retaliations escalate.
You should immediately report all incidents of crime, including assault, robbery and theft to the police by calling 911. They will take your statement and investigate the matter. This may take several weeks. You can pay a fee at any point during the process to receive a copy of the report when it is completed. Be aware that police capacity to respond is limited and many crimes remain unsolved.
Local travel
Take particular care when travelling in the Belize/Guatemala border area because of the ongoing dispute between the two countries. Only use officially recognised border crossings.
There have been a number of injuries and fatalities resulting from adventure sports activities including snorkelling and diving. Severe weather and inadequate safety precautions are the main causes. Check local weather forecasts and only use registered and licensed operators.
You can find more information on local travel on the Belize Tourism Board’s website.
Road travel
You can drive using your UK Driving Licence or an International Driving Permit for up to 3 months. For longer stays, you will need to get a Belize driving permit from the Department of Traffic in the district you’re in.
Road traffic accidents are common and local driving and vehicle maintenance standards are poor. Take great care when driving, particularly during rainy conditions and if you need to drive at night, be aware of the risks - there is a high incidence of drink-driving and the highways are mostly unlit, with potholes, unpaved dirt shoulders and lane markings present only on a few of the major highways for short stretches. In southern parts of the country, particularly in Stann Creek and Toledo, temporary bridges and causeways in low-lying areas may flood during severe weather.
Private and shared shuttles are available to travel between towns and cities. Public bus services are also available but bear in mind that most public buses are not well maintained and many don’t have seatbelts.
Taxis are widely available. If you are taking a taxi, ensure it is registered (registered taxis can be identified by their green licence plates) and ask for the fare before getting in (this will need to be paid in cash).
From the international airport, transport options are to rent a vehicle, take an Airport Taxi, a pre-booked shuttle or other taxi, or an internal flight.
Political situation
Political demonstrations can occur occasionally in Belize City and Belmopan. Most are peaceful.
Follow local media and avoid large gatherings of people or demonstrations.
