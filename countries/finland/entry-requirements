This page has information on travelling to Finland. Check what you must do to return to the UK.
This page reflects the UK government’s understanding of current rules for people travelling on a full ‘British Citizen’ passport from the UK, for the most common types of travel.
The authorities in Finland set and enforce entry rules.
If you’re fully vaccinated
If you’re fully vaccinated, you can enter Finland without needing an essential or compassionate reason for entry. You will need to demonstrate proof of being fully vaccinated at least 7 days prior to arrival. See ‘Proof of vaccination status’ below.
Find out if you qualify as fully vaccinated in Finland on the Finnish Institute for Health and Welfare’s website.
Proof of vaccination status
You must present proof that you have been fully vaccinated to enter Finland, otherwise you will need to demonstrate an essential or compassionate reason to enter.
You can use the UK’s proof of COVID-19 vaccination record or proof of COVID-19 vaccination issued in the Crown Dependencies. Your final vaccine dose must have been administered at least 7 days prior to travel. Proof of a full series of vaccinations is valid for 9 months. If you have had a booster shot, the proof of vaccination will be valid until further notice. Proof of recovery from COVID-19 will not be accepted for travellers from the UK demonstrating their COVID-19 status.
Your NHS appointment card from vaccination centres is not designed to be used as proof of vaccination and should not be used to demonstrate your vaccine status.
Residents of Finland
Permanent residents of Finland returning to Finland (e.g. persons who have registered the right of residence in Finland or with a residence permit granted by Finland) do not need to demonstrate proof of vaccination or an essential reason for entry. They will be granted entry to Finland from any country.
If you’re not fully vaccinated
If you’re not fully vaccinated, you will only be allowed to enter Finland if you can provide evidence of an essential or compassionate reason for entry. This does not include tourism.
Visit the Finnish Border Guard website (Section 2 - Entry into Finland from other countries) for full details.
If you have recovered from COVID-19 and have received one vaccine dose, you will be considered fully vaccinated by the Finnish authorities and should follow the instructions in the above section. You will need to evidence this on a single certificate. Find out if you qualify as fully vaccinated in Finland on the Finnish Institute for Health and Welfare’s website.
Children and young people
Young people born in 2007 or later are exempt from Finland’s COVID-19 entry requirements and they do not need to provide proof of vaccination or take a COVID-19 test, if they are ac-companied by a fully vaccinated adult guardian.
You can use the FINENTRY service to check entry requirements and book COVID-19 tests on arrival, if applicable. Visitors to Lapland can also familiarise themselves with entry requirements on the Laplandentry website.
If you’re transiting through Finland
Transiting is when you pass through one country on the way to your final destination.
There are no Finnish restrictions on cross-border traffic with other states in the Schengen area for commuter and other essential traffic. Restrictions for other travellers remain in place. See the Finnish Border Guard website for more information.
Passengers are allowed to transit through Helsinki Airport as long as they can verify acceptance at their final destination. Finavia strongly recommend that passengers use face-masks as they travel round airports in Finland, and Finnair have made the wearing of face-masks mandatory for passengers aged seven or over on their flights. Please check your carrier’s requirements before travelling.
Exemptions
Citizens of Finland, permanent residents in Finland, people travelling to Finland for essential or compassionate reasons and children born in 2007 or later are exempt from proving vaccination status or COVID-19 recovery status.
HGV drivers
HGV drivers from the UK entering Finland do not have to show a negative COVID-19 test, proof of vaccination or proof of recovery and do not have to quarantine.
Check your passport and travel documents before you travel
If you are planning to travel to an EU country (except Ireland), or Switzerland, Norway, Iceland, Liechtenstein, Andorra, Monaco, San Marino or Vatican City, you must meet the Schengen area rules.
Passport validity
Your passport must meet two requirements. It must be:
less than 10 years old on the day you enter (check the ‘date of issue’)
valid for at least 3 months after the day you plan to leave (check the ‘expiry date’)
We are asking the European Commission to clarify the 10-year rule. Their guidance for Schengen border guards may not be updated until the spring of 2022. Until then, for some Schengen countries your passport may need to be less than 10 years old during your whole visit, and the 3 months at the end of your visit may need to be within 10 years of your passport’s issue date.
Check both the issue date and the expiry date in your passport. If you renewed your passport early, extra months may have been added to its expiry date. This could affect the requirement for your passport to be less than 10 years old.
Contact your travel provider or embassy of the country you are visiting if you think that your passport does not meet both these requirements. Renew your passport if you need to.
Check with your travel provider to make sure your passport and other travel documents meet their requirements.
UK Emergency Travel Documents
UK Emergency Travel Documents (ETDs) are accepted for entry, airside transit and exit from Finland.
Entering Finland with children
Minors are permitted to enter Finland with an adult who is not their legal guardian (such as grandparents) but you are advised to carry a free-form letter of consent from the legal guardian(s) including their contact details.
If you have further queries about entry to Finland you can contact the Finnish Border Guard directly on their helpline (+358 295 420 100), open Monday to Friday between 8am and 4pm Finnish local time (GMT +2).
