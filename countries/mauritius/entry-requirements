Entry rules in response to coronavirus (COVID-19)
Entry to Mauritius and quarantine requirements
On 6 March, in response to the COVID-19 situation, the Government of Mauritius announced the suspension of all international flight arrivals. These restrictions have been extended to 15 July. Some departures remain scheduled.
On 11 June, the Government announced that fully vaccinated tourists will be allowed to enter Mauritius from 15 July. Until 30 September, they will have to remain at their holiday resort for 14 days. They will then be allowed to explore the island on presentation of a negative PCR test. From 1 October, vaccinated travellers will be allowed entry without restrictions on presentation of a negative PCR test taken within 72 hours of travel. From 15 July, unvaccinated tourists are not allowed to enter Mauritius. Only unvaccinated Mauritian nationals are allowed to return home but will need to quarantine for 14 days on arrival in dedicated quarantine facilities. You can find further details on the My Mauritius website.
Regular entry requirements
Visas
You don’t need a visa to enter Mauritius. On arrival, your passport will be stamped allowing entry to the country for 60 days. You’ll need to be able to provide evidence of onward or return travel.
If you intend to work in Mauritius, you must get a work permit before you travel.
The Mauritian immigration services have confirmed that foreign nationals in Mauritius on a tourist entry do not need to extend their “leave to stay” period (as stamped in your passport on arrival) if it is due to expire during the current confinement period.
Passport validity
Your passport should be valid for the proposed duration of your stay. No additional period of validity beyond this is required. It should have at least one blank passport page.
UK Emergency Travel Documents
UK Emergency Travel Documents (ETDs) are accepted for entry, transit and exit from Mauritius.
