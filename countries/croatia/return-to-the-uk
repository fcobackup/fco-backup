British travellers currently in Croatia are permitted to leave the country. You should contact your travel provider with questions regarding your onward travel arrangements.
You will need to pay for your return travel to the UK. If departure options are available but you cannot afford the travel costs and have exhausted all other options for getting funds, you may be eligible to apply for an emergency loan from the government. This is a last resort option and you would need to repay the loan when you are back in the UK. For more information, you should contact Corporate Travel Management (CTM). CTM are a commercial partner of the FCO and are authorised to administer such loans on behalf of the FCO.
Dubrovnik International Airport is currently closed to all passengers until further notice. Other airports remain open but you should check with your airline on the status of your flight as airport operations may be subject to change at short notice.
On 27 March Croatian immigration authorities announced that foreign travellers to Croatia who are unable to leave due to COVID-19 restrictions will not face sanctions for overstaying the conditions of their stay.
