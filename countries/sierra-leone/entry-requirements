Entry rules in response to coronavirus (COVID-19)
Entry to Sierra Leone
In a travel advisory announcement on 10 September, the Government of Sierra Leone announced COVID-19 arrival and departure protocols for anyone wishing to travel to and from Sierra Leone. If you intend to travel to Sierra Leone, you must get authorisation from the Government of Sierra Leone through the online portal before you travel.
To get authorisation you must have:
proof of a negative PCR COVID-19 test result issued no earlier than 7 days prior to your date of travel;
you should not use the NHS testing service to get a test in order to facilitate your travel to another country. You should arrange to take a private test;
a pre-departure public health passenger locator form;
and proof of payment for on arrival COVID-19 tests paid for through the portal.
Arrivals whose stay in the country does not exceed 5 days do not require to be tested again before leaving the country. However passengers are required to request a certificate of the negative PCR test result that was administered to them when they arrived in Sierra Leone.
Testing on arrival
On arrival at Freetown Lungi International airport, all passengers are required to have both a COVID-19 PCR and RDT test (in addition to the negative test result required to get authorisation to travel to Sierra Leone). If you test negative for the RDT test, you’ll be allowed to leave the airport and to travel to your final destination, where you must observe public health protocols while you wait for the result of your PCR test (which is expected to take no more than 48 hours).
Quarantine requirements
If you test positive for the RDT test, you’ll be required to quarantine at a hotel in Lungi at your own expense while you wait for the result of your PCR test. The PCR result supersedes the RDT result. If you test positive for the PCR test result, you’ll be contacted by Sierra Leonean health authorities and taken to a state treatment centre. Passengers sitting in close proximity to a positive case on the flight will be treated as a primary contact and be required to self-isolate until you return a negative PCR COVID-19 test. Social distancing and the use of facemasks is mandatory at Freetown Lungi International airport.
Testing on departure
Before departure from Sierra Leone, you’ll need to pay for and take a PCR COVID-19 test through the portal within 72 hours of your departure. Certificates confirming the test result will be emailed to you and copies made available for you to collect in person at the airport. You’ll need to provide this certificate confirming your test result at check-in. If you test positive, you’ll not be allowed to travel and you’ll need to follow public health protocols for isolation and contact tracing.
If your stay in Sierra Leone is for 5 days or less, you are exempt from needing a further test ahead of departure You’ are exempt from the COVID-19 test on departure if you arrived in Sierra Leone fewer than 5 days before departing. Children under two years of age are also exempt.
If you think you have COVID-19 symptoms you should call the Government of Sierra Leone emergency line on 117 (local). Treatment for coronavirus cases is carried out at Government of Sierra Leone facilities.
