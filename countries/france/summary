France will host the G7 Summit in Biarritz from 24 to 26 August 2019. Traffic measures will be put in place to manage traffic demands in the local area during and in the run up to this period. The authorities will prohibit road traffic in the centre of Biarritz, redirecting traffic to the A63 motorway. They will extend national restrictions on the movement of heavy goods vehicles in the local area, particularly those carrying especially heavy or Class 1 dangerous goods. You should plan travel in advance, follow the instructions of the local authorities and keep up to date with developments, including via this travel advice and the Bison Futé website.
A counter-summit/demonstration against the G7 is planned for Saturday 24 August in Hendaye, just south of Biarritz. This may lead to confrontations between demonstrators and the French security forces. There may also be confrontations in and around Biarritz itself. If these occur, you should avoid the demonstrations wherever possible and follow the advice of the local authorities.
Some protests linked to the yellow vest (gilets jaunes) movement continue across France, generally taking place on Saturdays. While now smaller in scale, previous demonstrations have led to violence. If demonstrations do turn violent, a heavy police/gendarmerie presence is to be expected. Motorists travelling through France may continue to experience some delays or blockages caused by local demonstrators - you should drive with caution as protestors may be present on roads, motorways and toll booths. In all cases, you should avoid demonstrations wherever possible and follow the advice of the local authorities.

There remain some migrants around Calais, who may seek to enter the UK illegally. There have been instances of migrants seeking to slow down traffic on approach roads to ports, including by placing obstacles on the Calais Port approach road. If this happens you should keep moving where it’s safe to do so, or stop and call 112 if isn’t safe to proceed (keeping car doors locked).
Terrorists are very likely to try to carry out attacks in France. Due to ongoing threats to France by Islamist terrorist groups, and recent French military intervention against Daesh (formerly referred to as ISIL), the French government has warned the public to be especially vigilant and has reinforced its security measures. Check the French government’s advice about what to do if a terrorist attack occurs. See Terrorism
