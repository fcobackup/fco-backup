The information on this page covers the most common types of travel and reflects the UK government’s understanding of the rules currently in place. Unless otherwise stated, this information is for travellers using a full ‘British Citizen’ passport.
The authorities in the country or territory you’re travelling to are responsible for setting and enforcing the rules for entry. If you’re unclear about any aspect of the entry requirements, or you need further reassurance, you’ll need to contact the embassy, high commission or consulate of the country or territory you’re travelling to.
You should also consider checking with your transport provider or travel company to make sure your passport and other travel documents meet their requirements.
Restrictions in response to coronavirus
Entry and borders
From 15 June, Ukraine has reopened its borders to foreign nationals. Upon arrival, all foreign nationals will be required to provide proof of health insurance that covers COVID-19 observation and treatment for the duration of their stay. Insurance must be purchased from a company registered in Ukraine or a foreign company that has a representative office or an insurance partner in Ukraine.
Transiting Ukraine
If you arrive from a country in the red zone and stay airside, you are not required to take insurance with COVID treatment coverage. For those entering Ukraine by land or sea and departing within two days of arrival, self-isolation or observation is not required. However, healthcare insurance for COVID-19 treatment and observation remains mandatory in this case.
Quarantine requirements
The country from which you are travelling will dictate whether or not you are required to self-isolate for 14 days upon arrival in Ukraine.
Travellers arriving from countries in what the Ukrainian authorities call the “red zone” (where there are more than 40 active COVID-19 cases per 100,000 people) are required to undergo 14 days’ self-isolation proven by the “Dii Vdoma” tracking app(see below), or quarantine in a Government-approved facility for 14 days upon arrival.
Mandatory self-isolation or quarantine can be cancelled if a traveller undergoes a PCR test and receives a negative result once in Ukraine. Further information about taking the tests and cancelling self-isolation in case of a negative result can be found via the ‘more detailed’ link of the ‘for citizens of “red zone” countries’ box on the Ukrainian authorities’ Visit Ukraine webpage.
Travellers arriving from countries in what the Ukrainian authorities call the “green zone” (where the figure is under 40 active COVID-19 cases per 100,000 people), are not required to undergo self-isolation or observation on arrival.
Citizens of “red” countries who can prove that they have spent the last 14 days in “green” countries are treated as arriving from the “green zone”, and will not be required to isolate. Currently, the UK falls into the “red zone”. Check the list of red and green zone countries (updated daily) by clicking the “more detailed” links in the “for citizens of green/red zones” information boxes..
Self-isolation on entry to Ukraine can be completed at your chosen address using the “Dii Vdoma” mobile app. You need to have a Ukrainian mobile phone number with the SIM card activated before you arrive in the country, though the SIM does not need to be in your phone on arrival. When using the app, you must respond promptly to notifications sent to your mobile (in Ukrainian).
More information about the app is available on the Cabinet of Ministers website or the Visit Ukraine webpage. Make sure that you understand the regular reporting requirements before taking up this option. People who do not register with the Dii Vdoma app, or who do not abide by its terms, are required to complete quarantine at a government-approved observation centre.
Travellers arriving in Ukraine or crossing the administrative points from non-government-controlled parts of Donetsk and Luhansk oblasts and Crimea will be subject to health monitoring on arrival. You should comply with any additional screening measures put in place by the authorities.
Further information about visiting Ukraine during the quarantine period can be found at the Ukrainian authorities’ Visit Ukraine webpage.
Regular entry requirements
Visas
British Citizen passport holders can enter Ukraine without a visa for visits of up to 90 days within a 180 day period. Ukraine has confirmed that this policy will continue to apply to British citizens until 30 January 2021. This page will be updated as soon as further information on visa rules from 31 January 2021 onwards is available.
If you’re planning to stay in Ukraine for longer than 90 days in a 180 day period, you need to get a visa. For more advice on entry requirements contact the Ukrainian Embassy in London or Consulate General in Edinburgh.
You don’t need to complete an immigration card. Immigration officials may require you to scan your fingerprints as part of biometric data collection at border crossing points. For more details, visit the website of the State Border Guard Service of Ukraine
Proof of financial means
You may be asked to provide evidence that you have sufficient funds to support you during your stay. The Ukrainian authorities accept the following as a proof of sufficient funds: cash, bank cards along with bank statements, accommodation bookings, tourist vouchers, a letter from the person or company you’re visiting stating that they will cover your expenses, a return ticket or onward travel ticket. You can find more information on the websites of the Ukrainian Embassy in the UK and State Border Service of Ukraine.
Passport validity
If you’re travelling without a visa, your passport should be valid for the proposed duration of your stay. No additional period of validity beyond this is required.
If you’re applying for a visa, your passport may need to have an additional period of validity. Check with the Ukrainian Embassy in London for further details.
Borders
It’s illegal under Ukrainian law to enter internationally recognised Ukrainian territory through a border point that isn’t currently controlled by the Ukrainian authorities. If you do so, you risk arrest or a fine, and you may be subject to a travel ban.
International border crossings that aren’t currently under the control of the Ukrainian authorities include all land border crossings into Donetsk oblast, many of the land border crossings into Luhansk oblast, all air and sea ports in Crimea and the Kerch Bridge road and rail crossing into Crimea.
If you intend to visit any of the areas not controlled by the Ukrainian authorities, you should apply to the State Migration Service of Ukraine for a special entry permit. Information on border crossing procedure, entry/exit regulations and checkpoints are provided at the State Border Guard Service of Ukraine website.
UK Emergency Travel Documents
UK Emergency Travel Documents are accepted for entry, airside transit and exit from Ukraine.
Customs regulations
You can find general information about importing and exporting items on the website of the State Fiscal Service of Ukraine (in Ukrainian).
