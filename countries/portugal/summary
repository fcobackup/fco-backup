Portugal declared a state of emergency on 18 March. This has activated a series of measures including significant restrictions on movement throughout the country in response to the coronavirus outbreak - see Health.
British travellers who are currently in Portugal and who wish to return to the UK are advised to make travel plans to do so as soon as possible.
Since 19 March flights from Portugal to countries outside the EU/EEA, with the exception of the UK, USA, Canada, Venezuela, South Africa and Portuguese speaking countries have been suspended. Flights to Brazil will be limited to Rio de Janeiro and São Paulo. Flights to and from Italy and Spain remain suspended.
While flights to the UK are not affected by these measures, airlines have cancelled a number of flights between the UK and Portugal. If your travel plans are likely to be affected, or you want to check on the status of your flight, contact your airline or travel company for the latest information.
From 16 March until 15 April, there will be border controls on the land border with Spain. Cross border workers, goods traffic and people entering or leaving Portugal to return to their place of residence will be allowed to travel.
British nationals can still drive through Spain and France to return to the UK. While driving through France, they will need to complete an ‘attestation’ (declaration) specifying the reason for being outside.
If you are planning to use this route, check the latest travel advice for Spain and France ahead of your journey.
Around 2.2 million British nationals visited Portugal in 2018. Most visits are trouble-free.
