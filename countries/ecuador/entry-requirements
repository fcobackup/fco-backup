The information on this page covers the most common types of travel and reflects the UK government’s understanding of the rules currently in place. Unless otherwise stated, this information is for travellers using a full ‘British Citizen’ passport.
The authorities in the country or territory you’re travelling to are responsible for setting and enforcing the rules for entry. If you’re unclear about any aspect of the entry requirements, or you need further reassurance, you’ll need to contact the embassy, high commission or consulate of the country or territory you’re travelling to.
You should also consider checking with your transport provider or travel company to make sure your passport and other travel documents meet their requirements.
Entry rules in response to coronavirus (COVID-19)
Entry to Ecuador
All land borders with Colombia and Peru remain closed until further notice.
As of 1 June, international commercial flights resumed limited operations. The restriction on international arrivals has also been lifted.
Testing / screening on arrival
Upon arrival, passengers will be required to sign a declaration form with their itinerary and local contact details. They must also present a negative Polymerase Chain Reaction (PCR) test for COVID-19, taken up to 7 days prior to departure.
In countries where the PCR tests are not available, passengers must agree to take a COVID-19 test at the airport in Ecuador on arrival.
Quarantine requirements
All passengers will be subject to mandatory self-isolation (Aislamiento Preventivo Obligatorio – APO) for 14 days. This will be at the individual’s own expense, in hotels or private accommodation. People qualified as “priority attention groups” such as people over 65 years old, children and pregnant women, will be allowed to self-isolate at their homes.
The Ministry of Health has published more information on coronavirus protocols that also allows direct messaging with the Ministry (Spanish only).
If you need to find emergency accommodation to go through the mandatory self-isolation protocol, you can access options on the Ministry of Foreign Affairs and Human Mobility website.
The Government will monitor the situation in other countries with high risk of contagion to prevent incoming flights.
Travel to and from the Galapagos
From 1 July, tourist activities will be allowed in the Galapagos. Foreigners wishing to enter the islands must present a negative Polymerase Chain Reaction (PCR) test for COVID-19, taken 96 hours prior to the date of departure to Ecuador.
Tourists must also present a safe passage document from the Ministry of Tourism to be exempt from doing 14 days of self-isolation on the islands. The tour operators or hotels can arrange this safe passage document.
If you are in the Galapagos, the authorities have issued a Whatsapp group invitation for people to get information on flight opportunities to leave the islands, which can be accessed here and here. Authorities are aware that the groups have a limited capacity, so please keep trying.
If you have any queries regarding travel back to mainland Ecuador, you can contact the Galapagos authorities via email at galapagosresponder@gmail.com
Visa extensions
The Ministry of Foreign Affairs (MFA) has confirmed that all tourist visas will be granted automatic extension if they expire while the state of emergency is in place (until 15 August). Once the state of emergency is over, visitors will have 30 days either to leave the country or to apply for an official extension without paying any fine.
Immigration officials have created a standard email to request extensions (“prórrogas”) for visitor visas, by sending their full name and attaching a copy of their passports to: servicios.migratorios@ministeriodegobierno.gob.ec.
The MFA has made an appointment system available for visa renewals in Quito: citasvisas@cancilleria.gob.ec. For more information on visas, call +593 (2) 993200 ext. 23007 and 23015.
Travelling to the airport
When travelling to the airport outside of curfew hours, including travel between provinces, you need a safe passage document. Email BritishEmbassy.Quito@fco.gov.uk to get one. A consular officer will respond as quickly as possible.
It is very important that you carry documents that justify your movement, including a confirmed flight booking, your passport and the safe passage document referred to above. A safe passage document is required for each traveller.
Once you have filled out the form, you will need to send a copy or photo via email to the Ministry of Foreign Affairs at dcp@cancilleria.gob.ec so they can confirm validity if you are stopped.
Drivers and taxis need to arrange their own safe passage document through this updated website
Regular entry requirements
Visas
You can visit Ecuador without a visa, but you may be asked about your reason for travel and to provide evidence of a return or onward flight/bus ticket when you arrive. On arrival in the country, you’ll normally be allowed to remain in Ecuador for up to 90 days per year.
If you’re planning to stay for longer, you should apply for a visa from the Ecuadorean Embassy in London (or from another Ecuadorean embassy overseas) before you travel. You can extend your 90 days for a further 90 days (before the first period expires) only once and by paying a fee. If you want to change your immigration status, by applying for another type of visa, you can do so at the Ecuadorean Ministry of Foreign Affairs and Human Mobility before the 90 or 180 days expires.
The penalty for overstaying involves a fine. As with other immigration offences, if the fine is not paid, you will not be able to return to Ecuador for 2 years and your name will remain on immigration records. If the fine is paid, you can return with an official visa issued by an Ecuadorean Embassy overseas. The relevant deportation local regulation is still under consideration.
If you wish to work or study in Ecuador, check visa requirements with the Ecuadorean Embassy in London before travelling.
As of January 2019, permanent and temporary resident visas are issued electronically. Ecuadorean visas are no longer stuck in passports. The online visa is sent by email to be printed out. The immigration authorities have access to online visa records.
If you enter Ecuador via the border with Peru or Colombia, you must insist on being given an official entry stamp at the border showing the date of your arrival. There have been cases of buses not stopping at the border, which has caused great difficulties for foreign visitors for failing to comply with immigration regulations. Travellers may need to return to the border entry point to get the required stamp and entry registration. If there is no exit stamp from the country you are coming from, in principle the Ecuadorean immigration officials cannot give you an entry stamp, thus you will be denied entry.
Although local regulations may not always be implemented, all visitors to the Galapagos Islands should provide a copy of their hotel booking. Likewise, visitors staying with local residents in the islands should have an invitation letter from their host available. The maximum stay in this region as a tourist is 60 days.
Passport validity
Your passport should be valid for a minimum period of 6 months from your date of entry. This is a strict legal requirement from the Ecuadorean government. If your passport does not meet this requirement, you will be denied entry to Ecuador.
UK Emergency Travel Documents
UK Emergency Travel Documents (ETD) are also accepted for entry, airside transit and exit from Ecuador. Your emergency travel document must be valid for a minimum period of 6 months from the date of entry into Ecuador.
Yellow fever certificate requirements
Check whether you need a yellow fever certificate by visiting the National Travel Health Network and Centre’s TravelHealthPro website. Please check if you will be required to present a yellow fever certificate to travel to your next destination from Ecuador. See Health
Travelling with children
Under Ecuadorean law, children under the age of 18 born in Ecuador are automatically considered as Ecuadorean citizens, even if travelling on a British passport (dual nationals).
They, along with British minors who have resident status in Ecuador, will need notarised written consent from the non-accompanying parent(s) to be able to leave the country. In non-straightforward situations due to a legal dispute, the child will need a judicial written permission (Autorización de Viaje Judicial) issued by a judge (Juzgado de la Niñez y Adolescencia). If one of the parents is deceased, the other parent would need to submit the death certificate to a public notary, so that an indefinite notarial permit to travel with the child is issued. The immigration authorities are responsible for checking all the above legal documents.
British children (or British-Ecuadorean dual nationals) who have tourist status do not need these permissions, unless they have stayed in Ecuador for over 90 days. If so, they need to comply with the same local regulations.
