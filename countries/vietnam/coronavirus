Cases of coronavirus (COVID-19) have been confirmed in Vietnam. The Vietnamese authorities have introduced a large number of measures to limit the spread of the virus including temporarily banning visits by foreigners and compulsory quarantine and self-isolation for anyone suspected of coming in to contact with the virus. The Vietnamese government have confirmed that it will cover all quarantine costs, but foreign nationals will be personally responsible for paying for any coronavirus hospital treatment costs.
You are strongly advised to familiarise yourself with these risks before travelling.

Quarantine
Widespread quarantine requirements are in place for anyone who may have come in to contact with coronavirus. The Vietnamese government have confirmed that it will cover all quarantine costs, but foreign nationals will be personally responsible for paying for any coronavirus hospital treatment costs.
Vietnamese quarantine centres are safe but basic, and most do not meet Public Health England standards. With the increased number of people in quarantine, it is likely that the standards of quarantine facilities will reduce further.
There have been instances of British nationals being turned away from, or asked to leave, hotels in Vietnam. You are at risk of being put into quarantine or instructed to self-isolate for 14 days even after you have arrived in Vietnam, if you either develop flu-like symptoms, or it is suspected you have been in contact with some who has tested for coronavirus.
You are strongly advised to familiarise yourself with these risks before travelling.
Local measures
Vietnam has closed tourist areas, bars, and concerts, particularly in Hanoi and Ho Chi Minh City.
People are required to wear facemasks in public areas.
You should follow the instructions of local authorities.
