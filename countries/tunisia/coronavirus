If you think you have COVID-19 symptoms, you should call 190 (emergency services SAMU). They will ask a series of questions to assess whether it is likely that you have COVID-19. If COVID-19 is suspected, then they will arrange for someone to come to your home or hotel to conduct a test and they will advise you to self-isolate. COVID-19 PCR tests are only offered free if you are displaying symptoms. You can also pay for a test, if required for travel purposes, at the Institut Pasteur.
