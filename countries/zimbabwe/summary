Zimbabwe’s economic situation remains unpredictable. As of 24 June 2019, the only legal tender in Zimbabwe is the “Zimbabwe Dollar”. This includes Zimbabwean bond notes, bond coins and mobile money such as ECOCASH: currently, there is no new “Zimbabwe dollar” note. There is a shortage of physical cash and it’s currently not possible to make cash withdrawals using an international bank card. You should check with your tour operator or hotel what payment methods will be accepted. There are some bureaux de change which will accept and change foreign currency, particularly US dollars. In shops and businesses you should check before making a transaction whether the price quoted is in Zimbabwean (RTGS) or US dollars as the symbol for both is $. It is recommended to check exchange rates prior to any transaction. Stock levels in supermarkets, including some basic commodities, are inconsistent. Some businesses, including some medical providers, may not accept payment by credit or debit card. Banks are experiencing challenges dispensing foreign currency cash including for international transfers from outside of Zimbabwe. See Money
