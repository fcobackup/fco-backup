When using an ATM, try to do so during business hours inside a bank, supermarket or large commercial building. Be particularly vigilant before and after using an ATM on the street, especially at night. Some ATMs don’t automatically release your card when you receive your money. You may have to push a button to release your card.
Not all shops, restaurants, bars and hotels accept credit cards, or may not accept all credit card types, and it is worth checking whether they do before ordering anything. Keep credit and debit card receipts.
Western Union is represented in Peru, with bureaux in all main cities. If you need more cash this is a quick, reliable way of receiving money from abroad. You will just need to identify yourself with valid ID.
Be alert to the possibility of being passed counterfeit US dollars or local currency, especially from street money changers. There have been reports of Intis (former Peruvian currency out of circulation) being provided by street money changers in Cusco tourist areas.
