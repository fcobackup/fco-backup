Terrorism 
There is a high threat of terrorist attack globally affecting UK interests and British nationals, including from groups and individuals who view the UK and British nationals as targets. Stay aware of your surroundings at all times.     
UK Counter Terrorism Policing has information and advice on staying safe abroad and what to do in the event of a terrorist attack. Find out how to reduce your risk from terrorism while abroad.
Terrorism in Poland
Terrorist attacks in Poland cannot be ruled out.
Attacks could be indiscriminate including in places visited by foreign nationals. Stay aware of your surroundings, keep up to date with local media reports and follow the advice of local authorities.
Russian invasion of Ukraine
Some Russian military strikes in Ukraine have hit within 20km of the Polish border.   
In 2022, there was an explosion in Przewodów near the Ukrainian border killing 2 Polish nationals. For the latest information, see Ukraine travel advice.  
Access to the land borders with Ukraine and Belarus are restricted. See Entry requirements.
Political situation and demonstrations
Public demonstrations are common. Marches and gatherings are mostly peaceful and well-policed, but take extra care in crowded places. Demonstrations, marches and gatherings can attract violence. Monitor local media and follow the instructions of local authorities.
Crime
Racially-motivated attacks   
Most visitors do not experience any difficulties. Serious crime against foreigners is rare, but crimes do occur and in some cases attacks have been racially motivated.
Protecting yourself and your belongings
Be alert to street crime and petty theft. Criminals view foreigners as easy targets. Keep valuables and cash out of sight, especially:
in crowded areas
in tourist spots
at main rail stations and on all train services and overnight sleeper trains
To reduce your personal risk:
avoid walking in isolated areas alone, especially at night
take care after withdrawing cash
Unofficial taxi drivers
Unofficial taxi drivers often overcharge. Passengers have been attacked, including sexual assaults, in unofficial taxis and cars booked using ride share apps. See further advice from the Polish police (in Polish).
Do not use unofficial taxis. Official taxis will:
have the name and telephone number of the taxi company on the door and top of the taxi
show a rate card on the window of the vehicle
Taxis with a crest but no company name are not official.
Drink spiking and alcohol
Victims of spiked drinks have been robbed in bars and clubs. Be careful about taking drinks from strangers or leaving your drink unattended.
Check your bill carefully when buying drinks in bars and nightclubs. Alcohol can reduce your vigilance, making you less in control. Visitors have been overcharged when paying for drinks at the end of the night by debit or credit card.      
Laws and cultural differences
Personal ID
Always carry ID. A printed copy of the photo page of your passport is acceptable.
Dual nationals
Dual Polish-British nationals will be treated as a Polish national if arrested or detained by the Polish authorities.
Illegal drugs
Illegal drugs, including cannabis, carry severe penalties. You should expect a long jail sentence and heavy fines for possessing, using or smuggling illegal drugs, including when transiting through the airport.
Airports in Poland have excellent technology and security for detecting illegal items. This is also used to scan the baggage of transiting passengers.
Alcohol laws
It is illegal to drink alcohol in public places. The police can arrest you and you could get a fine.
If you are drunk in a public place, the police can take you to a clinic to be medically assessed. You must stay there until you are sober, including overnight, and pay for your stay.
LGBT+ travellers
Same-sex sexual activity is legal, but Polish law does not recognise same-sex marriages and civil partnerships.
Small towns and rural areas can be less tolerant towards LGBT+ travellers. There are LGBT+friendly restaurants, clubs and bars in many towns and cities including Warsaw, Krakow, Wroclaw, Poznan, Gdansk and Sopot.
Read more advice for LGBT+ travellers.
Jaywalking
Police can fine you if you are jaywalking – ignoring pedestrian crossings or signals.
Photography
Avoid taking photographs of military or other security installations and any buildings or items of national infrastructure where there are signs prohibiting photography. This includes some border areas.
Transport risks
Reflective clothing
Walkers and cyclists must wear a reflective item at night in non built-up areas. The authorities may hold you responsible if you are involved in an accident and not wearing a reflective item. If police stop you without a reflective item, you could get a fine of 100 Polish zloty (around £20).
Public transport
Validate your public transport ticket at the start of the journey. You will get a fine if inspectors find you travelling on an invalid or unvalidated ticket.
Road travel
If you are planning to drive in Poland, see information on driving abroad and check the rules of the road in the RAC’s Poland guide. The guide lists driving regulations and other legal requirements you need to be aware of.
You can use a UK photocard driving licence to drive in Poland for up to 6 months. If you still have a paper driving licence, you may need to update it to a photocard licence or get the 1968 version of the international driving permit (IDP) as well. 
When driving, always bring your:
driving licence
ID
car registration document
insurance documents
You will need to show these if you are stopped by the police or if you cross non-Schengen borders. If you do not have them, the police may take your vehicle and charge fees.
Check if you need a UK sticker to drive your car outside the UK.
Hire car companies often have stricter requirements for their customers, such as a year of driving experience, a higher minimum age and holding an IDP. Most car rental companies will not allow you to take a hire car across the Poland-Ukraine border.
If you want to drive for longer than 6 months, see driving requirements for residents. 
Road conditions
Roadworks are frequent, particularly in summer, as the road network is repaired and upgraded. The major roads are heavily used by transport vehicles as Poland is a major east-west transit route.
Minor roads and even some main roads between major towns and cities can be narrow and poorly surfaced. Driving after dark on these roads is difficult.
Tolls
You must pay road tolls on some stretches of motorways, expressways and national roads. See the toll operator website for details.
Extreme weather and natural disasters   
Find out what you can do to prepare for and respond to extreme weather and natural hazards.
You may receive alerts on your mobile phone from the Polish government in the event of extreme weather, a natural disaster or other emergency. These are in Polish and English, and you should follow the authorities’ instructions. You can find out information about the text message alert system here and about the Government Centre for Security.
