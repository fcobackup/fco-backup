Since 25 March, all international flights to and from Kenya have been suspended by the Kenyan government, with the exception of specially negotiated repatriation flights and cargo flights. Crew must observe strict guidelines. This suspension was extended on 6 June for a further 30 days.
Despite some flights appearing on online bookings sites and airline websites, the Government of Kenya have confirmed airspace remains closed for routine international flights until at least 6 July. It is not yet known whether this suspension will be lifted or rolled over beyond that date. Before making a booking for any flight, confirm with the airline that they have all the necessary government permissions in place as refunds may not be possible.
Your journey home: re-entering the UK
When you return, you must follow the rules for entering the UK. You:
need to provide your journey and contact details up to 48 hours before you’re due to arrive in the UK
are not allowed to leave the place you’re staying for the first 14 days you’re in the UK except in very limited situations (known as ‘self-isolating’)
See also the list of people who are exempt from the border rules.
The National Travel Health Network and Centre (NaTHNaC) also provides advice on how to stay safe as you travel by air.
Future travel options
The British High Commission continues to work with the government of Kenya and international airlines to determine further options for helping British nationals who wish to return home. However, you should not expect any additional flights immediately.
If you’re in Kenya and wish to register your intention to leave, email the following details for you and any family members travelling with you to returnfromKenya@fco.gov.uk:
your full name as shown on your passport
passport number
date of birth
place of residence in UK
where exactly you are currently staying in Kenya
email address and telephone number (check that you are able to receive phone calls from unidentified numbers, including internationally, in case we need to reach you)
any specific medical needs/vulnerabilities
If registered with the British High Commission, we will alert you to any further opportunities to book onto flights departing Kenya for the UK, should these become available. This travel advice will also be updated when future options become available.
You will need to pay for your return travel to the UK. If you cannot afford the travel costs and have exhausted all other options for getting funds, you may be eligible to apply for an emergency loan from the government. This is a last resort option and you would need to repay the loan when you are back in the UK. For more information, contact the British High Commission via webform.
If you cannot leave Kenya at this time, see advice on staying in Kenya during coronavirus.
