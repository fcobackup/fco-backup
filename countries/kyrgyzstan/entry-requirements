This page has information on travelling to Kyrgyzstan. Check what you must do to return to the UK.
This page reflects the UK government’s understanding of current rules for people travelling on a full ‘British Citizen’ passport from the UK, for the most common types of travel.
The authorities in Kyrgyzstan set and enforce entry rules.
All travellers
You do not need a visa to enter Kyrgyzstan if staying in Kyrgyzstan for 60 days or less.
If a visa is required, visas for Kyrgyzstan are issued electronically through the portal “e-visa”. If you need further information about entry requirements or visa issues, visit the MFA visa website or contact the local immigration authorities.
You can contact the Kyrgyz visa service at e-visa@mfa.gov.kg or +996 312 66 30 70 and +996 703 42 88 65 (WhatsApp).
If you’re fully vaccinated
If you’re fully vaccinated, you can enter Kyrgyzstan without needing to test or quarantine. You do not need to show any proof of vaccination or proof of a negative test.
If you’re not fully vaccinated
You do not need to show any proof of vaccination, or proof of a negative test, or proof of recovery and there are no post-arrival testing or quarantine requirements.
Children and young people
If you are travelling to Kyrgyzstan you do not need to show any proof of vaccination or proof of a negative test and there are no post-arrival testing or quarantine requirements.
If you’re transiting through Kyrgyzstan.
Transiting is when you pass through one country on the way to your final destination.
Transiting through Kyrgyzstan is permitted for travellers who meet the requirements of their final destination.
If you are transiting through Kyrgyzstan on your way to another country and will be passing through immigration (sometimes known as a layover), for example to stay in a hotel for a flight the next day, you need to follow normal entry requirements.
Check your passport and travel documents before you travel
Passport validity
If you are visiting Kyrgyzstan, your passport should be valid for six months from the date you arrive.
If you are a resident in Kyrgyzstan, your passport must be valid for six months from the date you arrive.
Check with your travel provider to make sure your passport and other travel documents meet their requirements.
UK Emergency Travel Documents
UK Emergency Travel Documents are accepted for entry, airside transit and exit from Kyrgyzstan. If using one to leave Kyrgyzstan, you must obtain an exit visa from OVIR (the Department for Visa and Registration under the Ministry of Internal Affairs). This takes at least 5 working days.
Yellow fever certificate requirements
Check whether you need a yellow fever certificate by visiting the National Travel Health Network and Centre’s TravelHealthPro website.
Registration
On 19 December 2016, the government of Kyrgyzstan approved a decree removing the requirement for British nationals staying in Kyrgyzstan for longer than 5 days to register with the local authorities. You now only need to register your stay with the State Registration Service if you’re visiting for more than 60 calendar days. If you’re staying for more than 60 calendar days you must register within 5 days of entry into Kyrgyzstan and you must register for the period of validity of your visa.
Foreigners can now register through the electronic services portal (available in Russian and Kyrgyz only). Foreign citizens can act as a host and register visitors staying in their homes. The registration coupon with QR-code on the forms can be obtained online and printed on a regular printer.
