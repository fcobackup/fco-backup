This page has information on travelling to Germany. Check what you must do to return to the UK.
This page reflects the UK government’s understanding of current rules for people travelling on a full ‘British Citizen’ passport from the UK, for the most common types of travel.
The authorities in Germany set and enforce entry rules.
All travellers
The UK is not currently designated as a high-risk area. Residents of the UK are only permitted to enter Germany if they serve in an important role, if they have an urgent need to travel, or if they are fully vaccinated. The German Embassy in London has more detailed information on permissions. Children under the age of 12 who are not yet vaccinated can enter the country with proof of a negative test result (PCR test or antigen test) when accompanied by at least one fully vaccinated parent. Children under the age of six do not require proof of a negative test result.
All travellers entering Germany having spent time in the previous 10 days in a country designated at the time of entry as a high-risk or virus variant area are required to complete pre-departure digital registration, regardless of vaccination status. All travellers aged 12 or over entering Germany from anywhere abroad must carry with them a negative test result or proof of vaccination or recovery. Proof of recovery requires at least 28 days and no more than 90 days to have elapsed since the date of the positive COVID-19 test.
If you’re fully vaccinated
You may enter Germany from the UK for any travel purpose if you are fully vaccinated.
Proof of vaccination status
Travellers aged 12 or over entering Germany from abroad must possess either proof of vaccination, proof of recovery or a negative COVID-19 test prior to arrival and present this proof on request to carriers or authorities.
A full list of German requirements and information needed as proof can be found in English at the Ministry for Health webpages and from the German Embassy in London.
Germany will accept the UK’s proof of COVID-19 recovery and vaccination record and proof of COVID-19 vaccination issued in the Crown Dependencies. Your final vaccine dose must have been administered at least 14 days prior to travel. Evidence of your COVID-19 vaccination status can be provided digitally or as a printout (through the NHS app or NHS website). This can also be requested from the NHS by calling 119. A screenshot or photo is not sufficient. Further details can be found (in English) on the German Embassy website.
If you have received a booster, you are considered fully vaccinated for entry into Germany. There is currently no expiry date for booster jabs. If you have not received a booster, but have received two doses of a vaccine approved for use by Germany, then at least 14 days and no more than 270 days must have passed since your second dose, to qualify as fully vaccinated.
Your NHS appointment card from vaccination centres is not designed to be used as proof of vaccination and should not be used to demonstrate your vaccine status.
If you’re not fully vaccinated
Travellers from the UK to Germany who are not fully vaccinated may not currently enter Germany unless they are a German citizen; the spouse/partner/child under 18 of a German citizen; a resident of Germany; the spouse/partner/child under 18 of a resident of Germany; serve in an important role; or have an urgent need to travel.
Children between 0 to 5 years old and unvaccinated 6 to 11 year olds may enter if accompanied by a fully vaccinated parent. All permitted unvaccinated or unrecovered travellers aged 12 or over from the UK arriving in Germany need a negative COVID-19 test result. It can be either a PCR test that is no more than 48 hours old at the time of departure, or a rapid antigen or other test sample that is no more than 48 hours old at the time of entry. The result of the test required by the authorities can be either in paper or electronic form in German, English, French, Italian, or Spanish.
For more information on acceptable tests, see “What tests are recognised?” on the Federal Health Ministry website.
Quarantine after travel from high-risk areas
Travellers arriving from high-risk areas who are not fully vaccinated, are subject to 10-day quarantine, and test and release is available after 5 days. Fully vaccinated and recovered individuals are exempt from this requirement, once they have uploaded their proof of status on the pre-departure digital registration portal.
If, in the 10 days before you travel to Germany, you have been in an area designated at the time of entry as presenting an increased risk of infection, you must register online in advance of travelling to Germany. On arrival, you must travel to your accommodation and quarantine there for up to 14 days. If you are travelling from a high-risk area, you can be released from quarantine immediately if you provide one of the following with the pre-departure digital registration:
a negative C-19 test (only available after 5 days for travel from high-risk areas such as the UK)
proof that you are fully vaccinated (this means that you have taken the last of the recommended doses of a C-19 vaccine authorised in the EU more than 14 days ago)
proof that you have recently recovered from a C-19 infection. Proof of recovery is a positive PCR test no older than six months, but older than 28 days
If you are travelling from a virus variant area, you must quarantine for the full 14 days, and do not have access to early test to release.
For travel from designated high-risk areas there are some exemptions from the quarantine requirement, including for cross-border workers and individuals deemed to be providing essential activities. For precise details, see the Federal Health Ministry website page under the section, “What are the exemptions from the obligation to quarantine on entry?”.
If you have specific questions about the quarantine requirements which apply in your particular case, you should contact the local public health authority in your place of residence. You should also contact your local public health authority for further details on test and release. You can identify the relevant authority on the Robert Koch Institute webpage. Travellers from virus variant areas may be required by local public health authorities to undergo additional testing after arrival.
If you’ve had COVID-19 in the past year
Individuals who can prove recovery from the virus and the fully vaccinated are exempt from quarantine requirements. Proof of recovery requires at least 28 days and no more than 90 days to have elapsed since the date of the positive COVID-19 test (see ‘Quarantine after travel from high-risk areas’ and ‘Proof of vaccination status’).
Children and young people
Unvaccinated children 11 years of age and under are allowed to enter Germany from the UK as long as they travel with at least one fully vaccinated parent.
12 to 17 year olds may only enter if they are fully vaccinated, resident or the child of a resident, or have an urgent need to travel. If they are allowed to enter and are unvaccinated, they must have proof of a negative test or recovery.
For more information see the quarantine rules on the Federal Health Ministry website.
If you’re transiting through Germany
For further information about transiting Germany, see the Federal Interior Ministry website, under the heading “When is transit through Germany permitted?”. The Federal Health Ministry has a definition of transit under the question “What are the exemptions from the obligation to register?”.
Exemptions
Information about possible exceptions for non-residents is on the Federal Interior Ministry website, under “What constitutes an urgent need for travel”. The decision on whether to allow entry in such circumstances is at the discretion of border guards.
HGV drivers and transport personnel
HGV drivers and other transport personnel, such as persons who enter the country from the UK on business for the purpose of international transportation of people, goods or merchandise by land, sea or air are generally exempt from the requirement to possess a negative COVID-19 test, proof of vaccination or proof of recovery. They are also exempt from a requirement to quarantine when entering Germany, provided they were not in the previous 10 days in an area designated at the time of entry into Germany as a virus variant area.
See “What are the exemptions from the obligation to furnish proof?” and 1. Transport Personnel on this page for more information on testing and vaccination.
See “What are the exemptions from the obligation to quarantine on entry?” and 2. Transport personnel on this page for more information on quarantine for this group.
Check your passport and travel documents before you travel
Passport validity
If you are planning to travel to an EU country (except Ireland), or Switzerland, Norway, Iceland, Liechtenstein, Andorra, Monaco, San Marino or Vatican City, you must follow the Schengen area passport requirements.
Your passport must be:
issued less than 10 years before the date you enter the country (check the ‘date of issue’)
valid for at least 3 months after the day you plan to leave (check the ‘expiry date’)
You must check your passport meets these requirements before you travel. If your passport was issued before 1 October 2018, extra months may have been added to its expiry date.
Contact the embassy of the country you are visiting if you think that your passport does not meet both these requirements. Renew your passport if you need to.
Visas
You can travel to countries in the Schengen area for up to 90 days in any 180-day period without a visa. This applies if you travel as a tourist, to visit family or friends, to attend business meetings, cultural or sports events, or for short-term studies or training.
If you are travelling to Germany and other Schengen countries without a visa, make sure your whole visit is within the 90-day limit. Visits to Schengen countries within the previous 180 days before you travel count towards your 90 days.
To stay longer, to work or study, for business or for other reasons, you will need to meet the German government’s entry requirements. Check with the German Embassy what type of visa and/or work permit, if any, you will need.
If you are travelling to Germany for work, read the guidance on visas and permits. You can get detailed information on employment regulations from the German Embassy.
If you stay in Germany with a residence permit or long-stay visa, this does not count towards your 90-day visa-free limit.
Passport stamping
Check your passport is stamped if you enter or exit the Schengen area through Germany as a visitor. Border guards will use passport stamps to check you’re complying with the 90-day visa-free limit for short stays in the Schengen area. If relevant entry or exit stamps are not in your passport, border guards will presume that you have overstayed your visa-free limit.
You can show evidence of when and where you entered or exited the Schengen area, and ask the border guards to add this date and location in your passport. Examples of acceptable evidence include boarding passes and tickets.
You may also need to:
show a return or onward ticket
show you have enough money for your stay
If you are resident in Germany, read our Living in Germany guide for passport stamping information.
Proof of residence
If you are resident in Germany, carry proof of your residence when travelling. If you were living in Germany before 1 January 2021, you should carry your residence document (Aufenthaltsdokument-GB), as well as your valid passport when you travel. If you have applied but not yet received your document, carry your certificate of application (Fiktionsbescheinigung).
If you cannot show that you are resident in Germany, you may be asked additional questions at the border to enter the Schengen area, and your passport may be stamped. This will not affect your rights in Germany.
UK Emergency Travel Documents
UK Emergency Travel Documents (ETDs) are accepted for entry, airside transit and exit from Germany.
