There are currently no regular commercial options available to return to the UK from Oman. Oman suspended all international flights on Sunday 29 March and land borders are closed.
Oman Air flight

Whatsapp (or call): +968 9595 1000 (09:00-14:00 daily)
The cut-off date to register interest with Oman Air is 13 May. If there is not sufficient interest, Oman Air will not operate the flight.
Future travel options
The UK government is working closely with the airlines, the Omani authorities and British companies exploring private repatriation for their staff, to make sure options are available for you to return to the UK as soon as possible.
This travel advice will be updated when departure options become available.
You will need to pay for your return travel to the UK. If departure options are available but you cannot afford the travel costs and have exhausted all other options for getting funds, you may be eligible to apply for an emergency loan from the government. This is a last resort option and you would need to repay the loan when you are back in the UK. For more information, you should contact Corporate Travel Management (CTM). CTM are a commercial partner of the FCO and are authorised to administer such loans on behalf of the FCO.
