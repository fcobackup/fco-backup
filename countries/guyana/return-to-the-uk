There are currently extremely limited commercial options available to return to the UK from Guyana.
The Government of Guyana has announced the cancellation of all international flights from Cheddi Jagan International Airport at Timehri and the Eugene Correia Airport at Ogle. The closure started on 17 March 2020 and is scheduled to last for the foreseeable future.
The flight which departed on 7 May will be the only UK organised special flight from Guyana.
Eastern Airlines operate occasional charter flights between Guyana and the USA. For information on availability and to make reservations, visit the Eastern Airlines website. You will need to book onward connections from the USA. This is a commercial arrangement and as such we cannot be responsible for delays or cancellations that might take place.
You will not be able to transit the USA if you have been to the UK, European Union Schengen Area or the Republic of Ireland in the last 14 days and you will require an ESTA to travel. Cost of the ESTA is USD14. Visit the ESTA website to apply for an ESTA.
The Governments of Brazil and Suriname have both announced the closure of borders with neighbouring countries, including Guyana. There is no exit/entry available to Venezuela.
Future travel options
We know this is concerning for British people trying to leave Guyana. The UK government is working closely with airlines, the Guyana authorities and other governments to make sure commercial options are available for you to return to the UK as soon as possible.
This travel advice will be updated when departure options become available. If you are a British national in Guyana or Suriname and wish to leave, you should contact the British High Commission by email returnfrom.guyana@fco.gov.uk, who will inform you as soon as departure options become available.
Your journey home: re-entering the UK
When you return, you must follow the rules for entering the UK. You:
need to provide your journey and contact details up to 48 hours before you’re due to arrive in the UK
are not allowed to leave the place you’re staying for the first 14 days you’re in the UK except in very limited situations (known as ‘self-isolating’)
See also the list of people who are exempt from the border rules.
The National Travel Health Network and Centre (NaTHNaC) also provides advice on how to stay safe as you travel by air.
Help and support
If you need urgent consular assistance, you can contact the British High Commission on 00592 226 5881.
The High Commission cannot provide further information or advice about departure options over the phone. Where possible, the British High Commission in Guyana will share relevant information about departure options on Facebook.
