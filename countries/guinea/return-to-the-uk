Coronavirus guidance is being updated.
Read what you can and cannot do

If you live in the UK and are currently visiting Guinea, you’re strongly advised to return now by commercial means. Don’t run the risk of getting stranded.
UK special charter flights will only operate for priority countries where commercial flights are not possible. You should not assume that these flights will become available in countries where commercial routes are operating.
See additional advice on making travel plans to return to the UK, or what to do if you cannot depart immediately.
There are currently extremely limited commercial options available to return to the UK from Guinea.
Guinea’s borders have been closed since 27 March. Conakry airport is officially closed to commercial passenger flights, but there remain occasional commercial options with Air France. Travel to Conakry from elsewhere in the country is forbidden so if you need to move to Conakry you should contact the local authorities.
What to do
If you’re a British national traveller, email BritishEmbassy.Conakry@fco.gov.uk providing your full name, passport number, date of birth, current location in Guinea, and details of how to contact you
If you cannot leave Guinea at this time, you should:
follow the advice of local authorities, including local measures to help minimise your risk of exposure to coronavirus
find accommodation that’s suitable for your needs.
keep in regular contact with family and friends at home, so they know you are safe and well

Future travel options
The UK Government is working closely with airlines, the Guinea authorities and other governments to make sure options are available for you to return to the UK as soon as possible.

You will need to pay for your return travel to the UK. If departure options are available but you cannot afford the travel costs and have exhausted all other options for getting funds, you may be eligible to apply for an emergency loan from the government. This is a last resort option and you would need to repay the loan when you are back in the UK. For more information, you should contact Corporate Travel Management (CTM). CTM are a commercial partner of the FCO and are authorised to administer such loans on behalf of the FCO.
