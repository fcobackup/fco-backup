Be prepared for your plans to change

Authorities in Equatorial Guinea do all official testing. If you test positive for COVID-19 while in country, you will be required to isolate immediately. Oil company employees will be able to isolate in oil company isolation facilities, whilst other individuals will have to go to one of the hotels which the government of Equatorial Guinea has nominated for isolation until a negative test is returned. This applies to all, including those under 18. There is no assistance available from the government for people who need to leave these hotels for any reason.
Plan ahead and make sure you:
can access money
understand what your insurance will cover
can make arrangements to extend your stay and be away for longer than planned
