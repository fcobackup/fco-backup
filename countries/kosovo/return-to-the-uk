There are now commercial options available to return to the UK from Kosovo. If you live in the UK and are currently visiting Kosovo, you’re strongly advised to return now by commercial means. Don’t risk getting stranded.
Flights
Following measures taken by the authorities in Kosovo, the airport reopened on 28 June and international flights are permitted. You should contact your airline for the latest information on flight status and availability over the coming months, however bear in mind that flights could be cancelled at short notice. All passengers entering Kosovo are recommended to have a negative RT-PCR test, no older than four days, although this is not obligatory. You can expect some health checks on arrival..
Travel via neighbouring countries
As restrictive measures ease, there may be options to return to the UK from neighbouring countries. Certain land border crossings have re-opened but with some protective measures. You should check FCO travel advice for the relevant country for options and before attempting to cross borders. See Entry requirements.
Your journey home: re-entering the UK
When you return, you must follow the rules for entering the UK. You:
need to provide your journey and contact details up to 48 hours before you’re due to arrive in the UK
are not allowed to leave the place you’re staying for the first 14 days you’re in the UK except in very limited situations (known as ‘self-isolating’)
See also the list of people who are exempt from the border rules.
The National Travel Health Network and Centre (NaTHNaC) also provides advice on how to stay safe as you travel by air.
Help and support
If you need consular assistance, you can contact the British Embassy in Pristina on +383 (0) 38 254 700 or pristina.consular@fco.gov.uk.
The Embassy cannot provide further information or advice about departure options over the phone. To get the latest information, sign up for travel advice email alerts.
You will need to pay for your return travel to the UK. If departure options are available but you cannot afford the travel costs and have exhausted all other options for getting funds, you may be eligible to apply for an emergency loan from the government. This is a last resort option and you would need to repay the loan when you are back in the UK.
If you cannot leave Kosovo
If you cannot leave Kosovo at this time, see advice on staying in Kosovo during coronavirus.
