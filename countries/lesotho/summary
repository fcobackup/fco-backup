The Foreign and Commonwealth Office (FCO) advise against all but essential travel to Lesotho. This is due to the South African authorities announcing measures restricting individuals entering South Africa if they have come from various countries affected by coronavirus (COVID-19), including the United Kingdom. These measures will come in to effect as of 18 March.
British Nationals in Lesotho, particularly those who have been in a coronavirus affected country (including the UK) in the past 20 days, should be aware that it is possible they may not be able to leave Lesotho by road after 18 March until South African restrictions are lifted, or amended, or may require a visa to do so.
However, British Nationals will still be able to transit through OR Tambo International Airport in Johannesburg.
