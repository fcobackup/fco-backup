Entry rules in response to coronavirus (COVID-19)
Entry to Bangladesh
Bangladesh authorities have said passengers arriving from coronavirus-affected countries, including the UK, should complete Health Declaration Forms and Passenger Locator Forms provided by cabin crew. You may be subjected to additional health screening measures at the airport.
Commercial passenger flights from the UK, together with flights from Malaysia, Turkey, the UAE, Qatar and Sri Lanka are now permitted to land in Bangladesh. You should check with airlines to confirm what flight options are available. Flight schedules are subject to change at short notice and you should monitor travel arrangements closely.
The temporary suspension of international passenger flights from: Bahrain, Bhutan, Hong Kong, India, Kuwait, the Maldives, Nepal, Oman, Saudi Arabia, Singapore and Thailand remains in force.
Medical certificate
On arrival in Bangladesh, all foreign nationals are required to produce a medical certificate issued within 72 hours of travel indicating the passenger is COVID-19 negative.
Quarantine requirements
Passengers arriving from coronavirus affected countries, including the UK, are also required to self-quarantine for 14 days. Health officials at the point of entry to Bangladesh will assess whether passengers are able to self-quarantine or need to be taken to a government facility.
Passengers with a No Visa Required certificate (an arrangement for foreign nationals of Bangladeshi heritage) arriving in Bangladesh without a medical certificate indicating they are COVID-19 negative, or such passengers who display symptoms, will be placed into quarantine in a government facility for 14 days. Such passengers who arrive with a medical certificate indicating they are COVID-19 negative are required to self-isolate at home for 14 days.
Regular entry requirements
Visas
You’ll need a visa to enter Bangladesh. You can get a visa from the Bangladesh High Commission in London. Foreign investors and business people can apply for a visa on arrival on entry to Bangladesh on production of a PCR based COVID-19 negative medical certificate (in or with an English translation) issued within 72 hours of arriving in Bangladesh and the relevant supporting documents for getting an investment/business visa. Visas on arrival for other people remain suspended.
Foreign nationals currently in Bangladesh with valid visas have the option of extending their visas by three months. Visa extensions are available at the Department of Immigration and Passport of Bangladesh. You should be aware that overstaying your visa could risk the imposition of penalty fines.
If you intend to use Dhaka as a hub to visit other countries in the region, make sure you get a multiple entry visa. If you’re intending to work in Bangladesh make sure you get the correct visa before you travel.
If you have had your passport renewed in Bangladesh, you’ll need a new visa. The Bangladesh Immigration & Passport Department (telephone: 880 2 8159878 / 8123788 / 8123323) is able to issue an ‘exit visa’ or a ‘no visa required’ stamp. Officers there are unlikely to speak English, so you may need an interpreter.
Make sure you have an entry stamp placed in your passport on entry into Bangladesh otherwise you may have problems on departure.
