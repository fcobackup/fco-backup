The currency in Russia is the Russian rouble (RUB).
Credit/debit cards are widely used in major Russian cities, including most hotels, restaurants, tourist attractions, supermarkets and other shops. ATMs are easy to find; predominantly in bank outlets.
Let your credit/debit card provider know where you’re going to avoid your card being blocked for anti-fraud reasons. You should report the loss of your credit/debit card to your provider as soon as possible.
It’s advisable to have some cash in roubles to meet any expenses. For example, taxi drivers are unlikely to accept card payments unless you are using an app.
Most major high street banks and currency exchange providers in the UK can pre-order roubles.
If you plan to buy roubles in Russia, you should take US dollars or euros to exchange, and only change money at banks, hotels and airport exchange bureaux. It is an offence to change money from street traders.
It’s illegal to pay directly for general transactions with dollars or euros.
