Travel in USA
Many airports in the USA have implemented safety measures designed to limit the spread of COVID-19. You should check the website of the airport you are flying into or transiting to see how these could affect you.
Some states have rules in place requiring travellers from other states, with high rates of COVID-19, to quarantine for 14 days or to provide proof of a negative COVID-19 test. Before travelling you should check the websites of the relevant state governments. Further information can be found on the CDC website.
A number of US states have mandated the use of masks and face coverings while in public. These will vary from state to state. You should consult the website of the state to which you are travelling. Contact details are found on the US.GOV site .
Further restrictions will vary locally with some states relaxing lockdown procedures while others are pausing or reversing their re-openings.
Penalties for breaches of regulations will vary between each state and may sometimes vary in different areas in the same state.
Accommodation
Hotels are re-opening across the USA but will be operating at capacities dictated by local rules and regulations.
Public places and services
Local regulations on shops, restaurants, bars, beaches and other leisure activities will likely be following measures designed to limit the spread of COVID-19. You should be aware that public places likely to attract large crowds may be closed at short notice. You should follow local media and any guidance issued by local authorities.
Healthcare in USA
