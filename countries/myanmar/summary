The Foreign, Commonwealth & Development Office (FCDO) advises against all but essential travel across Myanmar, based on recent political events and the current assessment of the COVID-19 risk. If you have concerns for your safety in the current situation, you should consider leaving Myanmar by commercial means. See Return to UK.
As of 1 February, the Myanmar military have declared a state of emergency and assumed control. Figures in the Civilian Government, civil society and a foreign national have been detained by the military. The British Embassy is following the situation carefully. The military has shut down access to various internet platforms and reports of disruptions to wider internet, phone networks and ATMs are widespread. You are advised to stay home at night, and minimise movement during the day, avoiding crowds. There is a nationwide curfew imposed between 8pm and 4am until further notice.
If you’re in Myanmar and you need consular assistance, call one of the following numbers:
+95 (0)1 370863
+95 (0)1 370864
+95 (0)1 370865
+95 (0)1 370867
There may be disruptions to local phone networks. If you are unable to get through to the Embassy on any of these numbers, call +44 020 7008 1500. Please note that this is an international number and you may be charged a different rate.
The military have extended the suspension of normal commercial passenger flights until 31 May 2021. However, the airport is open and some ‘relief’ flights are available for those seeking to leave Myanmar. Most of these are commercially bookable. See Flights for more information on options for leaving Myanmar. Land borders are closed.
The Visa Application Centre in Yangon is temporarily closed. Those British Nationals looking to return to the UK urgently with family members who require a visa to enter the UK, should contact YangonBritfamilyvisas@fcdo.gov.uk for initial advice. See Return to the UK.
If you wish to return to the UK from Myanmar, you should check what you need to do before leaving to meet UK entry requirements. Please be aware of current UK entry requirements. To enter the UK, you are currently required to:
complete a passenger locator form; and
provide proof of a negative coronavirus test.
You are normally required to show proof of a negative coronavirus test to your airline before being allowed to board.
However, as of 21 February, you do not need to take a test if you began your journey to England from Myanmar. The present situation in Myanmar means that it is not reasonable to seek to obtain a pre-departure coronavirus test in that country before departure to England. The guidance will be reviewed every 10 days, with the first review being 1 March 2021. Sign up to get an email alert whenever this page is updated.
Please note that you are advised against all but essential travel to Myanmar. If you are considering travelling to Myanmar, or planning to re-enter Myanmar, please note the following entry restrictions for Myanmar:
Residents of the United Kingdom, or those who have visited the United Kingdom within the previous 14 days, are currently unable to enter Myanmar.
Arrivals must comply with Myanmar’s COVID-19 quarantine requirements.
See Entry requirements for more information before you plan to travel, and find out what you need to know about coronavirus there in the Coronavirus section.
During the COVID-19 pandemic, it is more important than ever to get travel insurance and check it provides sufficient cover. See the FCDO guidance on foreign travel insurance.
For information about COVID-19 vaccines, see the Coronavirus page.
Take particular care in the border areas with China, Thailand, Bangladesh, India and Laos. The security situation in border areas is often volatile. Border areas have been particularly affected by military activity, ethnic militias, armed drug smugglers and the presence of landmines. There is ongoing conflict in the north of Shan State, Southern Chin, Kachin, Karen/Kayin and northern and central Rakhine states. In these areas, travellers should be prepared for a high armed, military and police presence including passing through checkpoints. There remains the possibility of violent clashes in other border areas. See Border areas
Political tension and unrest is widespread since the military takeover. You should avoid all demonstrations and large gatherings. Do not take photographs or videos of the police, demonstrations, military installations or military personnel. There is an increased security presence in Naypyitaw, Yangon and other areas. You should follow the news for your area, and avoid large crowds. See Political situation
Terrorists are likely to try to carry out attacks in Myanmar. You should remain vigilant and follow the advice of local authorities. See Terrorism
UK health authorities have classified Myanmar as having a risk of Zika virus transmission. For information and advice about the risks associated with Zika virus, visit the National Travel Health Network and Centre website.
Urban areas, particularly Yangon and Mandalay, can experience poor air quality. See Health
Credit and debit cards are increasingly accepted in major tourist areas but some cards do not work. Check in advance that your card will work. See Money
Most visits to Myanmar are trouble-free. The most common types of consular assistance cases are related to lost passports, petty theft and road accidents.
If you need to contact local emergency services, call 199 for police, 192 for medical assistance and 191 for the fire service. You should be aware that phone operators may not speak English. Tourist Police outposts are available in Yangon, Bagan and Mandalay with English speaking officers. You can only visit these posts in person and they are not contactable by phone. Their services may be affected by COVID-19 measures.
If you’re abroad and you need emergency help from the UK government, contact the nearest British embassy, consulate or high commission. We continue to operate a consular service. However, the ability of the British Embassy to provide face-to-face assistance within Myanmar is currently extremely limited, and the majority of Yangon is currently under a stay at home order. Consular support is also difficult in parts of Myanmar where embassy officials need travel permission from the Myanmar government. Permission is not guaranteed, so the British Embassy’s ability to deliver consular assistance, including in an emergency, may be restricted or delayed in these areas. If you’re arrested or detained, ask police or prison officials to notify the British Embassy immediately.
If you’re resident in Myanmar or planning to stay for a longer period, you can find advice on our Living in Myanmar guide.
The Overseas Business Risk service offers information and advice for British companies operating overseas on how to manage political, economic, and business security-related risks.
