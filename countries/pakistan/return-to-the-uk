The government of Pakistan has suspended normal scheduled international flights to and from Pakistan until at least 21 April.
Pakistan International Airlines (PIA) flights
Pakistan International Airlines (PIA) operated 22 commercial flights between 4-12 April. There was high demand for these flights. We understand that flight PK701 due to depart on 13 April has been cancelled and that PIA is contacting ticket holders. There are currently no further flights available to return to the UK from Pakistan. The British Government is working urgently to clarify PIA’s future planning and will provide further updates as soon as possible. The British Government is also working with the Government of Pakistan and airlines to look at all options for further flights to the UK.
