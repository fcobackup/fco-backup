This page gives you guidance on how to stay safely in Chile as a visitor, if you are unable to return to the UK.
Everyone should comply with the measures put in place in Chile to limit the spread of coronavirus (COVID-19).
Moving around in Chile
For information on entering Chile, see Entry Requirements.
Chilean President Sebastian Piñera announced a 90-day ‘National State of Catastrophe’ on Wednesday 18 March 2020. On 18 June this was renewed for a further 90 days. A nationwide curfew (10pm to 5am) has been in place since 22 March.
Quarantine and sanitary cordons
Quarantine orders and sanitary cordons are in place in Santiago and in other parts of the country.
Chile is deploying a flexible approach to bringing municipal areas (called comunas) in and out of quarantine/sanitary cordons. New measures can be announced by the government at any time and come into force shortly after, although changes are typically announced every Wednesday and are applied from Fridays onwards.
On 28 July, as part of the Chilean government’s step-by-step, five stage plan for the parts of Chile under quarantine orders to emerge in a phased manner from lockdown, comunas across Chile began to move from quarantine (Stage 1) into the ‘transition phase’ (Stage 2).
As of 11 August, the following comunas are in Stage 2: Metropolitan Region (Santiago): Lampa, La Reina, Las Condes, Lo Barnechea, Ñuñoa, Providencia and Vitacura and the outlying towns of Colina, Curacavi, Melipilla and Til Til.
Antofagasta region: Tocopilla.
O’Higgins region: Rancagua, Machalí and Graneros.
Valparaíso region: San Antonio and San Felipe.
Under this arrangement, in Stage 2, quarantine measures in those comunas are lifted between 0500 and 2200, Monday to Friday with those residing in the areas no longer having to apply for permission to leave their residence or to move within their communa. Social gatherings of no more than 10 people are allowed. However, quarantine measures remain in place at weekends and bank holidays, with the nationwide curfew still enforced seven days a week, as well as obligatory quarantine for those over 75 and a prohibition on movement to a secondary home.
All other parts of the metropolitan region of Santiago and five neighbouring municipalities (San Bernardo, Buin, Puente Alto, and Padre Hurtado) remain under Stage 1 quarantine. In addition, the urban areas of Peñaflor and San José de Maipo are under Stage 1 quarantine orders.
Full quarantine is also in place in:
Arica y Parinacota region: Arica
Tarapacá region: Iquique, Alto Hospicio, Pozo Almonte, and Los Andes;
Valparaíso region: Valparaíso and Viña del Mar;
Antofagasta region: Mejillones Antofagasta, and Calama
El Maule region: Curicó.
Sanitary cordons are in place in Tarapacá, San Antonio (Valparaíso), Pirque, Alto Biobío, Los Rios, between Penco and Concepción, between San Pedro de La Paz and Coronel, Talcahuano, Chiloé, Aysén, Punta Varas, Punta Arenas and Puerto Williams.
Information on zones in quarantine is available on this Google interactive map.
In those areas in quarantine, people are allowed to leave their residences only under certain circumstances, including for medical reasons, basic services, and public services. If you need to leave your residence for food supplies or medical reasons, you must get a permit from the Comisaria Virtual.
Foreigners may use their passport number to access the system. The pages are only in Spanish. It is not possible to leave or enter a sanitary cordon without a “salvoconducto” (police authorization), also obtained via the Comisaria Virtual.
Checkpoints for health inspections are in force at various points around Santiago and elsewhere. In addition to checking the health of persons passing through, these checkpoints will be used to confirm that specific individuals who have been ordered to quarantine by medical authorities are not violating their quarantine. You will need to get a “Health Passport” prior to travel and present it at any checkpoint.

Finance
There is a range of financial support from the government that you can access while you are unable to return due to coronavirus restrictions.
If you’re in Chile, and have exhausted all other options to cover essential living costs while you wait to return home, you could apply for an emergency loan for your living costs from the UK government. You can only apply if you normally live in the UK and you cannot return home. This last-resort option is for those most in need, and you would need to repay the loan when you are back in the UK. Apply for an emergency loan.

If you need urgent consular assistance, contact your nearest British embassy, high commission or consulate. All telephone numbers are available 24/7.
