UK nationals (including those holding Hungarian Permanent Residence Card or a Registration Certificate and Address Card) who wish to enter Hungary for exceptional reasons, or transit through Hungary, must submit an application for exemption on the official website of the Hungarian Police by completing an electronic form here. The form is currently only available in Hungarian and must be completed in Hungarian. The Hungarian Ministry of Foreign Affairs and Trade recommend applications are submitted at least a few days before the planned travel day, clearly stating the justification for the exemption application. The form sets out more details about the type of exceptional circumstances in which the authorities may allow entry. Anyone entering Hungary following this application route will undergo a medical check. If you show no symptom of COVID-19, you still need to follow a 14 day quarantine rule If you show signs of COVID-19, entry will be rejected.
