Cases of coronavirus (COVID-19) have been confirmed in Guinea. The Guinean authorities have introduced a number of measures to limit the spread of the virus and an announcement was made on 23 March that Conakry Airport would be closed until further notice. Travellers should speak to their airline or tour operator promptly for further information regarding flights. See Coronavirus.
There have been regular demonstrations in Guinea since October 2019 leading to significant travel disruption and a number of violent incidents including deaths. Protests in Middle Guinea in January led to several public buildings being ransacked and set on fire and increased criminal activity. The National Front for the Defence of the Constitution (FNDC) have continued to call for demonstrations. Demonstrations may be spontaneous and unpredictable, with routes blocked. There has been damage to vehicles passing through or around demonstrations as well as an increase in criminality. Serious violence occurred around the legislative elections and referendum which were held on 22 March 2020. Demonstrations are likely to continue. You should exercise caution and be vigilant, staying clear of demonstrations and monitor local media. “Villes mortes” (general strikes) happen intermittently. See Political situation
