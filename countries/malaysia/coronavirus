Coronavirus (COVID-19) cases have been confirmed in Malaysia.
Entry and travel restrictions
The government of Malaysia has introduced a Movement Control Order that restricts the entry of foreign nationals until 12 May 2020.
Under the terms of that Order, no foreign nationals can enter Malaysia except those with diplomatic passports, those who have Permanent Residence or those who are an “expatriate in an essential service”.
If you or your dependents have other visas, including working visas or “Malaysia My Second Home” visas, these do not qualify for an exemption and you will not be permitted to enter.
The government has published further clarifications setting out some exceptions on immigration, including for foreign national spouses of Malaysian citizens. However, this information has not necessarily been reflected in all guidance and we are aware of reports that airlines are refusing to accept passengers who do not meet the headline requirements in the main Order.
Anyone (including British nationals) entering the country under the immigration rules mentioned above will be obliged to enter quarantine for 14 days in centres designated by the government. You will be charged a minimum of RM150 (£30) each day you are in quarantine. If you have an onward domestic flight in peninsular Malaysia, you will undergo quarantine in Kuala Lumpur. Any onward flight to a regional airport will need to be booked at a later date.
If you are transiting via Kuala Lumpur International Airport (KLIA) to East Malaysia (Sabah or Sarawak), you must stay airside and connect to your onward flight. You will be placed in quarantine for 14 days on arrival in Sabah/Sarawak, and charged for each day you are there. Sabah and Sarawak have additional immigration rules in place. You will only be permitted to enter if you have permanent residence or an employment pass in the relevant state.
If you must travel to Malaysia for essential purposes, check the latest information with your airline and keep up to date with developments, including this travel advice. For information on the Movement Control Order you can contact the hotline of the National Operations Management Centre on +60388882010.

Transit
Passengers looking to travel by air domestically within Malaysia in order to use KLIA to transit onwards to the UK are encouraged to check with their airline and choose a route which enables travel from Malaysia to the UK on one ticket, this allows direct transit to the international flight at KLIA. The Order is not preventing foreign nationals transiting via Kuala Lumpur International Airport (KLIA) provided they remain airside. Transit that requires passage through immigration (to collect bags, or to move between the two Kuala Lumpur terminals - KLIA and KLIA2) is not possible, unless you meet the general immigration requirements above.
Local measures
The Movement Control Order restricts all travel inside Malaysia, and is rigidly enforced by the police. You are only permitted to leave your accommodation for medical reasons or to go grocery shopping. You can travel a maximum of 10km from your accommodation, but you are expected to use the nearest supermarket/medical facility. To enter many facilities you will be expected to wear a face mask. You must carry your passport at all times, as it will be inspected by the police as they enforce the Movement Control Order. You must be alone while in public, especially when travelling in a vehicle.
Limited internal flights are available in peninsular Malaysia, but only for essential travel (e.g. an onward international flight). Internal flights to/from Sabah and Sarawak are not permitted for foreign nationals, unless they are associated with an international flight. Please check with your airline.
Only essential services are running during the Movement Control Order. Supermarkets, hotels, public transport and taxis fall into this category, though they are operating limited services. Many hotels have closed due to low demand, and some of those that are open require guests to remain in their rooms.
Further controls on travel within Malaysia may be imposed at short notice. If you are visiting Malaysia, you should plan accordingly, taking account of the fast moving situation and your individual circumstances.
Visas
Foreign nationals currently in Malaysia whose visas expire during the Order can return to their country of origin during the period the Order is in place without extending/renewing their visas. They must possess a valid travel document for onward travel. Alternatively, they can extend or renew their expired visa by contacting the Immigration department within 14 days of the end of the Order. This applies to holders of Short Term Social Visit Pass and Long Term Social Visit Pass such as Temporary Employment Visit Pass, Expatriate Pass, Student Pass, Dependent’s Pass (to holders of Long Term Visit Pass) and Long Term Social Visit Pass (MM2H).
Local medical care
The government of Malaysia has stated that they are currently covering all costs related to hospitalisation for Covid-19 at assigned government facilities, regardless of nationality. The Malaysian authorities expect patients to follow the formal reporting process in place.
If you have Covid-19 symptoms, you should call +60388810200, +60388810600 or +60388810700 or email cprc@moh.gov.my. After the consultation, you will be informed of the next steps.
