The information on this page covers the most common types of travel and reflects the UK government’s understanding of the rules currently in place. Unless otherwise stated, this information is for travellers using a full ‘British Citizen’ passport.
The authorities in the country or territory you’re travelling to are responsible for setting and enforcing the rules for entry. If you’re unclear about any aspect of the entry requirements, or you need further reassurance, you’ll need to contact the embassy, high commission or consulate of the country or territory you’re travelling to.
You should also consider checking with your transport provider or travel company to make sure your passport and other travel documents meet their requirements.
Entry rules in response to coronavirus (COVID-19)
Entry to Sweden
In light of the new variant of COVID-19 found in the UK, the Swedish government has imposed restrictions on travel from the UK to Sweden.
A temporary entry ban applies to all passengers arriving from the UK. UK Nationals who can demonstrate that they live or work in Sweden or have urgent family reasons are exempt. Swedish citizens are also exempt.. The exemption for those living or working in Sweden, or with urgent family reasons, applies until 31 January 2021
As of 1 January, travellers to Sweden from the UK who are exempt from the entry ban have to show a negative COVID-19 test taken within 72 hours prior to arrival in Sweden. The Swedish Border Police have now confirmed they are accepting tests from an authorised provider including those on this list. Holders of Swedish passports do not have to do this.
The Swedish government recommends that all passengers who arrived in Sweden from the UK since 12 December should self-isolate for seven days. They should also take a PCR test on the day of arrival and after five days. They should do this even if they have shown a negative COVID-19 test on arrival. More information is available from the Folkhälsomyndigheten.
Restrictions by neighbouring countries
Countries neighbouring Sweden (Denmark, Norway and Finland) have introduced some restrictions. Check country-specific FCDO Travel Advice for details.
Regular entry requirements
Visas
The rules for travelling or working in European countries changed on 1 January 2021:
you can travel to countries in the Schengen area for up to 90 days in any 180-day period without a visa. This applies if you travel as a tourist, to visit family or friends, to attend business meetings, cultural or sports events, or for short-term studies or training.
if you are travelling to Sweden and other Schengen countries without a visa, make sure your whole visit is within the 90-day limit. Visits to Schengen countries within the previous 180 days before you travel count towards your 90 days.
to stay longer, to work or study, for business travel or for other reasons, you will need to meet the Swedish government’s entry requirements. Check with the Swedish Embassy what type of visa and/or work permit, if any, you may need.
if you stay in Sweden with a visa or permit, this does not count towards your 90-day visa-free limit
Any time you spent in Sweden or other Schengen countries before 1 January 2021 does not count towards your 90-day visa-free limit.
At Swedish border control, you may need to use separate lanes from EU, EEA and Swiss citizens when queueing. Your passport may be stamped on entry and exit. You may also need to:
show a return or onward ticket
show you have enough money for your stay
There are separate requirements for those who are resident in Sweden. If you are resident in Sweden, you should carry proof of residence as well as your valid passport when you travel. For further information on these requirements, see our Living in Sweden guide.
Passport validity
Check your passport is valid for travel before you book your trip, and renew your passport if you do not have enough time left on it.
You must have at least 6 months left on an adult or child passport to travel to most countries in Europe (not including Ireland).
If you renewed your current passport before the previous one expired, extra months may have been added to its expiry date. Any extra months on your passport over 10 years may not count towards the 6 months needed.
UK Emergency Travel Documents
UK Emergency Travel Documents (ETDs) are accepted for entry, airside transit and exit from Sweden.
Travelling with children
If you’re travelling with children other than your own, you should carry a letter of consent from the child’s parent or guardian.
Pets
Check guidance before travelling with pets.
Border controls
Border controls are in place in Sweden for people travelling from Denmark via the Öresund crossing and arriving on ferries from Denmark and Germany. Make sure you carry a passport or national ID card when entering Sweden. More detailed information is available from the Swedish authorities.
