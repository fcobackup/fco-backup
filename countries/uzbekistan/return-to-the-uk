As of the morning of 16 March 2020, all commercial flights in and out of the country have been suspended. Any UK nationals who have booked flights including those already in Uzbekistan, should contact the airline directly, or their travel agent, to discuss the implications of this measure. In addition all passenger road and rail traffic to and from Uzbekistan has been suspended and the Uzbekistan â€“ Tajikistan border is closed.
The Uzbek Government are trying to organise charter flights to repatriate Uzbek citizens from Europe. If these flights go ahead, they have offered to make spaces available to British nationals currently in Uzbekistan who want to return to the UK. It is by no means certain that it will be possible to arrange these flights, given the increasing number of restrictions on air travel world-wide. Nor do we yet know exactly when- or to where - in Europe they would fly.
Any British citizens currently in Uzbekistan who wish to take advantage of these possible flights should send full passport details as soon as possible to Ukin.Uzbekistan@fco.gov.uk. Space on these flights is likely to be limited and we cannot guarantee that seats will be available for all. The Uzbek authorities will make a charge for seats on these flights.
