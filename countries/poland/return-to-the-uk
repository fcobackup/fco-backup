There are limited commercial options to return to the UK from Poland.
If you live in the UK and are currently visiting Poland you’re strongly advised to return now by commercial means. Don’t risk getting stranded.
UK special charter flights will only operate for priority countries where commercial options are not possible. You should not assume that these flights will become available in Poland because commercial routes are operating. Please do not contact the contracted travel management company if no flight is advertised here.
Flights
Direct flights between Poland and the UK are suspended until at least 30 June. From 17 June flights are permitted between Poland and members of the European Economic Area and Switzerland, apart from the United Kingdom, Sweden and Portugal. All other international flights remain suspended until 30 June.
You can fly from Polish airports to the UK indirectly via for example Germany or France. Flight availability changes on a daily basis as airlines revise routes. Some routes may require you to purchase tickets with more than one airline. You should first consult travel advice pages for any country you plan to transit via before booking a ticket. Countries may change their entry requirements at short notice.
If you have booked a standard airline ticket, check with your airline for the latest schedule and information on flight availability, and for refund/rebooking processes if your flight has been cancelled.
Travel via Germany
FlixBus and Sindbad are coach operators providing services from Poland to Germany. You can also travel by train from Poland to Frankfurt and Berlin from where you can catch a flight to the UK. Check FCO travel advice for Germany for further updates.
Road
You can depart Poland by car or limited coach services over some land border crossings, though the situation could change quickly. If you are willing to make a longer journey, Sindbad provides a coach service to London from Poland (journey times are around 24 hours including channel crossing).
Countries neighbouring Poland have also introduced border restrictions (Czech Republic, Germany, Lithuania, Russia, Slovakia and Ukraine). Check country specific FCO travel advice for any country that you plan to transit on the way back to the UK for details.
Financial assistance for travel
You will need to pay for your return travel to the UK. If departure options are available but you cannot afford the travel costs and have exhausted all other options for getting funds, you may be eligible to apply for an emergency loan from the government. This is a last resort option and you would need to repay the loan when you are back in the UK.
For more information, contact Corporate Travel Management (CTM). CTM are a commercial partner of the FCO and are authorised to administer such loans on behalf of the FCO.
Your journey home: re-entering the UK
When you return, you must follow the rules for entering the UK. You:
need to provide your journey and contact details up to 48 hours before you’re due to arrive in the UK
are not allowed to leave the place you’re staying for the first 14 days you’re in the UK except in very limited situations (known as ‘self-isolating’)
See also the list of people who are exempt from the border rules.
The National Travel Health Network and Centre (NaTHNaC) also provides advice on how to stay safe as you travel by air.
