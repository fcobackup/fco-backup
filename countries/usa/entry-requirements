The information on this page covers the most common types of travel and reflects the UK government’s understanding of the rules currently in place. Unless otherwise stated, this information is for travellers using a full ‘British Citizen’ passport.
The authorities in the country or territory you’re travelling to are responsible for setting and enforcing the rules for entry. If you’re unclear about any aspect of the entry requirements, or you need further reassurance, you’ll need to contact the embassy, high commission or consulate of the country or territory you’re travelling to.
You should also consider checking with your transport provider or travel company to make sure your passport and other travel documents meet their requirements.
Coronavirus (COVID-19) restrictions
Since 16 March, it is not possible for many British nationals to enter the USA if they have been in the UK, Ireland, Schengen zone, Iran or China within the previous 14 days.
US citizens and permanent residents of the USA, certain specified close family members and certain other limited categories of visas holders (such as UN staff and diplomats) are exempt. They will still be able to enter the USA, subject to normal entry requirements.
A Presidential Executive Order of 22 June means that further restrictions on certain visas (H1-B, H2-B, J and L) will be put in place from 24 June. To see if you are affected please refer to the US Government’s travel page.
Those allowed entry to the USA must be prepared to self-isolate for up to 14 days after arrival.
Airports
The new restrictions limit the number of airports to which flights from international destinations can operate to the USA. The 13 airports are:
JFK (New York)
EWR (Newark)
IAD (Washington DC)
BOS (Boston)
ORD (Chicago)
DTW (Detroit)
MIA (Miami)
ATL (Atlanta)
DFW (Dallas)
LAX (Los Angeles)
SEA (Seattle)
SFO (San Francisco)
HNL (Honolulu)
While there may be no direct flights from DTW (Detroit), (ATL) Atlanta, SEA (Seattle), SFO (San Francisco), or HML (Honolulu) to the UK at this time, there are flights with connections to the UK.
If your flight from the US has been delayed or cancelled, see information from the UK Civil Aviation Authority (CAA) and US Department of Transport on your rights.
Transiting the USA
You cannot transit the USA on an ESTA visa waiver if you have been in the UK, Ireland, Schengen zone, Iran or China within the previous 14 days. For further information on the validity of ESTAs, check the advice from US Customs and Border Protection.
Travel to American Samoa
To prevent the spread of coronavirus, American Samoa currently requires all non-US passport holders to spend at least 14 days in Hawaii, Samoa (Apia) or Tonga before entering. Other restrictions for those travelling from countries affected by the outbreak could also be in force.
If you’re due to travel, check the websites of the American Samoa Government and the US Center for Disease Control and Prevention for any updates, and check with your airline before leaving. You should also check with your airline or travel agent for any additional information about existing travel bookings.
Visas
You’ll need a visa to enter the USA. The Electronic System for Travel Authorisation (ESTA) visa waiver programme is not currently in operation due to the imposition of new travel restrictions on those travelling from the UK.
Regular entry requirements
Passport validity
Your passport should be valid for the proposed duration of your stay. You don’t need any additional period of validity on your passport beyond this.
Global entry
The US Customs and Border Protection programme Global Entry gets pre-approved travellers through border control faster at some US airports. If you’re a British citizen you can now register to get a UK background check on GOV.UK. If you pass the background checks, you’ll be invited to apply for Global Entry.
UK Emergency Travel Documents
UK Emergency Travel Documents (ETDs) aren’t valid for entry into the USA or transit through the USA on an ESTA. If you’re planning to enter or transit through the US using an ETD, you must apply for a visa from the nearest US embassy or consulate before you travel, which may take a number of days, or hold a valid lawful permanent resident card (often referred to as a ‘green card’), which you must have with you on arrival.
UK ETDs issued in the USA are valid for exit from the USA.
Bringing medicines into the USA
There are restrictions and prohibitions on the import of certain prescription drugs into the US. The US Department of Homeland Security website contains further information and advice on bringing medicines into the US.
Travelling with children
If a child (under the age of 18) is travelling with only one parent or someone who isn’t a parent or legal guardian, you may be asked to provide certain documents at the border. For further information, see the US Customs and Border Protection website.
Travelling to the USA from Cuba
It’s possible to travel to the USA after you’ve been to Cuba. However, you may wish to take supporting documents about the purpose of your trip to Cuba in case you’re questioned by US immigration officials at the port of entry on arrival in the USA. If you have any further questions or concerns, contact the nearest US Embassy or Consulate.
