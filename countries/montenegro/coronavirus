COVID-19 vaccines if you live in Montenegro
Wherever possible British nationals should aim to be vaccinated in the country where they live. As further information is available about the national vaccination programme, this page will be updated. Sign up to get email notifications.
The Montenegrin authorities have created an e-portal with information about the local COVID-19 vaccination programme (only available in Montenegrin). All residents in Montenegro, both Montenegrin and foreign nationals, are eligible for a vaccine free of charge. This is not dependent on citizenship or whether you are insured with the Montenegrin Health Fund.
If you are resident in Montenegro you can register for a vaccination by calling the National line on 1717 or by going directly to a local vaccination centre. The 1717 call centre is operational from 8am till 8pm on weekdays and from 8am till 3pm on Saturdays.
Currently the vaccination is only available to priority groups, including people older than 65, medical workers and those with certain medical conditions.
The Medicines and Healthcare Products Regulatory Agency (MHRA) is the UK authority responsible for assessing the safety, quality and efficacy of vaccines. It has authorised the Pfizer/BioNTech, Oxford/AstraZeneca and Moderna vaccines for temporary supply and use in the UK. Find out more about MHRA approval for these vaccines.
British nationals living overseas should seek medical advice from their local healthcare provider in the country where they reside. Information about vaccines used in other national programmes, including regulatory status, should be available from the local authorities. This list of Stringent Regulatory Authorities recognised by the World Health Organisation may also be a useful source of additional information. Find out more information about the COVID-19 vaccines on the World Health Organization COVID-19 vaccines page.
