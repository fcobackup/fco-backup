Terrorism in the Netherlands
Terrorists are likely to try to carry out attacks in the Netherlands.
Attacks could be indiscriminate, including in places frequented by foreigners. You should remain aware of your surroundings, keep up to date with local media reports and follow the advice of local authorities. Recent attacks include:
in 2019, 4 people were killed and 6 injured in a shooting incident in Utrecht
in 2018, 2 people were seriously injured in a knife attack at Amsterdam Central Station
On 12 December 2023 the Netherlands raised its National Terrorist Threat Level - this means that there is a real chance of a terrorist attack in the Netherlands.
Crime
Protect your belongings
Pick-pocketing and bag snatching are common, particularly in central Amsterdam and around Amsterdam Central Station. Thieves often operate in gangs on the trains and trams to and from Schiphol airport and Central Station. One thief distracts you while another steals your bag. Sleeping on trains can make you an easy target.
Thieves can enter restaurants attempting to sell you something or look for someone. Bags have been stolen from between people’s feet while they were distracted.
You should:
be alert
keep sight of your luggage and belongings
keep valuables safely on you
not leave bags or jackets hanging on the back of a chair in restaurants
avoid falling asleep in public or on public transport
If you are a victim of theft, contact the nearest police station and get a police report.
Scams – fake police ID
Amsterdam police have warned of criminals using false police identities to trick tourists into handing over cash and credit cards. They will usually say that it is part of and investigation into counterfeit money and false credit cards. Be very cautious about any approaches.
Genuine plain-clothed police will rarely carry out this type of inspection. Dutch police don’t have shiny badges, which the fake police sometimes present as ID.
You should:
be cautious if approached
ask for identity and check it thoroughly
not let them intimidate you
Call 0900-8844 to contact the nearest police station if you are unsure whether a police person is genuine.
Drug sellers
Avoid confrontation with anyone offering you drugs. Stay away from quiet or dark alleys, particularly late at night.
Drink spiking
There is a risk of drink spiking, particularly for young women and solo travellers. Don’t leave your drink unattended.  If you think your drink has been spiked, seek immediate medical help and inform the police. If you are in a group, make sure you leave together.
Laws and cultural differences
Personal ID
By law, anyone from the age of 14 and over must always be able to show a valid form of identification. British nationals should use their passport as ID. Dual-nationals can show a valid Dutch driving license, passport or Dutch/European identity card. For people aged 16 or over who fail to comply with the requirement to identify themselves, the fine is 100 euros. For persons aged 14 and 15, the fine is 50 euros.
Illegal drugs and prison sentences
Don’t carry or use drugs. The Netherlands has a reputation for being tolerant on the use of ‘soft drugs’, such as cannabis. However, drugs are illegal and drug use is only tolerated in designated premises in the major cities. Buying or possessing prohibited drugs and substances outside of designated areas, is illegal and can result in a prison sentence.
Buying or smoking soft drugs in public places is an offence. There are specific cafés where the use of cannabis is tolerated.
The sale of dry and fresh psychoactive mushrooms is illegal. However, the truffle (sclerotium) form of psychoactive (psilocybin) mushrooms are not covered under Dutch law (Opium Act) and are still sold in regulated ‘smart shops’. Be extremely careful as mixing alcohol, cannabis and wild mushrooms can be fatal.
Transport risks
Road travel
If you are planning to drive in the Netherlands, see information on driving abroad and read the RAC guide.
Licences and permits
When driving in the Netherlands, always carry your:
driving licence
insurance documents
vehicle documents
photo ID such as a passport or residence permit
If you are driving a vehicle that does not belong to you, you may need written permission from the registered owner. You are not allowed to drive on a provisional license.
If you’re living in the Netherlands, check the living in guide for information on requirements for residents.
Driving a British car abroad
You may need a UK sticker to drive your car outside the UK. From 2021, UK stickers have replaced GB stickers. Find more information on what to do if you are driving outside the UK.
Driving regulations
Traffic offences can carry heavy, on-the-spot fines. If you are fined, always ask for a receipt.
Watch out for trams. They have priority over other traffic. You must stop if a tram or a bus stops in the middle of the road to let passengers on and off.
Speed cameras, speed traps and unmarked vehicles are widely used. Motorway speed limits can vary. You must follow overhead illuminated lane indicators when in use.
Pedestrians and road safety
Be careful when crossing roads, especially on zebra crossings. Look out for cyclists and mopeds, who have right of way over motor vehicles and often ignore road traffic rules and red lights.
You could be fined for jaywalking.
Amsterdam canals
Every year people drown in the canals of Amsterdam. The majority of drownings happen after heavy drinking or smoking cannabis. Take care when travelling beside canals.
