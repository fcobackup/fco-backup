Crime
Be aware of the risk of street crime and pick-pocketing, particularly in busy tourist areas in Bali, where there have been reports of bag-snatching. Take sensible measures to protect yourself and your belongings. Avoid having bags obviously on show and carry only essential items. Take particular care of your passport and bank cards and avoid travelling around alone.
Credit card fraud is common. Do not lose sight of your card during transactions. Criminals sometimes place a fake telephone number on ATMs advising customers to report problems. Customers dialling the number are asked for their PIN and their card is then retained within the machine.
Beware of thieves on public transport. If you’re travelling by car keep doors locked at all times. Only book taxis with a reputable firm. You can ask your hotel to book one for you, or use taxis from Bluebird, Silverbird or Express groups. These are widely available at hotels and shopping malls in central Jakarta and at Soekarno-Hatta International Airport. Take care to distinguish Bluebird and Silverbird vehicles from ‘lookalike’ competitors. Do not use unlicensed taxi drivers at the airport or anywhere else. Their vehicles are usually in poor condition, unmetered and do not have a dashboard identity licence. They have been known to charge extortionate fares and to rob passengers.
Alcohol and drugs
Drinks served in bars can be stronger than those in the UK. In some cases, over drinking and taking drugs has resulted in accidents, injuries, robbery, assaults and lost travel documents and some British nationals have suffered psychiatric problems caused by alcohol, drugs and a lack of sleep. You should drink responsibly and be aware of your limits.
Drink spiking
There have been reports of sexual assaults and drink spiking in Bali, Lombok and the Gili Islands. Make sure drinks are prepared in your sight and be careful about accepting drinks from strangers at clubs and parties, or leaving drinks unattended. Tourists have also been robbed after taking visitors to their hotel rooms, and in some cases have found that their drinks were drugged.
Methanol poisoning
There have been a number of deaths and cases of serious illness of locals and foreigners in Indonesia caused by drinking alcoholic drinks contaminated with methanol. These cases have occurred in bars, shops and hotels in popular tourist areas like Bali, Lombok, the Gili Islands and Sumatra. Criminal gangs have been reported to manufacture counterfeit replicas of well-known brands of alcohol containing high amounts of methanol. Take extreme care when buying spirit-based drinks, as bottles may appear to be genuine when they’re not.
There have also been cases of methanol poisoning from drinking adulterated arak/arrack, a local rice or palm liquor.
If you or someone you’re travelling with show signs of alcohol induced methanol poisoning or drink-spiking, seek immediate medical attention.
Local travel
Use a reliable and reputable guide for any adventure trips, otherwise you may have difficulties with local authorities if you need their help. For longer journeys, notify friends of your travel plans, contact them on arrival and where possible travel in convoy/with others. Always carry a reliable means of communication with you.
Papua and West Papua
Political tensions in Papua province have given rise to occasional violence and armed attacks between Free Papua Movement (OPM) and associated groups, and the Indonesian authorities, particularly in the Central Highlands area around Puncak Jaya (including Wamena), but also including in Jayapura, Abepura, and Sentani on the north coast, and Timika town on the south coast.
On 30 March 2020, a New Zealand national was shot dead and a number of Indonesian nationals were wounded at the Freeport mining facility in Papua province. Clashes in previous years have at times resulted in civilian deaths. If you’re travelling in the region, you should exercise extreme caution. Papuan separatists have kidnapped foreigners in the past. There is a heavy security presence in some areas, especially along the border with Papua New Guinea.
Political tensions have also given rise to occasional mass demonstrations in cities in Papua and protests have most recently taken place in several locations including Manokwari, West Papua Province, and in Jayapura and Wamena Papua Province, Timika and Fakfak regency. (August and September 2019). There are reports of difficulties with internet connections and communications may be limited. You should monitor local media, avoid all protests, demonstrations and political rallies in these and other areas as they could become violent with little notice.
Should you need medical attention, there are limited hospital facilities in Papua and West Papua provinces and the likely destination for a medical emergency is Darwin, Australia.Monitor the situation and be alert to changing circumstances.
Central Sulawesi Province
The political situation in Central Sulawesi Province is unsettled. Take particular care in Palu, Poso and Tentena and be alert to the potential for politically-motivated violence.
There is ongoing conflict between the Indonesian security forces and terrorists, including attacks upon police and civilians in May 2021. This conflict is predominantly concentrated in the Sigi, Parigi Moutong and Poso regions.
Maluku Province
Maluku Province has experienced unrest and violence between different religious and tribal groups. Take particular care in Ambon, including Haruku Island (Pulau Haruku).
Aceh
Aceh has emerged from a long period of internal conflict. Although violence against foreigners is rare, a British national was abducted in June 2013 and there were three separate incidents in November 2009 targeting foreigners. There have been reports of Shari’a (religious) police harassing foreigners.
Be alert to the risk of politically-motivated violence and take particular care in remote areas. Keep up to date with local developments and avoid large crowds, especially political rallies.
Sharia law is in force in Aceh. See Local laws and customs
Political situation
The overall political situation is stable, but internal developments, such as elections, presidential inaugurations and external developments, including in the Middle East, can trigger public protests or unrest. You should avoid all protests, demonstrations and political rallies as they could turn violent with little notice.
Nationwide student protests took place in 2019, again in 2020, and have the potential to reoccur at any time. You should avoid large gatherings in public areas, including demonstrations, student and political rallies.
Road travel
You can not drive in Indonesia using a UK driving licence. You can drive using an International Driving Permit issued in Indonesia. International Driving Permits issued in the UK may need to be endorsed by the Indonesian licensing office in Jakarta. Before driving, riding or hiring any type of vehicle, ensure that you have the appropriate licence to do so, and check with your travel insurance company to confirm that you’re covered.
Traffic discipline is very poor. Foreigners involved in even minor traffic violations or accidents may be vulnerable to exploitation. Consider employing a private driver or hiring a car with a driver. Some multinational companies do not allow their expatriate staff to drive in Indonesia. Make sure you wear a helmet if you’re riding a motorbike or moped.
If you’re involved in an accident or breakdown, make sure someone remains with your vehicle. If you have any concerns for your security, move to another location safely. You should make yourself available for questioning by the police if requested to do so.
Air travel
The FCDO can not offer advice on the safety of individual airlines, but the International Air Transport Association publishes a list of registered airlines that have been audited and found to meet a number of operational safety standards and recommended practices. This list is not exhaustive and the absence of an airline from this list doesn’t necessarily mean that it is unsafe.
On 29 October 2018, a Lion Air domestic flight from Jakarta to Pangkal Pinang crashed into the Kawarang Sea shortly after take-off. There were no survivors and an investigation is underway to determine the cause of the crash.
A list of recent incidents and accidents can be found on the website of the Aviation Safety network.
Sea travel
Travelling by boat or ferry can be dangerous as the sea conditions can change rapidly, vessels can be crowded, overloaded, poorly maintained and safety standards vary between providers. In 2017, the Indonesian Search and Rescue Agency recorded 1,687 boat accidents (of which 76 were in Bali and Lombok), resulting in many injuries and 680 deaths. Make sure you’re satisfied with safety standards before travelling, including availability of safety equipment and life-jackets. Life-jackets suitable for children aren’t always available and you should consider bringing your own. Avoid travelling after dark unless you’re satisfied the vessel is suitably equipped.
There have been attacks against ships in and around the waters of Indonesia. Mariners should be vigilant, reduce opportunities for theft, establish secure areas on board and report all incidents to the coastal and flag state authorities.
