The FCDO advise against all travel to Donetsk oblast, Luhansk oblast and Crimea. The FCDO advises against all but essential travel to the rest of Ukraine.
Since late March 2021, there has been a pattern of Russian military build-ups near Ukraine’s eastern border and in illegally annexed Crimea. Since the beginning of November 2021 there has been significant media coverage of heightened tensions between Russia and Ukraine.
The situation in Kyiv and other areas outside Donetsk and Luhansk is generally calm. However, the situation has potential to deteriorate quickly and with little warning. There is continuing uncertainty about Russian intentions. Non-essential travel is advised against. Make sure you are ready to change your plans quickly if you need to. You should remain vigilant throughout Ukraine, monitor the media and this travel advice regularly, subscribe to email alerts and read our advice on how to deal with a crisis overseas. You should keep your departure plans under constant review and ensure your travel documents are up to date.
If you are a British national in Ukraine, you should register your presence in Ukraine. This will allow us to provide the latest information but you should also continue to read and follow FCDO Travel Advice.
Due to the growing threat from Russia, the FCDO has taken the decision to temporarily withdraw some Embassy staff and their dependants from Kyiv. The Embassy remains open and will continue to carry out essential work, including providing consular assistance and support to British nationals in Ukraine. However, any Russian military action in Ukraine would affect the British Embassy Kyiv’s ability to provide any consular assistance, and British nationals should not expect increased consular support or help with evacuating in these circumstances.
The security situation in the south-eastern parts of the Donetsk and Luhansk oblasts of Ukraine is highly unstable with ongoing clashes between Ukrainian armed forces and Russian-backed armed separatists. Consular support is not available in parts of Ukraine not currently under control of the Ukrainian authorities: Crimea and parts of Donetsk and Luhansk oblasts. See Crimea and Eastern Ukraine
Public demonstrations regularly take place. Policing of these events may include road closures. You should avoid all demonstrations and take extra care at public gatherings. In Kyiv, the areas around Maydan Nezalezhnosti (Independence Square) and government buildings such as the Verkhovna Rada (parliament building) and the Cabinet of Ministers are most frequently affected.
