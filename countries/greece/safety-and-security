Terrorism
There is a high threat of terrorist attack globally affecting UK interests and British nationals, including from groups and individuals who view the UK and British nationals as targets. You should remain vigilant at all times.
UK Counter Terrorism Policing has information and advice on staying safe abroad and what to do in the event of a terrorist attack. Find out how to reduce your risk from terrorism while abroad.
Terrorism in Greece
Terrorists are likely to try to carry out attacks in Greece.
Attacks could be indiscriminate, including in places frequented by foreigners.
There have been several attacks involving explosives and automatic weapons against Greek institutions, shopping malls, banks, media offices, diplomatic premises and the police.
British nationals aren’t normally considered a specific target, but attacks could happen in places visited by foreigners.
Political demonstrations
Greek authorities have increased security at some prominent locations, including tourist sites, due to events in Israel and the Occupied Palestinian Territories. Stay aware of your surroundings, stay away from demonstrations and follow the advice of local authorities.
Strikes and demonstrations
There are regular strikes, sometimes called at short notice that can cause disruption to public transport (including air travel and ports), as well as road networks and borders. Political demonstrations can also occur frequently.
Avoid demonstrations wherever possible and follow the advice of the local authorities. Some demonstrations in the past have turned violent. If you do find yourself unexpectedly near a demonstration, move away to the last known safe place. Security forces often use tear gas to break up demonstrations, which can harm your breathing and vision.
Demonstrations take place regularly around major squares in central Athens, in particular Syntagma Square. There is currently a heightened risk of demonstrations, particularly in central Athens, related to events in Israel and the Occupied Palestinian Territories. Nationwide strikes and protests can occur at any time and may disrupt road, air, sea travel and cause delays or diversions at border crossings.
Demonstrations may happen at short notice, and have traditionally happened on 1 May, 17 November and 6 December.
Crime
Theft
Theft of passports, wallets and handbags are common on the metro and in crowded tourist places, particularly in central Athens. Don’t carry all your valuables in one place, and remember to keep a photocopy or scanned copy of your passport somewhere safe. Maintain the same level of personal security awareness as in the UK.
When driving on holiday, keep your valuables out of sight and lock your vehicle at all times. Always park in a well-lit area or secure car park. Be alert to car crime.
Sexual assault
Sexual assaults and personal attacks may occur in Greece. This includes attacks on foreign visitors in tourist areas and cities.
We recommend that all travellers follow this advice:
save the location of your accommodation on your maps app, so it’s easier to find at the end of the night
set up a WhatsApp group to keep in touch with others in your group
keep an eye on each other’s drinks to make sure they don’t get spiked
don’t let a friend walk back to their hotel alone
don’t give a drunk person more alcohol
You should immediately report anything you see that doesn’t feel right to local authorities or hospitality management.
Laws and cultural differences
Personal ID
Carry a copy of your passport or other photographic ID which confirms British nationality at all times, this is a legal requirement.
Race
The majority of visitors experience no difficulties related to race, but there have been some racially motivated attacks, particularly in inner-city areas.
Public offences
The Greek police won’t accept behaviour they find rowdy or indecent, especially where excessive drinking is involved, this behaviour may be illegal. The police will make arrests and the courts are likely to give heavy fines or prison sentences if you behave indecently.
Some fancy dress costumes may be regarded as offensive and therefore against decency laws. Your travel insurance may not cover you after drinking.
Smoking
It’s illegal to smoke in all indoor public places. The penalty for violating this law is a fine of up to 500 euros.
Drugs
Possession of even small quantities of illegal drugs can lead to a long prison sentence.
Alcohol, drugs and use of nitrous oxide can make you less alert, less in control and less aware of your environment.
Nitrous oxide is illegal to buy or sell for recreational use in Greece. You can be arrested or fined if found in possession.
Public transport
It’s sometimes necessary to time stamp or validate your ticket on public transport for it to be valid. Check with local providers.
Buying goods or services
Make sure you get a receipt for any goods or services you buy.
Offensive items like pepper spray, knuckledusters or knives with a blade length of 10cm or above are listed as weapons in Greece and fall under the current weapon possession law. You need to have a special licence from the local police authority to carry any weapon otherwise you might face arrest and legal charges. You need to have a special licence to carry any knife that is not made for domestic, professional, artistic or hunting use.
LGBT+ travellers
Same-sex sexual relations are legal in Greece and civil unions between same-sex couples have been legal since 2015. The age of consent in Greece is 15, this applies to partners of both the same sex and opposite sex. Transgender people are able to change their legal gender. Anti-discrimination and hate speech laws apply to gender identity.
Public attitudes towards same-sex sexual activity vary throughout the country; showing affection in public by same-sex couples may be frowned upon, especially in rural areas.
Attitudes are generally much more welcoming in Athens and on many Greek islands, particularly on Lesvos, Mykonos and Skiathos. See our information and advice page for the LGBT+ community before you travel.
Military service
Men, aged 19 and above, born to a Greek national parent may have military service obligations, regardless of any other nationality they hold. Authorities can prevent you leaving Greece until you complete military service obligations.
Using cameras or approaching sensitive locations
It is illegal to approach or take photos or videos of military installations, vehicles or buildings at any time. The Greek authorities will arrest and possibly prosecute anyone doing so. Certain border areas are also militarily sensitive. Although you can visit these areas, you should avoid taking photos or video footage.
Outdoor activities and adventure tourism
Music festivals
Be aware of local laws and customs, and take extra care of your valuables if attending a festival or large concert. Read our festivals in Europe travel checklist for more advice.
Water sports and swimming safety
If you are considering taking part in water sports activities, do so through a licensed water sports centre and make sure paperwork is completed before starting the activity. Check the Safe Water Sports website for more information.
However inviting the blue waters may be, make sure you follow any warning signs, adhere to instructions from lifeguards and observe the flag indicators on beaches. Follow local advice if jellyfish or urchins are present.
Quad biking and mopeds
Quad biking is considered an extreme sport and carries the risk of serious injury or death. Specific travel insurance to cover quad bike rental is essential. Always take care to read the details of your insurance cover before you travel on holiday, paying particular attention to the small print and exclusions on your insurance policy.
If you do rent a quad bike, choose a category in accordance with your driving licence and age. Drivers and passengers must wear helmets. Failure to do so may invalidate your insurance and if stopped you will be fined and your licence taken from you. If you intend to hire a moped you will need a valid driving licence with at least category A1 - ‘light motorcycle’. Category P, which is valid in the UK for driving mopeds up to 50cc, is not valid in Greece.
Transport risks
Road travel
If you are planning to drive in Greece, see information on driving abroad and read the RAC guide.
Make sure any vehicle you hire is in good condition and check that you’re insured. When renting mopeds or quad bikes, insurance sold by the hire company usually only provides third party insurance, which only covers the cost of damage to another vehicle. Any damage sustained to the rental vehicle in many cases may need to be paid for by you, or you may face arrest if you do not pay and the hire company decide to press charges.
Traffic can be busy, fast and chaotic, especially in the larger cities. Take care when crossing roads. Pedestrians should cross roads using a crossing. Drivers don’t always stop, even though they are required to. The green pedestrian crossing signal sometimes also allows cars to turn right onto the crossing, so cross with caution.
Driving any vehicle while over the legal drinking limit can result in a heavy fine or imprisonment.
Licences and permits
You can drive in Greece with a UK driving licence.
Driving a British car abroad
You may need a UK sticker to drive your car outside the UK. Check the GOV.UK displaying number plates website for more information on what to do if you are driving outside the UK.
