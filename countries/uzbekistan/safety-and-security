Warning
FCDO advises against all but essential travel to parts of Uzbekistan.

Terrorism
There is a high threat of terrorist attack globally affecting UK interests and British nationals, including from groups and individuals who view the UK and British nationals as targets. You should remain vigilant at all times.
UK Counter Terrorism Policing has information and advice on staying safe abroad and what to do in the event of a terrorist attack. Find out how to reduce your risk from terrorism while abroad.
Terrorism in Uzbekistan
Terrorists are likely to try to carry out attacks in Uzbekistan.
Attacks could happen anywhere and could affect western interests and places visited by foreigners.
On 6 November 2019, it was reported that 17 people were killed in an armed attack on a Tajik security checkpoint on the Uzbekistan-Tajikistan border. Daesh/ISIS claimed responsibility. In light of this incident, you should exercise caution and vigilance, particularly if travelling near or across the Uzbekistan-Tajikistan border.
Political situation
The political situation in Uzbekistan is stable.
You should avoid any demonstrations or large gatherings of people. Use caution and maintain a high level of security awareness, particularly in public places.
Crime
Violent crimes against foreign nationals are rare. Reports of muggings, pickpocketing, snatch-and-grab robberies, theft of unattended bags and bag snatching are more common, especially in crowded places (bazaars and public transport). Home burglaries and break-ins happen, even in wealthier neighbourhoods.
You should use caution and take measures to protect your personal security as you would when visiting any European country.
Laws and cultural differences
Personal ID
You must carry your passport with you at all times. This is a legal requirement in Uzbekistan, and the police often carry out checks.
Illegal drugs and prison sentences
Possession of drugs is illegal. You can get a long prison sentence if convicted. 
Prison conditions
Prison sentences can be lengthy. While prison conditions have reportedly improved, reports of widespread hepatitis and tuberculosis and allegations of mistreatment of some prisoners by officials remain a concern.
Alcohol laws
It is illegal to sell alcohol and tobacco to someone aged 19 or under.    
Using cameras in secure areas
Any form of photography can upset the authorities, particularly photographs of government buildings. This includes the Palace of Forums in Tashkent and sometimes local bazaars not normally visited by tourists. While restrictions have been relaxed recently, you should check before using a camera, especially near airports, border checkpoints, military barracks, bridges, police stations and metro stations.
Drones
You must get a licence to import drones before you arrive in Uzbekistan. If you import or use drones without permission, you can get a fine or be detained. The authorities can also confiscate your equipment.
LGBT+ travellers
Same-sex relationships are illegal, not recognised and still frowned upon socially. You should take care over showing affection in public.

Transport risks
Road travel
If you are planning to drive in Uzbekistan, see information on driving abroad.
You’ll need to have both the correct version of the international driving permit (IDP) and your UK driving licence with you in the car. You cannot buy an IDP outside the UK, so get one before you travel. You can buy an IDP in person from some UK post offices – find your nearest post office branch that offers this service. 
You can drive in Uzbekistan with a valid UK driving licence for 30 days. You should get your licence translated into either Russian or Uzbek to make interaction with local authorities and traffic police easier. This is not a legal requirement.
Hire car companies often have stricter requirements for their customers, such as a year of driving experience, minimum age and holding an IDP.
Take care as many roads have poor surfaces and bad lighting.
In Uzbekistan:
drive on the right
vehicles approaching a roundabout have the right of way over vehicles already in the roundabout
seatbelts are compulsory for drivers and passengers
it is illegal to drive while using a mobile phone
Taxis and buses
You should use licensed taxis whenever possible, this includes:
official taxis at the airport
taxis hailed using apps like Yandex or My Taxi
Unlicensed taxis are still common, despite licensing laws. Many taxis do not have seatbelts in the rear seat, so you may want to request a taxi that has them.
Many buses and taxis in Uzbekistan run on compressed natural gas and safety regulations are often not followed. Where possible opt for modern vehicles.
Air travel
Check whether your tour operator has concerns about airlines in Uzbekistan.
On 19 May 2022, the UK sanctioned Aeroflot, Rossiya Airlines and Ural Airlines. It is now illegal under UK law for any British national or British company to do business with these airlines. This includes the purchasing of flight tickets.
Rail travel
Take care when travelling long distances by train. If you must travel overnight, keep valuables in a safe place. Do not leave your belongings in the compartment unattended. Lock the door from the inside. You’ll need to show your passport with a valid visa when booking train tickets.
Extreme weather and natural disasters
Earthquakes
Uzbekistan is in an active seismic zone. There are regular tremors.
The US Federal Emergency Management Agency has advice about what to do before, during and after an earthquake.
