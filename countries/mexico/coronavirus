The Mexican authorities have introduced a number of precautionary measures in response to the coronavirus (COVID-19) pandemic. You should comply with additional screening measures put in place by the authorities. Given the fast changing situation, you should check the latest entry requirements for your destination and keep in touch with your airline, cruise line or tour operator. New restrictions may be imposed with little warning. Please note that some airlines are imposing their own additional restrictions on travelers, different from the Mexican government guidelines. These restrictions may apply for domestic and international flights. Review the airline requirements carefully before purchasing any flights and before you travel.
The land border between the US and Mexico will close at midnight on Saturday 21 March to all non-essential traffic for 30 days. This closure applies primarily to tourism and recreational travel. Cargo, trade and healthcare workers will still be able to cross the border. Please check with your closest US Embassy/Consulate before attempting to cross the border.

On 30 March, the Government declared a national health emergency, and the immediate suspension of all non-essential activities in the public and private sector until 30 April. People should remain at home wherever possible, and particularly the over 60s, those with underlying medical conditions, and pregnant women.
On 3rd April, the Mexican Ministry of Health and Ministry of Tourism announced new measures for the hotel industry during the health emergency. Hotels will no longer receive reservations and only some hotels will be authorised to offer limited accommodation to foreign nationals for humanitarian reasons. The Mexican Ministry of Tourism and Ministry of Health request that non-resident foreign nationals currently in Mexico return to their home countries immediately.
Events of more than 50 people are discouraged.
If you are a resident in Mexico, you should follow the advice of the local authorities. Individual states in Mexico are imposing additional measures and restrictions; please review your local government website for detailed information on where you live.
If you present symptoms upon arrival at an airport in Mexico, you should ask for the International Health Team (“Sanidad Internacional”). If you present symptoms after having entered the country, you should call 800 0044 800. You will be attended by trained personnel of the Ministry of Health. For further information (in Spanish), please see the Mexican Ministry of Health website.
If you are in Mexico City, you can also send a free of charge text message saying “covid19” to 51515 (service only available in Spanish).
Further information on coronavirus, including advice on preparing for foreign travel and helping reduce the spread of the virus, is available from Public Health England and on the TravelHealthPro website.
