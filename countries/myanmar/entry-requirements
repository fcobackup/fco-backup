This page reflects the UK government’s understanding of current rules for people travelling on a full ‘British Citizen’ passport from the UK, for the most common types of travel.
The authorities in Myanmar set and enforce entry rules.
All travellers
COVID-19 rules and requirements can change at short notice. Confirmation should be sought from the relevant Myanmar Embassy or Consulate well in advance of your departure.
Insurance
Ahead of arrival to Myanmar, you will need to purchase a Travel Accident Insurance Policy with COVID 19 coverage from Myanma Insurance. This applies even if travellers have worldwide insurance cover. The tariffs depend on age and length of stay (full details are on the Myanma Insurance website). Diplomats, UN officials and their family members do not need to purchase Myanma Insurance and can show proof of health insurance from their countries of origin instead.
Data collection
On arrival, passengers may be asked to fill in a paper form giving your name, contact details and address.

Arrivals must also provide evidence of a negative COVID-19 PCR test result. The test should be issued no more than 72 hours prior to the date of departure from the origin airport.
