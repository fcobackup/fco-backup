Before you travel, check the ‘Entry requirements’ section for Peru’s current entry restrictions and requirements.
If you plan to pass through another country to return to the UK, check the travel advice for the country you’re transiting.
Political protests in Peru are unpredictable and can escalate quickly and include violence. You should take particular care to avoid large gatherings and all areas of protests. If there are protests and it is possible, you should remain in a safe place. You should follow the local authorities’ advice and also monitor local media, including social media channels.
Protests may cause travel disruption, including with road blockades, suspension of train services and airport closures including in tourist areas. See Safety and Security.
It is more important than ever to get travel insurance and check it provides sufficient cover. See the FCDO’s guidance on foreign travel insurance.
There may be a higher risk to your safety in areas where there is organised crime and terrorism linked to the production of drugs, notably in the border areas with Ecuador, Colombia and Brazil and the Valley of Apurimac, Ene and Mantaro rivers (VRAEM). See Local travel.
Where there are greater security concerns or local authorities currently have limited presence, the British Government will have limited ability to offer assistance, and may not be able to provide emergency or consular support. While we will liaise with local authorities to request assistance, their ability to respond may also be very limited if circumstances are unfavourable.
Where protests, natural disasters or criminal activity results in travel disruption or damage to infrastructure, the British Government’s ability to provide consular support will be limited, as may that of local authorities.
