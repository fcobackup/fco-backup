Restrictions in response to coronavirus
Borders and travel
Argentina’s borders are closed to foreign nationals and non-residents entering the country. Some exceptions apply to this rule.
Nationals and residents of neighbouring countries can enter Argentina to visit the Metropolitan Area of Buenos Aires for tourism purposes and do not need to self-isolate for 14 days. Those who qualify must present a negative COVID-19 PCR test taken within 72 hours of travelling and have medical insurance with comprehensive cover for coronavirus, including hospitalisation and the costs of self-isolation if required. Entry in these cases is only allowed through the Port of Buenos Aires (Buquebus Terminal) and through Ezeiza International Airport and San Fernando International Airport in the Province of Buenos Aires. You should not use the NHS testing service to get a test in order to facilitate your travel to another country. You should arrange to take a private test.
Some non-resident foreign nationals who don’t usually require a visa to enter Argentina can be allowed into the country, at the discretion of immigration officials at: Ezeiza and San Fernando International Airports; the Buquebus terminals; and the land border crossings at Paso de los Libres-Uruguayana, Sistema Cristo Redentor, San Sebastian and Gualeguaychú-Fray Bentos. If allowed to enter, self-isolation is not required. For your entry to be considered, you must:
be a direct family member of an Argentine national or resident of Argentina
have an exceptional reason to visit your Argentine/resident family member
plan to visit for a limited period of time
not have any COVID-19 related symptoms
If you meet the above criteria, you will have to show the following to both your airline, or Buquebus, authorities before boarding, as well as to immigration officers upon arrival in Argentina:
a legalised (apostilled) birth or marriage certificate, or common law partnership documentation
a copy of your Argentine/resident relative’s national ID (DNI)
a letter explaining the exceptional reasons for your visit
proof that you have booked a return flight
proof that you have taken a COVID-19 PCR test, with a negative result, within 72 hours of your arrival
and proof you have medical insurance with comprehensive cover for coronavirus, including hospitalisation and the costs of self-isolation if required
The British Embassy cannot offer advice to British nationals on whether you meet the above criteria. You should check with your airline and your nearest Argentine Consulate for further information ahead of travelling. You should also contact your nearest Argentine Consulate to find out about any other type of exceptions such us the need to travel to Argentina for work reasons.
All those authorised to enter Argentina must fill in an [electronic ‘sworn statement’ form] within 48 hours of travelling and must either present a negative COVID-19 PCR test taken within 72 hours of travelling or choose to self-isolate for 14 days.
As of 15 December, all those authorised to enter the country must present a negative COVID-19 PCR test taken within 72 hours of travelling. Self-isolating for 14 days upon arrival will no longer be an option or requirement. If you have had coronavirus confirmed by a lab test within 90 days of your trip you don’t need to take a COVID-19 PCR test again but instead you will need to show evidence of your diagnosis and a medical certificate issued at least 10 days after being diagnosed confirming that you have a clean bill of health. Only residents of Argentina entering the country by land will be able to choose either to show a negative COVID-19 PCR test or self-isolating for 14 days.
Additionally, as of 15 December, all those authorised to enter the country and who intend to travel to the City of Buenos Aires will have to fill in a specific City of Buenos Aires specific ‘sworn declaration’ form and take a COVID-19 test upon arrival at Ezeiza International Airport. For full details, visit the City of Buenos Aires website (in Spanish).
