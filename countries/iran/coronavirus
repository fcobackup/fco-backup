Travel in Iran
It is now mandatory to wear face masks in enclosed public places. You may incur a fine if you do not comply.
Measures and restrictions are in place in Iran, including temporary closure of non-essential businesses and shrines, and cancellation of some public events. Each province is able to introduce restrictions to respond to localised peaks in infections. This may include lockdown and restriction of movement, and may be introduced with little warning.
Internal travel restrictions, including to important tourism and pilgrimage areas, may be imposed at short notice.
Accommodation
Hotels are authorised to open in Iran but you should check in advance as restrictions can change at short notice, and in practice some may remain closed.
Public places and services
Please refer to Travel in Iran section. Events such as sports matches remain either cancelled or held behind closed doors, with no spectators admitted. In practice, many restaurants, markets and shops remain closed or may have restrictions in place on the number of customers they will admit.
Healthcare in Iran
Many medical facilities are currently under severe strain due to COVID-19.
If you think you have COVID-19 symptoms, you are advised to take a test and to self-isolate at home until you receive the results. If the symptoms are not serious, you should continue to self-isolate at home but if the symptoms persist and/or worsen then you are advised to go to a hospital for treatment.
