Being so close to the equator, Kiribati doesn’t usually experience tropical cyclones. However, during the wet season, which normally runs from November to April, strong winds and sea swells are sometimes experienced.
You should monitor regional and international weather updates from the World Meteorological Organisation, the Fiji Meteorological Service, and local newspapers.
Kiribati is subject to periodic spells of drought. These can be severe, and water restrictions may be put in place.
