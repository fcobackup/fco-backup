The Marshall Islands are vulnerable to natural disasters, such as cyclones, floods and severe droughts. Although these are rare occurrences, you should monitor local and international weather updates from the World Meteorological Organisation carefully and follow any instructions issued by the local authorities. See our tropical cyclones page for advice about what to do if you’re caught up in a storm.
