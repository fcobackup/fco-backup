Zimbabwe’s economic situation remains unpredictable. Whilst the primary legal tender in Zimbabwe is the “Zimbabwe Dollar”, it currently possible for tourists to transact using the US Dollar at the offical exchange rate. There are some bureaux de change which will accept and change foreign currency, particularly US dollars. The exchange rate is currently unpredictable.
Prices and transactions will mainly be in Zimbabwean (RTGS) dollars but US dollars may be accepted in some businesses. You should check before making a transaction whether the price quoted is in Zimbabwean (RTGS) or US dollars as the symbol for both is $. It is recommended to check exchange rates prior to any transaction. You should check in advance what payment methods a restaurant, hotel or tour operator will accept. Some businesses, including some medical providers, may not accept payment by credit or debit card.
Zimbabwe is currently experiencing a severe shortage of cash. It’s effectively impossible to make cash withdrawals with an international bank card. Credit and debit cards are increasingly being used for transactions. Banks are experiencing challenges dispensing foreign currency cash including for international transfers from outside of Zimbabwe.
It’s illegal to leave Zimbabwe with more than USD $2,000 (or equivalent) in cash, unless it is left over from funds which you have brought in yourself and declared on arrival. You should keep the proof of declaration to avoid problems with officials on exit. It’s illegal to exchange foreign currency anywhere other than at officially licensed dealers (eg banks or bureau de change). Carry small denomination notes as change is rarely available in smaller businesses.
