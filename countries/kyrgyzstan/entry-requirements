The information on this page covers the most common types of travel and reflects the UK government’s understanding of the rules currently in place. Unless otherwise stated, this information is for travellers using a full ‘British Citizen’ passport.
The authorities in the country or territory you’re travelling to are responsible for setting and enforcing the rules for entry. If you’re unclear about any aspect of the entry requirements, or you need further reassurance, you’ll need to contact the embassy, high commission or consulate of the country or territory you’re travelling to.
You should also consider checking with your transport provider or travel company to make sure your passport and other travel documents meet their requirements.
Visas
British nationals don’t need a visa to enter and stay for up to 60 calendar days. If you stay in Kyrgyzstan for over 60 calendar days without a valid visa, you’ll be liable for a fine and you’ll need to get an exit visa which could further delay your departure. In some cases you may also need a police report in order to get the exit visa. It’s not possible to get a visa in Kyrgyzstan if you originally entered the country without a visa. If you think you may spend more than 60 days in Kyrgyzstan, you should get a visa from a Kyrgyz Embassy before you travel or on arrival at the airport in Bishkek. The visa can be extended and exit visas can be arranged at a Kyrgyz Government office at 10A Togolok Moldo in Bishkek.
E-visas are available for tourist and business visits of up to 90 days from the e-Visa website. These visas can’t be extended within Kyrgyzstan. They can only be used at Manas Airport, Bishkek, Osh international airport and at the Ak-Jol border crossing point into Kazakhstan.
Passport validity
Your passport should be valid for a minimum period of 6 months from the date of entry into Kyrgyzstan and must have at least 1 full blank page if you’re applying for a visa. This rule is not applicable when entering Kyrgyzstan under the 60 day visa-free regime.
UK Emergency Travel Documents
UK Emergency Travel Documents are accepted for entry, airside transit and exit from Kyrgyzstan. If using one to leave Kyrgyzstan, you must obtain an exit visa from OVIR (the Department for Visa and Registration under the Ministry of Internal Affairs). This takes at least 5 working days.
Yellow fever certificate requirements
Check whether you need a yellow fever certificate by visiting the National Travel Health Network and Centre’s TravelHealthPro website.
Registration
On 19 December 2016, the government of Kyrgyzstan approved a decree removing the requirement for British nationals staying in Kyrgyzstan for longer than 5 days to register with the local authorities. You now only need to register your stay with the State Registration Service if you’re visiting for more than 60 working days. If you’re staying for more than 60 working days you must register within 5 days of entry into Kyrgyzstan and you must register for the period of validity of your visa.
In April 2019, Kyrgyzstan simplified the process of registration for foreigners. Foreigners can now register through the electronic services portal (available in Russian and Kyrgyz only) instead of at the counter at the State Registration Service office. Under the new amendments, foreign citizens can act as a host and register visitors staying in their homes. The registration coupon with QR-code on the forms can be obtained online and printed on a regular printer. Mobile applications will be developed for reading the information.
