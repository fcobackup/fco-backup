There are currently no commercial options available to return to the UK from Mozambique. The Mozambican authorities have suspended all international commercial passenger flights to and from Mozambique until 31 May.

Future travel options
This travel advice will be updated when departure options become available. Sign up for travel advice email alerts and follow the British High Commission on Twitter and Facebook.
You will need to pay for your return travel to the UK. If departure options are available but you cannot afford the travel costs and have exhausted all other options for getting funds, you may be eligible to apply for an emergency loan from the government. This is a last resort option and you would need to repay the loan when you are back in the UK. For more information, contact Corporate Travel Management (CTM). CTM are a commercial partner of the FCO and are authorised to administer such loans on behalf of the FCO.
