On the evening of 20 March the government of Cuba announced new measures to combat the spread of Coronavirus in Cuba. The measures affect foreign nationals. The details are to be confirmed but key messages are:
• from Monday 23 March (midnight) only Cuban nationals and foreign residents will be allowed to enter Cuba. All will have to stay in quarantine for 14 days (the Embassy is clarifying if this is self isolation or specific location). This measure applies for 30 days and is subject to review;
• International airlines are permitted to come to Cuba with Cuban nationals and foreign residents and leave with passengers without symptoms/ Coronavirus. Those flights will be determined by airlines. Customers should therefore keep in touch with the airline they are booked on and keep other options in mind;
• Visitors staying in casas particulares may be moved to hotels; new arrivals may be taken to hotels or other accommodation for isolation;
• Restaurants and bars will be restricting services, working hours and seating;
• Camp sites will be closed;
• Transport services may be affected.
All visitors and British residents should review their travel plans accordingly and stay in close touch with their tour operator and airline about routes to return to UK, and follow the instructions of the Cuban authorities.
The Cuban government will give a further update on Monday 23 March on national television.
