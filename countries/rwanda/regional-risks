All border crossings into neighbouring countries are currently open for cross-border travel. However, border crossings into the Democratic Republic of the Congo (DRC), Uganda and Burundi have been temporarily closed to tourists in recent years. Be aware of the impact that short-notice border closures could have on any travel plans in the region.
Rwanda-DRC border
The security situation near Rwanda’s borders with DRC remains unstable. There have been armed attacks in and around Rwanda’s Nyungwe Forest Park and Volcanoes National Park. If you’re travelling near the DRC or Burundi borders, be aware of the risk of attacks and government security operations. Be cautious and keep up to date with developments through your tour operator and local media.
The eastern part of DRC near the Rwanda border remains unstable, and conflict can happen with little notice. There have been violent clashes on the DRC-Rwanda border in recent years, and armed incursions into south-west Rwanda:
on 18 June 2023, 2 people were killed and 6 were injured when suspected militants opened fire on a public passenger bus on Nyamagabe-Rusizi road, in Nyungwe Forest, Nyamgabe District
on 17 June 2023, a Congolese soldier crossed into Rwanda at Gisenyi and fired on civilians and Rwandan security personnel near the border, injuring 2 Rwandan police officers – the soldier was shot dead
in 2022, artillery fire from the DRC hit Rwandan territory, close to the border in Kinigi sector of Musanze District in the north-west
These incidents have not affected tourists sites, and the Rwandan government has assured visitors the area is secure. Further incidents cannot be ruled out because of instability in DRC.
Rwanda-Burundi border
The situation in Burundi remains unstable. Tensions along the Rwanda-Burundi border remain high. Both sides have accused the other of cross-border raids targeting local inhabitants.
