This page has information on travelling to Australia.
This page reflects the UK government’s understanding of current rules for people travelling on a full ‘British Citizen’ passport from the UK, for the most common types of travel.
The authorities in Australia set and enforce entry rules. If you are unsure how Australia’s entry requirements apply to you contact its UK embassy, high commission or consulate.
All travellers
To enter Australia, you must hold a valid passport, a valid visa, and a completed and signed Incoming Passenger Card.
Incoming Passenger Cards are distributed during your flight to Australia by your airline. For more information about visas, see “check your passport and travel documents” section below.
COVID-19 requirements
Travellers do not require a pre-departure COVID-19 test to enter or transit Australia regardless of their COVID-19 vaccination status. You should check if COVID-19 testing requirements are different for any transit countries you will pass through on the way to Australia, or if your airline has additional requirements.
As of 6 July 2022, travellers to Australia will no longer have to complete a Digital Passenger Declaration if arriving by air, or a Maritime Travel Declaration if arriving by sea, and there is no requirement to declare or prove your vaccination status for entry to Australia.
However, states and territories can apply their own travel restrictions on travellers arriving from international and domestic locations. You should check requirements for the state or territory in which you will arrive. Border rules can change quickly. Travellers should prepare for disruptions to their plans.
Quarantine requirements
Each state and territory is responsible for determining and managing quarantine requirements. You should check requirements for the state or territory in which you will arrive.
If any quarantine requirements apply, for example if you test positive for COVID-19, you will need to comply with the quarantine requirements in the state or territory you are in before travelling on to another state or territory.
If you’re fully vaccinated
All fully vaccinated visa holders can travel to Australia.
Proof of vaccination status
From 6 July 2022, proof of vaccination is not required for entry into Australia.
You may be required to provide proof of vaccination status to enter or transit through other countries, or for use within Australia. If you were vaccinated in Australia, you should use an International COVID-19 Vaccine Certificate (ICVC) generated by Services Australia.
Australia will accept the UK’s proof of COVID-19 vaccination record and proof of COVID-19 vaccination issued in the Crown Dependencies. Your NHS appointment card from vaccination centres is not designed to be used as proof of vaccination and should not be used to demonstrate your vaccine status.
If you’re not fully vaccinated
From 6 July 2022, proof of vaccination is no longer required for entry into Australia. All visa holders can travel to Australia, regardless of vaccination status. You should check if proof of COVID-19 vaccination status requirements are different for any transit countries you will pass through on the way to Australia, or if your airline has additional requirements.
Each state and territory is responsible for determining and managing quarantine requirements. You should check requirements for the state or territory in which you will arrive.
If any quarantine requirements apply, for example if you test positive for COVID-19, you will need to comply with the quarantine requirements in the state or territory you are in before travelling on to another state or territory.
Public health restrictions may apply differently to people who are not vaccinated for COVID-19. Proof of COVID-19 vaccination may be required for entering certain places or premises. You should check requirements for all the states and territories you plan to visit.
Children and young people
From 6 July 2022, children and young people will not be required to show proof of COVID-19 vaccination status to enter Australia. You should check if proof of COVID-19 vaccination status requirements are different for any transit countries you will pass through on the way to Australia, or if your airline has additional requirements.
If you’re transiting through Australia
As of 6 July 2022, travellers transiting through Australia will no longer have to complete a Digital Passenger Declaration if arriving by air, or a Maritime Travel Declaration if arriving by sea.
British citizens are eligible to transit through Australia for a maximum of 8 hours without a visa. If you wish to transit without a visa, you must remain airside and you will not be able to clear immigration, including to collect baggage which should have been checked through to your final destination. You can check information from the Department of Home Affairs on transiting without a visa. If you are not eligible to transit without a visa, for example if your transit time is longer than 8 hours, you will need to apply for and obtain a visa before travelling to Australia.
If you plan to transit Australia, check the latest entry restrictions for your destination and keep in touch with your airline, cruise line or tour operator before you travel.

Visas
British citizens can usually get the following types of electronic visitor visa:
eVisitor visa. There is no visa application charge or service fee
Electronic Travel Authority (ETA) via the iOS App or Android App. There is no visa application charge, but a service fee of A$20 may apply
Information on all other types of visa is available from the Department of Home Affairs, or from the Australian High Commission in London.
If you hold an ePassport you can use SmartGate to pass through passport control when arriving in Australia. See the Australian Border Force website for more information.
Working holiday visa
If you’re on a working holiday visa you should be aware of your rights as an employee in Australia and how to report any concerns about unfair or unlawful treatment.
Thousands of British working holiday makers travel to Australia each year with the vast majority enjoying their stay without issue. Working conditions, accommodation and medical facilities are generally of a good standard.
In October 2016 the Fair Work Ombudsman published a report following an inquiry into the wages and conditions of people working under the working holiday visa program, which highlighted exploitative workplace cultures where unreasonable and unlawful requirements were being imposed in some isolated and remote workplaces. If you have concerns about your workplace conditions or treatment you can contact the Fair Work Ombudsman on 13 13 94. You can also report concerns to them anonymously.
If you feel you’re being treated unfairly or unlawfully by an employer, you can email the UK’s National Crime Agency (NCA) at the British High Commission in Canberra at: Australia.WHVreferrals@fcdo.gov.uk. The NCA is working with a number of Australian authorities to help identify and address any illegal employer behaviour affecting British nationals.
For further information and advice, see our working holiday makers booklet.
Visas during COVID-19
According to the Australian Department of Home Affairs, there may be disruptions to visa processing arrangements during the COVID-19 pandemic. You can review global visa processing times on the Department of Home Affairs website.
If you’re unable to leave Australia and your visa is nearing expiry or has expired already, you should contact the Australian Department of Home Affairs as soon as possible. Australia does not issue visa extensions so you will need to apply for a new visa to remain lawful in Australia, and provide relevant supporting documentation. If your visa is expiring or has expired, you can follow the advice from the Department of Home Affairs.
You can find more information about visas for Australia, including visa options that may suit your needs, on the Department of Home Affairs website.
Passport validity
For entry into Australia, your passport should be valid for the proposed duration of your stay. No additional period of validity beyond this is needed.
If you’re transiting another country on your way to or from Australia, make sure you check the entry requirements for that country. Many countries will only permit entry if you have at least 6 months validity remaining on your passport.
UK Emergency Travel Documents
UK Emergency Travel Documents are valid for entry into, transit through, and exit from Australia.
Dual nationals
If you’re a British national living in Australia with Australian citizenship, or you’re a dual national, you should leave and enter Australia on your Australian passport, otherwise you may face difficulties and delays. For more information, see the Department of Foreign Affairs & Trade’s website.
