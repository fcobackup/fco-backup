The information on this page covers the most common types of travel and reflects the UK government’s understanding of the rules currently in place. Unless otherwise stated, this information is for travellers using a full ‘British Citizen’ passport.
The authorities in the country or territory you’re travelling to are responsible for setting and enforcing the rules for entry. If you’re unclear about any aspect of the entry requirements, or you need further reassurance, you’ll need to contact the embassy, high commission or consulate of the country or territory you’re travelling to.
You should also consider checking with your transport provider or travel company to make sure your passport and other travel documents meet their requirements.

Android app
Apple Store
You must complete a Health Screening Arrival Form before arrival, for monitoring and contact tracing. Each adult traveller must download the app and register individually. You can register children via a parent’s app. When you arrive in Liberia, you must be able to show proof that you have completed the symptom tracker form. You must wear a mask during transit and upon arrival in Liberia.
Currently all land borders (with Sierra Leone, Guinea and Côte d’Ivoire) are closed to travellers. Ports remain open.
Testing / screening on arrival
All travellers arriving in Liberia will be screened for the coronavirus.
On arrival at entry points, staff will check your temperature and you must wash your hands with soap and water. You must show your symptom checking screening form (mobile app) to public health staff.
If you display symptoms of coronavirus, public health officials may take you to a government quarantine or medical facility. See Quarantine. Passengers entering Liberia will be tested for COVID-19 by the National Public Health Reference Laboratory team (unless exempt from testing). Sample collection involves taking a swab of the inside of your nose and the back of your throat, using a long cotton bud, for PCR testing. Sample processing could take several days.
You must pay US$75 for your PCR test and present proof of payment before your sample is collected. There are two payment options available. You can pay in advance online at http://datapointdev.liberiacovid19.info/#/PaymentProcessing. Please note that this website does not employ SSL technology and is not a secure website. Alternatively, you can pay at the United Bank for Africa (UBA) banking window (in US dollars cash or by card) on arrival.
If your PCR test is positive, you will be subject to Liberia’s case management guidelines. This means NPHIL will consider on a case-by-case basis and you may be taken to a government COVID-19 Treatment Unit. Private health care facilities are not currently permitted to treat COVID-19 patients. Home-based care is considered on a case-by-case basis.
If your PCR test is negative, you must self-isolate and monitor your symptoms via the Lib Travel app, for a period of 14 days beginning the day after arrival in Liberia. If you are not resident in Liberia and wish to self-isolate in a hotel, you must receive agreement from your hotel.
PCR testing exemptions:
Children under the age of 5 years old are exempt from COVID-19 testing and do not require a test result certificate.
Cabin crew, captains, flight engineers and first officers with layovers less than 48 hours are exempt from testing if they complete pre-boarding testing as per their airline’s policy and comply with screening procedures while in Liberia. They must complete screening on arrival and proceed to their designated flight crew hotel. If layover is more than 48 hours, cabin crew, captains, flight engineers and first officers must undergo PCR testing before leaving Liberia (see Leaving Liberia)
Diplomats and their families, honorary consuls, duly accredited international organisations’ staff must present a negative PCR COVID-19 test result certificate from an accredited lab within 96 hours of testing (i.e. your test sample must have been collected a maximum of 4 days before arrival in Liberia). Alternatively, voluntary testing at the airport is available free of charge.
You should not use the NHS testing service to get a test in order to facilitate your travel to another country. You should arrange to take a private test.
You should be prepared for travel restrictions, and changes to screening and quarantine requirements with no advance notice.
Quarantine
All travellers arriving in Liberia must self-isolate for a period of 14 days beginning the day after arrival in Liberia. If you are not resident in Liberia and wish to self-isolate in a hotel, you must agree this with your hotel in advance. There is a risk for British nationals of being put into a government quarantine or medical facility, either on arrival or during your trip to Liberia. Liberian Precautionary Observation Centre (POCs) are basic, and not guaranteed to meet Public Health England standards.
You are at risk of being put into quarantine or instructed to self-isolate even after completing your 14 days of post-arrival self-isolation, if you develop symptoms (fever, cough or respiratory illness), or it is suspected you have been in contact with some who has tested positive for coronavirus. If you test positive for COVID-19, you may be transferred to a government quarantine facility or treatment centre. You are strongly advised to familiarise yourself with these risks before travelling.
If you are travelling on behalf of government, an international organisation/NGO or a company, you should check with your organisation whether they have pre-arranged a private POC, i.e. quarantine facility, authorised by NHPIL. The British Embassy cannot provide POC facilities. If you show symptoms, you may be transferred to a government POC or treatment centre
Visitors arriving on a laissez-passer (except UN or EU), may also be taken to quarantine for secondary screening. Any suspicion of illegal attempts to circumvent the process will result in 14 days of quarantine.
Leaving Liberia
Before departure from Liberia, you’ll need a negative COVID-19 test result, and a travel certificate issued by the National Public Health Institute of Liberia (NPHIL):
You must present a negative COVID-19 PCR test result, from a test conducted by Liberia’s National Public Health Reference Laboratory within 72 hours (3 days) of departure. COVID-19 testing is available at the Union Center, located in Sophia, Congo Town, Monrovia from 9am to 4 pm 7 days per week.

You must ensure you provide correct contact details when paying. You will receive a unique identification number to retrieve your test results.

If your test result is positive, the Ministry of Health or NPHIL will contact you and you will not be permitted to travel. You will be subject to Liberia’s case management guidelines. This means NPHIL will consider on a case-by-case basis and you may be taken to a government COVID-19 Treatment Unit. Private health care facilities are not currently permitted to treat COVID-19 patients. Home-based care is considered on a case-by-case basis.
