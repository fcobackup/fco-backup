Warning
FCDO advises against all travel to parts of Moldova.

Your travel insurance could be invalidated if you travel against advice from the Foreign, Commonwealth & Development Office (FCDO).
Areas where FCDO advises against travel
Transnistria
FCDO advises against all travel to Transnistria. There is widespread military activity in Ukraine, including close to some Moldovan borders. Transnistria is outside the control of the Moldovan government.  
FCDOâ€™s ability to offer support is extremely limited and will be more limited if there is military action on or near the Moldova-Ukraine border.
