Drug trafficking is a serious problem: possession and trafficking in drugs leads to lengthy prison sentences and heavy fines. The minimum jail sentence for illegal drug offences is three years. Prison conditions in Guyana are tough. Pack all luggage yourself and do not carry any items that do not belong to you.
People are regularly offered free air tickets to Guyana. On arrival their ’sponsors’ will only allow them to leave Guyana if they carry a ’package’ (usually cocaine). The Guyana anti-drug authorities at the airport will routinely stop or search foreigners fitting a certain profile.
Homosexual activity is illegal. Public displays of homosexuality like holding hands or kissing in public places could lead to arrest and imprisonment. See our information and advice page for the LGBT community before you travel.
