Authorised civic marches and demonstrations will take place in Blantyre, Lilongwe and Mzuzu on Friday 27 April 2018, starting at 7.30am and lasting until around midday. If you’re travelling in these cities you should anticipate and plan for significant road and transport disruption, both along and close to the authorised routes:
Blantyre: from Upper Stadium via Chipembere Highway to the civic offices.
Lilongwe: from Winners Chapel in Mchesi, via Kamuzu Central Hospital and Lingadzi roundabouts and passing the parliament building; ending either at the office of the president and cabinet on Capital Hill or the civic offices in Capital City.
Mzuzu: Katoto via Mzuzu Clock Tower via High Court Road roundabout to civil offices.
You should avoid the marches and demonstrations, remain vigilant and follow the advice of the local security authorities and tour operators.
Between September and December 2017 there was a period of unrest and violence in the Mount Mulanje area, surrounding districts of Thyolo, Chiradzulu and Phalombe and also in rural parts of Blantyre, Zomba and Nsanje districts. You should continue to exercise extreme caution if you’re travelling in these areas, especially after dark, avoid any demonstrations or large groups of people and follow local security advice.
