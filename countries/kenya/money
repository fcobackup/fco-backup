The currency of Kenya is the Kenyan Shilling (KES).
ATMs are widely available in Nairobi and the main towns and credit cards are widely accepted. It’s unlikely you’ll be able to exchange Scottish or Northern Irish banknotes in Kenya.
Kenya is in the process of introducing new banknotes. As of 1 October 2019, the old-style one thousand shillings notes are no longer legal tender.
