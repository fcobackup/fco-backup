Cases of coronavirus (COVID-19) have been confirmed in Latvia. The Latvian authorities have introduced a number of measures to limit the spread of the virus, including the closure of all educational institutions, restrictions on public events, and the maintenance of social distancing.
The State of Emergency which the Latvian Government introduced on 12 March until 14 April and which it announced on 7 April will be extended to 12 May means that:
British nationals are permitted to exit Latvia at designated land border crossing points, but there is no guarantee of onward travel.
Nationals of the Republic of Latvia and foreign nationals who hold residence cards issued by the Latvian Office of Citizenship and Migration Affairs are permitted to enter Latvia through designated land border crossing points.
The international transit of passengers through airports and ports, by bus and rail, is suspended.
The movement of passengers and vehicles through border crossing points at airports and ports, on road and railway lines at the external border of the European Union is prohibited. This also applies to border crossing points intended for local border traffic, with the exception of the carriage of goods.
There are currently no commercial flights leaving Latvia to return to the UK. You should keep up to date with information from your tour operator, transport or accommodation provider on the impact on any existing travel plans.

Only Latvian nationals and foreign nationals who hold residence cards issued by the Latvian Office of Citizenship and Migration Affairs are authorised to enter Latvia from abroad.
The Latvian Government and the Latvian Centre for Disease Prevention and Control have introduced measures requiring all travellers to Latvia arriving from anywhere abroad, including the UK, to take special protection measures:
Self-isolate (quarantine) and carefully monitor their health for 14 days after their arrival in Latvia including by taking their body temperature twice a day (in the morning and evening);
If you experience mild flu-like (increased body temperature, cough, sore throat) symptoms for at least two days you should call 8303. The dispatcher will then evaluate on a case-by-case basis and refer you to a testing point or send a medical unit to you if you are unable to travel to a testing point.
In case of sudden onset of at least one of the following symptoms – dry cough, fever, shortness of breath – restrict contact with people nearby, but in case not possible, keep distance of at least two metres from them, and call 113 immediately (State Emergency Medical Service);
Keep up to date with information from your tour operator, transport or accommodation provider on the impact on any existing travel plans.
