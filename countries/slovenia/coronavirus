Individuals entering Slovenia are required to self-isolate for seven days, at an address which must be provided to the Slovene Border authorities. At the end of this period, you will be required to take a mandatory coronavirus test. If you decline to take this test, you will be required to undertake a further isolation period of seven days. Travellers who are unable to specify the address at which they will spend the quarantine period, will be refused entry to Slovenia.
You will be required to provide evidence of legal documentation for the duration of your stay in Slovenia (such as an official work permit or a residency document). Failure to provide this information will result in entry being refused.
Individuals transiting Slovenia without a stop-over are exempt from this requirement.
If you enter Slovenia you are advised to carry with you evidence of your reason for travel (for example, onward travel bookings; proof of residency; a work permit).
Neighbouring countries have introduced restrictions on entry from Slovenia. See travel advice for Austria, Croatia, Hungary and Italy.

The Slovene government has introduced restrictions on “non-essential services”, including tourist and visitor accommodation. Grocery stores, pharmacies, banks, post offices, petrol stations, newsstands and stores selling agricultural products remain open. Libraries, galleries, insurance companies and estate agents are permitted to open.
Protective masks (or other material covering the nose and mouth) must be worn in indoor public areas, including shops.
Restaurants and bars are permitted to open, if they are able to serve customers outside their venues, whilst observing social distancing requirements.
From 11 May, public transport (buses and trains) will gradually resume service. You are required to wear a protective mask, sanitise your hands with the supplied hand cleaner and maintain a safety distance of at least 1.5m. Wherever possible, tickets should be bought in advance (online, ticket machines and at sales counters). Taxi services continue to be available.
