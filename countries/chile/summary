If you’re visiting the Elqui Valley and/or the wider Coquimbo region on 2 July for the Solar Eclipse, you should be aware that the main road to the Elqui Valley (Road 41) has a high accident rate. Local authorities advise visitors to avoid this road on 2 July as they are expecting 350,000 visitors and it will be closed in the morning for 3 hours between La Serena and Vicuña. You should wear a pair of special eclipse glasses (with a CE Kitemark) to view the eclipse. They will block out more than 99.9% of the sun’s light.
