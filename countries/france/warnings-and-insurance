France National threat level
Following a fatal attack in Arras, northern France on 13 October 2023, France has raised its national threat level to the highest level (‘Emergency Attack Level’). This threat level is described as ‘maximum vigilance and protection in the event of an imminent threat of a terrorist act or in the immediate aftermath of an attack’. Evacuations of crowded places may take place, including:
airports
public transport stations and stops
tourist sites
major sports venues
schools
places of worship
large commercial centres
Stay alert, be prepared for heightened security checks and follow the advice of local authorities. See the Safety and Security section for more information.
Pro-Palestinian demonstrations in France
There have been some pro-Palestinian demonstrations in France related to events in Israel and the Occupied Palestinian Territories. French authorities have increased security around Jewish community sites. Stay aware of your surroundings, stay away from demonstrations and follow the advice of local authorities.
