The information on this page covers the most common types of travel and reflects the UK government’s understanding of the rules currently in place. Unless otherwise stated, this information is for travellers using a full ‘British Citizen’ passport.
The authorities in the country or territory you’re travelling to are responsible for setting and enforcing the rules for entry. If you’re unclear about any aspect of the entry requirements, or you need further reassurance, you’ll need to contact the embassy, high commission or consulate of the country or territory you’re travelling to.
You should also consider checking with your transport provider or travel company to make sure your passport and other travel documents meet their requirements.
Entry rules in response to coronavirus (COVID-19)
Entry to Barbados
Barbados has published travel protocols setting out its entry requirements in relation to COVID-19. Visit the Visit Barbados website for full details. You should read these before your departure and monitor the pages on a regular basis as the requirements may change at short notice. Masks should be worn at all times during your travel to Barbados and your passage through the airport. Social distancing and hygiene protocols are in place.
Arrive with a COVID 19 negative test
The Government of Barbados designates the UK as a High Risk country. All travellers must present on arrival a valid COVID-19 negative test result taken no more than 3 days in advance of your flight’s arrival. Please note that the test can be taken at any time during the day 3 days prior to the date of your arrival in Barbados. (For example, if your flight arrives at 10pm on Saturday, you can take a test at any time on the Wednesday prior to this.) You should check the protocols to confirm and understand all requirements. Relevant test accrediting bodies and standards authorities include: ISO 15189, CAP, UKAS or the equivalent.
All passengers are also required to submit an Embarkation/Disembarkation (ED) card 24 hours prior to travel, to which they should upload their negative test result via www.travelform.gov.bb.
If you arrive in Barbados from the UK without a valid negative PCR test, you may be denied entry to the country. You should not use the NHS testing service to get a test in order to facilitate your travel to another country. You should arrange to take a private test. On arrival all passengers are also subject to a health screen.
Quarantine
All arrivals from the UK are required to undergo a rapid antigen test at the airport. If negative, you will then be quarantined at approved facilities (a designated holding hotel, approved villa or a government facility at your own expense). See the Barbados Travel Protocols for further details.
You will be monitored for seven days after arrival. (Monitoring includes interviews and assessments with public health professionals.) You will be required to undergo a second PCR test 5 days after arrival.
You will need to remain in your hotel room and may be required to wear an electronic tracking bracelet until you receive the results of your second test. If the result of that second test is negative, you will not be subject to further quarantine. The government aims to return results within 24 hours. However, at present, return times are longer than this.
If you test positive for COVID-19 at any point during your stay in Barbados, you will be required to self-isolate. You will first be transferred to the government isolation facility for 24 hours. You can then request to self-isolate at your hotel or villa, or government approved isolation property under strict stipulations that must be signed and adhered to. This will be at your own expense for non-nationals and non-residents. You will need to remain at your designated accommodation until the Barbadian authorities are satisfied that you have recovered. This may mean a mandatory stay of several weeks in Barbados. Upon recovery, tourists can continue their holiday or return home. See the Barbados Travel Protocols for full details of isolation options, facilities and requirements.
If you are deemed to have been in close contact with a positive COVID-19 case, you will be required to quarantine at approved facilities. See Barbados Travel Protocols for full details.
You can find full and definitive details of the protocols at Visit Barbados website and are advised to read and understand the requirements carefully before departure.
You should monitor the website on a regular basis as the Government of Barbados may change the requirements without notice.
Regular entry requirements
Visas
British passport holders don’t need a visa to visit Barbados.
On entry, you will normally be granted a specified period to stay. If you wish to stay longer, you must apply and pay for an extension of stay through the Barbados Immigration Department.
It’s an offence to overstay the entry period or to work without a work permit.
Passport validity
Your passport should be valid for the proposed duration of your stay. No additional period of validity beyond this is required.
UK Emergency Travel Documents
UK Emergency Travel Documents (ETDs) are accepted for entry, airside transit and exit from Barbados.
Departure tax
A departure tax of BDS$55 (US$27.50) applies for all passengers over 2 years old leaving Barbados. From 1 October 2018, an additional fee has been added. Passengers flying outside of the Caribbean region pay US$70 per person, and those flying within the Caribbean pay US$35 per person. Most airlines include the cost within the ticket price. If in doubt, you should check with your airline or tour operator.
