Terrorists are very likely to try to carry out attacks in Afghanistan.
Multiple violent groups operate in Afghanistan and many hold strong anti-Western views which could make any British interest or person a target. Daesh Khorasan Province (ISKP) continues to be a serious threat and is fiercely hostile to the UK, other western countries and some religious minority communities. Attacks include roadside and suicide bombs either on foot or by vehicle, indirect rocket and mortar fire, direct fire including shootings and rocket propelled grenades as well as kidnappings and violent crime. Further attacks are increasingly likely.
If you choose to travel to Afghanistan against FCDO advice, you should be aware terrorists are likely to target public places frequented by foreigners including hotels such as the Serena, restaurants, diplomatic missions, shops and market places, particularly at busy and congested times of the days. Hotels used by the former government of Afghanistan and western nationals, government ministries (official buildings and agencies such as passport offices), military establishments, airports (including Kabul International), hospitals, vehicles of humanitarian organisations, religious sites and places of worship have previously been attacked. Make sure your accommodation is secure, and review your security measures regularly. Keep others informed including family and friends of your travel plans.
UK Counter Terrorism Policing has information and advice on staying safe abroad and what to do in the event of a terrorist attack. Find out more about the global threat from terrorism.
Kidnap
There is a very high threat of being kidnapped in Afghanistan.
British nationals are viewed as legitimate targets, including those engaged in tourism, humanitarian aid and some other development work, journalism or business sectors are viewed as legitimate targets. NGO workers have been kidnapped near their places of work. The International NGO Safety Organisation (INSO) issues regular security updates for NGOs. Most attacks continue to occur in the east and south of Afghanistan with a recent increase in activity in the central areas. If you are kidnapped, the reason for your presence is unlikely to serve as a protection or secure your safe release.
Over 100 westerners have been kidnapped in Afghanistan since 2001; a number of them have been British nationals.
At least four foreign nationals have been kidnapped in Kabul since July 2016, some of whom remain in captivity:
in January 2020, an international commercial contractor was kidnapped in Kabul or in a nearby province: the victim is still missing.
on 2 August 2018, three international workers were killed shortly after being kidnapped in Kabul.
The motivation and desire to undertake kidnapping in Afghanistan is likely to continue. You should take the utmost care, vary routines and avoid setting regular patterns of movement. You should take professional security advice while in the country.
The long-standing policy of the UK government is not to make substantive concessions to hostage takers. The UK government considers that paying ransoms and releasing prisoners builds the capability of terrorist groups and finances their activities. This can, in turn, increase the risk of further hostage-taking. The Terrorism Act (2000) makes payments to terrorists illegal.
