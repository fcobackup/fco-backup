Regular entry requirements
Visas
Although Macao is now part of the People’s Republic of China, it remains a Special Administrative Region with its own immigration controls. You can stay in Macao for up to 6 months without a visa. If you intend to work in Macao you must get a visa before arrival. Contact the Macao Immigration Department.
Passport validity
Your passport should be valid for a minimum period of one month from the date of entry into Macao. If you are staying longer than one month your passport must be valid for the duration of your visit.
UK Emergency Travel Documents
UK Emergency Travel Documents (ETDs) are accepted for entry, airside transit and exit from Macao.
Visits to mainland China
If you intend to travel to mainland China via Macao using a British passport you must get a Chinese visa before arrival at the border. Failure to do so could result in a fine and possible detention by the mainland Chinese authorities. If you’re entering Macao via mainland China and leaving again via the mainland you’ll need to have a double or multiple entry visa to re-enter mainland China.
There are reports of greater scrutiny from mainland authorities at border crossings into Macao at this time, including checks on travellers’ electronic devices.
