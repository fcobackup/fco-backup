The Foreign and Commonwealth Office (FCO) advise against all travel to:
the Darfur states
the Abyei Region
South Kordofan and Blue Nile states
the southern area of West Kordofan state that was previously part of South Kordofan, as shown on the map
within 50km of the border with South Sudan in White Nile and Sennar states
within 200km of the border with Libya
The FCO advise against all but essential travel to the rest of Sudan, including Khartoum. If you’re in Sudan, you should consider carefully whether your need to remain is essential and consider leaving the country by commercial means. As of 5 June 2019, the decision was made to withdraw non-essential British Embassy staff and dependants from Sudan.
Following the removal of Sudan’s former President on 11 April and the establishment of a Transitional Military Council, the situation in Khartoum and across Sudan is volatile. On 3 June, security forces dispersed protestors by force from the main protest site in central Khartoum. Approximately 30 people were killed and more than 100 injured. Sporadic gunfire has been heard across the city in recent weeks. A national strike is planned for Sunday 9 June which could lead to another escalation in violence and disruption to of commercial flights, which are already limited. See Political situation
You should maintain a high level of vigilance across the country, avoid all protests and large gatherings, monitor developments closely and follow the instructions of local authorities and security services.
If you’re in Khartoum, limit your movements in and around the city and plan any travel carefully. There remains a significant military presence in the area to the north of the main protest site, and many roads around the city are blocked by civilians and military. If you’re travelling to Khartoum Airport, check regularly with your airline for the latest information on the status of your flight before leaving for the airport. If you intend to travel outside of Khartoum and around the wider country, plan ahead and seek information on the situation in districts you propose travelling to or through before departing. See Local travel - Khartoum
There has been no internet service in Khartoum since 3 June. There had earlier been sporadic limitations on access to internet-based communications and social media sites. Virtual Private Networks (VPNs) are not readily available to download in Sudan.
The ability of the British Embassy to provide consular support to British nationals in Sudan is severely limited. You shouldn’t assume that the FCO will be able to provide assistance to leave the country in the event of serious unrest, a further deterioration in the security situation and/or reduced capacity of commercial flights. See this page for more information about the precautions you should take in the event of a crisis and the help and support the British Embassy can provide.
On a number of occasions since the beginning of 2018, there have been shortages of fuel throughout Sudan including in Khartoum. At times these have led to very long queues (several hours or even overnight) at petrol stations (which regularly run dry) and rationing of the commercial supply. Earlier in the year, the shortages had knock on effects, including availability of services and some basic food items. There have been some violent incidents at petrol stations. If you need to travel by road, consider how you will get fuel during your journey and whether you have sufficient fuel for your return trip.
On 30 December 2017, the then President Omar Al Bashir announced a state of emergency in the states of Kassala and North Kordofan, which remains in place. States of emergency give the authorities increased powers of arrest in these areas. The border between Sudan and Ethiopia was closed suddenly on 28 April 2019. On 31 January 2019 the border between Sudan and Eritrea was reopened, having been closed since January 2018. A heavy security presence remains in the area.
Terrorists are likely to try to carry out attacks in Sudan. Attacks could be indiscriminate, including in places frequented by expatriates and foreign travellers. See Terrorism
