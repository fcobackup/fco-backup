This page gives you guidance on how to stay safely in Montenegro as a visitor, if you are unable to return to the UK.
Everyone should comply with the measures put in place in Montenegro to limit the spread of coronavirus (COVID-19).
Moving around in Montenegro
For information on entering Montenegro, see Entry Requirements. A number of restrictions to prevent the spread of the virus have been put in place by the Montenegrin Government, on the advice of the Institute for Public Health.
Those in country can be subject to a mandatory self-isolation period of 14 days at the direction of sanitary inspectors, for example if you have symptoms of coronavirus or if you have been in contact, or are suspected to have been in contact, with someone known to have coronavirus. Additional measures may be requested.
All public gatherings are banned. There are a number of restrictions on private gatherings including a ban on wedding gatherings and only immediate family being allowed to attend funerals. In addition:
visits to hospitals, prisons, social care and child protective care institutions are banned
pharmacies, supermarkets and shops are open, subject to sanitary controls and limits on the number of people allowed inside at any given time
all child day care services, elementary and secondary schools and universities are closed
a facemask or covering must be worn in all enclosed public spaces (including shops, banks, and post offices)
Access to private and public beaches is allowed. A distance of at least 2 metres between sunbeds / other beach occupants is required at all times, unless visitors are members of the same family household.
Indoor and outdoor group sport activities are allowed to resume, with a requirement to split sport teams into smaller groups wherever possible.
On 28 May the Montenegrin Government announced the reopening of cinemas, theatres and kindergartens from 1 June, as well as public gatherings and sports events, involving up to 200 people.
Driving
Facemasks or coverings are required when people travel, with the exception of family members occupying the same vehicle.
Locally issued, but expired driving licences will remain valid, as long as the driving licence holder has a valid insurance policy and a technical car check certificate.
Social measures
Social distancing of two metres is highly recommended.
Those over 65 years old are recommended to self-isolate.
The Government of Montenegro has introduced a set of measures in response to the coronavirus. A list of measures in English is available on the Montenegrin government website.
Visas
Expired permanent and temporary residence permits and temporary work permits will remain valid for foreigners until 1 July 2020.
Health
If you develop any symptoms or are concerned about your health do not go to a hospital or a doctor. You should stay in your home or accommodation and call the designated Institute of Public Health hotline 1616 from 10am to 8pm, or ask a Montenegrin-speaker to call on your behalf. Call handlers will be able to assess the risks you have been exposed to and provide further recommendations and instructions for you to take.

Finance
There is a range of financial support from the government that you can access while you are unable to return due to coronavirus restrictions.
If you’re in Montenegro, and have exhausted all other options to cover essential living costs while you wait to return home, you could apply for an emergency loan for your living costs from the UK government. You can only apply if you normally live in the UK and you cannot return home. This last-resort option is for those most in need, and you would need to repay the loan when you are back in the UK. Apply for an emergency loan.

If you need urgent consular assistance, contact your nearest British embassy, high commission or consulate. All telephone numbers are available 24/7.
