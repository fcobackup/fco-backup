Future travel options
This travel advice will be updated when departure options become available. Sign up for travel advice email alerts, follow the British High Commission on Facebook and the Twitter accounts of the British High Commissioner and Deputy High Commissioner.
You will need to pay for your return travel to the UK. If departure options are available but you cannot afford the travel costs and have exhausted all other options for getting funds, you may be eligible to apply for an emergency loan from the government. This is a last resort option and you would need to repay the loan when you are back in the UK. For more information, contact Corporate Travel Management (CTM). CTM are a commercial partner of the FCO and are authorised to administer such loans on behalf of the FCO.
