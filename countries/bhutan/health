Before you travel check that:
your destination can provide the healthcare you may need
you have appropriate travel insurance for local treatment or unexpected medical evacuation
This is particularly important if you have a health condition or are pregnant.
Emergency medical number
Dial 112 and ask for an ambulance.
Contact your insurance company quickly if you’re referred to a medical facility for treatment.
Vaccinations and health risks
At least 8 weeks before your trip check:

where to get vaccines and whether you have to pay on the NHS travel vaccinations page
Go to TravelHealthPro to see what health risks you’ll face in Bhutan.

Medication
The legal status and regulation of some medicines prescribed or bought in the UK can be different in other countries.
Read best practice when travelling with medicines on TravelHealthPro.
The NHS has information on whether you can take your medicine abroad.
If you’re carrying a large amount of medicine or medicine that’s not for your personal use, check with the Bhutanese Embassy in Brussels.
Healthcare facilities in Bhutan
Healthcare facilities vary in quality across Bhutan. One hospital in Thimphu can provide surgery and emergency treatment. Outside of Thimphu, hospitals generally provide only basic healthcare. Treatment for more complex issues is not available in Bhutan and you would need evacuation to India or Thailand for treatment.
Make sure you have adequate travel health insurance that covers the cost of medical treatment abroad, emergency helicopter evacuation and repatriation.
English is widely spoken in Bhutan and doctors are likely to speak some English.

Read FCDO guidance on travel and mental health. There is also mental health guidance on TravelHealthPro.
