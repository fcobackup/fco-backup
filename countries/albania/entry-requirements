This page reflects the UK government’s understanding of current rules for people travelling on a full ‘British Citizen’ passport, for the most common types of travel.
The authorities in Albania set and enforce entry rules. For further information contact the embassy, high commission or consulate of the country or territory you’re travelling to. You should also consider checking with your transport provider or travel company to make sure your passport and other travel documents meet their requirements.
Entry rules in response to coronavirus (COVID-19)
All land borders are open. However neighbouring countries may have different entry and exit restrictions on their side of the border. You should check before travelling.
Keep up to date with information from your tour operator, transport or accommodation provider on the impact on any existing travel plans. If you need further information about entry requirements, contact the local immigration authorities or the nearest Albanian Embassy/Consulate. You should also check with your airline or travel company for the latest information.
Entering Albania from the UK
Regulations related to COVID-19 have been lifted
Quarantine and testing requirements if you’re travelling to neighbouring countries from Albania
If you are a British national travelling from Albania to Kosovo or North Macedonia there is no requirement to self-isolate, nor provide a PCR test nor provide a proof of vaccination upon entry to Kosovo or North Macedonia.
If you are a British national travelling from Albania to Montenegro you are exempt from the requirement to have a negative PCR test or proof of vaccination, but only if you have not travelled elsewhere in the previous 15 days.
If you are a British national travelling from Albania to Greece you can enter it only by the following land borders: Kakavia and Qafë-Botë. Travellers must fill in a Passenger Locator Form (PLF) no later than 11:59pm (Greek local time) on the day before arriving in Greece. You must provide either: proof of a negative COVID-19 PCR test, undertaken within the 72 hour period before arrival into Greece; proof of a negative COVID-19 rapid antigen test from an authorized laboratory, undertaken within the 48 hour period before the scheduled flight; or proof of two COVID-19 vaccinations (i.e. complete vaccine) completed at least 14 days before travel. Travellers with proof of either are exempted from the need to self-isolate on arrival in Greece. Failure to provide proof of either will likely result in the Greek authorities refusing you permission to enter Greece.
