Hurricanes
The hurricane season in Martinique normally runs from June to November. Monitor local and international weather updates from the US National Hurricane Centre website and check with local authorities or your tour operator for any changes to your onward travel plans.  
See our tropical cyclones page for advice about how to prepare effectively and what to do if you’re likely to be affected by a hurricane or tropical cyclone.
Volcanoes
The Montagne Pelée volcano was moved to ‘yellow volcanic alert level’ on 4 December 2020 following a registered change in behaviour of the volcanic system. Montagne Pelée is being closely monitored by a local observatory and there would be warning well in advance from the local authorities of any imminent volcanic activity. For further information, see the Volcanological and Seismological Observatory of Martinique’s website.
