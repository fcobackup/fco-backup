There are severe penalties for all drug offences. Pack all luggage yourself and don’t carry anything through Customs for anyone else. It is an offence for anyone, including children, to dress in camouflage clothing. Be aware of local dress codes and don’t wear swimming attire when walking in town.
Local attitudes towards the LGBT community are mostly conservative throughout the Caribbean. Public displays of affection (such as hand-holding or kissing) between opposite or same-sex couples are uncommon. Certain homosexual acts are illegal. LGBT travellers should be mindful of local attitudes and be aware that public displays of affection may attract unwanted and negative attention. See our information and advice page for the LGBT community before you travel.
