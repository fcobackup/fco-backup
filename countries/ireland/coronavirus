Local advice
On 15 September 2020, the Irish Government published a plan for ‘Living with COVID-19’ in the 6-9 months covering the end of 2020 and early 2021.
The revised strategy includes a ‘Framework for Restrictive Measures’ designed to allow people to understand, anticipate and prepare for the measures the government might introduce to stop escalation of the virus. The Framework consists of 5 Levels, which will be imposed depending on the incidence of COVID-19. Ireland is currently at Level 2. There are additional specific measures in place for Dublin (see section on Dublin below).
You should check the Irish Government website, for comprehensive guidance on public health measures currently in force.
Nationwide restrictions currently in force include the following:
Social and family gatherings in your home or garden – limited to a maximum of six visitors from up to three households including your own.
Other settings outside your home or garden - members of different households can continue to meet socially in other settings up to 6 people indoors and 15 outdoors from up to three households including your own.
Bars, cafes and restaurants (including hotel restaurants and bars) - Open with protective measures in place. Maximum numbers in restaurants and cafes linked to capacity of establishment, taking account of public health advice, but with individual groups limited to 6 people from up to 3 households.
Pubs or bars which do not serve food - open with robust protective measures in place. Maximum numbers linked to capacity of establishment, taking account of public health advice including appropriate social distancing, but with individual groups limited to 6 people from no more than 3 households.
Those aged 70 years and over and the medically vulnerable should exercise judgement regarding the extent to which they engage with others and in activities outside home.
Transport: you must wear a face covering on public transport. Walk or cycle where possible. Public transport capacity is limited to 50% and peak hours are for essential workers and essential purposes only.
Hotels and accommodation are open with protective measures in place.
There are no restrictions on domestic travel outside of Dublin.
For further detail on the restrictive measures in place including on attending organised indoor and outdoor gatherings; sports events; religious services; weddings; funerals; museums and other cultural attractions; playgrounds and parks; care facilities; and for guidelines on school and work, check the Irish government website.
