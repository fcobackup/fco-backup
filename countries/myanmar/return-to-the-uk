Flights
There are limited options for British nationals looking to return to the UK.
We understand that a number of flights are resuming to Kuala Lumpur, Seoul, and Singapore, although these may be subject to change and travellers should contact the relevant airline’s website or office.
These are primarily operated by Myanmar Airways International.
All travellers should check with the embassies of respective transit countries to check transit, entry and Covid-19 testing requirements before making ticket purchases.
Your journey home: re-entering the UK
When you return, you must follow the rules for entering the UK. You:
need to provide your journey and contact details up to 48 hours before you’re due to arrive in the UK
are not allowed to leave the place you’re staying for the first 14 days you’re in the UK except in very limited situations (known as ‘self-isolating’) See also the list of people who are exempt from the border rules.
The National Travel Health Network and Centre (NaTHNaC) also provides advice on how to stay safe as you travel by air.
Help and support
You will need to pay for your return travel to the UK. If departure options are available but you cannot afford the travel costs and have exhausted all other options for getting funds, you may be eligible to apply for an emergency loan from the government. For information on financial support you can access whilst abroad, see our financial assistance guidance.
The Embassy cannot provide further information or advice about departure options over the phone. To get the latest information, sign up for travel advice email alerts.
