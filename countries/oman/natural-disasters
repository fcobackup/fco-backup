Tropical storms
While Oman’s climate is generally dry, heavy rains do fall, usually in the winter. Flash floods can cause injuries and deaths. Cyclones from the Indian Ocean occasionally make landfall in Oman in the summer months, resulting in a disruption of services and utilities. You should follow any instructions given in an official weather warning. Check local weather forecasts and seek advice about travelling conditions particularly if you are considering any off-road travel or adventure tourism, including to Wadi areas (dry riverbeds).
Some roads remain closed or are unpassable due to floods or debris as a result of cyclone Shaheen which hit parts of Oman on 3-4 October. You should follow any directives or guidance provided by the Royal Oman Police .
