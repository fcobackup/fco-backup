Warning
FCDO advises against all travel to parts of India.

This section has safety advice for regions of India. It only covers regions where FCDO has specific advice.
You should also read FCDO’s overall travel advice and safety and security advice for India.
Jammu and Kashmir, and Ladakh
FCDO advises against all travel to the region of Jammu and Kashmir (including Pahalgam, Gulmarg, Sonamarg, the city of Srinagar, and the Jammu-Srinagar national highway), except for:
travel by air to and from the city of Jammu
travel within the city of Jammu
travel within the region of Ladakh
There have been frequent terrorist incidents in Jammu and Kashmir. There is a continuing threat, mainly towards Government of India targets.
There is a heavy security presence in the Kashmir Valley. This, combined with violent protests and operations by security forces, have resulted in a number of deaths and serious casualties.
Curfews and other restrictions can be imposed and lifted frequently and quickly. Stay vigilant, monitor local media, and follow the advice of local authorities and your travel company.
Foreigners are vulnerable in rural districts and outside the main population centres and tourist areas. There is a risk of unpredictable violence, including bombings, grenade attacks, shootings, and kidnapping. The long-standing policy of the UK government is not to make substantive concessions to hostage takers. The level of consular assistance that the British High Commission in India can provide in Jammu and Kashmir is severely limited.
Chhattisgarh, Jharkhand, Odisha, Madhya Pradesh and Maharashtra
Naxalite (radical Maoist communist) insurgents target police officers, paramilitary forces and government officials leading to injuries and deaths (150 in 2023 and around 100 until  May 2024). The following 12 districts have been identified by the Government of India as the worst affected, seek advice from your travel provider and local authorities if you plan to travel to rural areas of:
Chhattisgarh: Bastar, Bijapur, Dantewada, Kanker, Narayanpur, Mohalla-Manpur-Ambaragh chowki, Sukma
Jharkhand: West Singhbhum - there is risk of violent crime in the rural areas
Odisha: Kandhamal and Kalahandi – foreign tourists and researchers must keep to security guidelines during visits to tribal areas in Odisha
Madhya Pradesh - Gadchiroli
Maharashtra – Balaghat
Other northern states
FCDO advises against all travel within the vicinity of the India-Pakistan border, except for at Wagah where travellers can cross the border.
Follow FCDO advice if you are trekking in India.
North-east India
Manipur
FCDO advises against all but essential travel to the state of Manipur. Some insurgent groups are active in North-East India in the state of Manipur.
In April-May 2023 violent ethnic clashes broke out across Manipur, including in the state capital Imphal. Curfews and other restrictions have been imposed in many parts of the state. There may be transport disruptions. Internet services may be limited and restrictions might be imposed at short notice.
You should:
avoid protests or large gatherings
follow the advice of the local authorities and your travel company
monitor local media and follow any curfew restrictions
Other northeastern states
During 2021-22:
violent clashes along the disputed border between Assam and Mizoram and Assam-Meghalaya led to deaths
violent communal and political clashes were reported in Tripura
a number of civilians were killed by security forces in Nagaland near the Myanmar border
There have been skirmishes on the India-Bangladesh border. Travellers are advised to check with local authorities that it is safe to travel before visiting these areas.
Protests and large gatherings are common in India’s north-eastern states. They can happen without warning and occasionally result in disorder. Avoid protests and leave as soon as possible if a crowd develops. Review your security arrangements carefully and follow the advice of local authorities.
Access permits in northeast India
Permits from the Government of India are needed for travel to Sikkim, Arunachal Pradesh, Nagaland and parts of the Andaman and Nicobar Islands. Apply at least 3 months in advance.
In India, apply at the liaison office of the state for which you need a permit or the Foreigners Regional Registration Office (FRRO).
Permit regulations can change at any time. Contact the relevant state liaison office or the Indian Bureau of Immigration for the latest guidance.
For travelling to Mizoram, you need to register online with the Superintendent of Police in Aizawl or state CID on the e-FRRO online portal.
If you are travelling to Mizoram, Meghalaya and Nagaland you are advised to check guidelines issued by local authorities. This is because traffic along the National Highways connecting them with each other and with Assam may be disrupted due to blockades and protests, particularly in border areas.
West India
FCDO advises against all travel within the vicinity of the India-Pakistan border, except for at Wagah where travellers can cross the border.
The India-Pakistan border in Gujarat and Rajasthan is unmarked in some areas. Approaching it away from an official crossing point could be dangerous. Where it is unmarked, you could stray into Pakistan illegally.
Goa
Most British nationals visiting Goa do so without problems. However, because of the high number of tourists there are many opportunistic criminals operating in the region.
There have been some serious incidents involving British nationals in recent years, including sexual assaults and the murder of a young female traveller.
It is an offence to drink alcohol in public places in Goa. If you drink alcohol outside the limits of a place licensed to serve it, you could be fined or imprisoned. You can drink within the limits of a registered beach shack or bar, for example, but you cannot do so on an open beach or road.
