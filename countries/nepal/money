The currency of Nepal is the Nepalese Rupee (NPR). If you are visiting Nepal, you can bring cash and/or a bank card with you and exchange or withdraw US dollars or Nepalese rupees from ATM machines in Nepal.
Scottish and Northern Ireland bank notes are not accepted in Nepal.
There are ATM cash machines in most large towns, cities and hotels in Nepal.
You will have to declare any amount exceeding US$5,000 in bank notes, or US$10,000 in notes and travellersâ€™ cheques combined on your Customs Declaration when you arrive in the country. When you leave the country, you need to present the receipt for the exchange you made during the entry into Nepal. The airport desk will then help convert your Nepali currency back to the foreign currency.
