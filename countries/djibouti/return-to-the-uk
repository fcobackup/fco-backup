Coronavirus guidance is being updated.
Read what you can and cannot do

There are currently no commercial options available to return to the UK from Djibouti as the Government of Djibouti suspended all commercial flights into and out of Djibouti and closed the borders.
We know this is concerning for British people trying to leave Djibouti. The UK government is working closely with airlines, the Djiboutian authorities and other governments to make sure options are available for you to return to the UK as soon as possible.
If you cannot leave Djibouti at this time, see advice on staying in Djibouti during coronavirus.
Informing the British Embassy Addis Ababa
There is no British Embassy in Djibouti. The nearest British Embassy is in Addis Ababa. If you are currently in Djibouti and would like to return to the UK, you should email returnfromEthiopia@fco.gov.uk with:

any other relevant information
This email address is only for those expressing an interest in travelling back to the UK. It is not for consular assistance.
Future travel options

You will need to pay for your return travel to the UK. If departure options are available but you cannot afford the travel costs and have exhausted all other options for getting funds, you may be eligible to apply for an emergency loan from the government. This is a last resort option and you would need to repay the loan when you are back in the UK. For more information, you should contact Corporate Travel Management (CTM). CTM are a commercial partner of the FCO and are authorised to administer such loans on behalf of the FCO.
