This advice reflects the UK government’s understanding of current rules for people travelling on a full ‘British citizen’ passport from the UK, for the most common types of travel.
The authorities in South Africa set and enforce entry rules. If you’re not sure how these requirements apply to you, contact South Africa’s high commission in the UK.
COVID-19 rules
Countries may restrict travel or bring in rules at short notice. Check with your travel company or airline for changes.
If you test positive for COVID-19, you may need to stay where you are until you test negative. You may also need to seek treatment there.
Visit TravelHealthPro (from the UK’s National Travel Health Network and Centre) for general COVID-19 advice for travellers.
Passport validity requirements
To avoid problems at immigration, your passport should:
be valid for at least 30 days beyond your intended date of exit from South Africa
have 2 blank pages for your visa
Some immigration officials still request that a passport should have at least 6 months validity on the date of entry to South Africa. To avoid problems at the airport on arrival, you can ensure your passport is valid for six months.
Dual nationals
If you hold South African citizenship, you must use your South African passport to enter and exit the country. It is illegal for a South African citizen aged 18 or over to enter or leave the country on a foreign passport. For more information about South African passports, see the South Africa Department of Home Affairs.
Visa requirements
You do not need a visa to visit South Africa for tourism or business for up to 90 days.
Check the expiry date of your visa or entry stamp and make sure you do not overstay.
For more information on visas, contact the South African High Commission.
Travelling with children
There are special requirements for travelling to South Africa with children under 18, and for unaccompanied children entering South Africa. The South African Department of Home Affairs has more information.
Vaccination requirements (other than COVID-19)
At least 8 weeks before your trip, check the vaccinations and vaccination certificates you may need on TravelHealthPro.
Customs rules
Check UK customs requirements before buying products to take back to the UK.
Taking money into South Africa
There are limits on how much currency you can bring into South Africa:
cash in South African rand – up to 25,000 rand per person
combinations of cash in other currencies – up to 10,000 US dollars (or equivalent)
If you’re taking more than this, declare it when you enter South Africa.
