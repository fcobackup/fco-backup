Crime
Guatemala has one of the highest violent crime rates in Latin America. Although the majority of serious crime involves local gangs, incidents are usually indiscriminate and can occur in tourist areas. Despite the high levels of crime, most visits to Guatemala are trouble-free.
Car-jacking and armed hold-ups are common on the main road ‘Carretera Salvador’ leading from Guatemala City to the border with El Salvador. The crossroads at Fraijanes, San Jose Pinula and Las Luces are also focal points for express kidnappings.
Such attacks, including sexual assault, can take place anywhere and at any time of the day. Attacks usually involve firearms and motorcycle riders. There is a low arrest and conviction rate. Victims have been killed and injured resisting attack.
No parts of Guatemala City are free from crime, this includes Zone 10 (Zona Viva), which is popular with tourists and foreign residents. Take care in Zone 1 (the historical centre), where the cheaper hotels are located and several bus routes terminate.
For shorter trips within towns and cities the safest option is to take radio or hotel taxis. When arriving at the airport you can buy pre-paid taxi vouchers from the INGUAT Tourist Office in the arrivals terminal.
Take care around ATM machines, petrol station forecourts, the airport, bus stations and shopping centres. Check ATMs for evidence of tampering, but be aware that affected machines may not be easy to spot. It’s safer to change money in hotels, at banks or at foreign exchange offices. Don’t withdraw too much money at once, and avoid withdrawing money at night.
Avoid displaying valuable items like laptops, cameras and mobile phones. Don’t wear a lot of jewellery and only carry minimal amounts of cash. Use a hotel safe if possible.
Avoid travelling around on your own or at night, especially at border crossings or areas where there are few other people around. When travelling to remote areas it may be safer to travel with others or take part in a tour with a reputable company.
Be wary of bogus police officers. There have been reports of visitors becoming victims of theft, extortion or sexual assault by people dressed in police uniforms.
Foreign visitors and residents can be targeted by scam artists. The scams come in many forms, and can lead to great financial loss. Be cautious if you are asked to transfer funds to family or friends in Guatemala. Try and get in contact with your family member or friend to check that they have made this request.
Local travel
If you are travelling near the affected areas you should seek advice from your travel agent or PROATUR. Always cooperate with military and police officers; carry valid ID at all times and be prepared for various checkpoints; allow extra time to reach your destination; monitor local news to stay informed on the current situation.
You can get up-to-date security information through INGUAT, the Guatemalan tourist agency. INGUAT’s tourist assistance service, PROATUR, offers a service to accompany individual tourists or groups travelling in Guatemala. You can contact them on (502) 2290 2810; an English service is available. You may also dial 1500 in Guatemala.
There have been armed attacks on tourists travelling by road to/from major tourist sites like Antigua, Tikal, Petén and Lake Atitlan. Boat services between towns on the shore of Lake Atitlan may be a safer alternative.
PROATUR issues advice on which routes to take when travelling in and around Sololá, Panajachel and Lake Atitlan. Avoid the Godinez by-pass via Patzun between Guatemala City and Panajachel. Use the Pan American Highway to Sololá instead. You should also avoid the road between Cocales (Suchitepequez) and San Lucas Toliman (Atitlan) if possible.
Reports of violence have been reported in the municipalities of Ixchiguan and Tajumulco of the department of San Marcos. Please seek advice from PROATUR if you plan to travel to these areas and whether it is safe to climb the Tajumulco volcano.
Be careful when accepting lifts.
Border areas
Pay particular attention to your security in the border areas with Mexico, Honduras, El Salvador and Belize. There have been reports of disruptions and tensions at the Mexico-Guatemala border. For information on the current requirements if travelling to Mexico from Guatemala, contact the Mexican Embassy in Guatemala.
Take particular care in the Belize/Guatemala border area because of the ongoing dispute between the two countries. Only use the officially recognised border crossings.
Volcanoes
Before climbing volcanoes, you should visit the website of the Guatemalan Meteorological Office (INSIVUMEH) and the CONRED disaster agency for information on access, restrictions and recommendations. You should also check and follow the advice of local authorities beforehand. Some volcanoes are at high altitude with sub-zero temperatures at night. Six tourists died of exposure on Acatenango in January 2017. Warm clothing and waterproofs are essential. Local tour organisers tend to underestimate the risks. There is no mountain rescue service. Please also see Local travel.
Road travel
You can use your UK driving licence to drive in Guatemala for visits under 3 months, but an International Driving Permit is recommended. Driving standards are variable. You should drive carefully and expect the unexpected. Adequate car insurance is essential. If you are involved in an accident, contact the National Police by calling 120 or the fire brigade by dialling 122 or 123 and wait for them to arrive.
PROVIAL, a roadside assistance force, patrols most of the major roads in the country. However, patrols are sporadic. PROVIAL can be contacted by calling 2419-2121.
It is generally safer to travel on main roads. There is a greater risk of attack on quieter routes. Travel in convoy if possible. In more isolated locations, roads are unpaved and you may need a four-wheel drive vehicle.
Motorcyclists throughout the country must wear an orange vest and helmet with the registration number. Those violating the law face a fine of Q1000 (around £100).
Speed limits are strictly enforced and there are heavy penalties for driving under the influence of drugs or alcohol. These can include fines, confiscation of driving licences and imprisonment. It is against the law for drivers to operate mobile telephones whilst driving. For more information you can visit Departamento de Transito PNC and Transit Law (in Spanish).
Public buses and coach services
For security reasons you should avoid travel on public buses (repainted US school buses). There has been an increase in armed attacks by local gangs on bus drivers and conductors, often resulting in serious injury or death. Since July 2010 these attacks have included the use of explosives. There have been reports of violent muggings, including rape and assault against foreigners on these buses.
Private inter-city coach services are generally safer, but have been attacked during daylight hours on well-used, main roads.
Guatemala City Council no longer allows some inter-city buses to enter the city centre. Passengers are dropped at various points on the outskirts.
Political situation
Nationwide elections will take place in Guatemala in 2023 with the first round taking place 25th June and a potential second round on 20th August. There may be heightened tensions in the lead up to these, as well as in the immediate aftermath. Monitor local news channels and visit the Tribunal Supremo Electoral (the government entity in charge of the election process) for the latest information.
The months leading up to elections season are typically characterised by large rallies and other events associated with political campaigning. Such events could cause increased traffic and disrupt movements, complicating travel.
There is a risk of political demonstrations, and although most demonstrations are peaceful, they can turn violent. You should avoid all demonstrations. Guatemalan legislation prohibits political activities by foreigners. If you take part in protests you may be detained and/or asked to leave the country.
Incidents of political violence, strikes and large demonstrations can occur, often with little or no notice.
The use of roadblocks and blocking public facilities, including the international airport, can happen at any time.
