Entry rules in response to coronavirus (COVID-19)
Entry to Cyprus
On 21 December, the Cypriot authorities announced that passengers arriving from the UK will be subject to PCR testing followed by a compulsory 7-day self-isolation in government-assigned hotels, with a further PCR test on day 7. If the result is negative self-isolation continues at home for another 3 days. If no symptoms occur, self-isolation ends on the 10th day. These measures are in force until at least 23:59 Cyprus time on 5 January.
Since then the UK has also been removed from Cyprus’ Category B List which means that temporary visitors from the UK are not permitted to travel to Cyprus. Legal residents of Cyprus and Cypriot ID holders, are permitted to enter Cyprus on presentation of proof of residence or Cypriot nationality. You can find full details of the measures introduced by the Cypriot authorities on the Press & Information Office website and contact information for the Cypriot authorities is listed here.
Permitted travellers to Cyprus (as stated above) must complete a Cyprus Flight Pass before travelling, available on the Cyprus Flight Pass website. You will be responsible for ensuring your PCR test result is uploaded to Cyprus Flight Pass within 24 hours of your departure. If you need to provide your appointment letter you can upload both documents in a single photo. In addition to obtaining the Cyprus Flight Pass, passengers are required to carry with them, in hard copy or electronically, copies of these documents. You will be asked to present your flight pass prior to boarding and on arrival at immigration.
The Cyprus government have a help desk to assist travellers with queries regarding the use of the Cyprus Flight Pass. This service is accessible by telephone +(357) 2484 1234 and through the Cyprus Flight Pass e-platform. You should continue to track developments through the Republic of Cyprus Information Office.
As of 22 December, non-resident air travellers who have been in UK in the last 14 days will not be permitted entry to the north of Cyprus.
