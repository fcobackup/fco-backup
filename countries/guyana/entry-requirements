This page reflects the UK government’s understanding of current rules for people travelling on a full ‘British Citizen’ passport, for the most common types of travel.
The authorities in Guyana set and enforce entry rules. For further information contact the embassy, high commission or consulate of the country or territory you’re travelling to. You should also consider checking with your transport provider or travel company to make sure your passport and other travel documents meet their requirements.
Restrictions in response to coronavirus
The following documents are required before travelling to Guyana:
Proof of full vaccination
Negative SARS-CoV-2 Antigen test not older than 72 hours or a negative SARs-CoV-2 PCR test not older than 72 hours
Children under twelve years old do not require an Antigen or PCR test.
All incoming passengers whose Antigen or PCR SARs-CoV-2 test results exceed 72 hours from the date it was taken, are required to have a repeat Antigen or PCR test upon arrival in Guyana.
Passengers who are required to be re-tested shall bear the financial cost of doing so at the airport testing facility.
Passengers whose tests were taken within 72 hours upon arrival in Guyana, who are asymptomatic, and who are fully vaccinated against SARS-CoV-2, will be permitted to leave the airport after being granted clearance by Immigration and Customs officials.
You should not use the NHS testing service to get a test in order to facilitate your travel to Guyana. You should arrange a private test.
Borders
There is no exit/entry available to Venezuela. Guidance for travellers coming to Guyana from a COVID-19 affected country is available from the Guyana Ministry of Public Health. The Guyana Ministry of Public Health hotline is +592 624 3067 and +592 227 4986 ext 215.
Visas
British nationals do not need visas to visit Guyana. Visitors are generally given 30 days to remain in Guyana, but extensions can usually be obtained from the Ministry of Home Affairs in Georgetown. The Guyanese authorities are very severe on visitors who overstay or abuse the conditions of their stay. Conviction for overstaying will result in one year imprisonment, a fine of up to G$50,000 (Guyana dollars) and deportation - at the deportee’s expense - upon release.
Check entry requirements with the Guyana High Commission in London before you travel.
UK Emergency Travel Documents
UK Emergency Travel Documents are accepted for entry, airside transit and exit from Guyana.
Passport validity
Your passport should be valid for a minimum period of six months from the date of entry into Guyana.
Departure tax
Departure tax is no longer required. All taxes are now included in the ticket.
Yellow fever certificate requirements
