There remains a possibility of violent protest across all of Chile, Santiago in particular, associated with the country’s constitutional reform process. Other cities, including Concepción, Viña del Mar, Valparaíso, and Osorno have also seen sporadic incidents over the past few months. Some protests have seen isolated incidents of the use of small arms by members of the public. If protests take place, you should follow the instructions and advice of the local authorities, remain vigilant, monitor local media for updates and avoid protests and demonstrations. Under Chilean law, foreign nationals visiting or living in Chile could be deported for involvement in protests and demonstrations. See Local laws and customs
Opportunistic street crime can be a problem in towns and cities, and in areas popular with tourists including airports, bus stations and ports. Take care of your personal belongings at all times and be aware of your surroundings. Carry a photocopy of your passport and keep the original document in a safe place. See Crime.
Terrorist attacks in Chile can’t be ruled out. See Terrorism
