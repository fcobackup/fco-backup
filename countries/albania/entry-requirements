This information is for people travelling on a full ‘British citizen’ passport from the UK. It is based on the UK government’s understanding of the current rules for the most common types of travel.
The authorities in Albania set and enforce entry rules. If you’re not sure how these requirements apply to you, contact the Albanian Embassy in the UK.
Passport validity requirements
Your passport must have an ‘expiry date’ at least 3 months after the day you plan to leave Albania.
Check with your travel provider that your passport and other travel documents meet requirements. Renew your passport if you need to.
You will be denied entry if you do not have a valid travel document or try to use a passport that has been reported lost or stolen.
Visa requirements
You can visit Albania without a visa for up to 90 days in a 180-day period, for tourism or business.  
If you want to stay longer than 90 days, you must apply in advance for a long-stay visa or apply for a residence permit from within Albania.  
Vaccine requirements
To enter Albania, you must have a certificate to prove you’ve had a yellow fever vaccination if you’re coming from a country listed as a transmission risk.
For full details about medical entry requirements and recommended vaccinations, see TravelHealthPro’s Albania guide.
Customs rules
There are strict rules about goods you can take into or out of Albania. You must declare anything that may be prohibited or subject to tax or duty.
