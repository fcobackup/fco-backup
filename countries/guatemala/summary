Guatemala has active volcanoes, some prone to heightened activity. See Volcanoes
Some volcanoes are at high altitude with sub-zero temperatures at night. Six tourists died of exposure on Acatenango in January 2017. Warm clothing and waterproofs are essential. Local tour organisers tend to underestimate the risks.
The eruption of Fuego volcano in June 2018 damaged the National Route 14, which connects Escuintla and Antigua, Sacatepéquez. The road has reopened, but for safety reasons it is vulnerable to closure at short notice, during heavy rain or due to volcanic activity. Check with your tour operator and local authorities (PROATUR) before travelling along this route.
Before climbing volcanoes, you should visit the website of the Guatemalan Meteorological Office (INSIVUMEH) and the CONRED disaster agency for information on access, restrictions and recommendations. You should also check and follow the advice of local authorities beforehand.
Avoid travelling on public buses (repainted US school buses). Private inter-city coach services are safer, but not immune from attack. See Local travel
