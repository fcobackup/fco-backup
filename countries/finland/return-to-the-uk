There remain commercial options to return to the UK from Finland. If you live in the UK and are currently visiting Finland, you’re strongly advised to return now by commercial means. Don’t run the risk of getting stranded.
UK special charter flights will only operate for priority countries where commercial flights are not possible. You should not assume that these flights will become available in countries where commercial routes are operating. Please do not contact the contracted travel management company if no flight is advertised here.
Finnair currently operate twice-daily flights to London, but these could change at short notice. British nationals who wish to leave Finland should contact their travel operator to make arrangements to do so as soon as possible.
