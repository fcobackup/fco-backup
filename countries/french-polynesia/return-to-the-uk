Coronavirus guidance is being updated.
Read the Prime Minister’s statement for the latest information.

There are currently limited commercial options available to return to the UK from French overseas territories. With the exception of Réunion, all regular commercial flights between mainland France and French overseas territories are suspended. For more information see the Travel Advice for France.
You will need to pay for your return travel to the UK. If departure options are available but you cannot afford the travel costs and have exhausted all other options for getting funds, you may be eligible to apply for an emergency loan from the government. This is a last resort option and you would need to repay the loan when you are back in the UK. For more information, you should contact Corporate Travel Management (CTM). CTM are a commercial partner of the FCO and are authorised to administer such loans on behalf of the FCO.
Travel certificates
For journeys within the French Overseas Territories you will need to complete a certificate certifying your reason for travel. See Staying during coronavirus
If your journey involves travel from the French Overseas Territories to mainland France, you will need to complete a separate travel certificate. See travel advice for France.
Your journey home: re-entering the UK
When you return, you must follow the rules for entering the UK. You:
need to provide your journey and contact details up to 48 hours before you’re due to arrive in the UK
are not allowed to leave the place you’re staying for the first 14 days you’re in the UK except in very limited situations (known as ‘self-isolating’)
See also the list of people who are exempt from the border rules.
The National Travel Health Network and Centre (NaTHNaC) also provides advice on how to stay safe as you travel by air.
