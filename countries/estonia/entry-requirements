The information on this page covers the most common types of travel and reflects the UK government’s understanding of the rules currently in place. Unless otherwise stated, this information is for travellers using a full ‘British Citizen’ passport.
The authorities in the country or territory you’re travelling to are responsible for setting and enforcing the rules for entry. If you’re unclear about any aspect of the entry requirements, or you need further reassurance, you’ll need to contact the embassy, high commission or consulate of the country or territory you’re travelling to.
You should also consider checking with your transport provider or travel company to make sure your passport and other travel documents meet their requirements.
Restrictions in response to coronavirus
Travel restrictions and borders
Travellers without symptoms arriving from an EU Member State, Schengen Convention state or from the UK are allowed to enter the country. On 6 July, entry was also opened to travellers from 14 non-EU or EEA countries.
Temporary border controls introduced on 17 March, limit entry from other destinations to Estonian nationals, those with an Estonian Residence Permit or foreign citizens with family members in Estonia. There are some exceptions to this, including diplomats, healthcare workers and those transporting goods and raw materials, provided they are asymptomatic.
Quarantine requirements
Those arriving from countries where the COVID-19 infection rate is 16 cases or fewer per 100,000 people for the previous 14 days do not need to self-quarantine on entry.
A list of countries from which arrivals are not required to self-quarantine is available on the official government crisis website and the website of the Estonian Ministry of Foreign Affairs and is updated every Friday. You should follow the local quarantine measures of the country that you are in.
See detailed information about border crossings on the Estonian government official crisis portal.
