Travel is subject to entry restrictions
You must complete and submit an online immigration/customs form 24 hours prior to travel.
Barbados designates the UK as a high-risk country. Travellers from the UK must arrive with a negative PCR test taken by a certified or accredited laboratory within 3 days of arrival.
On arrival, you will be required to quarantine at government approved facilities (a designated holding hotel or approved villa at your own expense, or a government facility free of charge), and undertake a further test 4-5 days after the first accepted negative test. If this second test is negative you will no longer be subject to quarantine. Check the Barbados Travel Protocols carefully for full details of these requirements.
If you test positive for COVID-19 at any point during your stay in Barbados you will be required to self-isolate until the Barbadian authorities are satisfied you have recovered. This may be undertaken at an approved hotel or villa, at your own expense. See the Barbados Travel Protocols for full details.
If you are notified that you have been in close contact with a positive COVID-19 individual you will be required to quarantine. This may be undertaken at an approved hotel or villa, at your own expense. See the Barbados Travel Protocols for full details.
A night curfew is in place from 9pm until 5am. During the curfew, only essential services including gasoline stations are allowed to operate. During the curfew, persons can only leave their home if they are members of an essential service or have an emergency.
Additional restrictive measures include: all social gatherings banned. Religious worship is only permitted for funerals with restrictions on numbers. Numbers of people attending weddings also restricted. Recreational and sporting events are banned. Bus and other vehicular excursions are also banned. Persons may only visit a beach or a park for exercise and groups should be from the same household and not exceed ten persons.
Monday 4 and Tuesday 5 January 2021 are declared Bank Holidays in order for the nation to ‘slow down and pause’. Schools closed until 14 January 2021.
A limited COVID-19 Directive was introduced on 30 December 2020 to enforce the Barbados Travel Protocols and prevent the spread of COVID-19.
Supermarkets and gas stations will remain open outside of the curfew hours. There is no need to panic buy.
Protocols can change at short notice. You should regularly monitor and follow the Barbados Government Information Service website and Barbados Travel Protocols. The Government of Barbados will prosecute persons who breach COVID-19 protocols, including persons who break quarantine protocols.
