Terrorists are likely to try to carry out attacks in the Maldives. See Terrorism
The Maldivian authorities have designated a March 2020 arson attack on a police speedboat in Laamu Gan as a terrorist incident and charged two individuals with terrorism offences in relation to the attack. This follows knife attacks against three foreigners (two resident employees and one tourist) in Hulhumale’ in February, which were claimed by Daesh (also known as ISIL, Islamic State, or ISIS) supporters. The Maldives police made a number of arrests in relation to the knife attacks. You should remain vigilant.
Political protests in the capital Male’ take place occasionally. You should exercise caution and avoid any protests or rallies. Outlying islands, resorts or Male’ International Airport are not usually affected by protests or rallies. See Political situation
