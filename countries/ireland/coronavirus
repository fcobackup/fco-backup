Local advice
On 15 September, the Irish Government published a plan for ‘Living with COVID-19’ in the 6-9 months covering the end of 2020 and early 2021.
The revised strategy includes a ‘Framework for Restrictive Measures’ designed to allow people to understand, anticipate and prepare for the measures the government might introduce to stop escalation of the virus. The Framework consists of 5 Levels, which will be imposed depending on the incidence of COVID-19.
From 1 December, Ireland will move to Level 3. There will be further changes taking place later in December. Please click here for more information on these measures.
Face coverings
The Irish government now recommends that face coverings are worn in crowded workplaces, places of worship and in busy or crowded outdoor spaces where there is significant congregation. For more information on exemptions and a complete list of settings where wearing a face covering is required, please see the Irish Government website.
