The Foreign and Commonwealth Office (FCO) advise against all travel to within 80 km (50 miles) of the Colombian border and 40 km (25 miles) of the Brazilian border. Drug traffickers and illegal armed groups are active along the border area with Colombia and Brazil and there is a risk of kidnapping. See Crime
The FCO advise against all but essential travel to the remaining areas of Venezuela, due to ongoing crime and instability. If you’re in Venezuela, you should keep your departure options under review. If the political situation worsens, the British embassy may be limited in the assistance that it can provide. A prolonged and widespread power cut affected Caracas and much of the rest of Venezuela on 25-27 March. Power has returned to many parts of Caracas, though supply remains fragile. Caracas International Airport has also been affected, and you should check with your airline whether it has changed its schedule. Mobile signals and internet are intermittent in areas without power. The British Embassy in Caracas is currently operating normally. If you are in Venezuela and you need urgent help, call +58 (212) 3195800.
You should remain vigilant and informed. Avoid protests and demonstrations, which can turn violent with little warning. During and ahead of demonstrations, there’s often travel disruption as a result of road closures. Some airlines may cancel flights or reduce flight frequencies as a precaution. You should remain in close contact with your airline or travel agent to see if your flight is affected. The authorities often use tear gas and buckshot/plastic pellets to disperse protests. In case of renewed prolonged protests, you should take precautions by securing several days’ worth of food and water provisions. See Political situation
A number of Venezuela’s land and sea borders are subject to closure. The borders with Brazil and Colombia have been temporarily closed by the Venezuelan de facto authorities. The sea borders with Aruba, Bonaire and Curaçao are also temporarily closed, with no air or sea traffic operating between Venezuela and these islands. If you’re planning travel in the region on any of these routes, contact your travel company for more information.
Consular support is not available in parts of Venezuela. We cannot provide any support in the areas where we advise against all travel and our support is limited in other parts of the country.
You should take particular care to check the local situation ahead of any travel to Canaima National Park and the Gran Sabana area of Bolívar State. Recent protests by locals have led to the closure (sometimes for days) of Canaima airport and main roads (eg parts of Road 10 between El Callao and the Brazilian border); and there are particular shortages of fuel and other essentials in the area.
There’s a high threat from violent crime and kidnapping throughout Venezuela. Take care at all times, including when arriving in the country. During 2017 there were major, unpredictable outbursts of violence in several cities, including Caracas, Barquisimeto, Valencia, Maracay and Ciudad Guayana. Smaller incidents (including looting) have occurred in 2018. Law enforcement presence in these cities is low and incidents of violent crime are on the rise. Criminality and security incident rates rise sharply during December. Increase your vigilance and remain alert at all times See Crime
Power cuts are common and you may find yourself without water or electricity from short to extended periods of time. See Electricity and Water
There are intermittent shortages of fuel for cars throughout Venezuela, including in Caracas. See Road travel
Banknote shortages have led to increased pressure on Venezuela’s card payment processing infrastructure. Debit or credit card transactions may take longer than expected, or require several attempts.
There have been recent reports of bribes being solicited by authorities at Maiquetia (Caracas) International Airport. See Air travel
