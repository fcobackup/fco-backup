Regular entry requirements
Visas
If you choose to travel to Syria against FCDO advice, you will need to get a visa and security clearance before you travel.
In June 2013, the Syrian regime issued a law stating that individuals who enter Syrian territories illegally will be punished by a prison sentence of 5 to 10 years and/or a fine of 5 to 10 million Syrian pounds.
Passport validity
If you choose to travel to Syria against FCDO advice, your passport should be valid for a minimum period of 3 months from the date of entry into Syria – local authorities may ask you to produce a copy of your passport; you should carry a copy with you at all times.
Previous travel to Israel
If you have an Israeli stamp in your passport or Emergency Travel Document it is highly likely that you will be refused entry into Syria, regardless of your nationality.
