Restrictions linked to variant B.1.1.529 (Omicron)
In addition to the information below on entry requirements for Slovenia, the Government of Slovenia has implemented specific measures related to the emergence of variant B.1.1.529.
Full details on these new measures can be found on the Government of Slovenia’s website. You should read these new rules carefully.
Passengers from countries listed by the Slovenian National Institute of Health as having cases of variant B.1.1.529 cannot enter Slovenia unless they are a Slovenian national or resident of Slovenia. The list (in Slovene) is available on the Slovenian National Institute of Public Health website. The list does not include the United Kingdom.
Passengers who are Slovenian nationals or residents of Slovenia and who arrive from a listed country, or have been in a listed country within the last 14 days, must quarantine for 10 days.
People who stayed in a listed country between 13 November and 27 November 2021 must:

In addition, the Government of Slovenia recommends that from 2 December 2021, all passengers travelling to Slovenia from countries that have identified cases of the Omicron variant, should take a self-administered rapid antigen test upon their arrival into Slovenia, regardless of their vaccination status. This includes arrivals from the UK. If the self-administered test is positive, you should follow the advice outlined by the Government of Slovenia.
Quarantine requirements
From 16 August 2021, anyone entering Slovenia via an airport or a ferry terminal will be required to complete a Digital Passenger Locator Form 24 hours before arrival to Slovenia.

They will be permitted to transit through Slovenia, if upon entering they can unequivocally prove that their reason for entering is to transit Slovenia.

There are some exemptions whereby people will not be required to quarantine on entry if they cannot show one of the documents outlined above. Full details can be found at GOV.SI website.
Anyone required to enter into quarantine will need to provide an address (where they will be staying) to the Border authorities. Failure to do so may result in the Border authorities denying you entry into Slovenia. During self-isolation, you are required to stay in your accommodation and not socialise outside of your household. You can take short walks for exercise, but should maintain social distancing and not engage with people from outside your household. The local municipality can make arrangements for the delivery of essential supplies if friends or family cannot support you.
All arriving travellers will be given advice at the border regarding the steps they may need to take.
Internal checkpoints on the Schengen borders with Italy, Austria and Hungary have been removed.
If you are travelling to neighbouring countries you should check the travel advice for the latest information on entering those countries. See travel advice for Austria, Croatia, Hungary and Italy. If you remain in Slovenia, you should be aware that for stays longer than 90 days, you will be required to register as a Temporary Resident.

If you are travelling with a printed PDF proof of vaccination status, it must date from 1 November 2021 to ensure that the certificate can be scanned successfully. Your NHS appointment card from vaccination centres is not designed to be used as proof of vaccination and should not be used to demonstrate your vaccine status.
Regular entry requirements
Visas  
The rules for travelling or working in European countries changed on 1 January 2021:
you can travel to countries in the Schengen area for up to 90 days in any 180-day period without a visa. This applies if you travel as a tourist, to visit family or friends, to attend business meetings, cultural or sports events, or for short-term studies or training.
if you are travelling to Slovenia and other Schengen countries without a visa, make sure your whole visit is within the 90-day limit. Visits to Schengen countries within the previous 180 days before you travel count towards your 90 days.
to stay longer, to work or study, for business travel or for other reasons, you will need to meet the Slovenian government’s entry requirements. Check with the Slovene Embassy what type of visa and/or work permit, you may need
if you stay in Slovenia with a residence permit or long-stay visa, this does not count towards your 90-day visa-free limit
Any time you spent in Slovenia or other Schengen countries before 1 January 2021 does not count towards your 90-day visa-free limit.
At Slovenian border control, you may need to queue in separate lanes from EU, EEA and Swiss citizens.
Check your passport is stamped if you enter or exit the Schengen area through Slovenia as a visitor. Border guards will use passport stamps to check you’re complying with the 90-day visa-free limit for short stays in the Schengen area. If relevant entry or exit stamps are not in your passport, border guards will presume that you have overstayed your visa-free limit.
You can show evidence of when and where you entered or exited the Schengen area, and ask the border guards to add this date and location in your passport. Examples of acceptable evidence include boarding passes and tickets.
You may also need to:
show a return or onward ticket
show you have enough money for your stay
If you are resident in the Slovenia your passport should not be stamped. You should proactively show your proof of residence as well as your valid passport at Slovenian border control. For further information, see our Living in Slovenia guide.
Passport validity
If you are planning to travel to an EU country (except Ireland), or Switzerland, Norway, Iceland, Liechtenstein, Andorra, Monaco, San Marino or Vatican City, you must meet the Schengen area rules.
Your passport must meet 2 requirements. It must be:
less than 10 years old on the day you enter (check the ‘date of issue’)
valid for at least 3 months after the day you plan to leave (check the ‘expiry date’)
We are asking the European Commission to clarify the 10-year rule. Their guidance for Schengen border guards may not be updated until the spring of 2022. Until then, for some Schengen countries your passport may need to be less than 10 years old during your whole visit, and the 3 months at the end of your visit may need to be within 10 years of your passport’s issue date.
Check both the issue date and the expiry date in your passport. If you renewed your passport early, extra months may have been added to its expiry date. This could affect the requirement for your passport to be less than 10 years old.
Contact your travel provider or embassy of the country you are visiting if you think that your passport does not meet both these requirements. Renew your passport if you need to.
UK Emergency Travel Documents
UK Emergency Travel Documents (ETDs) are accepted for entry, airside transit and exit from Slovenia.
