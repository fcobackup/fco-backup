COVID-19 vaccines if you live in Czech Republic
Wherever possible British nationals should aim to be vaccinated in the country where they live. As further information is available about the national vaccination programme, this page will be updated. Sign up to get email notifications.
Residents of the Czech Republic who have public health insurance, including British nationals, are eligible to receive the vaccine through the Czech national vaccination programme in accordance with their rollout plan. If you are currently eligible for a vaccine, i.e. you have residency in the Czech Republic, public health insurance and are 12+ , you can now register for a vaccine. From 11 June, British residents who have private health insurance can register for a vaccine within the Czech health system, for a fee of 1000 CZK. Workers who are posted to the Czech Republic by their UK employer are eligible for a vaccine if they hold an S1 certificate. More information on the S1 certificate and how to apply is available on the Your Europe website. Details of the national vaccination programme and the online booking system are available on the Ministry of Health website.
UK nationals can register for a vaccine by using their health insurance number instead of a birth registration number. The health insurance number is provided by your Czech health insurance company and can be found on the insurance card issued by the company, in the box labelled “číslo pojištěnce”.
The Medicines and Healthcare Products Regulatory Agency (MHRA) is the UK authority responsible for assessing the safety, quality and efficacy of vaccines. It has authorised the Pfizer/BioNTech, Oxford/AstraZeneca and Moderna vaccines for temporary supply and use in the UK. Find out more about MHRA approval for these vaccines.
British nationals living overseas should seek medical advice from their local healthcare provider in the country where they reside. Information about vaccines used in other national programmes, including regulatory status, should be available from the local authorities. This list of Stringent Regulatory Authorities recognised by the World Health Organisation may also be a useful source of additional information. Find out more about COVID-19 vaccines on the World Health Organisation COVID-19 vaccines page.
