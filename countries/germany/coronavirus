Coronavirus travel health
Check the latest information on risk from COVID-19 for Germany on the TravelHealthPro website.
See the TravelHealthPro website for further advice on travel abroad and reducing spread of respiratory viruses during the COVID-19 pandemic.
Entry and borders
See Entry requirements to find out what you will need to do when you arrive in Germany.
Returning to the UK
When you return, you must follow the rules for entering the UK.
You are responsible for organising your own COVID-19 test, in line with UK government testing requirements. You should check that the test result can be provided in the correct format and language. For further information on testing facilities, including those that can provide a result in English you should consult the Patientenservice by telephone (116 117) or contact your local public health authority.
Be prepared for your plans to change
No travel is risk-free during COVID. Countries may further restrict travel or bring in new rules at short notice, for example due to a new COVID-19 variant. Check with your travel company or airline for any transport changes which may delay your journey home.
If you test positive for COVID-19, you may need to stay where you are until you test negative. You may also need to seek treatment there.
Plan ahead and make sure you:
can access money
understand what your insurance will cover
can make arrangements to extend your stay and be away for longer than planned
COVID-19 restrictions
Some restrictions on social contact aimed at reducing the spread of COVID-19 are still in place in Germany, although measures are gradually being relaxed.
Private gatherings are restricted, generally up to ten people. The number of different households that can meet varies across the states, as does differentiation between the rules indoors and outdoors. Please follow local guidance. Generally, children under the age of 14 do not count towards the maximum.
The fully vaccinated and those who have recovered are exempt from the above restrictions on contact, as well as limits on contactless sport (these vary in the states). The fully vaccinated can demonstrate their status by either using yellow vaccination booklets ‘Impfpass’ which contain a doctor’s signature and stamp or two C-19 certification apps (the CovPass-App or the Corona-Warn-App; see below). The recovered must show a positive PCR test no older than six months and no younger than 28 days.
Currently, there are few restrictions on non-essential retail, gastronomy, barbers and hairdressers, museums, art galleries, and other cultural and leisure activities. You may need to show C-19 certification for indoor venues or for outdoor venues if case rates rise significantly.
FFP-2 masks are generally compulsory in shops and public transport, replacing a previous requirement for simple surgical masks or mouth-nose coverings.
These restrictions are implemented by Germany’s 16 states. Where the seven–day incidence rate exceeds 100, restrictions may be tighter or be re-imposed with limited notice.
As rules may vary please check the latest local guidance (in German). There are a variety of sources in English including Germany’s NINA Warn App

COVID-19 vaccines if you live in Germany
Wherever possible British nationals should aim to be vaccinated in the country where they live. As further information is available about the national vaccination programme, this page will be updated. Sign up to get email notifications.
The German health authorities have issued an ordinance setting out how the vaccine will be distributed and administered. All citizens normally resident in Germany that are covered by state or private health insurance will be offered a vaccination according to the rules on prioritisation. British nationals resident in Germany should consult their state authorities for more information on local arrangements.
The Medicines and Healthcare Products Regulatory Agency (MHRA) is the UK authority responsible for assessing the safety, quality and efficacy of vaccines. It has authorised the Pfizer/BioNTech, Oxford/AstraZeneca and Moderna vaccines for temporary supply and use in the UK. Find out more about MHRA approval for these vaccines.
British nationals living overseas should seek medical advice from their local healthcare provider in the country where they reside. Information about vaccines used in other national programmes, including regulatory status, should be available from the local authorities. This list of Stringent Regulatory Authorities recognised by the World Health Organisation may also be a useful source of additional information. Find out more information about the COVID-19 vaccines on the World Health Organization COVID-19 vaccines page.
If you receive your COVID-19 vaccination in Germany, you can get an EU Digital COVID Certificate from in-country authorities. The Certificate proves that you have been vaccinated against COVID-19, received a negative test result, or recovered from COVID-19. It will help facilitate your travel within the EU and, in some countries, you can use it to demonstrate your COVID-19 status to businesses and other organisations.  For further information visit the European Commission’s EU Digital COVID Certificate page. To obtain an EU Digital COVID Certificate in Germany you will need a QR code. A QR code may be issued by the vaccine centre or GP where you received your vaccine. If not, a code can be obtained from participating pharmacies (in the German language only). You can then scan the QR code into the two apps used in Germany, the CovPass-App or the C-19 certification feature in the Corona-Warn-App.
