There is a high threat of terrorist attack globally affecting UK interests and British nationals, including from groups and individuals who view the UK and British nationals as targets. Stay aware of your surroundings at all times.

Terrorism in Hong Kong
Terrorist attacks in Hong Kong cannot be ruled out.
Political situation
Protests and civil unrest
Between 2019 and 2020, large-scale political demonstrations took place in Hong Kong, including popular tourist areas. There were some violent clashes between police and protesters.
Protests are rare but could take place at any time. If you are near a demonstration, follow the advice of local authorities and move away to a safe place.
Crime
Protecting yourself and your belongings
Violent crime is low but pickpocketing and other street crime can happen. Take extra care of passports, credit cards and money in crowded areas and when checking in and out of hotels.
If you plan to hike in Hong Kong’s country parks, stay on the marked trails and do not carry valuables.
Drink spiking and sexual assault
Personal attacks, including sexual assaults, are rare but do happen, including by drink spiking. Do not leave drinks unattended and do not accept drinks from strangers. Women travelling alone, or with other females, could be at greater risk. See advice for women travelling abroad.

Immigration Ordinance
The Immigration (Amendment) Ordinance came into force in 2021. Under this law, people could be stopped from leaving the Hong Kong Special Administrative Region (SAR). However, the Hong Kong SAR government has said these powers will only be used to stop certain asylum seekers from entering Hong Kong.
Public offences
You can get on-the-spot fines for littering, jay walking or spitting.

Transport risks
Road travel
