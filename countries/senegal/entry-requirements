The information on this page covers the most common types of travel and reflects the UK government’s understanding of the rules currently in place. Unless otherwise stated, this information is for travellers using a full ‘British Citizen’ passport.
The authorities in the country or territory you’re travelling to are responsible for setting and enforcing the rules for entry. If you’re unclear about any aspect of the entry requirements, or you need further reassurance, you’ll need to contact the embassy, high commission or consulate of the country or territory you’re travelling to.
You should also consider checking with your transport provider or travel company to make sure your passport and other travel documents meet their requirements.
Entry rules in response to coronavirus (COVID-19)
Entry to Senegal
To enter Senegal, you must provide a negative test dated no more than 7 days earlier, issued in the country where you started your trip and authorised by that country or a recognised health organisation. If this is not possible, you will need to declare that you have no symptoms and accept having a test done on arrival if deemed necessary. This would be at your cost. If you have symptoms of COVID-19 or test positive, you will be taken into Senegalese health care.
Regular entry requirements
Visas
You don’t need a visa to travel to Senegal. If you intend to stay in Senegal for longer than 3 months, you’ll need to register with the local authorities in order to obtain a ‘Carte d’étranger’.
Carte d’étranger
From 29 June you can now obtain a “carte d’étranger” from the local authorities if you’ll be staying in Senegal for longer than 3 months. If your visa has expired because of the coronavirus crisis, you should report to the Police des Étrangers et des Titres de Voyage in order to renew your visa.
Passport validity
Your passport should be valid for at least 3 months from the date of entry into Senegal.
Evidence of return or onward travel
You may be refused entry if you don’t have evidence of return or onward travel.
UK Emergency Travel Documents
UK Emergency Travel Documents are accepted for entry into, transit through and exit from Senegal.
