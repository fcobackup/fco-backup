Terrorists are very likely to try to carry out attacks in Thailand.
UK Counter Terrorism Policing has information and advice on staying safe abroad and what to do in the event of a terrorist attack. Find out more about the global threat from terrorism.
In the past, there have been attacks throughout Thailand, including in Bangkok and other parts of the country:
On 2 August 2019, coinciding with the ASEAN Foreign Ministers’ meeting, a number of small explosions occurred in Bangkok.
On 10 March 2019, a number of small explosions occurred in Satun City and in Patthalung Province in the south of Thailand.
In December 2018, there were a series of small explosions on Samila beach in Songkhla City.
In April and May 2017, there were several explosions in Bangkok.
In August 2016, there were multiple explosions and incidents in tourist areas across Thailand (including Hua Hin, Trang, Krabi, Nakhon Sri Thammarat, Patong and Loma in Phuket, Surat Thani, and Khao Lak in Phang Nga) involving improvised explosive devices (IEDs) and incendiary devices.
A large bomb exploded at the Erawan Shrine in Bangkok in 2015, resulting in numerous casualties, including the death of a British national.
Bomb and grenade attacks have been indiscriminate, including in places visited by foreigners. You should take care, particularly in public places, follow the advice of the local authorities and monitor local media reports.
The FCDO advises against all but essential travel to Thailand’s southernmost provinces of Pattani, Yala and Narathiwat, and to southern Songkhla province. There are regular attacks in these areas. Methods of attack can include arson, bombings and shootings. Targets are often members of the security forces and government officers, but attacks have also taken place against hotels, shops, supermarkets, and transport infrastructure and trains. Over 7,700 people, including civilians, have been killed and several thousand more injured since 2004.
Martial law is in place most areas within these provinces.
There’s a heightened threat of terrorist attack globally against UK interests and British nationals from groups or individuals motivated by the conflict in Iraq and Syria. You should be vigilant at this time.
