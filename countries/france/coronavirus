Coronavirus travel health
Check the latest information on risk from COVID-19 for France on the TravelHealthPro website
See the TravelHealthPro website for further advice on travel abroad and reducing spread of respiratory viruses during the COVID-19 pandemic.
Some travel operators such as airlines may specify types of masks to be worn on board e.g. surgical masks, and may encourage you to take spares for long journeys. Please check with your travel operator before travelling.
PCR and rapid antigen tests are no longer be free for international travellers visiting France. The cost of these tests will be €49 for PCR tests and €29 for rapid antigen tests. If you have a prescription from a French medical practitioner or are identified as having been in contact with someone who has a confirmed COVID-19 diagnosis, these tests remain free so long as you present a valid UK European Health Insurance Card (EHIC) or the new UK Global Health Insurance Card (GHIC). The process for accessing these tests in France remains the same with a list of places available via the French government site.
Entry and borders
See Entry requirements to find out what you will need to do when you arrive in France and for details on France’s current entry requirements and restrictions.
Returning to the UK
Travelling from and returning to the UK
Check what you must do to travel abroad and return to England, Scotland, Wales or Northern Ireland.
If you plan to pass through another country to return to the UK, check the travel advice for the country you’re transiting. If you will pass through a red list country, book your hotel quarantine package before travelling to the UK.
You are responsible for organising your own COVID-19 test, in line with UK government testing requirements. You should contact local authorities for information on testing facilities.
Be prepared for your plans to change
No travel is risk-free during COVID. Countries may further restrict travel or bring in new rules at short notice, for example due to a new COVID-19 variant. Check with your travel company or airline for any transport changes which may delay your journey home.
If you test positive for COVID-19, you may need to stay where you are until you test negative. You may also need to seek treatment there.
Plan ahead and make sure you:
can access money
understand what your insurance will cover
can make arrangements to extend your stay and be away for longer than planned
Travel in France
Face masks are mandatory in all enclosed public spaces. While it is no longer a requirement to wear a mask in all outdoor public spaces in France, it remains mandatory in a number of departments. Please check local guidance for more information. Across France, masks are still compulsory in large gatherings, queues, markets and stadiums.
Wearing masks on public transport is compulsory for all users aged 11 and over, with fines for those who are not compliant. Masks are also compulsory in taxis and private hire vehicles without a plexiglass screen.
Some travel operators such as airlines may specify types of masks to be worn on board e.g. surgical masks, and may encourage you to take spares for long journeys. Please check with your travel operator before travelling.
Certain forms of transport, such as cross country trains, will require passengers to demonstrate their COVID-19 status through the “pass sanitaire”. For further details on what this involves see the ‘public spaces and services’ section below.
There is no curfew in place across the French territory and there are no internal travel restrictions. You should visit the French Interior Ministry website or use the ‘TousAntiCovid’ digital app for further information.
These measures may change at short notice either at national or at local level. You should check local guidance for further information.
Full information about restrictions in France can be found here.
Public spaces and services
People aged 12 and over will need to demonstrate their COVID-19 status through the “pass sanitaire” in order to access services and venues. This includes leisure facilities (bars, restaurants, museums, cinemas), hospitals, retirement homes and modes of transport such as long distance train and bus journeys and planes.
This can be acquired by fulfilling one of the following three criteria:
1) A vaccination certificate, which conforms to the EU Digital Covid Status Certification framework, illustrating that you are fully vaccinated with a vaccine authorised by the European Medical Authority. This means:
7 days after a second dose of Oxford/AstraZeneca, Pfizer/BioNTech, Moderna
28 days after a single dose of Johnson & Johnson
7 days after a single injection for those able to demonstrate they have already been infected (this only applies to those vaccinated in France)
2) A negative PCR or antigen result from a test taken within the last 24 hours.
3) A document (dated more than 11 days ago and less than six months ago) proving you have recently recovered from COVID.
The French Government has announced that from 15 December, those who are 65 and over and who have been fully vaccinated for more than six months and five weeks will need to demonstrate that they have received an approved COVID-19 booster injection in order to access the “pass sanitaire” in France.
From 15 January 2022, those who are aged 18-64 years old and who have been fully vaccinated for more than seven months will need to demonstrate they have received an approved COVID-19 booster injection in order to access the “pass sanitaire” in France. This applies to visiting tourists and those residing in France. You can access the QR code for your booster in the same way as for previous injections (see ’How to obtain a French Pass Sanitaire’ section below).
You can find more information on how to access the “pass sanitaire” from the French government.
France will accept the UK’s proof of COVID-19 recovery and vaccination record. If you are travelling with a printed PDF proof of vaccination status, it must date from 1 November to ensure that the certificate can be scanned successfully, if domestic certification is required. Your NHS appointment card from vaccination centres is not designed to be used as proof of vaccination and should not be used to demonstrate your vaccine status.
Those vaccinated in England, Wales, Scotland and Northern Ireland can also choose to scan and save the NHS QR code into France’s “TousAntiCovid” app.
More information on how to obtain a certificate/QR code is available, if vaccinated in Northern Ireland and if vaccinated in Scotland.
Other Covid status certification that conforms with the EU Digital COVID Certification scheme (e.g. from other EU member states) can also be used for entry into settings where there is a COVID status certification requirement in France.
Facemasks are mandatory in all enclosed public spaces. This applies to those aged 11 and over. It is no longer required to wear a facemask in all outdoor public spaces, with some exceptions, including gatherings, queues, markets, and stadiums. Failure to comply with these restrictions may result in a fine. Please refer to local guidance for more information.

COVID-19 Vaccines if you live in France
Wherever possible British nationals should aim to be vaccinated in the country where they live. We will update this page when the French Government announces new information on the national vaccination programme. You can sign up to get email notifications when this page is updated.
The France national vaccination programme started in December 2020 and is using the AstraZeneca, Janssen (Johnson and Johnson), Pfizer-BioNTech and Moderna vaccines. The French Government have said that residents of France, regardless of their nationality, will have access to the vaccine in France.
The French authorities have issued guidance on how to get a vaccination in France including details of how to book an appointment (only available in French) and which groups are currently being offered the vaccine. Further information on COVID-19 vaccinations in France can be found on the French Government’s coronavirus information website and on their frequently asked questions page.
Find out more, including about vaccines that are authorised in the UK or approved by the World Health Organisation, on the COVID-19 vaccines if you live abroad.
If you’re a British national living in France, you should seek medical advice from your local healthcare provider. Information about COVID-19 vaccines used in the national programme where you live, including regulatory status, should be available from local authorities.
How to obtain a French ‘pass sanitaire’
If you receive your COVID-19 vaccination in France, you can obtain a French ‘pass sanitaire’ (which is a version of the EU Digital Covid Certificate) in order to travel internationally. To do so, you should scan the QR code on your paper vaccine certification via the French app TousAntiCovid. Once scanned, TousAntiCovid will save your certification in the ‘wallets’ section of the app, allowing you to present it at the border when you travel. The Certificate proves that you have been vaccinated against COVID-19, received a negative test result, or recovered from COVID-19. It will help facilitate your travel within the EU and, in some countries, you can use it to demonstrate your COVID-19 status to businesses and other organisations. For further information visit the French government’s website on the “pass sanitaire”.
