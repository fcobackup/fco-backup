You can spread the virus even if you donâ€™t have symptoms.

Cases of coronavirus (COVID-19) have been confirmed in Vietnam. The Vietnamese authorities have introduced a large number of measures to limit the spread of the virus including temporarily banning visits by foreigners and compulsory quarantine and self-isolation for anyone suspected of coming in to contact with the virus. The Vietnamese government has confirmed that it will cover all quarantine costs, but foreign nationals will be personally responsible for paying for any coronavirus hospital treatment costs, and hotel costs from periods of self-isolation.
You are strongly advised to familiarise yourself with these risks before travelling.
Entry and borders
Vietnam has temporarily banned the entry of foreigners to the country.

Quarantine
Widespread quarantine requirements are in place for anyone who may have come in to contact with coronavirus. The Vietnamese government has confirmed that it will cover all quarantine costs, but foreign nationals will be personally responsible for paying for any coronavirus hospital treatment costs, and hotel costs from periods of self-isolation.
Vietnamese quarantine centres are basic, and most do not meet Public Health England standards. With the increased number of people in quarantine, it is likely that the standards of quarantine facilities will reduce further.
If you come in to contact with someone who is positive with coronavirus you must expect to undergo quarantine in a government centre. It lasts a minimum of 14 days and longer if you test positive at any point. In addition, if you have a positive test result, you will be expected to undertake a period of self-isolation after this point and restrictions on travel for a further period of 14 days. These are mandatory requirements from the Vietnamese Ministry of Health. You should not expect the British Government to be able to have these requirements changed or shortened. Should you have serious reservations about undertaking quarantine in Vietnam if required for health or other reasons, you are strongly advised to return to the UK as soon as possible.
There have been instances of British nationals being turned away from, or asked to leave, hotels in Vietnam. You are at risk of being put into quarantine or instructed to self-isolate for 14 days even after you have arrived in Vietnam, if you either develop flu-like symptoms, or it is suspected you have been in contact with some who has tested for coronavirus.
You are strongly advised to familiarise yourself with these risks before travelling.
Local measures
The Vietnamese authorities have announced a the extension of the partial lockdown until 22 April in the following cities/provinces:
Hanoi, Ho Chi Minh City, Danang, Lao Cai, Quang Ninh, Bac Ninh, Ninh Binh, Quang Nam, Binh Thuan, Khanh Hoa, Ha Tinh and Tay Ninh
The lockdown means that:
people are being advised to stay at home, leaving only to buy food and medicine
if you leave your accommodation, always wear a mask, practice social distancing and do not congregate with more than one person, with some exceptions (e.g. hospitals)
public transport and taxi services are being widely suspended; internal flights greatly reduced (see International Flights and Accessing Departure Airports)
essential services will remain open
Provinces not included in the lockdown will continue protective measures including staying at home for all but essential tasks, wearing masks in public, social distancing and no large public gatherings. Further local restrictions may also apply.
Movement between, and within, cities across the country is not encouraged, is very difficult and should be avoided. If you are out in the street, you can expect to be asked if it is an essential journey. Checkpoints are appearing in some Vietnamese cities where people are being asked about their recent travel history, and having temperatures checked. Passengers arriving into domestic terminals in some Vietnamese airports are now required to undergo quick (10 minutes) COVID-19 testing.
On 5 April, the Vietnamese provinces of Hai Phong, Danang and Quang Nam announced restrictions that anyone arriving from either Hanoi or HCMC or any other Vietnamese province with confirmed COVID-19 cases, will be quarantined. Also, the provinces of Thai Binh and Quang Ninh will refuse entry to people unless they are travelling for essential reasons (e.g. food shopping; medical appointment).
Other provinces may put in place similar measures. You should follow the instructions of local authorities. There are penalties for non-compliance.
