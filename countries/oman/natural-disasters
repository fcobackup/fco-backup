Tropical storms
While Oman’s climate is generally dry, heavy rains do fall, usually in the winter. Flash floods can cause injuries and deaths. Cyclones from the Indian Ocean do occasionally make landfall in Oman in the summer months. Check local weather forecasts and seek advice about travelling conditions particularly if you are considering any off-road travel or adventure tourism, including to Wadi areas (dry riverbeds).
Tropical Cyclone Mekunu passed through southern Oman in May 2018. There were reports of flooded wadis and damage to infrastructure in and around the city of Salalah. In October 2018, Tropical Cyclone Luban also caused flooding and power disruption in the same area.
