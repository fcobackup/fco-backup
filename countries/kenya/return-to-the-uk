There are currently no commercial options available to return to the UK from Kenya. Since 11.59pm (local time) on 25 March, all international flights to and from Kenya have been suspended by the Kenyan Government. Cargo flights are excepted, but crew must observe strict guidelines. On 6 April, the suspension of international passenger flights was extended for 30 days.
The last British Airways flights, specially authorised by the Government of Kenya, departed Nairobi on 29 March.
We continue to work with the government of Kenya and international airlines to determine options for helping British nationals who wish to return home. However you should not expect any additional flights immediately.
What to do
If you cannot leave Kenya at this time, you should:
follow the advice of the local authorities, including local measures to help minimise your risk of exposure to coronavirus
find accommodation suitable for your need
keep in regular contact with family and friends at home, so they know you are safe and well
If you need to renew your visa, the Kenyan Immigration Department has announced that visitor pass extensions will be processed online from 13 April 2020. Guidance on how to do so, as well as apply for other forms of documentation such as residence permits, is available here.

You will need to pay for your return travel to the UK. If departure options are available but you cannot afford the travel costs and have exhausted all other options for getting funds, you may be eligible to apply for an emergency loan from the government. This is a last resort option and you would need to repay the loan when you are back in the UK. For more information, you should contact Corporate Travel Management (CTM). CTM are a commercial partner of the FCO and are authorised to administer such loans on behalf of the FCO.
