We understand that from 1 May onwards there will be commercial options to return to the UK from Chile.
If you live in the UK and are currently visiting Chile, you’re strongly advised to return now by commercial means. Don’t risk getting stranded.
Commercial flights
LATAM Airlines and American Airlines have flights listed from Santiago to Miami starting on 1 May and 8 May respectively. Delta Airlines have flights from Santiago to Atlanta, USA listed from 19 May onwards. From these destinations, onward connections to the UK are available.
All flights could be subject to last minute change or cancellation.
You will need to pay for your return travel to the UK. If departure options are available but you cannot afford the travel costs and have exhausted all other options for getting funds, you may be eligible to apply for an emergency loan from the government. This is a last resort option and you would need to repay the loan when you are back in the UK. For more information, you should contact Corporate Travel Management (CTM). CTM are a commercial partner of the FCO and are authorised to administer such loans on behalf of the FCO.
Travelling to the airport
If you are travelling to the airport to catch a flight from one of the areas under quarantine or curfew, presenting your passport and boarding pass will permit you to cross any checkpoints. Use a recognised taxi service or airport transfer whose driver should have the requisite permissions.
Visas
If you plan to fly back to the UK make sure you have not overstayed on your visa – this could affect your departure.
Your journey home
The National Travel Health Network and Centre (NaTHNaC) provides advice on how to stay safe as you travel by air.
When you arrive back in the UK, follow the guidance for when you return to the UK on steps you should take to protect yourself and others.
Future travel options
The UK government is working closely with airlines, the Chilean authorities and other governments to make sure further options are available for you to return to the UK as soon as possible.
