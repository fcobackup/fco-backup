The information on this page covers the most common types of travel and reflects the UK government’s understanding of the rules currently in place. Unless otherwise stated, this information is for travellers using a full ‘British Citizen’ passport.
The authorities in the country or territory you’re travelling to are responsible for setting and enforcing the rules for entry. If you’re unclear about any aspect of the entry requirements, or you need further reassurance, you’ll need to contact the embassy, high commission or consulate of the country or territory you’re travelling to.
You should also consider checking with your transport provider or travel company to make sure your passport and other travel documents meet their requirements.
Entry rules in response to coronavirus (Covid-19)
Entry to Benin
Entry visas are restricted. Entry and exit at border crossings is limited to “extreme necessity” and authorised in liaison with bordering countries.
The land border with Togo is closed.
Testing/screening on arrival
Cotonou Cadjehoun International Airport has reinforced measures in place for visitors arriving in Benin. On May 12, the Government of Benin announced mandatory COVID-19 testing of all airline passengers arriving in Benin. These tests are at passenger expense; fees are 100,000 CFA (approximately £136), payable in cash only, and airlines may require advance payment as a condition of boarding. Passengers will be required to self-isolate for at least 48 hours until all results have been confirmed negative, and may be subject to additional screening after 15 days.
Quarantine requirements
Those who test positive for COVID-19 will be subject to government-mandated isolation measures, which may include quarantine in a government-designated hotel at passenger expense. Quarantine areas will be guarded by defence and security forces to ensure that quarantine regulations are strictly adhered to, and the Government of Benin will retain passengers’ passports until all testing and isolation requirements are met to ensure compliance.
