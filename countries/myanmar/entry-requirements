This page has information on travelling to Myanmar.
This page reflects the UK government’s understanding of current rules for people travelling on a full ‘British Citizen’ passport from the UK, for the most common types of travel.
The authorities in Myanmar set and enforce entry rules. If you’re unsure how Myanmar’s entry requirements apply to you, contact its UK embassy, high commission or consulate.
All travellers
COVID-19 rules and requirements can change at short notice. Confirmation should be sought from the relevant Myanmar Embassy or Consulate well in advance of your departure.
On arrival in Myanmar, foreign travellers are expected to present printed copies of:
proof of full vaccination with a vaccine recognised by the Ministry of Health (list below) at least 14 days before arrival in the country OR the negative result of a PCR test taken no more than 48 hours before arrival
COVID-19 medical insurance from Myanma Insurance.
You will also need to complete a health declaration form. This will be provided to you by either your airline or airport authorities.
Children under 12 years old are exempt from the requirement for proof of full vaccination or a negative PCR test result, providing they are travelling with fully vaccinated parents or guardians.
Diplomats, UN officials and their family members do not need to purchase Myanma Insurance and can instead show proof of health insurance from their countries of origin.

UK Emergency Travel Documents
UK Emergency Travel Documents (ETDs) are not valid for entry into Myanmar. They are accepted for exit from Myanmar but a valid visa has to be added to the ETD once the document is issued.
