Coronavirus travel health
Check the latest information on risk from COVID-19 for Fiji on the TravelHealthPro website
See the TravelHealthPro website for further advice on travel abroad and reducing spread of respiratory viruses during the COVID-19 pandemic.
International travel
You should carefully check requirements relating your country of departure, transit points and airline or other method of transport.
If you are based in Fiji, wish to travel internationally and have been vaccinated under Fijiâ€™s vaccination campaign, you may require a COVID-19 Vaccination Certificate. See the section below on COVID-19 vaccines if you live in Fiji for more information.
Entry and borders
International travellers to Fiji will no longer be required to provide proof of COVID-19 vaccination and travel insurance. Fiji no longer has any COVID-19 border health measures.
Be prepared for your plans to change
No travel is risk-free during COVID-19. Countries may further restrict travel or bring in new rules at short notice, for example due to a new COVID-19 variant. Check with your travel company or airline for any transport changes which may delay your journey home.
If you test positive for COVID-19, you may need to stay where you are until you test negative. You may also need to seek treatment there.
Plan ahead and make sure you:
can access money
understand what your insurance will cover
can make arrangements to extend your stay and be away for longer than planned
