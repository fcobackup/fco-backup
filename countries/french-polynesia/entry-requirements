The information on this page covers the most common types of travel and reflects the UK government’s understanding of the rules currently in place. Unless otherwise stated, this information is for travellers using a full ‘British Citizen’ passport.
The authorities in the country or territory you’re travelling to are responsible for setting and enforcing the rules for entry. If you’re unclear about any aspect of the entry requirements, or you need further reassurance, you’ll need to contact the embassy, high commission or consulate of the country or territory you’re travelling to.
You should also consider checking with your transport provider or travel company to make sure your passport and other travel documents meet their requirements.
Entry rules in response to coronavirus (COVID-19)
Only travellers who can prove that entry is for urgent family/work reasons will be allowed to enter, and they will be expected to fill in a travel certificate (available here) and provide proof. All travellers will need to undertake a test for COVID-19 within 72 hours before departure and will need to show proof of a negative result when embarking.
Travellers must also provide a self -certified document affirming that they have no COVID symptoms and that to their knowledge they have not been in contact with any person confirmed positive within the last 14 days.
Airlines will refuse boarding to anyone who does not produce both proof of a negative result and the self-certified document.
Travellers will also need to register on the Polynesian Electronic Travel Information System (ETIS) and provide the receipt at check-in. Minors travelling with their parents can be included on their ETIS form.
If you’re eligible to enter French Polynesia, you will receive a self-testing kit upon arrival in French Polynesia which you will need to complete four days after your date of arrival.
Further details are available on the website of the local prefecture.
Regular entry requirements
Visas
French Polynesia is an Overseas Collective (collectivité d’outre-mer) of France.
If your passport describes you as a British Citizen you will not need a visa to enter French Polynesia. Other British passport holders should check the current entry requirements on the website of the French Ministry of Foreign Affairs, and if necessary confirm with the nearest French diplomatic mission.
The current visa policy for British Citizens visiting French Polynesia may change. We’re working with the relevant authorities to clarify entry requirements and this page will be updated as soon as further information is available. If you would like more details in the meantime, or want to discuss a specific issue, you should consult the French Embassy in London. If you’re a British Overseas Territories Citizen passport holder the current visa policy for travel to French Polynesia will be unaffected by the UK leaving the EU.
Passport validity
Your passport should be valid for the proposed duration of your stay. No additional period of validity beyond this is required.
Yellow fever certificate requirements
Check whether you need a yellow fever certificate by visiting the National Travel Health Network and Centre’s TravelHealthPro website.
Emergency travel documents
UK emergency travel documents (ETDs) are accepted for entry, airside transit and exit from French Polynesia.
Working
British nationals who wish to work in French Polynesia should make enquiries, prior to departure, at the nearest French Consulate.
