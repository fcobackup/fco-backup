Returning to the UK
Travelling from and returning to the UK
Check what you must do to travel abroad and return to England, Scotland, Wales or Northern Ireland.
If you plan to pass through another country to return to the UK, check the travel advice for the country youâ€™re transiting.
Be prepared for your plans to change
No travel is risk-free during COVID. Countries may further restrict travel or bring in new rules at short notice, for example due to a new COVID-19 variant. Check with your travel company or airline for any transport changes which may delay your journey home.
If you test positive for COVID-19, you may need to stay where you are until you test negative. You may also need to seek treatment there.
Plan ahead and make sure you:
can access money
understand what your insurance will cover
can make arrangements to extend your stay and be away for longer than planned
If you test positive whilst in the BIOT
Testing is only routinely conducted on individuals after arrival in the Territory. If, at any time, you develop a continuous cough, fever, or experience a loss of smell or taste, you must make contact with either the local health centre, self-isolate, limit your contact with others, and notify your supervisor or chain of command if you have one. You may be required to enter quarantine and you may be required to return a negative COVID-19 test prior to exiting quarantine.
Healthcare in British Indian Ocean Territory
There are no medical facilities in the territory. Emergency response and search and rescue facilities are limited, and private medical evacuation can take several days to transport a patient to a suitable medical facility.
