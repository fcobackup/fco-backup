Travel in Uzbekistan
Civilian airports are open but scheduled international passenger flights are not operating at the present time. Some domestic flights are operating.
Public transport in cities has resumed and train travel between regions are now operating, though at a reduced capacity.
From 15 August, use of private vehicles is permitted without restriction.
Care should be taken if using taxis as some operators might not be fully complying with COVID-19 hygiene measures.
Under measures introduced by the Uzbek authorities, anyone subject to quarantine or self-isolation who breaches such controls is liable to a minimum fine of 11 Million UZS (approximately £900) or up to 10 years imprisonment.
Accommodation
Hotels, motels and guest houses have reopened (but are subject to special health and safety rules) following the easing of restrictive measures. Some hotels remain designated as special quarantine facilities.
Public places and services
Persons aged over 65 are recommended to remain in self-isolation and not to visit public spaces. Large group gatherings in any public place are prohibited.
From 15 August, all shopping malls, clothing markets, restaurants, cafes, beauty salons and larger shops, as well as gyms, swimming pools, private kindergartens and education centres have reopened.
You must wear a face mask while outside – you may be fined (up to approximately £100) if you do not comply with this regulation.
A ban on all cultural entertainments and other public events remains in place. Weddings and other family events are permitted with no more than 30 people present (who should be relatives). Gyms, swimming pools, restaurants, markets and large stores are closed, as are private kindergartens and any other education establishment irrespective of their legal status.
Healthcare in Uzbekistan

If you think you have COVID-19 symptoms, you should call the 1003 hotline number of the Ministry of Health of Uzbekistan. Please note, however, operators at the hotline will speak only Russian or Uzbek.
Individuals who are showing COVID-19 symptoms will undergo testing at government facilities.
From 5 July, those testing positive for COVID-19 will be placed into Red, Yellow and Green categories. Those with a light form of coronavirus infection (asymptomatic) will be categorised as Green. Those with medium symptoms (e.g. high temperature) will be categorised as Yellow, and those with serious symptoms as Red.
Those categorised as Green or Yellow will be allowed to have treatment at home if this is approved by a doctor and will be required to comply with existing sanitary-hygiene rules. Those categorised as Green or Yellow and where treatment at home is not possible will be hospitalised in a dedicated government facility, but released after 10 days if no further symptoms are observed.
Those who have been in contact with a person who tests positive for COVID-19 will no longer be automatically quarantined but required to self-isolate for 14-days and subject to medical monitoring.
