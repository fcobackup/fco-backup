Local attitudes towards the LGBT community are mostly conservative throughout the Caribbean. In the Bahamas, same-sex sexual relations have been legal since 1991, with an age of consent of 18. However, LGBT travellers should be mindful of local attitudes and be aware that public displays of affection may attract unwanted and negative attention. Public displays of affection (such as hand-holding or kissing) between opposite or same-sex couples are uncommon. See our information and advice page for the LGBT community before you travel.
