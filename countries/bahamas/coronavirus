Be prepared for your plans to change
No travel is risk-free during COVID. Countries may further restrict travel or bring in new rules at short notice, for example due to a new COVID-19 variant. Check with your travel company or airline for any transport changes which may delay your journey home.
If you test positive for COVID-19 in The Bahamas before returning to the UK, you may be expected to self-isolate in a hotel, private residence or medical facility. You should also expect to be contacted by local health authorities to confirm that you are complying with self-isolation rules. Should you need to leave your place of self-isolation for essential purposes then arrangements can be made with the local authorities. It is important to note that people aged 17 and under cannot apply directly for a Travel Health visa. A parent or guardian must create a profile and add them, creating a separate trip within the adult profile if the child is to travel alone.
Plan ahead and make sure you:
can access money
understand what your insurance will cover
can make arrangements to extend your stay and be away for longer than planned
