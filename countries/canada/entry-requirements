The information on this page covers the most common types of travel and reflects the UK government’s understanding of the rules currently in place. Unless otherwise stated, this information is for travellers using a full ‘British Citizen’ passport.
The authorities in the country or territory you’re travelling to are responsible for setting and enforcing the rules for entry. If you’re unclear about any aspect of the entry requirements, or you need further reassurance, you’ll need to contact the embassy, high commission or consulate of the country or territory you’re travelling to.
You should also consider checking with your transport provider or travel company to make sure your passport and other travel documents meet their requirements.
Entry rules in response to coronavirus (COVID-19)
Entry to Canada
The Canadian authorities are barring entry to Canada, including at its border with the US, to most foreign nationals, including British nationals. This exclusion does not apply to temporary foreign workers, most international students, Canadian citizens and permanent residents or their immediate and extended families: and to fully vaccinated US citizens and permanent residents from 9 August 2021, and from elsewhere from 7 September 2021. Further details are available on Transport Canada’s website.
Individuals can use the online tool, “Find out if you can travel to Canada” on the Government of Canada website to find out if they may be eligible to enter Canada. Further details are available on the Immigration, Refugees and Citizenship Canada website or call the Canada Border Service Agency helpline: 1 800 461 9999.
The Canadian government requires all travellers aged five and above arriving in Canada by land or air to provide proof of a negative COVID-19 molecular test taken within 72 hours of their scheduled flight or arrival at the land border crossing. Passengers without a negative test will be denied boarding or entry. If you are travelling from a country where molecular testing is unavailable you will be required to report to a designated Public Health Agency of Canada quarantine facility for the duration of your mandatory 14-day quarantine. Delays in obtaining test results does not apply.
Alternatively, travellers must provide proof of a positive COVID-19 test taken between 14 and 90 days before their scheduled flight or arrival at the land border crossing.
Further details are available on Public Health Canada’s website.
At point of departure, air operators must complete a basic health assessment of every passenger. No passengers (regardless of citizenship) who are showing symptoms of coronavirus will be allowed to board. Non-medical face masks or face coverings are required for all flights to and from Canadian airports, and within airport terminals. Anyone who cannot wear a face mask for medical reasons must be in possession of a medical certificate.
All travellers whose final destination is Canada are required to submit their information digitally through Canada’s ArriveCAN app within 72 hours before your arrival in Canada. This includes travel and contact information, quarantine plan, COVID-19 symptom self-assessment and vaccine information. You must be ready to show your ArriveCAN receipt when seeking entry into Canada, as well as evidence that you have submitted your details digitally. Further information is available on the Public Health Agency of Canada’s website.
If you have any questions, contact the nearest Canadian High Commission, Embassy or Consulate.
Only Toronto Pearson (YYZ), Montreal Pierre Elliott Trudeau (YUL), Calgary International Airport (YYC) and Vancouver International Airport (YVR) are operating international flights. International flights will be permitted to land at four additional airports (Halifax, Quebec City, Ottawa and Winnipeg) in the coming weeks. Further details are available on Transport Canada’s website.

Transiting Canada
If you’re planning to transit via Canada to reach the UK, you should be aware that exceptions apply. A person ‘in transit’ means that they:
arrive and depart from the same airport within a reasonable time frame (the Canadian authorities advise this means as short as possible, and certainly less than 24 hours)
remain on the air side or sterile area of the airport
do not have to go through Customs and formally enter Canada and pick up their bags so they can take their next flight
do not move between terminals at an airport, unless they can do so without going through Customs and formally entering Canada
do not take a domestic flight to get to another airport so they can catch their next international flight
Canadian authorities require passengers to wear a face covering on flights to and from Canada, and within airport terminals in Canada. Passengers arriving at or departing from Canadian airports must demonstrate that they have the necessary face mask or face covering during the boarding process, otherwise they will be stopped from continuing their journey. Anyone who cannot wear a face mask for medical reasons must be in possession of a medical certificate. Further information is available on Transport Canada’s website.
The Canadian authorities require visitors transiting through Canada to obtain an Electronic Travel Authorisation (eTA) see Entry requirements, unless you are otherwise exempted (for example, if you have a valid Canadian visa or a permanent resident card).
If you have any further questions, you should contact your airline, Transport Canada, or your nearest Canadian high commission, embassy or consulate.
Testing / screening on arrival
All air passengers must wear a non-medical mask or face covering during travel, within airport terminals and to their place of self-isolation.
In addition to the mandatory pre-departure tests unless exempt, all travellers arriving in Canada by land and air are required to take an additional test on arrival and a further test on Day 8 of their 14 day self-isolation period.
You should comply with any additional screening measures put in place by the authorities.
For questions about travel during the coronavirus pandemic, check the Health Canada website.
Quarantine requirements
Unless exempt, everyone arriving in Canada is legally required to self-isolate for 14 days. Heavy penalties apply if you fail to comply. You must also produce a credible self-isolation plan. An inadequate plan would include scenarios such as planning to stay with elderly family members or failing to have a set destination. Travellers who are unable to produce a credible plan will be placed in a quarantine location, such as a hotel, for a 2-week period.
Unless exempt, air travellers are required to reserve, prior to departure to Canada, a 3 night stay in a government-authorised hotel at their own expense. From 12.01 EDT on 9 August, this will cease to be a requirement. Further details are available on Public Health Canada’s website.
From 11:59pm EDT on 5 July, fully vaccinated travellers who are eligible to enter Canada will no longer be required to quarantine on arrival or complete a Day 8 test. They must have received the full series of a vaccine — or a combination of vaccines — accepted by the Government of Canada at least 14 days prior to entering Canada;
Fully vaccinated travellers will still be required produce a valid pre-departure test, take a test on arrival, and produce a quarantine plan, as well as be prepared to quarantine in case it is determined at the border that they do not meet the necessary requirements. They will also be required upload relevant information and documentation to the ArriveCAN app prior to arrival in Canada. Further details are available on Public Health Canada’s website.
The Government of Canada has announced that there will be new entry rules for fully vaccinated US citizens and permanent residents from 9 August 2021, and for fully vaccinated travellers from elsewhere from 7 September 2021. Further details are available on Transport Canada’s website.
Regular entry requirements
Visas
British Citizens don’t usually need a visa to visit Canada for short periods, but you’ll need to get an Electronic Travel Authorisation before you travel (see below).
If you have a different type of British nationality or intend to travel for a longer period, such as for work or study, check entry requirements with the Canadian High Commission. Effective from 31 July 2018, you may need to give your fingerprints and photos (biometrics) at a visa application centre when applying for a study or work permit, or permanent residence. When you arrive in Canada, you will need to be able to show that you have enough funds available to support yourself during your stay, even if you’re staying with family and friends.
If you have any doubts about whether you’re eligible to enter Canada (eg if you have a criminal record or have been arrested even if it did not result in a conviction), or about visa matters generally, contact the Canadian High Commission before you travel.
Some unauthorised websites charge for submitting visa applications. These websites are not endorsed by or associated with the Canadian government. Be wary of such sites and businesses, particularly those that seek additional fees.
Passport validity
Your passport should be valid for the proposed duration of your stay. No additional period of validity beyond this is required.
Electronic Travel Authorisation (eTA)
Visitors travelling to Canada by air are now expected to get an electronic travel authorisation (eTA) to enter Canada.
If you’re visiting Canada you’ll need an eTA to board your flight unless you’re otherwise exempted (for example, if you have a valid Canadian visa or a permanent resident card). If you have British-Canadian dual nationality you won’t be able to apply for an eTA and you’ll need to present a valid Canadian passport to board your flight to Canada.
If you’re travelling by land or sea, you won’t need an eTA when you enter Canada. However, you must travel with acceptable travel documents and identification.
For more information about the eTA system, and to apply online, visit the official Canadian government website.
UK Emergency Travel Documents
UK Emergency Travel Documents (ETDs) are accepted for entry, airside transit and exit from Canada. You can apply for an Electronic Travel Authorisation using an ETD.
Travelling with children
If you’re travelling with children and only one parent is present, you should carry a letter of consent from the non-travelling parent. Immigration officers have the right to question children using simple and appropriate language to establish whether there are any concerns about child abduction. A letter of consent may help to dispel potential concerns.
For further information check with the Canadian High Commission or the Canada Border Services Agency.
Travelling to the USA
The Canada-US border is closed to non-essential travel.
