Entry rules in response to coronavirus (COVID-19)
Entry to Papua New Guinea
Commercial options for travel to and from Papua New Guinea remain very limited. If transiting through another country, it is important that you check the requirements for transit through that country. You should also check the Air Niugini website for the latest advice.
International passengers, over the age of 18, must be fully vaccinated to enter Papua New Guinea. Papua New Guinea nationals and permanent residents are exempt from this requirement. ‘Fully vaccinated’ is defined as having had the recommended number of doses of recognised COVID-19 vaccines (see international travel measures for full details).
The Air Niugini website gives details of vaccination certificates valid for travel. Your NHS appointment card from vaccination centres is not designed to be used as proof of vaccination.
There is no pre-flight PCR test requirement for incoming passengers. COVID-19 testing on arrival is no longer required.
Face masks must be worn on all domestic flights. All domestic travellers must submit a health declaration form to the Provincial Health Authority on arrival. Domestic airline travellers may need to be tested for COVID-19. Testing requirements for domestic travel are at the discretion of each province, and travellers should check the latest requirements with their travel agent.
You should check the Air Niugini website for details of the latest domestic travel measures. Separate arrangements apply for travel to the Autonomous Region of Bougainville.
