At least 8 weeks before your trip, check the latest country-specific health advice from the National Travel Health Network and Centre (NaTHNaC) on the TravelHealthPro website. Each country-specific page has information on vaccine recommendations, any current health risks or outbreaks, and factsheets with information on staying healthy abroad. Guidance is also available from NHS (Scotland) on the FitForTravel website.
General information on travel vaccinations and a travel health checklist is available on the NHS website. You may then wish to contact your health adviser or pharmacy for advice on other preventive measures and managing any pre-existing medical conditions while you’re abroad.
The legal status and regulation of some medicines prescribed or purchased in the UK can be different in other countries. If you’re travelling with prescription or over-the-counter medicine, read this guidance from NaTHNaC on best practice when travelling with medicines. For further information on the legal status of a specific medicine, you’ll need to contact the embassy, high commission or consulate of the country or territory you’re travelling to.
While travel can be enjoyable, it can sometimes be challenging. There are clear links between mental and physical health, so looking after yourself during travel and when abroad is important. Information on travelling with mental health conditions is available in our guidance page. Further information is also available from the National Travel Health Network and Centre (NaTHNaC).
Coronavirus
There is an ongoing outbreak of coronavirus (COVID-19) in China and elsewhere, including Jordan. The Jordanian authorities have introduced a number of precautionary measures, including restrictions to travel to and from Israel and the OPTs. Foreign passport holders are not allowed to enter Jordan via the Allenby/King Hussein Bridge; Jordan River/Sheikh Hussein; or Yitshak Rabin/Wadi Arraba crossings unless they hold UNLP or diplomatic passports. Foreign nationals will only be allowed to enter Israel and the OPTs via these crossings on a case-by-case basis.
Jordan has implemented enhanced screening procedures and entry restrictions. Non-Jordanians who have travelled to mainland China, Iran, South Korea or Italy within 14 days before their arrival in Jordan will be denied entry. Travellers from other countries arriving in Jordan may be quarantined upon entry if they are seen to be displaying flu-like symptoms.
If you are in Jordan and displaying symptoms of coronavirus you should seek medical advice while self-isolating. You should contact your insurance/medical assistance company. Alternatively you can call the Jordanian Ministry of Health Hotline on 111 where guidance is available in English.
Further information on coronavirus, including advice on preparing for foreign travel and helping reduce the spread of the virus, is available from Public Health England and on the TravelHealthPro website.
Other health risks
Cases of Middle East respiratory syndrome coronavirus in patients from Jordan have been reported to the World Health Organization. You can find more information on this virus on the website of the National Travel Health Network and Centre.
Temperatures in summer months can be very high. Drink plenty of water and use high factor sun-block.
Local medical care
Medical facilities outside Amman are basic. In an emergency you should seek treatment in Amman. Emergency treatment is also available in Aqaba. Make sure you have adequate travel health insurance and accessible funds to cover the cost of any medical treatment abroad and repatriation. A list of medical practitioners is available here.
If you need emergency medical assistance during your trip, dial 911 and ask for an ambulance. You should contact your insurance/medical assistance company promptly if you are referred to a medical facility for treatment.
