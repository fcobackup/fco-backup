There are currently no commercial options available to return to the UK from Bermuda as all borders are currently closed. The LF Wade international airport is closed for passenger flights until further notice. Cargo flights are not affected.
If you cannot leave Bermuda at this time, you should:
follow the advice of local authorities, including local measures to help minimise your risk of exposure to coronavirus
keep in regular contact with family and friends at home, so they know you are safe and well
although Shelter in Place has ended, it is strongly encouraged that persons do not visit other households.

You will need to pay for your return travel to the UK. If departure options are available but you cannot afford the travel costs and have exhausted all other options for getting funds, you may be eligible to apply for an emergency loan from the government. This is a last resort option and you would need to repay the loan when you are back in the UK. For more information, you should contact Corporate Travel Management (CTM). CTM are a commercial partner of the FCO and are authorised to administer such loans on behalf of the FCO.
