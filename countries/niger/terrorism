Terrorists are very likely to try to carry out attacks in Niger. Attacks could be indiscriminate, including in places visited by foreigners. There’s a threat of retaliatory attacks in Niger due to its participation in the French-led intervention in Mali and due to Niger’s involvement in the regional fight to counter Boko Haram. You should monitor developments, be alert to announcements and remain vigilant at all times.
As seen in Mali, Cote d’Ivoire and Burkina Faso, terrorist groups continue to mount attacks on hotels, cafés and restaurants visited by foreigners. Be especially vigilant in these places.

There’s a high threat of kidnapping from terrorist groups operating in the region including Jamaat Nusrat al-Islam wal Muslimeen (JNIM), Islamic State West Africa (ISWA) and Boko Haram. These groups operate in the border areas of northern Mali, Niger, Burkina Faso, Algeria and Libya. They have proven capability of travelling long distances to carry out attacks.
Westerners have been kidnapped in Niger and the wider Sahel region, including in Niamey and the north and west of Niger. On October 14 2016, an aid worker was kidnapped in Abalak, a province of the region of Tahoua 350 km northeast of Niamey. There are reports that terrorist groups may be targeting international humanitarian workers in Diffa province for kidnapping.
Criminal gangs have previously carried out kidnapping for terrorist groups in return for financial rewards. There are currently several westerners being held in the Sahel and surrounding region. Victims in the region have included tourists, NGO workers and diplomats of a variety of nationalities, primarily European. These attacks have sometimes resulted in the murder of the hostage.
Kidnapping for ransom is Jamaat Nusrat al-Islam wal Muslimeen (JNIM) and its associated groups primary source of finance. Further kidnap attacks are likely. Terrorist groups view those engaged in humanitarian aid work or journalism as legitimate targets. There are reports that terrorist groups may be targeting international humanitarian workers in Diffa province for kidnapping. If you’re kidnapped, the reason for your presence in country is unlikely to serve as protection.
The long-standing policy of the British government is not to make substantive concessions to hostage takers. The British government considers that paying ransoms and releasing prisoners increases the risk of further hostage taking.
