Travel in Senegal
A mandatory nightly curfew between 9pm and 5am (local time, GMT) came into effect for the regions of Dakar and Thiès on 6 January. During curfew hours, everyone must stay at home or indoors, except for essential government service workers. The motorways between the international airport and Thiès and between the airport and Mbour are closed between 8pm and 6am.
The Government of Senegal has advised that the airport will remain open and existing flight schedules will not change. People can still travel to the airport during curfew if they are passengers arriving and departing or the driver (no other people accompanying passengers are allowed). All of these people must carry a copy of their passport and plane ticket, which will allow for movement to the airport or to their accommodation. If you are arriving into Senegal at the airport in curfew hours, you should contact the person or taxi company you have arranged to collect you in advance to make sure they can still access the airport and have all the necessary paperwork.
There is currently no restriction on travel between regions, and authorisation is not needed to travel between regions. Internal flights have also restarted. Masks must be worn at all times in public areas and when travelling, including in a private car if there are two or more people in the car.
Accommodation
Hotels are open.
Public places and services
On 8 January, the Interior Minister announced that for the Dakar and Thiès regions all public gatherings are prohibited including at hotels, bars, beaches, sports grounds, theatres and public spaces. Consequently, many bars and other public venues are closing. Religious sites are open. Restrictions are changing rapidly; you should follow instructions given by the authorities.
Masks must be worn in all public areas throughout Senegal, including in supermarkets, on public transport (which is still operating with reduced capacity), in taxis, and when on public streets.
