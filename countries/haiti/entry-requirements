Warning
FCDO advises against all travel to Haiti.

This information is for people travelling on a full ‘British citizen’ passport from the UK who choose to travel against FCDO advice. It is based on the UK government’s understanding of Haiti’s current rules for the most common types of travel.
The authorities in Haiti set and enforce entry rules. If you’re not sure how these requirements apply to you, contact the Haitian Embassy in the UK. 
Passport validity requirements
Your passport must have an ‘expiry date’ at least 6 months after the date you arrive.
Check with your travel provider that your passport and other travel documents meet requirements. Renew your passport if you need to.
You will be denied entry if you do not have a valid travel document or try to use a passport that has been reported lost or stolen.
Visa requirements
You do not need a visa to visit Haiti for up to 90 days. 
To stay longer (or to work or study, for business travel or for other reasons), you must meet the Haitian government’s entry requirements.
Applying for a visa
For more information about how to apply for a visa, call the Haitian Embassy in London: 0203 771 1427.
Entry tax
Tourists must pay an entry fee of 10 US dollars in cash on arrival.
Departure tax
Tourists must pay a departure tax of 55 US dollars. For most international flights, this is included in the price of the ticket. Check this with your airline or tour operator before you travel. If the departure tax is not included in your air fare, make sure you have enough US dollars or local currency on departure. 
Vaccine requirements
To enter Haiti, you must have a certificate to prove you’ve had a yellow fever vaccination if you’re coming from a country listed as a transmission risk.
For full details about medical entry requirements and recommended vaccinations, see TravelHealthPro’s Haiti guide.
Customs rules
There are strict rules about goods you can take into or out of Haiti. You must declare anything that may be prohibited or subject to tax or duty.
