This page reflects the UK government’s understanding of current rules for people travelling on a full ‘British Citizen’ passport from the UK, for the most common types of travel.
For further information contact the embassy, high commission or consulate of the country or territory you’re travelling to. You should also consider checking with your transport provider or travel company to make sure your passport and other travel documents meet their requirements.
All travellers
Visas
You will need a valid visa and a valid travel document to enter Ethiopia.
Visitors must obtain a visa from the official Ethiopian e-visa platform [https://www.evisa.gov.et] or from their nearest Ethiopian Embassy before travelling. The visa on arrival service remains suspended. You will need to show a valid visa before boarding your flight and upon entry.
The penalty for overstaying your visa is USD10 per person per day. If you overstay you will have to pay your fine in full before you are able to leave Ethiopia. Visitors entering Ethiopia without a valid travel document and Ethiopian visa may be detained and/or fined.
Holders of valid Ethiopian Diplomatic ID Cards, Ethiopian Temporary Residents Permits or Ethiopian Origin ID (Yellow Cards) can enter without a visa.
Passport validity
Your passport should be valid for a minimum period of 6 months from the date of entry into Ethiopia. Make sure you have two blank pages in your passport on arrival.
Yellow fever certificate requirements
Check whether you need a yellow fever certificate by visiting the National Travel Health Network and Centre’s TravelHealthPro website.
Immigration status
If you’re visiting Ethiopia on a tourist visa, you will be unable to take employment, including voluntary employment. If visitors are caught in breach of their immigration status they may face severe fines or possible imprisonment.
Once you’re in Ethiopia you will not be able to change your immigration status. If you have any concerns about your immigration status in Ethiopia, you should contact the local immigration authorities.
UK Emergency Travel Documents
UK Emergency Travel Documents (ETDs) are accepted for entry, airside transit and exit from Ethiopia.
If you’re fully vaccinated
Passengers age 12 and over who have been fully vaccinated against COVID-19 more than two weeks before the date of entry are required to show evidence of this. Accepted vaccinations are a single dose of Johnson and Johnson, or two doses for Astra-Zeneca, Sinopharm, Sinovac, Moderna and Pfizer.
Travellers under the age of 12 do not need to show proof of vaccination.
If you’re not fully vaccinated
If you’re not fully vaccinated, you’ll need to show proof of a negative COVID-19 RT PCR test result issued within the 72 hours (3 days) before departure, or a rapid lateral flow test up to 24 hours before arriving in Ethiopia. A lateral flow test must be certified by a testing centre and not self administered. Pre-departure tests are not required for passengers under the age of 12 or diplomats. You may need to demonstrate you have such a test certificate before boarding your flight.
You should not use the NHS testing service to get a test in order to facilitate your travel to another country. You should arrange to take a private test. See information on getting a test before entry.
If you’ve had COVID-19 in the past 90 days
If you’re not fully vaccinated but have tested positive for COVID-19 you can enter Ethiopia if you have certificate of recovery from within the last 90 days or evidence of vaccination as above.
Children and young people
Children under 12 are not required to be vaccinated or show evidence of recovery.
If you’re transiting through Ethiopia
Transiting is when you pass through one country on the way to your final destination.
If you are planning to travel via Ethiopia to reach the UK, you should be aware that restrictions apply. Transit passengers are those with an onward ticket to another destination, who do not formally enter Ethiopia. Transiting passengers are exempt from the current quarantine restrictions for COVID-19. The maximum transit time is 72 hours.
While you don’t need a negative COVID-19 test to transit Addis Ababa, you should ensure that you have the correct tests for your onward journey. Check FCDO Travel Advice for the countries you are travelling to. British nationals have previously been tested in transit and had to complete mandatory quarantine in Ethiopia after testing positive for COVID-19.
Passengers transiting for 24 hours or less can remain in the departure lounge of the airport. For transits over 24 hours, you will be taken to a designated transit hotel for the duration of your stay. On arrival in Addis Ababa Bole International Airport, you should report to the transit desk to confirm your hotel details. After health screening and immigration you will then need to present your hotel details and passport to the desk marked “transit shuttle bus” from where you will be taken to the hotel. You will not be able to leave the hotel during your transit. To the extent airline schedules allow, you should therefore minimise the duration of your transit in Addis Ababa.
Passengers transiting Addis Ababa Bole International Airport are subject to COVID-19 screening measures during transit.
If you have any further questions, you should contact your airline.
Check your passport and travel documents before you travel
Your passport should be valid for a minimum period of 6 months from the date of entry into Ethiopia. Make sure you have two blank pages in your passport on arrival. Check with your travel provider to make sure your passport and other travel documents meet their requirements.
