There is no healthcare agreement between the United Kingdom and South Africa.
Before you travel check that:
you have appropriate travel insurance for local treatment or unexpected medical evacuation
your destination can provide the healthcare you may need
This is particularly important if you have a health condition or are pregnant.
Emergency medical number
Dial 112 (from a mobile) or 10177 and ask for an ambulance.
Contact your insurance or medical assistance company promptly if you’re referred to a medical facility for treatment.
Vaccinations and health risks
At least 8 weeks before your trip check:
the latest information on health risks and find out what vaccinations you need for South Africa on TravelHealthPro
where to get vaccines and whether you have to pay on the NHS travel vaccinations page
Altitude sickness is a risk in parts of South Africa, including in Johannesburg. More information about altitude sickness is available from TravelHealthPro (from the UK’s National Travel Health Network and Centre).
HIV is a risk in South Africa. Take normal precautions to avoid exposure to HIV/AIDS. There is more information on sexually transmitted infection risk and prevention for travellers on TravelHealthPro.
Cholera outbreak
Sporadic outbreaks of cholera can take place. See information on cholera from TravelHealthPro.
Medication
The legal status and regulation of some medicines prescribed or bought in the UK can be different in other countries.
If you take regular medication, make sure you can get repeat prescriptions if needed. Most prescription medicines in the UK need a prescription (‘script’) from a local doctor in South Africa. The doctor may ask you to get an electronic prescription from your medical practitioner in the UK. Pharmacies are readily accessible across the country. Some have medical practitioners on site who can write prescriptions.
TravelHealthPro explains best practice when travelling with medicines.
The NHS has information on whether you can take your medicine abroad.
Healthcare facilities in South Africa
Public medical care varies across South Africa. Standards of treatment and hygiene may not be the same as in the UK.
South Africa has a very high standard of private medical care. Private healthcare can be expensive, so make sure you have the right travel health insurance and funds to cover the cost of medical treatment abroad and repatriation if needed.
Most medical practitioners speak English, particularly in major cities and tourist areas. See our list of medical providers in South Africa.
Rehabilitation centres for drug or alcohol addiction
Private rehabilitation centres are widely accessible to foreigners. The British High Commission does not usually contact or visit people who have travelled specifically for medical treatment. If you do choose to attend a rehabilitation centre, you should:
do extensive research in advance and choose a reputable facility that is registered with the South African Department of Social Development or the Western Cape’s Substance Use Disorder Service
make sure you get the right visa for your stay
get the right travel insurance, including medical cover suitable for a rehabilitation stay and your particular circumstances
More information on medical tourism is available from TravelHealthPro.
Organise a contingency plan in case:
you relapse abroad
treatment is unsuccessful
you need unplanned repatriation to the UK (this may need to include access to extra funds)
More information on the impact of travel and substance use is available from the International Association for Medical Assistance to Travellers.
FCDO has a list of medical providers in South Africa.
