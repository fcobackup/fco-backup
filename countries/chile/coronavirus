Entry and borders
On 18 March 2020 the Chilean Government introduced a prohibition of the entry into the country for non-Chileans. This applies to all nationalities, with the exception of non-nationals with valid residency visas for Chile.
Since 0800 on 15 March, the Chilean authorities have closed all Ports to cruise liners.
Local measures
Chilean President Sebastian Piñera announced a 90-day ‘National State of Catastrophe’ on Wednesday 18 March 2020. A nationwide curfew (22:00 to 05:00) has been in place since 22 March.
Since 26 March, Chile has put in place quarantines and sanitary cordons for a number of districts in Santiago and in other parts of the country. The country is deploying a flexible approach to bringing districts in and out of quarantine/sanitary cordons. Changes are currently announced every Tuesday and are applied from Thursdays onwards.
The latest update (28 April) from the Chilean Government was the following:
Quarantine orders for 11 out of Santiago’s 32 municipalities (until at least 7 May inclusive) – the northern halves of Ñuñoa and Central Santiago, El Bosque, San Bernardo (Norte), Puente Alto (Poniente), Independencia, Quinta Normal, Pedro Aguirre Cerda and (as of 28 April) La Pintana, San Ramon (Sur) and Estacion Central.
Full quarantine is in place (until at least 7 May) for 4 other cities: Arica, Punta Arenas, (and as of 28 April) Angol and Victoria (both in La Araucania region).
Sanitary cordons in place in Temuco (Araucanía), Osorno (Los Lagos) and Ñuble. The cordon for Ñuble is to be lifted from 22:00 on Sunday, 3 May.
Sanitary Cordons in place for Metropolitan Santiago and Concepcion (Bío Bío) from 18:00, 30 April until 22:00, 3 May.
Information on zones in quarantine is available on the Google interactive map.
In those areas in quarantine, people are allowed to leave their residences only under certain circumstances, including for medical reasons, basic services, and public services. If you need to leave your residence for food supplies or medical reasons, you must get a permit from the Comisaria Virtual. Foreigners may use their passport number to access the system. The pages are only in Spanish. It is not possible to leave or enter a sanitary cordon without a “salvoconducto” (police authorization), also obtained via the Comisaria Virtual.
Health inspections
Checkpoints for health inspections are in force at various points around Santiago and elsewhere. In addition to checking the health of persons passing through, these checkpoints will be used to confirm that specific individuals who have been ordered to quarantine by medical authorities are not violating their quarantine. You will need to get a “Health Passport” prior to travel and present it at any checkpoint.

More information (in Spanish) is available on the Ministry of Health (Ministerio de Salud) website.
