Be prepared for your plans to change
No travel is risk-free during COVID-19. Countries may further restrict travel or bring in new rules at short notice, for example due to a new COVID-19 variant. Check with your travel company or airline for any transport changes which may delay your journey home.
If you test positive for COVID-19 you will not be able to travel and must isolate for 14 days at home (if you are a resident) or in a hotel specifically requisitioned by the government (if you are a visitor), at your own expense. You must test negative before traveling. Health authorities will inform you if you test positive and monitor the progress of those who do. The government does not provide any assistance for treatment, this would need to be covered by your insurance. This applies to all, including those under 18.
Plan ahead and make sure you:
can access money
understand what your insurance will cover
can make arrangements to extend your stay and be away for longer than planned
