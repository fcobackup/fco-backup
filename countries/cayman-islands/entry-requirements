Entry rules in response to coronavirus (COVID-19)
Entry to the Cayman Islands
Airports in the Cayman Islands are closed to all scheduled inbound and outbound international passenger flights until further notice. The Cayman Islands Government has contracted with British Airways and Cayman Airways to provide a limited service with the UK, USA, Jamaica, Cuba and Honduras.
Only people, who have been pre-authorised may enter the Cayman Islands at this time and they are subject to mandatory quarantine for a period of 14 days, if they are unvaccinated against COVID-19, in a government facility or pre-approved home isolation. From 23 June, those who are fully vaccinated either by the Cayman Islands Health Service Authority or who have a securely verified vaccination certification, are required to quarantine for 5 days, rather than 10, in a government facility or pre-approved home isolation.
From 16 March 2020 the Cayman Islands Government imposed a ban on cruise ships docking in the Cayman Islands.
Cargo flights, couriers and air ambulance services continue to operate as usual.
