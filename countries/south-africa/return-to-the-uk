South African airspace is closed to commercial airlines as part of efforts to contain the spread of coronavirus (COVID-19). International commercial passenger flights are unlikely to resume for some time.
Land borders to neighbouring countries are closed except for trade.
UK special flights
Between 23 May and 4 June, the UK government in partnership with British Airways will operate repatriation charter flights for remaining British travellers in South Africa to return to the UK.
We have now notified all passengers who have been ticketed to fly on our remaining repatriation charter flights from Johannesburg and Cape Town. It is no longer possible to apply for tickets.
We are not planning any further UK government repatriation flights from South Africa after 4 June. Commercial international passenger flights are unlikely to be permitted by the South African government for some time.
Future options
Some other countries are still organising repatriation flights, which British nationals can use to catch connecting flights to the UK. This travel advice will be updated when departure options become available. Sign up for travel advice email alerts and follow the British High Commission on Twitter.
If you have a flight ticket to go to the UK, the South African authorities have said you will need a letter from the British High Commission to enable you to travel to the assembly point for your flight. If you need such a letter, please email your name, passport number and flight ticket details to SouthAfricaBritishNationalReturns@fco.gov.uk.
International commercial passenger flights are unlikely to resume for some time. This travel advice will be updated with any information on resumption of commercial passenger flights. In the meantime, you should continue to follow any regulations set out by the South African government during the lockdown.
You will need to pay for your return travel to the UK. If departure options are available but you cannot afford the travel costs and have exhausted all other options for getting funds, you may be eligible to apply for an emergency loan from the government. This is a last resort option only available
Travel to the airport
You should not go directly to the airport. We will arrange assembly points where passengers will meet and then be transferred to the airport by bus.
After your seat is confirmed you will receive an email explaining where your assembly point is and how you should get there. There will be a contact number in case you need additional assistance.
Ahead of your flight, the High Commission will issue a letter which you can use to travel to the assembly point. You should not go to an assembly point without a flight ticket.
Your journey home
The National Travel Health Network and Centre (NaTHNaC) provides advice on how to stay safe as you travel by air.
If youâ€™re returning home before 8 June, follow the guidance for when you return to the UK on steps you should take to protect yourself and others. From 8 June there will be new rules for entering the UK.
