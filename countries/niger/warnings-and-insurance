Warning
FCDO advises against all travel to parts of Niger.

Your travel insurance could be invalidated if you travel against advice from the Foreign, Commonwealth & Development Office (FCDO).
Areas where FCDO advises against travel
FCDO advises against all travel to Niger, except the capital city of Niamey due to the risk of terrorist attacks and kidnaps.
The political situation remains unstable following the military coup in July 2023. Further instability is possible.
Niamey
FCDO advises against all but essential travel to Niamey. We recommend that British Nationals who decide to travel remain within the city limits of Niamey.
Heightened security measures have been put in place in Niamey, including random stop and searches by local authorities.  This is in response to the JNIM attack in Maliâ€™s capital city, Bamako, on 17 September 2024.
Limited UK government support
There is limited UK government support for British nationals in Niger is provided from the British Deputy High Commission in Lagos, Nigeria. They cannot provide in-person assistance.
If there is serious violence, unrest or a deterioration in the security situation, it could be difficult to leave safely.
Do not rely on the UK government to evacuate you as they may not be able to do so. Have your own plans on how you would leave the country, make sure you keep all travel documentation up to date and monitor the local situation.
Travel insurance
If you choose to travel, research your destinations and get appropriate travel insurance. Insurance should cover your itinerary, planned activities and expenses in an emergency.
