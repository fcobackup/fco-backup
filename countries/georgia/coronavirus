Cases of coronavirus (COVID-19) have been confirmed in Georgia. The Georgian authorities have introduced a number of measures to help limit the spread of the virus.
Departure options
All scheduled passenger flights to or from Georgia have now been cancelled for an indefinite period. The only exception will be Georgian Airways (Air Zena) flights arranged in co-ordination with the Georgian Government (for the purpose of repatriation of their nationals). Air Zena may be willing to take departing outward passengers. The British Embassy Tbilisi is issuing regular updates on Facebook and twitter.com/ukingeorgia with the latest information on flight departure options for British Nationals wishing to leave Georgia. With effect from 16 March, all Georgian land borders have been closed for the movement of people for at least 10 days, other than for the return of the citizens of each country to return to their country of origin. This does not apply to the movement of goods.
In-country measures
On 21 March the President of Georgia declared a State of Emergency for one month until 21 April. Gatherings of more than 10 people are banned, religious services have been cancelled, fines of 3,000 GEL for individuals introduced for violation of self-isolation and people are strongly encouraged to limit movement outside their homes. Restrictions on internal travel are being introduced.
From midnight 23 March inter-city public travel by train or minibus (“mashrutka”) will stop. Travel by private car will be allowed but social distancing rules should be applied. No-one should sit next to the driver and there should be no more than two passengers in the rear seats. At least one rear window should be open. In areas where there is an unexplained case of coronavirus, lockdown measures may be introduced without warning. All shops with the exception of food shops, pharmacies, petrol stations, banks and post offices are now closed. Cafes and restaurants only offer take-out service. Additional restrictions may be imposed if there is further transmission of virus.
Entry rules
From midnight 18 March, for at least a two-week period, foreign citizens will not be allowed to enter the country. The ban will also apply to foreigners with Georgian residence permits. Those already in Georgia will be permitted to leave. Anyone arriving in Georgia from 20 March will face compulsory 14-day quarantine. You should carry additional supplies of necessary medication in carry-on luggage.
Healthcare response
A number of medical facilities have already been prepared specifically for coronavirus patients, with further facilities in reserve. If you think you might have the symptoms of coronavirus you should call the Georgian Emergency number 112. There are also Hotlines for the Health Ministry on 1505 and the Centre for Disease Control on 116 001.
Further information on coronavirus, including advice on preparing for foreign travel and helping reduce the spread of the virus, is available from Public Health England and on the TravelHealthPro website.
