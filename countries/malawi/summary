Travel to Malawi is subject to entry restrictions
Entry to Malawi is prohibited except for Malawian nationals and foreign nationals with valid residency visas for Malawi.
If you’re eligible for entry, you will be tested for COVID-19 on arrival at your own expense. Passengers may be required to remain at the airport or a testing centre until their COVID-19 test results are known, usually within 24 hours. Individuals testing positive may be taken for treatment at a government facility. All other individuals will be required to self-isolate for 14 days after arrival
If you want to exit Malawi, proof that a negative COVID-19 test has been taken within 10 days of departure needs to be provided.
Mandatory COVID-19 testing will also take place on departure if you fail to produce a valid negative test certificate, or if the airport staff judge you to display COVID-19 symptoms. Again, this test will be at your own expense.
No animals (domestic pets) are permitted to enter or leave the country at this time.
See Entry requirements for more information before you plan to travel.
