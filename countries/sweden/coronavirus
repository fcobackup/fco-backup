Travel via Denmark
If you are in southern Sweden, you may be considering returning to the UK via Denmark. This would require you to cross the Oresund Bridge or use the Helsingborg – Helsingör ferry route, and therefore cross Danish border controls. You should inform the Danish border officials that you are returning to the UK, and be prepared to provide evidence to support this, for example a flight ticket. See travel advice for Denmark.
