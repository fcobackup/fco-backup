International travel
With effect from midnight on 20 December, the Moroccan Government has suspended until further notice all flights to and from the UK following the emergence of a new strain of Covid-19 in the UK. British Nationals affected by flight cancellations should contact their airlines for further information and for advice on possible alternative flight options via a third country. Please be aware, however, that several third countries have themselves suspended flights to and from the UK and others may follow suit at very short notice.
British nationals who find themselves now stranded in Morocco and who require consular assistance should call the British Embassy on + 212 (0) 537 63 33 33 and follow the voice menu for “option 4 - consular assistance”.
