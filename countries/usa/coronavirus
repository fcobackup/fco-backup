Cases of coronavirus (COVID-19) have been confirmed in the USA. The US authorities have introduced a number of measures to limit the spread of the virus.
The US authorities announced on 14 March that travel restrictions imposed previously on Schengen zone countries would now be extended to the UK (and Ireland).
From 23:59 Eastern Daylight Time on 16 March (03:59 GMT 17 March) it will not be possible for many British nationals to enter the USA.
US citizens and permanent resident of the USA, certain specified close family members and certain other limited categories of visas holders (such as UN staff and diplomats) are exempt and will still be able to enter the USA, subject to normal entry requirements. Those allowed entry to the USA may be asked to self-isolate for up to 14 days after arrival.
In line with the new restrictions, British nationals will also be unable to transit the USA on an ESTA visa waiver if they have been in the UK, Ireland, Schengen zone, Iran or China within the previous 14 days. For further information on the validity of ESTAs please consult advice from US Customs and Border Protection.
British travellers currently in the USA will be allowed to leave. The new US travel restrictions are likely to affect commercial flight schedules to the UK and we recommend that British travellers who wish to leave by air make appropriate arrangements to ensure their travel plans can be met.
For information on how to return to the UK from the USA, see Return to the UK.
The new restrictions also limit the number of airports to which flights from the UK (and Ireland) can operate. The 13 airports are: JFK (New York), EWR (Newark), IAD (Washington DC), BOS, (Boston), ORD (Chicago), DTW (Detroit), MIA (Miami), ATL (Atlanta), DFW (Dallas), LAX (Los Angeles), SFO (San Francisco), SEA (Seattle) and HML (Honolulu). Long queues have been reported at US airports as a result of the new screening procedures put in place by the US Government. Travellers should comply with these measures and account for the extra time it may take to clear screening when arriving for a flight or on disembarkation.
Those who are permitted entry to the USA from the UK (or Ireland) will be advised to self-isolate, possibly for up to 14 days.
On 11 March President Trump announced that, effective from midnight 13 March, the US Government will not permit entry to the USA of any non-US nationals, including British nationals, who have visited (or are resident in) Schengen Area countries 14 days or less prior to their travel to the USA. The US Government has indicated that this is a temporary restriction that will last for 30 days. For further information please see the US State Department website.
With effect from 2 February, the US Government will not permit entry to the USA of any foreign nationals who have visited China 14 days or less prior to their travel to the USA. More information for travellers to the USA can be found on the US Centre for Disease Control (CDC) website.
To prevent the spread of COVID-19, American Samoa currently requires all non-US passport holders to spend at least 14 days in Hawaii, Samoa (Apia) or Tonga before entering. Other restrictions for those travelling from countries affected by the outbreak could also be in force. If youâ€™re due to travel, check the websites of the American Samoa Government and the US Center for Disease Control and Prevention for any updates, and with your airline before leaving. You should check with your airline or travel agent for any additional information about existing travel bookings.
