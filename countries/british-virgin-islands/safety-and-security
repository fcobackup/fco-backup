Terrorism
There is a high threat of terrorist attack globally affecting UK interests and British nationals, including from groups and individuals who view the UK and British nationals as targets. You should remain vigilant at all times.
UK Counter Terrorism Policing has information and advice on staying safe abroad and what to do in the event of a terrorist attack. Find out how to reduce your risk from terrorism while abroad.
Terrorism in the British Virgin Islands (BVI)
Although there’s no recent history of terrorism in the BVI, attacks cannot be ruled out.
Crime
Levels of crime in the BVI are low. However, some serious incidents do occur including armed robbery and drug-related gun crime.
Take sensible precautions to protect your personal safety and belongings, as you would at home:
carry a mobile phone with roaming capability
take care if you are walking alone in isolated areas including beaches, particularly after dark
do not carry large amounts of cash or jewellery and use a hotel safe if possible
be aware of the risk of leaving your valuables unattended, especially when on the beach
do not attempt to resist an armed robber or take any action that puts you at greater risk
Take particular care of your passport, as it cannot be renewed or replaced in the BVI. If you lose your passport, you will need to apply online for an emergency travel document.
If you need emergency help, contact the police on 999 or 911. Contact 311 for non-emergencies.
Laws and cultural differences
The BVI is a separate legal jurisdiction to the UK and has its own laws.
Illegal drugs and prison sentences
Do not get involved with any illegal drugs, including marijuana. Possession of small quantities can lead to large fines or imprisonment. Drug trafficking is a serious offence. Pack your luggage yourself and do not carry items for anyone else.
Conservation and fishing
Spear fishing is not allowed. The use of scuba equipment, explosive, poison or other toxic substance to capture or remove any marine animal or coral is against the law (this includes dead coral and shells). Fishing within the boundaries of any marine park is banned. Commercial, sport and pleasure fishing require a fishing licence and the boat you are fishing from must be registered. You can get a temporary permit from the Department of Agriculture and Fisheries.
LGBT+ travellers
Homosexuality is legal in the BVI. There’s no provision for marriage or civil partnerships between same-sex couples. Attitudes in the main tourist destinations are tolerant and hotels and resorts are generally welcoming regardless of sexual orientation. Local attitudes outside the tourist areas can be conservative and some people may not approve of public displays of affection between same-sex couples. Read more advice for LGBT+ travellers.
Transport risks in the BVI
Road travel
You can drive for up to 30 days on a UK licence in the BVI and then you must apply for a local licence. The majority of cars are left-hand drive, but vehicles drive on the left as in the UK.
Sea travel
Many visitors to the BVI take part in water sports. The rate of accidents is very low, but they do occur. Many accidents involve the consumption of alcohol, so take care if you have been drinking. Virgin Islands Search and Rescue (VISAR) can be contacted to respond to emergencies at sea.
Extreme weather and natural disasters
The hurricane season in the Caribbean normally runs from June to November but can occur any time of the year.
You should:
monitor weather updates from the US National Hurricane Centre and the BVI Department of Disaster Management (DDM)
follow the advice of local authorities
download the DDM alert app
read the BVI Red Cross guidance on hurricanes and tsunamis
