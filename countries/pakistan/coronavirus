Travel to the airport
You’re strongly advised not to travel to the airport if you’re displaying any COVID-19 symptoms, including a high temperature. When you enter the airport, you may be thermal scanned by the Pakistani authorities. If you have a high temperature or other COVID-19 symptoms, you will not be permitted to fly and may be asked to self-isolate for 14 days before you can travel.
Public places and services
Pakistani authorities have imposed restrictions on some public activities in Islamabad Capital Territory and parts of Punjab province due to rising cases of COVID-19 including a ban on indoor and outdoor dining, restrictions on commercial activities, educational institutes and gatherings. Restrictions may be lifted or re-imposed based on the levels of COVID-19 in the country.
There are mandatory standard operating procedures which must be followed in public spaces, including the use of face masks, temperature screening and social distancing. Across Pakistan, it is now mandatory to wear a face mask in public and not wearing one is punishable by a fine.
There are additional varying measures in force in each province including compulsory self-isolation for people who have COVID-19 symptoms, or people who have come into contact with others with COVID-19 symptoms. In some cases, authorities are locking down specific areas. Some provinces have introduced powers to fine or arrest anyone breaking the rules.
You should follow the federal and relevant provincial guidance, and monitor local media for updates. Plan any movements accordingly.

The Pakistan Civil Aviation Authority (CAA) require the plane to be disinfected prior to departing for Pakistan. Luggage will also be disinfected before it is loaded onto the plane. Cabin Crew will be required to wear personal protective equipment (PPE).
Healthcare in Pakistan
There is a risk that the healthcare system will come under significant strain as the number of COVID-19 cases increases. Access to routine and emergency healthcare may be limited.
The Pakistani authorities have announced a helpline (on phone number 1166) for people who have COVID-19 symptoms like fever, cough and difficulty breathing. If you’re worried about the virus, or suspect you may have contracted it, call the helpline and follow the guidance given by the authorities. You can also check the official government of Pakistan website on COVID-19.
If you’re running out of medication or have medical needs, you should speak to your travel insurance company for advice and seek local medical assistance, including from pharmacies. Pharmacies remain open in Pakistan and many medicines can be purchased over the counter. If your usual medication is not available, speak to your travel insurer, ask a local doctor or request advice from your UK doctor.
Pharmacies have remained open during COVID-19 lockdowns as they are exempted from lockdown closure. Major hospitals have pharmacies which operate 24 hours a day and there have been no restrictions in accessing hospitals during COVID-19 lockdowns.
