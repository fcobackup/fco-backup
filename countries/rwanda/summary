On 22 May 2021, Mount Nyiragongo volcano in Democratic Republic of Congo (DRC), close to the city of Goma, and near the border with Rwanda and the Rwandan city of Gisenyi, erupted. You can follow the latest information about the volcano on the website of GeoRiskA. If you’re in the area, you should follow the instructions of local authorities and remain vigilant.
Rwanda is generally safe and crime levels are relatively low, but street crime does occur. There have been reports of an increase in burglary, theft and mugging in Kigali in recent months. You should take precautions with valuables and remain vigilant. See Crime
The security situation near the border with the Democratic Republic of Congo (DRC) and Burundi remains unstable, and there have been armed attacks in Rwanda’s Nyungwe Forest and Volcanoes National Parks Parks and neighbouring areas. If you’re travelling near the DRC or Burundi borders, you should be aware of the risk of attacks and Government of Rwanda security operations. Exercise caution and keep up to date with developments on the current situation, including via your tour operator, the local media and this travel advice. See Local travel
If you’re abroad and you need emergency help from the UK government, contact the nearest British embassy, consulate or high commission.
Although there’s no recent history of terrorism in Rwanda, attacks can’t be ruled out. See Terrorism
