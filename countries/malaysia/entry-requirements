This page reflects the UK government’s understanding of current rules for people travelling on a full ‘British Citizen’ passport, for the most common types of travel.
The authorities in Malaysia set and enforce entry rules. For further information contact the embassy, high commission or consulate of the country or territory you’re travelling to. You should also consider checking with your transport provider or travel company to make sure your passport and other travel documents meet their requirements.
Entry rules in response to coronavirus
Entry to Malaysia
Entry to Malaysia for British nationals is prohibited. Some exemptions may apply, including: British nationals with permanent resident status, resident pass, My Second Home Programme (MM2H) pass, expatriates of all categories, including professional visit passes as well as dependants pass, spouse to Malaysian nationals (spouse visa) and students and temporary employment passes.
You are not permitted to enter Malaysia as a tourist, except for travel to Langkawi Island under the international tourism bubble. Strict requirements are in place to travel to Langkawi. Further information is available from the Ministry of Tourism (MOTAC).
The situation is changing regularly, and any British national who wishes to enter Malaysia will need to seek permission from the local Malaysian Embassy/High Commission or the Immigration Directorate before travelling.
If you normally reside in Malaysia and wish to seek further guidance, contact the Malaysian High Commission or Embassy in the country you currently stay for further guidance and your airline and keep up to date with developments, including this travel advice. You may need to complete an application on the MYTravelPass online platform. You should speak to the local Malaysian authorities for further guidance.
Additional measures in response to the Omicron variant
Malaysia has introduced additional travel restrictions and requirements from some countries with COVID-19 Omicron variant spread.
From 8 December, in addition to the quarantine and testing requirements outlined below, if you are travelling to Malaysia from the UK you will be required to wear a digital tracker during your quarantine. You should check with the local Malaysian Embassy or High Commission before travelling.
Foreign nationals including international students and foreign workers from or with a travel history within 14 days to certain high-risk countries are not allowed to enter Malaysia nor travel under the Langkawi International Travel Bubble. See the list of countries affected, which may be subject to change.
Transiting Malaysia
You can transit (up to 24 hours only) via Kuala Lumpur International Airport (KLIA) as long as you remain airside.
Transit that requires passage through immigration (to collect bags, or to move between the two Kuala Lumpur terminals - KLIA and KLIA2) is not possible, unless you meet the general immigration requirements above.
Testing/screen on arrival
You have to take a COVID-19 test on arrival (even if you have a negative test from your country of origin) and on completion of your quarantine. From 17 December arrivals from the UK must undertake a daily lateral flow/RTK-Ag self-test during quarantining. If you have an onward domestic flight in peninsular Malaysia, you will undergo quarantine in Kuala Lumpur. Any onward flight to a regional airport will need to be booked at a later date.
Quarantine requirements
Travellers arriving in Malaysia must provide a negative RT-PCR test result taken within 72 hours of departure. There will be a Covid screening test on arrival. Unvaccinated or partially vaccinated travellers must observe a 10-day quarantine upon entry to Malaysia. Fully vaccinated travellers must observe a 7-day quarantine. You will need to meet all costs associated with your quarantine. You will need to download the MySejahtera app. Quarantine is mandatory and the British High Commission is unable to assist you with not having to do it, regardless of your circumstances.
If you’re travelling to East Malaysia (Sabah or Sarawak) please consult the Malaysian High Commission/Embassy and your airline as regards quarantine procedures and onward travel from Kuala Lumpur to these states. Sabah and Sarawak have additional immigration rules in place. You will only be permitted to enter if you have permanent residence or an employment pass in the relevant state.
The Prime Minister announced on August 8 that fully vaccinated foreigners with a residence in Malaysia who arrive or return from abroad may be allowed to quarantine at home under a digital home surveillance order, as opposed to in a hotel. Please follow the instructions in any forms required to return to Malaysia to ascertain if you meet the requirements to do home quarantine.
Demonstrating your COVID-19 vaccination status
Although we understand that the UK’s proof of COVID-19 vaccination status is being accepted in practice, Malaysia has not yet officially confirmed this. We therefore recommend that you contact your nearest Malaysia embassy for advice on entry requirements. Your NHS appointment card from vaccination centres is not designed to be used as proof of vaccination.
Data collection
You will need to download the MySejahtera app.
Regular entry requirements
Visas
British nationals do not need a visa to visit Malaysia. You will normally be given permission to stay for 3 months on arrival. Visas for longer stays or for non-tourist purposes must be obtained from the nearest Malaysian diplomatic mission before you travel.
The Malaysian authorities are running a vigorous campaign against illegal immigration. Do not overstay your visa, or violate the terms of entry. Even if you overstay for just a few days, you can be fined, detained, deported to the UK and blacklisted. Flight costs will be the responsibility of the individual.
If you’re travelling between Peninsular Malaysia and East Malaysia (sometimes known as Malaysian Borneo and comprising the states of Sabah and Sarawak) you will need to carry your passport. You must get an entry stamp in East Malaysia at your initial port of entry.
Regional travel
UK citizens who wish to travel in the region should consult the appropriate travel advice page.
Passport validity
Your passport should be valid for a minimum period of 6 months from the date of entry into Malaysia. You might be refused entry if its validity is less than 6 months.
Yellow fever certificate requirements
Check whether you need a yellow fever certificate by visiting the National Travel Health Network and Centre’s TravelHealthPro website.
UK Emergency Travel Documents
UK Emergency Travel Documents (ETDs) are accepted for exit from Malaysia. You’re likely to need to get a special exit pass from Malaysian Immigration before leaving and there will be a cost for this. If travelling to another country, other than the UK, you will need to check with the relevant Embassy if a visa is needed in the ETD. If you plan to use an ETD to enter or transit through Malaysia, check entry requirements with the nearest Malaysian Embassy or High Commission before you travel.
Dual nationals
Malaysia doesn’t recognise dual nationality. You can be refused entry if you’re found to be holding a Malaysian passport and one of a different nationality. For those people with dual nationality (not including Malaysian), we advise entering and exiting with the same passport.
Exchange control rules
You can import or export up to 10,000 Malaysian Ringgit without prior approval. There are no limits on the amount of foreign currency you can import or export, but you must declare any amount in excess of US$ 10,000. Penalties include a fine of up to RM 1 million and up to 3 years’ imprisonment. Further information can be found on the Royal Malaysian Customs Department website.
