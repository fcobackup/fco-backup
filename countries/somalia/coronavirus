Cases of coronavirus (COVID-19) have been confirmed in Somalia, including Somaliland.
The Somali authorities have banned all passenger flights until 2 April and have indicated their intention to extend this. Given the rapidly changing situation in Somalia, we have temporarily withdrawn a limited number of UK staff from our Embassy.
Local authorities in Somaliland have announced a number of measures to prevent the spread of the virus including restrictions on travel:
Individuals starting their journey in Europe or North America will not be allowed to enter Somaliland and may be denied boarding by the airline.
All passengers arriving into Somaliland by air will be required to undergo a 14 day quarantine in government assigned accommodation at their own expense. You may need to demonstrate that you can afford the cost of your hotel quarantine before boarding your flight. Please contact your airline for more details.
All arrivals to Somaliland will be subject to entry screening which may include temperature measurements and checks on recent travel to affected areas. Those people displaying symptoms linked to coronavirus may be transferred to a nearby isolation facility while further tests are carried out.
The Somaliland authorities have announced the closure of all land borders for three weeks on 26 March and the closure of all sea ports. You should check with local authorities before travelling to the border.
The authorities have encouraged members of the diaspora not to travel to Somaliland at this time.
Land borders with countries neighboring Somalia may close at short notice. You should check with local authorities before travelling to the border. You should also monitor Travel Advice for Ethiopia, Kenya or Djibouti. You should not cross the border without the correct documents.
Further information on coronavirus, including advice on preparing for foreign travel and helping to reduce the spread of the virus, is available from Public Health England and on the TravelHealthPro website.
