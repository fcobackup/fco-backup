It’s not possible to withdraw any cash against credit and debit cards at banks or from ATMs. Foreign credit and debit cards can’t be used anywhere in Sudan, including at international hotels. Make sure you have enough hard currency with you – this should be in US dollars dated 2006 onwards (older ones will not be exchanged). Pounds sterling are rarely exchanged. You should only change money through banks or official bureaux de exchange (eg in hotels). Don’t change any money on the street.
