Travel in El Salvador
Most businesses and services are operating. However some COVID-19 restrictions and other measures remain in force.
Anyone leaving their accommodation must wear a face covering. Other measures could be introduced with little or no notice. You should familiarise yourself with any local measures or restrictions, and comply with these and any other emergency measures.
Accommodation
Please check that your planned accommodation is available and whether any COVID-19 restrictions are being applied before travelling.
Public spaces and services
Key services (including most shops, banks, petrol stations and restaurants/take away/home delivery food services) are open; entry controls, temperature checks, social distancing measures and limits on customer numbers are common. Schools and universities and some businesses and organisations, including some tourist visitor facilities, remain closed or require a prior appointment. Large gatherings are discouraged.
Health
British-issued prescriptions cannot be used locally. To find a pharmacy (“farmacia”) look for one of the big national chains such as Farmacia San Nicolas, Farmacias UNO or Farmacias Economicas, among others; a quick search online should help you to identify the nearest open one.
