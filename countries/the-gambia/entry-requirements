This information is for people travelling on a full ‘British citizen’ passport from the UK. It is based on the UK government’s understanding of The Gambia’s current rules for the most common types of travel.
The authorities in The Gambia set and enforce entry rules. If you’re not sure how these requirements apply to you, contact the Gambian High Commission in the UK.  
Passport validity requirements 
To enter The Gambia, your passport must be valid for the duration of your stay.
Check with your travel provider that your passport and other travel documents meet requirements. Renew your passport if you need to.  
You will be denied entry if you do not have a valid travel document or try to use a passport that has been reported lost or stolen. 
Visa requirements 
You do not need a visa to visit The Gambia. You’ll get a stamp in your passport that allows you to stay for 28 days when you arrive.  
You can get 2 extensions of 28 days from the Immigration Office in Banjul or the tourist police stations in the Tourism Development Area.
You’ll need a residence permit for longer stays. For more information contact the Gambian High Commission in the UK. 
Airport tax 
You must pay an Airport Security Fee when you arrive in and leave the country. The fee is 20 US dollars, which can also be paid in euros, British pounds, or local currency. Visa credit cards are accepted but card machines are often out of service. You can pay the fee at marked kiosks in Banjul International Airport. Children aged 1 or under and passengers transiting are exempt. 
Entry through land borders 
If you are driving across the border in a private vehicle you may be asked to pay a vehicle registration fee. 
Vaccine requirements 
To enter The Gambia, you must have a certificate to prove you’ve had a yellow fever vaccination if you’re coming from a country listed as a transmission risk.
You may need a yellow fever certificate for onward travel to some other countries, due to the risk of yellow fever in The Gambia.
For full details about medical entry requirements and recommended vaccinations, see TravelHealthPro’s The Gambia guide.  
Customs rules 
There are strict rules about goods you can take into or out of The Gambia. You must declare anything that may be prohibited or subject to tax or duty.
