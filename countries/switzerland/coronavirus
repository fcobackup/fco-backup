Travel restrictions
Entry in to Switzerland from all countries except Liechtenstein is only possible for Swiss citizens, Liechtenstein citizens, holders of Swiss resident permits, cross-border workers, those transiting with an onward ticket within the same day (not overnight) and those with “compelling reasons”. Goods traffic is also still permitted. Secondary customs posts are closed at all borders so that traffic can be channelled through the main border crossings.

Local measures
The Swiss Government have implemented “extraordinary measures” in response to coronavirus (COVID-19).
Gatherings of more than 5 people are banned, excluding families and members of the same household.
All contact with other individuals should be kept to a minimum, and a distance of 1 metre should be maintained at all times.
The public are strongly advised to stay at home and employers urged to allow staff to work from home.
All schools, shops, restaurants, bars, leisure and entertainment facilities are closed with exemptions for essential outlets such as grocery stores, pharmacies, health facilities and public transport.
The Government has announced a phased relaxing of these measures. From 27 April, hospitals and medical practitioners (including dentists and physiotherapists) can carry out non-urgent procedures. And a range of businesses including DIY stores and hairdressers have reopened.
Further information is available from the Swiss Government (in French, German and Italian).
More information is available from the Federal Office of Public Health in Switzerland.
