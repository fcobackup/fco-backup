The information on this page covers the most common types of travel and reflects the UK government’s understanding of the rules currently in place. Unless otherwise stated, this information is for travellers using a full ‘British Citizen’ passport.
The authorities in the country or territory you’re travelling to are responsible for setting and enforcing the rules for entry. If you’re unclear about any aspect of the entry requirements, or you need further reassurance, you’ll need to contact the embassy, high commission or consulate of the country or territory you’re travelling to.
You should also consider checking with your transport provider or travel company to make sure your passport and other travel documents meet their requirements.
Entry rules in response to coronavirus (COVID-19)
Entry to Kosovo
The airport reopened on 28 June, and international flights are permitted. Certain land border crossings have reopened on the Kosovo side. These are:
All crossings into Albania
The Kulla crossing into Montenegro
The Hani I Elezit crossing into North Macedonia
The Merdarë/Merdare, Dheu i Bardhë/Bela Zemlja, and Jarinjë/Jarinje crossing points into Serbia. You should check our advice on the Kosovo/Serbia border below and our advice recommending all but essential travel to northern Kosovo.
There are some restrictions for entry into neighbouring countries. You should check FCDO travel advice for the relevant country before attempting to cross a border.
Testing / screening on arrival
All foreign nationals entering Kosovo from countries where the overall risk of Covid-19 is assessed as “high”, according to the official ECDC list, must provide a negative RT-PCR test, no more than 72 hours old, to enter Kosovo. The official ECDC list is updated every two weeks. As of 28 September, UK nationals travelling from the UK to Kosovo do not require a negative test before arrival.
You should consult the latest ECDC list before travelling.
As of 30 July, citizens of Bosnia and Herzegovina, North Macedonia, Serbia and Montenegro entering Kosovo must present a negative RT-PCR test, less than 72 hours old at the border.
You should not use the NHS testing service to get a test in order to facilitate your travel to another country. You should arrange to take a private test.
There are medical staff at border crossings and the airport and you may be subject to a health check, particularly if you are displaying coronavirus symptoms. There are no requirements to self-isolate on entry into Kosovo, but you should follow the instructions of the medical staff on the border.
Regular entry requirements
Visas
British nationals don’t need a visa to enter Kosovo. You may be asked to provide documentary evidence giving a reason for your stay. A 90-day entry stamp will be issued which is renewable for longer stays. Since 8 May 2013 citizens of EU member states can enter Kosovo on a photo ID card. A photo ID driving licence does not constitute a valid ID card for cross-border travel and British nationals still need to enter Kosovo with a valid passport. With effect from 1 July, Kosovo introduced a visa regime for the nationalities listed on the Kosovan Ministry of Foreign Affairs website.
Registration
If you’re coming to Kosovo for a short stay (90 days or less), and will be staying in a hotel, hostel or other registered landlord, that business will notify the police of your presence on your behalf. If you plan to stay in a private house (for example, with friends or family) then you must notify the nearest police station of where you’re staying. If you plan to stay in Kosovo for longer than 90 days, you will need to register with the Ministry of Internal Affairs for a Residence Permit.
Kosovo/Serbia Border
The authorities in Serbia don’t consider the designated crossing points from Kosovo to be official ‘international’ border crossing points.
Foreign nationals have been denied entry to Serbia if they have Republic of Kosovo stamps in their passports and the Serbian authorities may not allow you to travel into Serbia if you hold these stamps. We are also aware of isolated incidents where Serbian authorities have cancelled Kosovo stamps in passports of foreign nationals.
You cannot travel directly from Kosovo into Serbia if you don’t have a valid entry stamp from either Belgrade airport or one of the Serbia’s border crossings with Montenegro, Croatia, Hungary, Romania, Bulgaria or North Macedonia; you will be refused entry without an existing valid Serbian entry stamp. You should take a route which transits a third country. For more information please visit the website of the Serbian Ministry for Foreign Affairs.
Passport validity
Your passport must be undamaged and valid for the proposed duration of your stay. No additional period of validity beyond this is required. 
UK Emergency Travel Documents
UK Emergency Travel Documents are accepted for entry, airside transit and exit from Kosovo.
