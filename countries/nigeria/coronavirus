Entry and travel restrictions

The Nigerian Immigration Service has announced the temporary suspension of passports and migrant registration due to the outbreak of coronavirus until 23 May. The Nigerian authorities have told us that British nationals who exceed their authorised visa stays because of travel restrictions linked to coronavirus will not be penalised for overstaying when they depart.
Most states in Nigeria have introduced their own restrictions on movement. All travellers and residents in Nigeria are encouraged to monitor announcements by federal and state governments on further restrictions, which are likely to be introduced with little advance notice.
Local measures
The Federal Government (FG) has announced that from 4 until 17 May the lockdown restrictions in place in Abuja and Lagos will be relaxed and replaced with new requirements including a nationwide daily night time curfew between 8:00pm and 06:00am and the mandatory use of facemasks in public. Check the Nigerian Centre for Disease Control website for further guidance on the implications of the easing of the lockdown restrictions in Abuja and Lagos.
The FG also advised that travel to or from other states should be postponed.
Only government operated isolation centres can treat coronavirus related issues.
You are also advised to follow the advice of local authorities, including local measures to help minimise your risk of exposure to coronavirus (COVID-19).
Medical
Pharmacies are classified as an essential service, and will remain open. Most medicines that require a prescription from a doctor in the UK will require one in Nigeria. If necessary, you should obtain an electronic prescription from your medical practitioner to enable a local doctor to write one.
