Travel in the Netherlands
The latest information on Dutch domestic coronavirus measures can be found on the Dutch government website (in English).
Where possible, the Dutch government advises to avoid crowds and to travel outside peak hours if taking public transport.
As of 26 June 2021, wearing a face mask is no longer compulsory in indoor public spaces. The Dutch Government recommends you continue to wear a face mask in situations where you cannot maintain social distancing of at least 1.5metres. Face masks must be worn on public transport, in stations, on platforms and at bus, tram or metro stops if you are aged 13 and over. If you do not wear a face mask as directed, you may be fined €95. You must observe social distancing of at least 1.5 metres when on platforms and at stations.
For other shared forms of transport, such as taxis, passenger vans and coaches, you must wear a face mask, unless you are the only passenger. If you’re travelling in a car or other private vehicle, you are advised to wear face masks if there are two or more people in the vehicle who belong to different households. On other forms of transport, you must stay 1.5 metres apart where possible.
Children under the age of 13 are not required to wear a face mask.
Schiphol, Eindhoven and Rotterdam Airports
All passengers and staff aged 13+ must wear face masks in all areas of these airports. The terminals are only open for passengers and staff. You must not be accompanied into the airport, unless absolutely necessary for a traveller with reduced mobility.
Ferries
DFDS
All travellers must wear face coverings at check-in, whilst boarding, and during disembarkation. This applies for both foot- and car passengers, as well as freight drivers. On the Amsterdam - Newcastle route, passengers must wear face coverings whilst moving around the ship. Face coverings do not need to be worn when travellers are in their cabins, seated in a socially distanced manner or whilst social distancing on outside decks.

All passengers aged 13+ must wear a face mask at Eurostar stations and on board trains. If you don’t have a mask you may be refused travel on Eurostar services.
Public Spaces and Services
A full overview of measures is available on the Dutch government’s website. Most outdoor and indoor activities are now permitted, as long as 1.5 metres social distancing in observed.
There are no limits on group sizes indoors and outdoors, as long as 1.5metres social distancing is observed. Mandatory reservations, health checks and maximum capacity limits are in place for public venues, such as restaurants, cafes, museums, theatres, amusement parks and zoos.
You must stay 1.5 metres away from other people. This applies to everyone over the age of 18, in the street, in shops and other buildings. It does not apply to members of your household and it does not apply if you are providing assistance to someone, for example pushing a wheelchair. If you notice that it is becoming difficult to keep a distance of 1.5 metres, you should leave. The Dutch government continues to advise people to avoid busy places. If a gathering poses a safety or public health risk, enforcement officers can take action.

COVID-19 vaccines if you live in the Netherlands
Wherever possible British nationals should aim to be vaccinated in the country where they live. As further information is available about the national vaccination programme, this page will be updated. Sign up to get email notifications.
The Netherlands started its vaccination programme on 6 January 2021. It is the Dutch government’s goal to invite all residents aged 18 and over to receive their vaccination in 2021. Vulnerable groups and healthcare workers are the first groups to be invited. The Dutch government has issued information on the vaccination programme. If you are resident in the Netherlands, you should receive an invitation by letter or email when it is your turn to get the vaccination.
The Medicines and Healthcare Products Regulatory Agency (MHRA) is the UK authority responsible for assessing the safety, quality and efficacy of vaccines. It has authorised the Pfizer/BioNTech, Oxford/AstraZeneca and Moderna vaccines for temporary supply and use in the UK. Find out more about MHRA approval for these vaccines.
British nationals living overseas should seek medical advice from their local healthcare provider in the country where they reside. Information about vaccines used in other national programmes, including regulatory status, should be available from the local authorities. This list of Stringent Regulatory Authorities recognised by the World Health Organisation may also be a useful source of additional information. Find out more about COVID-19 vaccines on the World Health Organisation COVID-19 vaccines page.
Finance

Returning to the UK
When you return, you must follow the rules for entering the UK. You are responsible for organising your own COVID-19 test, in line with UK government testing requirements. The Dutch Municipal Health Service (GGD) should not be used for pre-travel tests, as explained on the GGD website (in Dutch and English). You should obtain a test from a private provider instead. The Dutch Government are providing free tests for travel. If you choose to use these tests, you should check that the type of test and the test result certificate meets the full testing requirements (e.g. name of the test provider and their contact details, if appropriate) for entry into either England, Scotland, Wales and Northern Ireland.
