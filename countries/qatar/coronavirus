Travel in Qatar
Qatar’s Ministry of Public Health has published advice on how to limit the spread of coronavirus, and has introduced a number of precautionary restrictions on travel and events in response to the coronavirus pandemic.
Public transport, including the metro and bus services, are currently operating at full capacity. You should wear a mask at all times when using these services. These guidelines and regulations change frequently with little warning. For the most current information regarding COVID-19 regulations visit the Ministry of Public Health website.
With effect from 7 July 2022, the requirement to wear a face mask has been re-introduced. Citizens, residents and visitors are obliged to wear masks in closed public places. This includes healthcare facilities, public transportation, mosques, gyms, shopping malls, stores, cinemas and any other closed public space.
It is compulsory to have Qatar’s contact tracing app, Ehteraz, downloaded and working on your smartphone whenever you leave the house.
Anyone violating these could incur a fine of up to QAR200,000 and/or a prison sentence not exceeding three years.
For further information, visit the Ministry of Public Health webpage.
Accommodation
Hotels are open, and facilities (i.e. gyms, pool) have reopened. Some hotels are being used as quarantine locations.
Public places and services
There are currently no limits on the number of people at social gatherings. These guidelines and regulations change frequently with little warning. For the most current information regarding COVID-19 regulations visit the Ministry of Public Health website. You will be asked to show your vaccinated status on the Ehteraz app to enter most locations. If you are unvaccinated, entry may be denied.
Playgrounds and exercise equipment in public spaces have been reopened. Mosques are open but worshippers are reminded to follow the guidance on general prevention measures. Entry may be dependent on presenting evidence that you are fully vaccinated.
From 30 January 2022 schools have returned to in-person lessons.
Healthcare in Qatar
If you need emergency medical assistance during your trip, dial 999 and ask for an ambulance. You should contact your insurance or medical assistance company promptly if you are referred to a medical facility for treatment.
If you have symptoms of COVID-19, you should contact the Ministry of Public Health’s helpline on 16000.
If you are confirmed to have COVID-19, you will be placed in isolation in one of the country’s medical facilities, or asked to self-isolate at home for 7 days, depending on your symptoms.
Emergency medical treatment is excellent but can be expensive. Routine treatment is available but expensive for visitors. Make sure you have adequate travel health insurance and accessible funds to cover the cost of any medical treatment abroad and repatriation.
