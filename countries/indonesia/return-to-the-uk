British nationals in Indonesia who wish to leave, should make arrangements to do so as soon as possible.
The number of international flights out of Indonesia is reducing daily, to destinations within the region and globally, so you may not be able to leave Indonesia when you had planned to. Flights and medical evacuation may not be available, or become very expensive if you do not depart soon.
The British Embassy Jakarta is issuing regular updates on Twitter and Facebook with the latest available information on flight departure options for British nationals wishing to leave Bali and other areas of Indonesia.
