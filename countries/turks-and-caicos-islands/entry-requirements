Entry rules in response to coronavirus (COVID-19)
Entry to Turks and Caicos Islands
Border closures have been extended by the Turks and Caicos Islands Government until 22 July. This is subject to change.
Entry to or transit through the Turks and Caicos Islands is prohibited until 22 July, with some exceptions for returning residents and workers delivering essential COVID-19 business, or other business on behalf of the Government, who will require authorisation by Public Health prior to arrival. Depending on an assessment by Public Health, anyone authorised to enter the Turks and Caicos Islands before 22 July may require a PCR test, or to remain in quarantine for a designated period following arrival.
From 22 July, any eligible travellers arriving to the Turks and Caicos Islands must have evidence of a negative COVID-19 test from a reputable facility within 5 days of arrival, proof of health/travel insurance with COVID-19 cover (including cover for any necessary in-country medical treatment, quarantine costs or repatriation/medevac) and must complete a health screening questionnaire. All visitors will be required to wear masks on arrival to the Turks and Caicos Islands.

Customs regulations
There are restrictions on the import and export of agricultural, food and marine products. Before arrival, all flight passengers will be asked to complete a form providing details of products they are bringing into the country. This form should be handed to a customs official on arrival.
There are no restrictions for travellers on the import of cameras, film or sports equipment. To bring in firearms of any type (including spear guns and Hawaiian slings), you will need written approval from the Commissioner of Police.
Travelling with medicines or any controlled drugs must be accompanied by a doctorâ€™s prescription. Keep all medication in original packaging to avoid confusion and questioning at ports of entry.
