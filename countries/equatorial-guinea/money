It is not possible to use credit cards except at the major airline offices (Air France, Iberia and Lufthansa) and some hotels (Hilton, Sofitel). The local currency is the Central African Franc (CFA), issued by the Banque des Etats de L’Afrique Centrale (BEAC). This is not the same Central African Franc as issued by the Banque des Etats de L’Afrique Ouest (BEAOC) which is not legal tender in Equatorial Guinea. There are only a limited number of ATMs available, located in Malabo and Bata. Not all of these accept international credit and debit cards. Euros, Pound Sterling and US Dollars are the preferred currencies for exchange at local banks.
