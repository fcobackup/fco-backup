This page has information on travelling to Brazil.
This page reflects the UK government’s understanding of current rules for people travelling on a full ‘British Citizen’ passport from the UK, for the most common types of travel.
The authorities in Brazil set and enforce entry rules. If you’re unsure how Brazil’s entry requirements apply to you, contact its UK embassy, high commission or consulate.
All travellers
All passengers arriving in Brazil do not need to show proof of COVID-19 vaccination, a negative COVID-19 test, or a certificate of recovery from COVID-19. For more information see the Consulate General of Brazil in London – Visiting Brazil website.
You can travel to Brazil without a visa as a tourist for up to 90 days. If you wish to extend your tourist visa, you should contact the Policia Federal.
See Visas and Passport validity section for more information.
Check your passport and travel documents before you travel
Check with your travel provider to make sure your passport and other travel documents meet their requirements.
Passport validity
Your passport should be valid for a minimum period of 6 months from the date of entry into Brazil.
Visas
British nationals can normally enter Brazil without a visa as a tourist. For further information about visas, see the website of the Brazilian Consulate in London.
Ensure you comply with Brazilian immigration laws on arrival in the country. You must satisfy the Federal Police (the Brazilian immigration authority) of the purpose of your visit. You will need to demonstrate that you have enough money for the duration of your stay, provide de-tails of your accommodation and evidence of return or onward travel. Make sure your passport is stamped. If it is not, you may be fined on departure.
If you wish to extend your stay in Brazil, you should apply to the Federal Police for an extension. If you overstay, you are likely to be given notice to leave the country at your own expense and you may be fined or deported.
Dual nationality
The Brazilian immigration authorities often require dual British/Brazilian nationals visiting Brazil to travel on Brazilian (rather than British) passports.
Travelling with children
Children who hold dual British-Brazilian citizenship
British-Brazilian dual nationals aged 17 or younger require authorisation from both of their parents or legal guardian(s) to travel within Brazil or exit the country. When a minor travels with both parents, no written authorisation is needed.
When the dual national minor travels with only one parent or without either parent, they must have two original written authorisations from both parents. The authorisation must be provided through a formal process called Travel Authorization for Brazilian Minors. The process can also be completed online through e-Notariado (Sistema de Atos Notariais Eletrônicos).
The Federal Police will require this permission to be presented at the time of the minor’s departure from Brazil. The travel authorisation must be prepared in two original copies, one of which will be retained by the Federal Police inspection agent at the time of boarding, together with a copy of the identification document of the minor, and the other must remain with the minor, or with the adult person accompanying them on the trip.
Children who are not dual British-Brazilian nationals
The Federal Police have, at times, delayed the travel of non-Brazilian minors who lack appropriate authorisation from both parents. For this reason, we recommend that families of non-Brazilian minors who may travel through Brazil without one or both parents follow the instructions above and ensure that the minor, or the minor’s travelling companion, carries the original or notarised copy of the minor’s birth certificate. Contact the Brazilian Consulate in London for more information and advice.
