Terrorist attacks in Kyrgyzstan can’t be ruled out. Attacks could be indiscriminate, including in places visited by foreigners. There has been some terrorist activity and armed violence, particularly south and west of Osh. Security forces conducted several anti-terrorism operations in Bishkek in 2015. A suicide bomb attack against the Chinese Embassy on the outskirts of Bishkek on 30 August 2016 was reportedly carried out by the Turkestan Islamic Party.
You should maintain a high level of vigilance in public spaces and near to public buildings, and pay attention to any security announcements by the Kyrgyz authorities.
There’s a heightened threat of terrorist attack globally against UK interests and British nationals, from groups or individuals motivated by the conflict in Iraq and Syria. You should be vigilant at this time.
