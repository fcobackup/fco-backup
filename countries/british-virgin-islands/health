Before you travel, check that:
your destination can provide the healthcare you may need
you have appropriate travel insurance for local treatment or unexpected medical evacuation
This is particularly important if you have a health condition or are pregnant.
Emergency medical number
Call  911 and ask for an ambulance.
Contact your insurance or medical assistance company quickly if you’re referred to a medical facility for treatment.
For emergencies at sea call 767 to contact the Virgin Islands Search and Rescue (VISAR).
Vaccine recommendations and health risks
At least 8 weeks before your trip:
check the latest vaccine recommendations for the British Virgin Islands (BVI)
see where to get vaccines and whether you have to pay on the NHS travel vaccinations page
See what health risks you’ll face in the BVI, including:  
Zika virus
biting insects and ticks
dengue
Healthcare in the BVI
There is only one hospital in the BVI – the Dr D. Orlando Smith Hospital – and medical facilities are limited. Complex medical problems are often referred to hospitals in the US Virgin Islands, Puerto Rico, or mainland USA.
If you need medical evacuation to the US mainland and have no US visa, you will need special arrangements.  The US Electronic System for Travel Authorisation (ESTA) visa waiver programme does not automatically apply on one-off charter flights. Make sure you have travel health insurance and accessible funds to cover any possible costs.
