This advice reflects the UK government’s understanding of current rules for people travelling on a full ‘British citizen’ passport from the UK, for the most common types of travel.
The authorities in Andorra set and enforce entry rules. If you’re not sure how these requirements apply to you, contact the Andorra Ministry of Foreign Affairs.
COVID-19 rules
Countries may restrict travel or bring in rules at short notice. Check with your travel provider for changes.
If you test positive for COVID-19, you may need to stay where you are until you test negative. You may also need to get treatment there.
Read TravelHealthPro’s general COVID-19 advice for travellers.
Travel to Andorra
There are no COVID-19 testing or vaccination requirements for passengers entering Andorra.
Passport validity requirements
If you are travelling to an EU country (except Ireland), or Switzerland, Norway, Iceland, Liechtenstein, Andorra, Monaco, San Marino or Vatican City, you must follow the Schengen area passport requirements.
Your passport must:
have a ‘date of issue’ less than 10 years before the date you arrive. Passports issued after 1 October 2018 are now valid for only 10 years, but for passports issued before 1 October 2018, extra months may have been added if you renewed a passport early
have an ‘expiry date’ at least 3 months after the day you plan to leave
Although Andorra is not in the Schengen area, all travel to Andorra is through France or Spain. Contact the embassy of the country you are travelling through to reach Andorra if you think that your passport does not meet both these requirements. Renew your passport if you need to.
Check with your transport provider or travel company that your passport and other travel documents meet their requirements.
Travellers who arrive without a valid travel document, or a passport that has previously been reported lost or stolen, will be denied entry to Andorra.
Visa requirements
British nationals do not need a visa to visit Andorra. However, all travel to Andorra is through France or Spain. See FDCO’s travel advice for France and Spain, and information on visas from the Andorra Ministry of Foreign Affairs.
If you wish to stay in Andorra longer than 3 months, you must apply for a work or residence permit, in person in Andorra, through the Andorran government immigration department (in Catalan).
Travelling with children
Single parents or other adults travelling alone with children should bring a copy of any custody documents or written authorisation of the other parent.
Vaccination requirements (other than COVID-19)
At least 8 weeks before your trip, check the vaccinations and certificates you need in TravelHealthPro’s Andorra guide.
Accommodation
You will have to provide your passport details during your stay. Hotels and tourist apartments must register the names of all overnight guests with the police.
Customs rules
There are strict rules about goods that can be brought into and taken out of Andorra. You must declare anything that may be prohibited or subject to tax or duty.
Andorra is not a member of the EU. You may have to pay taxes and duties on tobacco, liquor and luxury goods when you re-enter France and Spain.
France and Spain have strict rules on the amount of tobacco exported from Andorra for personal use. Customs officers may impound excess amounts of tobacco and the vehicle transporting it.
