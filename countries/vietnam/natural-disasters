Tropical cyclones affect the eastern coastal regions. In addition to strong winds, the associated rainfall frequently leads to flooding and disruption to transport. The season normally runs from May to November, but tropical cyclones can occur outside this period. Monitor approaching storms on the National Center for Hydro-Meteorological Forecasting website and follow the advice of the local authorities, including any evacuation orders.
Vietnam has a tropical monsoon climate which produces large amounts of rain in short periods of time over and above rainfall associated with cyclones. Localised flooding, flash floods and landslides are common and care should be taken if trekking in rural and mountainous areas.
