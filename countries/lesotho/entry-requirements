Entry rules in response to coronavirus (COVID-19)
Entry to Lesotho
SAA Airlink flights between Maseru and Johannesburg Airport have resumed but with a very reduced timetable.
The border crossing points at Maseru Bridge, Caledonspoort (Butha Buthe), Maputsoe Bridge, Qacha’s Nek Bridge and Vanrooyens Gate (Mafeteng) are open for specific categories of traveller. Entry and exit is permitted for essential services and trade. The Lesotho government has announced that five additional categories of people will be permitted entry and exit from 1 October: business people, students, residents with permits to live and work outside Lesotho, the critically ill and people with special travel needs.
Movement of other persons in or out of Lesotho is still prohibited.
If you wish to enter or exit Lesotho, you’ll need a negative PCR COVID-19 test taken within 72 hours of travel. You should not use the NHS testing service to get a test in order to facilitate your travel to another country. You should arrange to take a private test.
Special regulations apply for truck drivers, Basotho students studying in South Africa and others who cross the border daily.
Basotho nationals and residents who exit Lesotho with a negative COVID-19 certificate will be permitted to re-enter within 7 days of the original test.
Transiting via South Africa
All visitors to Lesotho must travel through, or transit via, South Africa.
South Africa has put in place travel restrictions and visa requirements for individuals from countries affected by coronavirus, including the United Kingdom. Follow our travel advice for South Africa and consult your nearest South African High Commission.
Screening on arrival
Everyone entering Lesotho will be screened for coronavirus.
Individuals entering Lesotho must provide evidence of a negative PCR COVID-19 test, taken within 72 hours of travel.
You should comply with any additional screening measures.
Quarantine requirements
All individuals who have been in coronavirus-affected areas within the past 14 days, including the UK, are required to self-quarantine at their permanent or temporary place of residence for 14 days. This may be monitored by health officials. This self-isolation period may be required to take place in a government-nominated hotel at the visitor’s expense.
Anyone showing symptoms of coronavirus will be required to self -isolate at their permanent or temporary residence or may be placed in an isolation facility in a government hospital at their own expense.
Data collection
Anyone permitted to enter Lesotho will be required to provide details of where they will be staying during the compulsory quarantine.
If you need further information about entry requirements, contact the local immigration authorities or the nearest Lesotho High Commission.
