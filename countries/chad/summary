The FCO advise against all travel to the whole country.

The Foreign, Commonwealth & Development Office (FCDO) advises against all travel to Chad based on the current assessment of security risks given recent events.
The FCDO advises British nationals in Chad to leave the country as soon as possible. This change in the level of advice was prompted by an advance south west by armed rebel vehicles past the town of Faya, apparently heading towards N’Djamena.
On 20 April, the Chadian army announced the death of President Déby, increasing risk of instability in the capital N’Djamena and the wider country. The national curfew announced following the death of President Déby has now been modified, and is in place between 8pm and 5am. Land and air borders have now been reopened. You should exercise extra vigilance and caution, and avoid any demonstrations or large gatherings of people.
Consular support in Chad is provided remotely from the British High Commission in Cameroon. Other services of the UK Government Office in N’Djamena are temporarily suspended and all diplomatic staff have been withdrawn.
Commercial flights are the best way for you and your family to exit the country. We are working with airlines to confirm which flights are still operating.
British Nationals requiring consular assistance should phone + 237 222 22 07 96 or contact the FCDO on Help@fco.gov.uk. If you cannot reach us on this number, call +44 1908 516666 (if abroad) or +44 207 008 5000 (if in the UK). Consular officers are available 24/7 to assist with your enquiries.
On Sunday 11 April an armed convoy belonging to the rebel group “Le front pour l’alternance et la concorde au Tchad” (FACT) crossed into Chad from Libya, and engaged in fighting with government security forces. On Saturday 17 April, the rebel convoy moved south west, passing the town of Faya. The convoy appears to be heading towards the capital, N’Djamena. Additionally, a separate FACT convoy has been seen approaching the town of Mao from the north. See Safety and security
