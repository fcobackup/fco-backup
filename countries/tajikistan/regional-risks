This section has safety advice for regions of Tajikistan. It only covers regions where FCDO has specific advice.
You should also read FCDO’s overall travel advice and safety and security advice.  
Border crossings
Tajikistan’s borders with neighbouring countries can close without notice and some borders may not be open to foreign travellers.
Check with the Tajikistan authorities  before you travel to see which crossings are open.
Tajikistan-Kyrgyzstan border
There remains some risk of conflict over recognition of the border with Kyrgyzstan. There have been security incidents along the border including with exchanges of gunfire.  
In September 2022, armed conflict between the Kyrgyz and Tajik militaries resulted in over 100 deaths, including civilians. There was significant destruction of civilian property and infrastructure. Around 140,000 civilians were displaced. Do not walk off-road – there are both marked and unmarked minefields.
Tajikistan-Afghanistan border
Armed clashes or incursions by armed terrorist or criminal groups may occur without notice near the border with Afghanistan. Stay alert and be cautious in these areas. Do not walk off-road – there are both marked and unmarked minefields. Read information on terrorism.
Gorno-Badakhshan Autonomous Region
There is a risk of civil unrest in Khorog and other towns in the Gorno-Badakhshan Autonomous Region (GBAO). There were serious disturbances in 2021 and there have been violent clashes in and around Khorog since 2022 with casualties. There is an increased security presence. Some roads in Khorog, Rushan and other parts of Gorno-Badakhshan Autonomous Region are temporarily closed. The security situation can change at short notice, with the possibility of further unrest.
Border Guard patrols may ask to see your passport and GBAO permit when you travel in GBAO, particularly in areas close to the border with Afghanistan
If you’re travelling in the region, be alert in public places and check for security announcements by the local authorities.
Tavildara Region
Take local advice in the Tavildara Region of central Tajikistan, as there are minefields dating from the civil war in the mountains.
Medical and rescue facilities are unreliable where they exist at all.
