Although all scheduled international flights to and from Angola were suspended on 20 March, limited charter flight options to connect to the UK continue to become available on an ad-hoc basis (see Flights section below).
If you live in the UK and are currently visiting Angola you’re strongly advised to return now by commercial means. Don’t run the risk of getting stranded.
UK Government special charter flights will only operate for priority countries where commercial flights are not possible. You should not assume that these flights will become available in countries where commercial flights are operating.
