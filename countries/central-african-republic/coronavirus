Cases of coronavirus (COVID-19) have been confirmed in the Central African Republic (CAR). The CAR authorities have introduced a number of measures in response to the coronavirus pandemic. You should be prepared for additional screening measures or travel restrictions to be put into effect with little or no advance notice.
The CAR authorities have announced the following measures to reduce the spread of coronavirus. These include:
A mandatory 14-day self-quarantine for any person entering CAR coming from a location with local transmission of coronavirus;
Central Africans outside of CAR are recommended to postpone travel to CAR;
No handshakes or kissing, instead use non-contact greetings for social interactions;
No large gatherings;
Public spaces must have hand-washing stations;
Members of the government of CAR are banned from travelling to countries with local transmission;
Diplomatic missions, international organisations, and non-governmental organisations must comply with these measures. Airline companies must also cooperate with the government of CAR concerning quarantine and other measures necessary to manage the spread of coronavirus. The government of CAR has established a coronavirus hotline (French and Sango) – call 1212 if you have questions or to report possible exposure.
Further information on coronavirus, including advice on preparing for foreign travel and helping reduce the spread of the virus, is available from Public Health England and on the TravelHealthPro website.
