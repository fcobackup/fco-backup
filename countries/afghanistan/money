On 2 November 2021, there was an announcement banning the use of foreign currency in Afghanistan. This stated that payments need to be settled in the Afghan currency (the Afghani â€“ AFN).
There are frequent shortages of local currency. Credit cards are not widely accepted for payment. You should check with the supplier before goods and services are received.
Some ATMs and many banks continue to function, with restrictions on the levels of cash withdrawals. Customers should check with local branches. Some ATMs will accept foreign issued bank cards.
Some international money transfer services continue to operate in Afghanistan. However payouts will be made in local currency, even where the payee has requested this in foreign exchange.
Banks are closed on Fridays and queues at other times may be lengthy, with infrequent opening hours.
