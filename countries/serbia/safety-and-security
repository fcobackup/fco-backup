Terrorism
There is a high threat of terrorist attack globally affecting UK interests and British nationals, including from groups and individuals who view the UK and British nationals as targets. You should remain vigilant at all times.
UK Counter Terrorism Policing has information and advice on staying safe abroad and what to do in the event of a terrorist attack. Find out how to reduce your risk from terrorism while abroad.
Terrorism in Serbia
Terrorist attacks in Serbia can’t be ruled out.
There is a general threat from terrorism. There may be increased security in place over the festive period, including at Christmas markets and other major events that might attract large crowds. Remain vigilant and follow the advice of the local authorities.
Attacks could be indiscriminate, including in places visited by foreigners. Terrorists may target religious sites, including churches.
Political situation
There is the potential for disturbances in Belgrade and other towns and cities. There have been mass gatherings in Belgrade and other cities since May 2023. Further gatherings are planned. These can cause significant disruption, including to public transport. You should:
keep up to date with local developments
plan ahead to avoid disruption
avoid crowds or demonstrations to avoid injury
Crime
Protecting your belongings
Take sensible precautions to protect yourself from street crime, particularly in larger cities. Pickpockets work in tourist areas, airports, on public transport and at motorway petrol stations.
As a foreigner, criminals may assume you are carrying large amounts of cash. Four-wheel drive and luxury vehicles are also popular targets.
Some sporting events have had incidents of violence and petty crime. Report all incidents of crime to the local police and get a report.
Unexploded landmines and bombs
There is still some danger from unexploded landmines and bombs from the 1999 war in Kosovo and Serbia. Most of the affected areas are in the mountains to the north and east of Kosovo. Take special care in these areas and keep to marked roads.
Thick vegetation covers most of the dangerous areas. Do not touch anything suspicious and report it to the police.
Laws and cultural differences
Personal ID
It is a legal requirement to carry your passport (as a tourist) or ID card (as a resident) with you for identification purposes. Keep a copy separately in a safe place.
Illegal drugs and prison sentences
There are strict penalties for possessing and trafficking drugs, including long prison sentences.
Using cameras in secure areas
Taking photographs of military and police installations, personnel or vehicles anywhere in Serbia may lead to arrest or difficulties with the authorities.
LGBT+ travellers
Same-sex relationships are legal in Serbia, and there are anti-discrimination laws. There are LGBT+ friendly hostels, clubs and other events in Belgrade. However, the level of public prejudice against LGBT+ people is still relatively high. Be aware that showing affection in public could result in unwanted attention.
Read more advice for LGBT+ travellers.
Transport risks
Road travel
You need either a 1968 international driving permit (IDP) or a valid UK driving licence to drive in Serbia. The 1949 IDP is not accepted anymore. You cannot buy an IDP outside the UK, so get one before you travel.
You can drive with a UK driving licence or IDP for a series of short visits up to a year after you first entered Serbia, or for a single stay of up to 6 months. If you’re staying longer than 6 months, you must get a local licence.
If you are planning to drive in Serbia, see information on driving abroad and read the RAC Serbia guide.
The general standard of roads in Serbia varies widely. Roads are worse in rural areas, especially after bad weather. One particularly dangerous road is the Ibarska Magistrala (linking Belgrade, via Čačak and Užice, to Montenegro).
Dial 1987 for roadside assistance.
Taxis
You should only use registered taxis – look for a municipal registration number alongside the cab number. Instead of hailing a taxi, you can call one of the radio taxi phone numbers (most operators speak English). See information about taxis and public transport from the Belgrade tourism organisation.
Car hire
Many Serbian car hire firms will not allow you to drive their vehicles to Kosovo, Albania or Bulgaria because of security concerns. There have been some incidents where Serbian registered cars have been vandalised, or in some cases set on fire, in more isolated areas of Kosovo.
Bringing a vehicle into Serbia
If you are bringing a vehicle to Serbia, you must have vehicle registration and ownership documents and a locally valid insurance policy. European green card vehicle insurance is now valid in Serbia, but you no longer need to hold a green card. Confirm with your insurance company that your policy covers Serbia.
Contact the Serbian embassy in London if you have more detailed questions about bringing a vehicle to Serbia. The British embassy cannot help you if you arrive at the border without the correct documents.
Rail travel
Trains can be slow, particularly in winter when there are often long delays. On overnight trains, sleeping berths can be locked from the inside for safety. Each carriage has an attendant. Local police carry out random ID checks onboard trains in Serbia. Thieves operate on trains, so take particular care that documents and other valuables are safe.
Extreme weather and natural disasters
Forest fires
During especially hot and dry periods there is a danger of forest fires. Take care when visiting or driving through woodland areas. Make sure cigarette are properly extinguished and do not light barbecues.
Flooding
Parts of Serbia can flood after heavy rain. See flood warnings from the Serbian Hydrometeorological Service. If floods affect your area, follow the instructions of the Serbian authorities.
Earthquakes
Serbia lies in a seismically active zone, and earth tremors are common. Serious earthquakes are less frequent but can occur. The US Federal Emergency Management Agency has advice on what to before, during and after an earthquake.
