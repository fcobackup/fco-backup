Moving around in Slovenia
The Slovene government have declared that the coronavirus epidemic in Slovenia is over and have announced an easing of the measures that were put in place to restrict the spread of the virus. The requirement to follow social distancing measures remains in place. Further measures may follow at short notice.
Public spaces and services
The Slovene authorities have introduced a Red, Amber and Green rating system, to determine which Covid-prevention measures are in place within Slovenia. Within these ratings, there are different levels, for which different restrictions apply.
Movement between the ratings is determined by three criteria:
The number of cases per 100,000 over the previous 14 days.
The number of hospitalised patients.
The number of patients in Intensive Care Units.
The Slovene authorities review the status of anti-Covid measures on a weekly basis. You should therefore be prepared for the rules to change rapidly, and at short notice.
From 16 October, the government is ranking seven of Slovenia’s twelve statistical regions as RED:
Central Slovenia
Gorenjska
Koroška
Savinska
Posavska
Southeastern Slovenia
Zasavska
In these regions (which include the city of Ljubljana), the following rules will apply:
No travel between regions, except for essential business, caring for close family members or accessing essential services
Face masks must be worn in all public spaces at all times
No visits to care homes or hospitals
Closure of restaurants and bars
Closure of gym and sports facilities for recreational team sports
Beauty salons and hairdressers to serve one customer at a time
Total ban on all public events, except those already mandated by the National Public Health Authority (NIJZ)
Suspension of all non-essential hospital and dentist visits
The restrictions in Red regions outlined above are in addition to the measures that currently apply to Amber Regions.
The restrictions that apply to Amber regions are as follows:
Public and private gatherings will be limited to 10 people, with some exceptions for organised public events.
Restaurants and bars will limit the number of seating spaces and only serve food at tables. Restaurants must be closed from 10:30 to 6am
The number of people in indoor spaces will be limited by the size of the space.
There are no visits to care homes or hospitals.
In addition, in all cases protective masks (or other material covering the nose and mouth) must be worn in indoor public areas, on public transport and in busy public outdoor spaces such as high streets, where maintaining social distance is not possible.
Public transport (buses and trains) is running. You are required to wear a protective mask, sanitise your hands with the supplied hand sanitiser and maintain a safety distance of at least 1.5m.
Wherever possible, tickets should be bought in advance (online, ticket machines and at sales counters). Taxi services continue to be available.
