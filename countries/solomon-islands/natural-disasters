Solomon Islands is a part of the ’Ring of Fire’ that surrounds the basin of the Pacific Ocean; earthquakes, tsunamis and volcanic activity can occur at any time.
Sometimes localised tsunamis are caused by larger undersea earthquakes. The Solomon Islands authorities are responsible for providing tsunami warnings and alerts, usually through radio broadcasts. You can get up to date information from the U.S Tsunami Warning System.
The tropical cyclone season normally runs from November to May. You should monitor local and international weather updates from the  World Meteorological Organisation and Solomon Islands Meteorological Service.
Heavy rain and flooding can affect Solomon Islands. Bridges are often washed away as a result. Check local weather forecasts and take care if you are travelling during the tropical cyclone season.
