The information on this page covers the most common types of travel and reflects the UK government’s understanding of the rules currently in place. Unless otherwise stated, this information is for travellers using a full ‘British Citizen’ passport.
The authorities in the country or territory you’re travelling to are responsible for setting and enforcing the rules for entry. If you’re unclear about any aspect of the entry requirements, or you need further reassurance, you’ll need to contact the embassy, high commission or consulate of the country or territory you’re travelling to.
You should also consider checking with your transport provider or travel company to make sure your passport and other travel documents meet their requirements.
Entry rules in response to coronavirus
Entry to Cuba
Entry requirements may be subject to change at short notice. You should also check requirements with your airline.
From 6 April 2022, there will be no requirement for travellers arriving from the UK for either a COVID-19 vaccination certificate or a negative COVID-19 test.
All travellers are required to complete a Health Declaration (Declaracíon Jurada de Sanidad) online before travel.
Screening and quarantine
Visitors are no longer required to routinely self-isolate or take a PCR test on arrival in Cuba, but sanitary authorities are present at the airport and will carry out random PCR tests. Anyone testing positive on arrival will be moved to quarantine in a designated government health centre, at their own expense. Direct contacts of those testing positive will either be moved to a designated government health centre or allowed to self-isolate in their own accommodation depending on their circumstances. Foreign arrivals registered with international schools, those with scholarships at Cuban institutions, technicians and other foreign collaborators will be required to do 8 days’ quarantine at the relevant quarantine centre linked to their institution, and will take a PCR test on the seventh day after their arrival.
Regular entry requirements
Visas
If you’re entering Cuba as a tourist, you’ll need to get a tourist card before you travel. You can apply online on the visascuba website or check with your travel agent or tour operator.
For more information and advice about visas, contact the Cuban Embassy.
If you’re a dual national, you should contact the Cuban Embassy for advice on entry requirements before you travel.
Passport validity
Your passport should be valid for at least two months after your departure date from Cuba.
Customs regulations
Some electrical items with heavy power consumption may be confiscated on entry to Cuba. Global Positioning Systems (GPS) are also subject to import requirements and may be confiscated. Confiscated items are normally returned on departure.
Mobile telephones, tablets and laptops can be taken to Cuba, but any inbuilt GPS should be disconnected or disabled. For more information on Cuban customs regulations, including a list of prohibited and regulated items, visit the Cuban Customs Administration website.
Cuban regulations allow a maximum of two pieces of checked in luggage per person, each to a maximum weight of 32kgs. Passengers should confirm their luggage allowance, which may be more restrictive than this, and excess baggage charges with their airline.
Travelling to Cuba from the USA
US law does not permit travel directly from the USA to Cuba for tourism purposes. The law applies to US nationals and all foreign nationals who are either resident in the USA, or travelling through the USA en route to Cuba. UK nationals travelling on direct flights between the UK and Cuba, or via other countries, are unaffected by this US legislation.
Under certain conditions, travel is permitted from the USA to Cuba, including on the direct flights which operate between the two countries. Everybody travelling on these routes (both US citizens and foreign nationals) will need to comply with US law and travel for one of 12 permitted reasons/categories of travel. Tourism isn’t one of these 12 permitted reasons/categories. For more information see the US Department of the Treasury website and the US State Department’s travel advice for Cuba. For travel-specific questions, see the Code of Federal Regulations 31 C.F.R. 515.560 and the US Treasury’s Office of Foreign Assets Control (OFAC) frequently asked questions.
