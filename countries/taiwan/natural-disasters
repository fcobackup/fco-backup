Tropical cyclones
The tropical cyclone (typhoon) season in Taiwan normally runs from May to November, sometimes resulting in local flooding and landslides.
Listen to Typhoon Alerts on ICRT, BCC and PRS radio stations, or alternatively monitor the websites of the Japan Meteorological Agency, Taiwan Central Weather Bureau, ICRT and DGPA (Announcement of Office and School Closures in Taiwan).
There’s a risk of road blockages and landslides following typhoons, especially in central and southern Taiwan. Check the Central Weather Bureau website and the Directorate General of Highways website before travelling.
See our tropical cyclones page for advice about how to prepare effectively and what to do if you’re likely to be affected by a hurricane or tropical cyclone.
Earthquakes
Earthquakes do occur in Taiwan. The US Federal Emergency Management Agency website has advice about what to do before, during and after an earthquake.
