The Foreign and Commonwealth Office (FCO) advise against all travel to western and central Mindanao and the Sulu archipelago because of terrorist activity and clashes between the military and insurgent groups. The FCO advise against all but essential travel to the remainder of Mindanao (excluding Camiguin, Dinagat and Siargao Islands) due to the threat of terrorism.
Typhoon Kammuri has made land fall in Luzon and is expected to continue to affect the Philippines until 4 December (although prevailing conditions may shorten or extend this time period). You should monitor local media and the Philippines Disaster Risk Reduction and Management Council for the latest updates. Many transport links are severely affected. Flights from Manila airports have been disrupted and there have been flight cancellations. You should check with your travel company before you travel.See Natural disasters
Terrorists are very likely to try to carry out attacks in the Philippines. Terrorist groups have the intent and capability to carry out attacks at any time and anywhere in the country, including in the capital Manila and in places visited by foreigners, such as airports, shopping malls, public transport, including the metro system, and places of worship. Attacks have been carried out using small arms and improvised explosive devices including both vehicle and personnel borne. You should remain vigilant at all times and report anything suspicious to the local authorities.
It’s likely that terrorist groups continue to plan kidnap operations against western nationals in the Philippines, both on land and at sea, but this is particularly acute in Mindanao and the Sulu archipelago. See Terrorism
Martial law is in place across the whole of Mindanao until 31 December 2019. Monitor media reporting and follow the instructions of local authorities. A ‘state of national emergency on account of lawless violence’ remains in place across the rest of the country. Expect random checkpoints, security patrols and a more visible routine security presence. You should co-operate with the Philippine authorities and allow extra time to pass through security checks. Make sure you carry a form of identification with you.
