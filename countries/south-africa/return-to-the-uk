British Government special flights
From 9 April, the British Government in partnership with Virgin Atlantic will operate special flights from Johannesburg and Cape Town for British travellers to South Africa to return to the UK.
The cost of the flight is £855.43 per person from Cape Town and £655.50 per person from Johannesburg.
To be eligible to take this flight, you must be normally resident in the UK. Eligibility, including your address in UK, will be checked before tickets are issued.
Direct dependents of British travellers are eligible for a space on the flight, providing they are normally resident in the UK.

If you are unable to complete this online form and want to return to the UK from Johannesburg, please send a SMS text message with your full name to +44 7537 416 124 and someone from our team will get in touch to assist you. Some international charges may apply.
If you wish to travel from Cape Town, book here.

Tickets will not be on sale at the airport. Do not travel to the airport. To make a booking, you will need:
full passport and contact details for each traveller you are registering
your UK home address and postcode
your means of payment, such as credit or debit card details
What to do after booking your ticket
We will arrange assembly points where British nationals will meet and then be escorted to the airport.
After you book your ticket you will receive an email explaining where your assembly point is and how you should get there. There will be a contact number for anyone requiring additional assistance.
South Africa is in lockdown from 27 March to 30 April and you should continue to comply, with the exception of travelling to an assembly point immediately before your flight. You should not travel to an airport during this period, as no commercial flights are available. You should not go to an assembly point without a flight ticket.
Future options
The South African authorities have not confirmed when commercial flights will start again, so we strongly recommend travelling on one of the special charter flights if you need to return to the UK soon.
Accommodation
Those hotels which still have international guests should remain open until their guests are able to leave South Africa. You should ensure you have accommodation for the duration of the lock down, or until you have a confirmed ticket on a special charter flight.
We have published a list of hotels that have told us they can accept British people. We will keep this list up to date.
You can also ring a national hotline: +27 (0)800 029 999 to speak to a professional who will assess your individual need and advise on next steps.
If you are staying in the Western Cape, you can contact the Western Cape provincial government who may be able to assist in identifying new accommodation, using the following numbers:
Cape Town, Overberg and Winelands and West Coast – +27 (0)82 554 2010
Garden Route and Karoo - +27(0)82 972 2507

Restrictions during the lockdown
All ‘non-essential domestic travel’ is prohibited during this period. Internal flights stopped from midnight on 26 March and public transport is not operating.
Land borders to neighbouring countries have been closed to crossings, except for goods trade.
Port entry for UK visitors is banned. Cruise liners and smaller leisure vessels are not permitted to dock in South African ports. If you are booked onto a cruise scheduled to stop in South Africa, you should speak to your operator or travel agent.
