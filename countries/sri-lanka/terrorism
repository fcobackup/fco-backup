Terrorists are very likely to try to carry out attacks in Sri Lanka. Attacks could be indiscriminate, including in places visited by foreigners.
On 21 April 2019, bombs were used to attack three churches and three hotels in Sri Lanka, in central Colombo; in the northern suburb of Colombo Kochchikade, and in Negombo roughly twenty miles north of Colombo; and in the east of the country in Batticaloa. More than 250 people were killed including 8 British nationals.
Security has been stepped up across the island and a State of Emergency remains in place. The Sri Lankan authorities have made a number of arrests in relation to the attacks, and some security operations are ongoing.
Avoid crowded public places, large gatherings and demonstrations, and follow the advice of local authorities. All of the attacks on 21 April 2019 were carried out either in places of worship or in places where foreign visitors were affected. Any further attacks may be targeted against similar locations.
Thereâ€™s a heightened threat of terrorist attack globally against UK interests and British nationals, from groups or individuals motivated by the conflict in Iraq and Syria. You should be vigilant at this time.
