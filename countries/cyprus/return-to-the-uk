There are currently extremely limited, indirect commercial options available to return to the UK from Cyprus due to the near complete ban on flights to and from Cyprus from 21 March until 30 April. Although a very limited number of commercial flights are still able to leave Cyprus, only humanitarian and cargo flights may arrive.
The Cyprus government is organising repatriation flights from European hubs.
The first flight departed from Larnaca to London Heathrow on 9 April.
A second Cyprus Airways flight will depart Larnaca for London Heathrow on 15 April at 10.20am. Bookings can be made online.
There may be further Cyprus-government repatriation flights, which could be announced at short notice. Please follow @UKinCyprus social media channels on Facebook and Twitter for future updates.
We know this is concerning for British people trying to leave Cyprus. The UK government is working closely with airlines, the Cypriot authorities and other governments to make sure options are available for you to return to the UK as soon as possible.
There are currently no flights between Turkey and the north of Cyprus until at least 1 May.
What to do
If you cannot leave Cyprus at this time, you should:
follow the advice of local authorities, including local measures to help minimise your risk of exposure to coronavirus.
find accommodation that’s suitable for your needs. Although hotel accommodation is closed, many private villas remain open. Consult the usual booking websites.
keep in regular contact with family and friends at home, so they know you are safe and well

Future travel options
The British High Commission in Nicosia is issuing regular updates on Twitter and Facebook with the latest available information on departure options from Cyprus.

You will need to pay for your return travel to the UK. If departure options are available but you cannot afford the travel costs and have exhausted all other options for getting funds, you may be eligible to apply for an emergency loan from the government. This is a last resort option and you would need to repay the loan when you are back in the UK. For more information, you should contact Corporate Travel Management (CTM). CTM are a commercial partner of the FCO and are authorised to administer such loans on behalf of the FCO.
Arrival in the UK
When you arrive back in the UK, follow the guidance for when you return to the UK on steps you should take to protect yourself and others.
Help and support
If you’re abroad and you need emergency help from the UK government, contact the nearest British embassy, consulate or high commission.
The High Commission cannot provide further information or advice about departure options over the phone. Please follow @UKinCyprus social media channels on Facebook and Twitter for future updates. To get the latest information, sign up for travel advice email alerts.
