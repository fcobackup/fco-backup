There are currently no regularly scheduled commercial options available to return to the UK from Morocco.
We know this is concerning for British people trying to leave Morocco. The UK government is working closely with airlines, the Moroccan authorities and other governments to make sure options are available for you to return to the UK as soon as possible.
If you cannot leave Morocco at this time, see advice on staying in Morocco during coronavirus.

Help and support
You will need to pay for your return travel to the UK. If departure options are available but you cannot afford the travel costs and have exhausted all other options for getting funds, you may be eligible to apply for an emergency loan from the government. This is a last resort option and you would need to repay the loan when you are back in the UK. For more information, please email the British Embassy in Rabat at morocco.britishsupport@fco.gov.uk.
