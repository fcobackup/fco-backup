Air travel
All international flights into Bangkok, are currently suspended until 31 May 2020 at 1700 UTC. You should check any future bookings with your airline.
Flights via China will not be permitted in the near future, as China has effectively stopped non-Chinese nationals from entering the country. You should check with the airline for the latest information on transit arrangements in China. You should also monitor our China travel advice for updates.
You should keep checking airline websites for the latest information, and to book any available flights directly. Not all third party providers will have up to date information for new flight options.
You will need to pay for your return travel to the UK. If departure options are available but you cannot afford the travel costs and have exhausted all other options for getting funds, you may be eligible to apply for an emergency loan from the government. This is a last resort option and you would need to repay the loan when you are back in the UK. For more information, you should contact Corporate Travel Management (CTM). CTM are a commercial partner of the FCO and are authorised to administer such loans on behalf of the FCO.
