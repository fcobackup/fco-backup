Find out more about why FCDO advises against travel.
Enga Province
Following wide-spread intercommunal violence in Wapenamanda area of Enga Province, the provincial government has declared all districts except Wabag District, which remains relatively safe, as ‘fighting zones’.  The authorities report deaths, destruction of property, and the closure of public services.  Checkpoints, random searches, and curfews have been introduced.
