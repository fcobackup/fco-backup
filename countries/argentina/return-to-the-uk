Travelling to the airport
You can travel from your accommodation to the airport if you have a valid plane ticket and are not showing any symptoms of coronavirus.
Regular domestic flights within Argentina are suspended until 1 September and all scheduled long distance trains and buses are suspended until midnight on 16 August. There may be other options for travelling overland, such as taking a taxi or hiring a car, but you are only permitted to travel to Buenos Aires if you have a valid ticket for an international flight which departs within 24 hours of your arrival. Please also note that vehicles are unable to stop overnight so there must be a minimum of two drivers for long journeys.
If you need to spend a night in Buenos Aires, you will need to find accommodation to meet the requirements of the nationwide quarantine, which prohibits you from leaving your accommodation without justification. See Moving around in Argentina
If you are planning to travel overland to Buenos Aires, you will need:
a copy of the letter issued by the Ministry of Health confirming that foreign nationals travelling to return to their country of origin are exempt from the nationwide quarantine rules
a letter issued from the British Embassy confirming that you should be allowed to travel.
proof that you have a confirmed international flight departing within 24 hours of your arrival in Buenos Aires.
possible additional permissions depending on your route and means of travel. Please check this with the British Embassy, as far in advance of your departure as possible, by emailing returnfrom.argentina@fco.gov.uk with details of your planned journey.
If you are being driven, your drivers must also have the relevant permits allowing them to make the journey.
Your journey home: re-entering the UK
When you return, you must follow the rules for entering the UK. You:
need to provide your journey and contact details up to 48 hours before you’re due to arrive in the UK
are not allowed to leave the place you’re staying for the first 14 days you’re in the UK except in very limited situations (known as ‘self-isolating’)
See also the list of people who are exempt from the border rules.
The National Travel Health Network and Centre (NaTHNaC) also provides advice on how to stay safe as you travel by air.
Finance
If departure options are available but you cannot afford the travel costs and have exhausted all other options for getting funds, you may be eligible to apply for an emergency loan from the government. You can only apply if you normally live in the UK. This is a last resort option and you would need to repay the loan when you are back in the UK.
