The information on this page covers the most common types of travel and reflects the UK government’s understanding of the rules currently in place. Unless otherwise stated, this information is for travellers using a full ‘British Citizen’ passport.
The authorities in the country or territory you are travelling to are responsible for setting and enforcing the rules for entry. If you’re unclear about any aspect of the entry requirements, or you need further reassurance, you’ll need to contact the embassy, high commission or consulate of the country or territory you’re travelling to.
You should also consider checking with your transport provider or travel company to make sure your passport and other travel documents meet their requirements.
Entry rules in response to coronavirus (COVID-19)
St Lucia’s border re-opened on 4 June.
Testing and Quarantine requirements on arrival
All travellers must complete a Pre-Arrival registration form prior to arrival to St Lucia which can be found on the St Lucia COVID-19 page. Reservations for either a Government operated quarantine facility or a COVID-19 certified property must be confirmed before travel.
Pre-testing prior to travel is now mandatory. All travellers must provide certified proof of a negative PCR (Polymerase Chain Reaction) COVID-19 test taken five days or less before travel to St Lucia. Passengers will be refused boarding if they do not have proof of a negative test. You will need to check with an accredited healthcare provider in the UK or your country you are travelling from for PCR testing options. You should not use the NHS testing service to get a test in order to facilitate your travel to another country. You should arrange to take a private test.
All arriving passengers will be screened, including temperature checks, at the airport. All passengers will advance through immigration, baggage claim, customs and, except those from the Travel Bubble, arrivals for transportation to their COVID-19 certified property or Government operated quarantine facility.
Quarantine requirements
All returning residents are required to quarantine for 14 days at a Government operated quarantine facility or a COVID-19 certified property.
All international visitors must stay at a COVID-certified property for 14 days.
Any symptomatic passengers will be isolated and tested and required to remain in quarantine/isolation at your hotel or Government operated quarantine facility until the test result is obtained. If the test is positive all visitors and nationals will be transferred to a treatment facility until they receive two negative test results and are clinically stable.
Demonstrating your COVID-19 vaccination status
If you live in England, Saint Lucia will accept the NHS app or your NHS letter to demonstrate your COVID-19 vaccination status. You cannot use a handwritten NHS COVID card as proof of vaccination for travel purposes.
