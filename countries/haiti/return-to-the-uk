British Nationals are currently able to travel to the UK via the United States and Canada from Haiti, providing they hold a valid ESTA (US) or ETA (Canada). You should consult the ESTA and ETA pages to check individual eligibility. Passengers must have an onward ticket to the UK in order to transit either country. This ticket must be for a flight departing from the same airport as entry and leave no more than 24 hours after arrival. If travelling via the US, passengers must not have been physically present in Europe, China or Iran in the past 14 days. To check available routes, please consult with airlines, travel providers or flight tracking websites and applications, such as Flightradar24, which provide live flight statuses. Please then contact a relevant airline to make a booking. Carriers reserve the right to deny boarding to any individual exhibiting symptoms of coronavirus.
