Coronavirus: stay up to date
Cases of coronavirus (COVID-19) have been confirmed in Taiwan. See information on measures introduced in Taiwan to limit the spread of the virus. Find out how to return to the UK from Taiwan.
See coronavirus travel advice for guidance on international travel.
Sign up for email alerts for Taiwan travel advice.
There are over 60,000 visits to Taiwan by British nationals annually. Most visits are trouble-free.
The UK does not recognise Taiwan as a state and has no diplomatic relations with Taiwan, so limited consular services are available to British nationals. See Consular assistance
Crime levels are low, but small-scale petty crime does exist. You should maintain at least the same level of vigilance as you would at home, and take sensible precautions. See Crime
There has been a significant increase in cases of dengue fever. See Health
You should not enter Taiwan with animal products without prior authorisation as those caught smuggling products may face heavy fines. See Customs regulations
Although there’s no recent history of terrorism in Taiwan, attacks can’t be ruled out. See Terrorism
Take out comprehensive travel and medical insurance before you travel.
You can contact the emergency services by calling 110 (police) or 119 (ambulance and fire).
If you’re abroad and you need emergency help from the UK government, contact the nearest British embassy, consulate or high commission.
