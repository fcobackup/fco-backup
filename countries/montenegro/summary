The Foreign, Commonwealth & Development Office (FCDO) advises against all but essential travel to:
The whole of Montenegro based on the current assessment of COVID-19 risks.
Travel to Montenegro is subject to entry restrictions
Visitors travelling from most countries, including the UK, require a negative PCR test, or rapid antigen test (recommended by the European Commission) or a positive serology test on IgC antibodies to enter Montenegro.
Montenegrin citizens and holders of Montenegrin residence permits can enter Montenegro without such a test but will be required to self-isolate or quarantine for 14 days.
If you notice symptoms of a respiratory infection you must follow the guidelines of the Institute of Public Health, which include contacting a local epidemiological service. The guidance and contact details of epidemiological services are available in English from the Institute of Public Health.
