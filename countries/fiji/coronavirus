International travel
Fiji’s international border reopened to fully vaccinated visitors on 1 December 2021. From 5 September 2022, persons arriving in Fiji no longer require a pre-booked COVID-19 test. For full information see ‘Entry Requirements’ .
The Fijian Government website has more information on entry conditions. All foreign passport holders must have medical travel insurance with international cover for COVID-19.
You should carefully check requirements relating your country of departure, transit points and airline or other method of transport.
If you are based in Fiji, wish to travel internationally and have been vaccinated under Fiji’s vaccination campaign, you may require a COVID-19 Vaccination Certificate. See the section below on COVID-19 vaccines if you live in Fiji for more information.

Be prepared for your plans to change
No travel is risk-free during COVID-19. Countries may further restrict travel or bring in new rules at short notice, for example due to a new COVID-19 variant. Check with your travel company or airline for any transport changes which may delay your journey home.
If you test positive for COVID-19, you may need to stay where you are until you test negative. You may also need to seek treatment there.
Plan ahead and make sure you:
can access money
understand what your insurance will cover
can make arrangements to extend your stay and be away for longer than planned
Travel in Fiji
Although travel restrictions have been eased within Fiji, please ensure you check the latest rules carefully when making travel plans. More information on the latest restrictions are available on the Fiji government website.
Public places and services
Following the lifting of the majority of COVID-19 restrictions in October 2021, many businesses and public places have reopened.
The Government of Fiji has introduced regulations that require all workers in both the public and private sector to obtain a COVID-19 vaccination. Although formal requirements to check proof of vaccination have now eased you may be asked for proof of vaccination when entering businesses, including restaurants, bars and hotels.
