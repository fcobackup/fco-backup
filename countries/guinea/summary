Following the violent protests in Conakry and throughout Guinea during the week of 13 January the National Front for the Defence of the Constitution (FNDC) announced that regular demonstrations would continue from Tuesday 21 January. The FNDC have made further announcements since. There have been weekly demonstrations across Conakry and in other towns throughout Guinea, leading to significant travel disruption and a number of violent incidents including deaths. You should remain vigilant, particularly for spontaneous demonstrations, stay clear of areas where demonstrators are gathering and monitor local media. The recent protests in Middle Guinea have led to several public buildings being ransacked and set on fire and increased criminal activity. We advise essential travel only to Middle Guinea including Labé, Pita and Dalaba.
