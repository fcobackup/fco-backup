Face coverings
On mainland Portugal and in the autonomous regions of Madeira and the Azores, you must wear a face mask in all enclosed spaces. You should wear your face covering when you enter the building and keep it on until you leave.
On mainland Portugal and in the Azores, you must also wear a face mask outdoors where it is not possible to maintain a 2m social distance from people outside your family group. In Madeira and Porto Santo, the use of a face mask outdoors is mandatory, except when driving, exercising, while on the beach or walking the recommended routes in forest and mountain areas.
These measures apply to everyone over the age of 10 on mainland Portugal and in the Azores, and over the age of 5 in Madeira and Porto Santo.
You can be fined if you breach the regulations.
You may be exempt from using a face mask both indoors and out on medical grounds. You will have to show a declaration from your doctor as evidence that you have a health condition that prevents you from wearing a face covering. You should observe strict social distancing and limit the time you spend in common areas in enclosed spaces. For further information (in Portuguese) on exemptions, see decree-law 24-A/2020 (Article 13 a and b).

Healthcare in Portugal

RT-PCR COVID-19 tests are carried out free-of-charge if you have a prescription issued by a national health service doctor. NHS testing is carried out at hospitals and laboratories by appointment.
If you need a COVID-19 test in order to travel, you should arrange to take a private test. Check when you book that the testing service can provide the appropriate COVID-19 test for your destination. You will not need a prescription, but you will have to show your passport and confirmed travel bookings. You will have to pay for the test in full. If you have health or travel insurance, check whether it will cover any expense you incur.
You will need to go to a pharmacy to get most medicines, though some non-prescription medication is sold at health stores in supermarkets and shopping centres. Pharmacies are widely available and are identified with a green cross. Find a pharmacy near you on the Pharmacy Association website.
If you have a UK prescription, take it to a pharmacy and ask the pharmacist whether they can dispense your medication for you. Remember the pharmacist will have to apply national rules so may not be able to give you the same strength or dosage. Some medicines may not be available or may not be authorised for sale in Portugal.
If you need a repeat prescription, go to the nearest health centre or hospital A&E.
