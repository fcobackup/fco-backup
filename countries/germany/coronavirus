Public spaces and services
Until at least 7 March there will be a range of restrictions on social contact in Germany, aimed at reducing the spread of COVID-19:
private gatherings are restricted to one household plus one individual from another household
non-essential shops are closed. Shops selling food and healthcare products will remain open
personal care service providers such, as tattoo and massage parlours are closed. Barbers and hairdressers will open from 1 March. Physiotherapy and similar services are open
employers are legally obliged to allow employees to work from home, where their work activities allow, until 15 March
restaurants will be able to provide a takeaway service, but the consumption of alcohol in public is banned
services at churches, mosques and synagogues continue to be allowed as long as 1.5m distancing is maintained, mouth-nose coverings are worn and singing is banned
in some parts of Germany, local travel restrictions are in place and individuals cannot leave a 15km radius of their place of residence (meaning a village, town or city rather than a home)
Schools and nurseries are gradually being opened in February
Medical grade masks are compulsory in shops and public transport, replacing a previous requirement for simple mouth-nose coverings. Whereas Bavaria requires FFP-2 masks, other states permit a disposable surgical mask. You should follow local guidance. These restrictions are the minimum and are implemented by Germanyâ€™s 16 states. The rules may vary so check the latest local guidance (in German). There are a variety of sources in English.
These measures will next be reviewed on 3 March.

COVID-19 vaccines if you live in Germany
Wherever possible British nationals should aim to be vaccinated in the country where they live. As further information is available about the national vaccination programme, this page will be updated. Sign up to get email notifications.
The German health authorities have issued an ordinance setting out how the vaccine will be distributed and administered. All citizens normally resident in Germany that are covered by state or private health insurance will be offered a vaccination according to the rules on prioritisation. British nationals resident in Germany should consult their state authorities for more information on local arrangements.
The Medicines and Healthcare Products Regulatory Agency (MHRA) is the UK authority responsible for assessing the safety, quality and efficacy of vaccines. It has authorised the Pfizer/BioNTech, Oxford/AstraZeneca and Moderna vaccines for temporary supply and use in the UK. Find out more about MHRA approval for these vaccines.
British nationals living overseas should seek medical advice from their local healthcare provider in the country where they reside. Information about vaccines used in other national programmes, including regulatory status, should be available from the local authorities. This list of Stringent Regulatory Authorities recognised by the World Health Organisation may also be a useful source of additional information. Find out more information about the COVID-19 vaccines on the World Health Organization COVID-19 vaccines page.
