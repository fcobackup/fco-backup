The information on this page covers the most common types of travel and reflects the UK government’s understanding of the rules currently in place. Unless otherwise stated, this information is for travellers using a full ‘British Citizen’ passport.
The authorities in the country or territory you’re travelling to are responsible for setting and enforcing the rules for entry. If you’re unclear about any aspect of the entry requirements, or you need further reassurance, you’ll need to contact the embassy, high commission or consulate of the country or territory you’re travelling to.
You should also consider checking with your transport provider or travel company to make sure your passport and other travel documents meet their requirements.
Entry rules in response to coronavirus (COVID-19)
Entry to Cyprus
Tourist arrivals from a limited number of countries are now permitted, but this does not include the UK.
Passengers who have been in the UK, or any other destination not listed in categories A or B, in the last 14 days will not be allowed to enter Cyprus, even via a third country (eg: Greece), until further notice. The Republic of Cyprus government have indicated that this may change from 1 August. You should continue to track developments through the Republic of Cyprus Information Office.
The exception to this is legal residents of Cyprus and Cypriot ID holders who will be permitted to enter Cyprus on presentation of proof of residence or Cypriot nationality and a negative PCR COVID-19 test result (taken in the 72 hours before departure).
If you’re a British national travelling from a category A country you will be allowed to enter Cyprus. If you’re a British national travelling from a Category B country, and have not been in the UK (or any other Category C country) in the last 14 days, you will also be allowed to enter Cyprus with a negative PCR test result (taken in the previous 72 hours).
Further details are available from the Republic of Cyprus Information Office. If eligible to travel, you should make sure that you complete your Cyprus Flight Pass before travelling, available on the Cyprus Flight Pass website.
The authorities in the north of Cyprus are allowing entry to ‘citizens’ and foreign nationals who hold residency, work or student permits. Any UK national will be permitted entry from 1 July but will still be required to present a negative PCR test result (taken in the previous 72 hours) and go into quarantine for 14 days at their own expense.
Neighbouring countries have also introduced restrictions which may impact on your travel plans. Check country-specific FCO Travel Advice for details.
Regular entry requirements
Visas
If you hold a British Citizen passport, you don’t need a visa to enter Cyprus. If you’re planning a stay of longer than 3 months, see our Living in Cyprus guide and contact the Republic of Cyprus High Commission if you have further questions.
The rules on travel to and from the Republic of Cyprus, including travel to or from the north, will stay the same until 31 December 2020.
For more information on crossing to and from the north of Cyprus, see Local travel
If you’re a resident in Cyprus, you are advised to carry your Republic of Cyprus-issued residency documents when entering/exiting the Republic of Cyprus.
The Republic of Cyprus does not recognise the self-declared ‘Turkish Republic of Northern Cyprus’ in the north of Cyprus, nor residence permits issued by the administration there.
Passport validity
Your passport should be valid for the proposed duration of your stay; you do not need any additional period of validity on your passport beyond this. However, if you’re travelling to the north of Cyprus, their administration advises that your passport should be valid for at least 6 months from your date of entry to the north.
The rules on travel will stay the same until 31 December 2020.
UK Emergency Travel Documents
UK Emergency Travel Documents (ETDs) are accepted for entry, airside transit and exit from Cyprus.
