The Foreign and Commonwealth Office advise against all but essential travel to Bolivia. If you’re in Bolivia, you should keep your departure options under review.
If you need urgent consular assistance, contact the British Embassy La Paz on (591 2) 2433424. The British Embassy’s ability to travel to deliver consular services is very limited at this time.
The political and security situation is very uncertain across Bolivia following the resignation of the President and senior public officials on 10 November, following an extended and ongoing period of wide-scale political demonstrations and civil unrest across the country since disputed elections in October 2019. Many demonstrations have resulted in violence, including in some cases the deaths of protesters, in La Paz city centre and other major towns and cities. Further protests are likely to occur at short notice and may turn violent without warning. You should continue to avoid large crowds and public demonstrations, don’t attempt to cross blockades, and pay close attention to developments via local media and this travel advice.
There has been disruption to flights and access to airports in recent weeks, particularly at El Alto airport in La Paz, and increased levels of disruption are possible. If you’re planning to travel to or from El Alto airport, contact your airline or travel company for the latest information before you leave for the airport and check with the authorities on arrival that ground transport is functioning normally before leaving the terminal.
You should avoid inter-city travel by road wherever possible. There have been several attacks against inter-city buses and emergency services have limited capacity to respond in these areas. If you decide to travel within Bolivia, you should plan your travel carefully, regularly check the viability of your plans and be prepared to change them at short notice. Transport options are extremely limited, road journeys and land border crossings may take a lot longer than planned, and there may be disruption to supply of goods in parts of the country. Land borders are subject to closure at short notice.
