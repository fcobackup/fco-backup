Entry and borders
See Entry requirements to find out what you will need to do when you arrive in Germany.
Be prepared for your plans to change
No travel is risk-free during COVID-19. Countries may further restrict travel or bring in new rules at short notice, for example due to a new COVID-19 variant. Check with your travel company or airline for any transport changes which may delay your journey home.
If you test positive for COVID-19, you may need to stay where you are until you test negative. You may also need to seek treatment there.
Plan ahead and make sure you:
can access money
understand what your insurance will cover
can make arrangements to extend your stay and be away for longer than planned
Public spaces and services
Medical grade masks, usually FFP-2 masks, are still legally required in health and social care settings. Public transport may still have signs indicating mandatory mask wearing but these are no longer valid.
If travellers develop symptoms associated with COVID-19 (coughing, a runny nose, sore throat or fever) they should get in touch by phone with a doctor or contact the hotline 116 117. Often travel guides or hotels can also help in such cases.
Guidance from the Federal Health Ministry is available.
Testing positive for COVID-19 in Germany
Most German States have ended the requirement for those testing positive for COVID-19 to self isolate, though Berlin and Brandenburg will still require self-isolation until 13 February and Mecklenburg Western Pomerania until late February or early March. Mandatory self-isolation lasts at least five days and can only end if an individual is symptom free for 48 hours. From the sixth day, individuals can take a self-test and end self-isolation if they test negative.
The local health office (Gesundheitsamt) is responsible for monitoring self-isolation and will provide further guidance in individual cases. You can find your local health office by postcode.
The Federal Health Ministry provides further guidance on self-isolation.
