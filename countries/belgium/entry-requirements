This page has information on travelling to Belgium. Check what you must do to return to the UK.
This page reflects the UK government’s understanding of current rules for people travelling on a full ‘British Citizen’ passport from the UK, for the most common types of travel.
The authorities in Belgium set and enforce entry rules.
If you’re fully vaccinated
If you’re fully vaccinated, you can enter Belgium from the UK if you
complete a Passenger Locator Form (PLF), unless you fall under a very limited list of exemptions listed on the Belgian government website (under the Transport and International section)
To qualify as fully vaccinated at least 14 days must have passed since your second dose of a vaccine approved for use by Belgium, and no more than 270 days must have passed since your second dose unless you have received a booster or third dose. Further information can be found on the Belgian government’s website (section travels).
Travellers who are not coming to Belgium via a carrier (for example, those travelling by car via France ) and who will be staying in Belgium for a maximum of 48 hours, do not need to fill in a PLF. You should continue to follow the guidance for any country which you will be travelling through.
Further information can be found on the Belgian government’s website (section travels)
Proof of vaccination status
Belgian authorities will accept the UK’s proof of COVID-19 vaccination record and proof of COVID-19 vaccination issued in the Crown Dependencies. These must include a verifiable QR code. Your final vaccine dose must have been administered 14 days prior to travel. Your NHS appointment card from vaccination centres is not designed to be used as proof of vaccination and should not be used to demonstrate your vaccine status. In line with EU recommendations, a second dose of vaccine (or sole dose in the case of the Johnson & Johnson vaccine) must have been administered less than 270 days ago for incoming travellers to qualify as fully vaccinated. Those who have had a booster shot still qualify as fully vaccinated.
From 1 March 2022, those who have received a second vaccine dose (or, in the case of the Johnson & Johnson vaccine, their sole dose) more than 150 days ago, will no longer count as fully vaccinated for domestic purposes within Belgium without a booster shot. Therefore they will need additional proof of covid safe status (eg negative test, recovery certificate) to enter specific venues (eg restaurants and bars, cinemas, most museums, and many events).
If you’re not fully vaccinated
If you are aged 12 or over and fall under this category you can only enter Belgium if you can produce either a recovery or negative test certificate. A recovery certificate is valid for 180 days, a PCR test 72 hours, whilst a RAT test is valid for 24 hours. You must complete a Passenger Locator Form (PLF), unless you fall under an exemption listed on the Belgian government website (under the Transport and International section).
Further information can be found on the Belgian government’s website (section travels).
Residents of Belgium
If you have Belgian residency and cannot produce either a vaccination/recovery or negative test certificate you will need to take a day 1 PCR test or RAT if you return from a third country not on the white list or from a EU country coloured dark-red.
Children and young people
Children under 12, even if not fully vaccinated, do not need to be tested either before departure or on arrival.
If you’re transiting through Belgium
Transiting is when you pass through one country on the way to your final destination. Travellers visiting Belgium for less than 48 hours do not need to present evidence of vaccination or a recovery or negative test certificate unless arriving from a country with a new Variant of Concern (VOC).
Transit passengers arriving by air, will need to demonstrate they are able to meet the requirements applicable in their country of final destination.
Exemptions
Belgium allows a limited number of tightly defined exemptions from testing, quarantine or from other restrictions on travel. More information can be found on the Belgian government`s website.
HGV drivers
HGV drivers from the UK entering Belgium do not have to show a negative COVID-19 test, proof of vaccination or proof of recovery and do not have to quarantine.
Check your passport and travel documents before you travel
Passport validity
If you are planning to travel to an EU country (except Ireland), or Switzerland, Norway, Iceland, Liechtenstein, Andorra, Monaco, San Marino or Vatican City, you must meet the Schengen area rules.
Your passport must meet 2 requirements. It must be:
less than 10 years old on the day you enter (check the ‘date of issue’)
valid for at least 3 months after the day you plan to leave (check the ‘expiry date’)
We are asking the European Commission to clarify the 10-year rule. Their guidance for Schengen border guards may not be updated until the spring of 2022. Until then, for some Schengen countries your passport may need to be less than 10 years old during your whole visit, and the 3 months at the end of your visit may need to be within 10 years of your passport’s issue date.
Check both the issue date and the expiry date in your passport. If you renewed your passport early, extra months may have been added to its expiry date. This could affect the requirement for your passport to be less than 10 years old.
Contact your travel provider or embassy of the country you are visiting if you think that your passport does not meet both these requirements. Renew your passport if you need to.
Visas
You can travel to countries in the Schengen area for up to 90 days in any 180-day period without a visa. This applies if you travel as a tourist, to visit family or friends, to attend business meetings, cultural or sports events, or for short-term studies or training
If you are travelling to Belgium and other Schengen countries without a visa, make sure your whole visit is within the 90-day limit. Visits to Schengen countries within the previous 180 days before you travel count towards your 90 days.
To stay longer, to work or study, for business or for other reasons, you will need to meet the Belgian government’s entry requirements. Check with the Belgian Embassy what type of visa and/or work permit, you may need.
If you are travelling to Belgium for work, read the guidance on visas and permits.
If you stay in Belgium with a residence permit or long-stay visa, this does not count towards your 90-day visa-free limit.
Passport stamping
Check your passport is stamped if you enter or exit the Schengen area through Belgium as a visitor. Border guards will use passport stamps to check you’re complying with the 90-day visa-free limit for short stays in the Schengen area. If relevant entry or exit stamps are not in your passport, border guards will presume that you have overstayed your visa-free limit.
You can show evidence of when and where you entered or exited the Schengen area, and ask the border guards to add this date and location in your passport. Examples of acceptable evidence include boarding passes and tickets.
You may also need to:
show a return or onward ticket
show you have enough money for your stay
If you are resident in Belgium, read our Living in Belgium guide for passport stamping information.
UK Emergency Travel Documents
UK Emergency Travel Documents (ETDs) are accepted for entry, airside transit and exit from Belgium.
