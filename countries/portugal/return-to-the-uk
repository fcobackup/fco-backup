Returning home from the Azores
If you have completed a period of self-quarantine in the Azores and you are now planning to return home, complete and submit this form to the health authorities. The health authorities will sign and return it to you so you can show it at the airport on departure.
Future travel options
You will need to pay for your return travel to the UK. If departure options are available but you cannot afford the travel costs and have exhausted all other options for getting funds, you may be eligible to apply for an emergency loan from the government. This is a last resort option and you would need to repay the loan when you are back in the UK.
For more information, you should contact Corporate Travel Management (CTM). CTM are a commercial partner of the FCO and are authorised to administer such loans on behalf of the FCO.
