The Foreign and Commonwealth Office (FCO) advise against all travel to the cities of Daegu, Cheongdo and Gyeongsan due to the ongoing coronavirus (COVID-19) outbreak, the increased incidence of community transmission and increasing pressure on medical services in these areas.
The Government of South Korea has designated the cities of Daegu, Cheongdo and Gyeongsan as “special care zones” due to the high number of cases of coronavirus in these cities. If you’re already in Daegu, Cheongdo or Gyeongsan, you should follow the instructions and advice of the local authorities and pay particular regard to virus control testing and measures.
Flights between South Korea and a number of countries have been reduced, and some countries have altered their entry requirements for travellers who started their journey in, or transited through, South Korea. You should check with your airline, travel agency or the relevant websites for your destination for the latest information.
There is an ongoing risk of coronavirus (COVID-19) throughout South Korea, with a growing number of cases across the country in recent days, including instances of community-based transmission. It may cause more severe symptoms in older people, and those with pre-existing medical conditions. You should exercise caution throughout the country, and follow the advice of local authorities. The Government of South Korea has announced that foreign nationals who have been in Hubei province in China within the previous 14 days will not be allowed to enter South Korea. See Health

The level of tension on the Korean Peninsula grew considerably in 2017 due to a series of North Korean nuclear and missile tests. On 21 April 2018, North Korea announced a halt to nuclear and intercontinental ballistic missile testing.
Since 2018 there has been renewed direct contact between the North and South Korean governments, and between North Korea and the United States. In the past, periods of diplomatic engagement have failed to be sustained. This has led to further missile or nuclear tests by North Korea and a return to instability in the region. The level of tension and the security situation can therefore still change with little notice. Tensions usually rise around the time of South Korean-US military exercises. In the past, heightened tensions haven’t affected daily life. See Political situation
