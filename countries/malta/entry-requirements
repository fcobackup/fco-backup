Entry rules in response to coronavirus (COVID-19)
Entry to Malta
Since 15 July flights to and from some countries has been extended to include those on the Visit Malta website. All arriving passengers must have completed a paper copy of both a public health and a passenger locator form. These are available at the Malta Airport website or enquire with your airline.
On 21 December, the Government of Malta announced that from 00:01 on 22 December normal commercial flights between the UK and Malta will be suspended. If you have a ticket to travel you should contact your travel operator.
Maltese citizens and residents currently in the UK will be able to return to Malta on Air Malta flights. The Maltese authorities have announced that British Nationals in Malta will be able to return to the UK on Air Malta flights.
All passengers arriving to Malta from the United Kingdom will be required to observe a mandatory 14 day quarantine and submit to COVID-19 Polymerase Chain Reaction (PCR) test upon arrival. Until 22 December, passengers travelling from the United Kingdom are required to submit a negative COVID-19 Polymerase Chain Reaction (PCR) test before boarding flights to Malta. The test should be dated no more than 72 hours before arrival.
Passengers who do not present this certificate will be asked to give a swab on arrival at Malta International Airport. However, some airlines may not allow boarding without a prior test. You should check the airline requirements before you travel. If your test on arrival is positive you will be required to quarantine.
You should not use the NHS testing service to get a test in order to facilitate your travel to another country. You should arrange to take a private test.
The current list of countries or regions requiring prior testing can be found on the Maltese Ministry of Foreign and European Affairs’ website. The Maltese Government will regularly review the list of countries for which prior testing will be required.

The current list of countries exempt from self-isolation can be found on the Visit Malta website. If arriving from an exempt country or region passengers will need to certify they have resided in that country for at least 2 weeks prior to travelling. There will, however, be temperature checks for all arriving and departing passengers. Those passengers with a high temperature will be required to undergo a swab test. Further details on the procedures are explained on the Malta International Airport website.
You may not travel to Malta from a country not listed via one of the listed countries. If you wish to travel to Malta from a country not listed you will need prior permission from the Maltese authorities. You should contact your nearest Maltese Embassy or High Commission for more information.
