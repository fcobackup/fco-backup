There remain commercial options to return to the UK from Hong Kong.
If you live in the UK and are currently visiting Hong Kong, you’re strongly advised to return now by commercial means. Don’t run the risk of getting stranded.
UK special charter flights will only operate for priority countries where commercial flights are not possible. You should not assume that these flights will become available in countries where commercial routes are operating. Please do not contact the contracted travel management company if no flight is advertised here.
Flights
Limited direct flights from Hong Kong to the UK are still available, but they are likely to be suspended at short notice. Some airlines have announced a total suspension of passenger services (e.g. British Airways from 8 – 24 April), and others will likely follow soon. From 8 April, Cathay Pacific will only operate two flights a week (on Wednesday and Sunday) from Hong Kong to London.
Indirect flights are also increasingly limited. If you choose an indirect flight, you should check that the country in which you plan to transit allows you to do so.
