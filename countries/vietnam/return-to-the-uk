There are still commercial options to return to the UK from Vietnam.
If you live in the UK and are currently visiting Vietnam, you’re strongly advised to return now by commercial means. While some international flights remain, these cannot be fully guaranteed. Don’t run the risk of getting stranded.
UK special charter flights will only operate for priority countries where commercial flights are not possible. You should not assume that these flights will become available in Vietnam because commercial routes are operating.
International flights
The only remaining international flight option of departure from Vietnam is via South Korea by Korean Air from Ho Chi Minh City, and Asiana Airlines from Hanoi and from Ho Chi Minh City, with onward flights to the UK from Incheon by Korean Air. Please note that flight frequency may change with little notice. Please check with the airlines and/or travel agents for up to date information.
You will need to pay for your return travel to the UK. If departure options are available but you cannot afford the travel costs and have exhausted all other options for getting funds, you may be eligible to apply for an emergency loan from the government. This is a last resort option and you would need to repay the loan when you are back in the UK. For more information, you should contact Corporate Travel Management (CTM). CTM are a commercial partner of the FCO and are authorised to administer such loans on behalf of the FCO.
Travelling to the airport
With the relaxation of the partial lockdown measures, taxis or private hire cars are available to take you to international airports in Vietnam.
Accessing departure airports
Internal flight routes have resumed though many routes have a lower frequency than pre-COVID-19 levels.
Arrival in the UK
When you arrive back in the UK, follow the guidance for when you return to the UK on steps you should take to protect yourself and others.
