Cases of coronavirus (COVID-19) have been confirmed in Hungary. The Hungarian authorities have declared a state of emergency and introduced a number of measures to limit the spread of the virus. You should comply with any additional screening measures put in place by the authorities.
Travel restrictions
Hungary has restricted entry to foreign nationals. Only Hungarian citizens and EEA citizens (including UK nationals) holding a Permanent Residence Card or a Registration Certificate and Address Card will be allowed to enter the country.
From 27 March, all individuals entering Hungary are obliged to undergo a medical examination at the border to check for signs of Covid-19 infection. Those individuals suspected of infection will be put into officially designated quarantine for 14 days. If there is no suspicion of infection, individuals will still be required to quarantine at home for 14 days.
The situation may change rapidly, including in neighbouring countries, where some airports have closed or ceased direct flights to the UK.
For information on how to return to the UK from Hungary, see Return to the UK.
Local measures
From 28 March, Hungary has introduced rules to limit people’s social interaction with those outside their household. The police have powers to fine people breaking the rules.
Under these rules, which will remain in place at least until 3 May, people should stay at home as much as possible. The rules allow individuals to leave home only for essential purposes, for example work, shopping for essential products, banking and postal services, and to help people unable to provide for themselves. Between 9am and 12 noon each day, only people over 65 are permitted to shop in food stores, personal hygiene stores, markets and pharmacies. All restaurants must now offer takeaway services only.
Outdoor exercise is permitted, but people must either be alone or only with people from their household. Otherwise, they must maintain a minimum one and a half metres from others.
From 27 April, people in Budapest should wear a face covering (i.e. mask, scarf or shawl) in all shops, markets and when using taxis or public transport, with the aim of preventing the spread of COVID-19.
The full details are set out on the Hungarian government website
UK nationals living in Hungary should note that the National Directorate General for Aliens Policing has introduced changes in in-person appointments to help reduce the spread of the virus. Expiring resident permits from 11 March onwards will automatically remain valid during the state of emergency and for 45 days after the state of emergency terminates. If you are a UK national residing in Hungary for over three months, and trying to register your stay, please visit the webpage of the National Directorate General for Aliens Policing for guidance on how to do this.
