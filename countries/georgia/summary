For security reasons, the FCDO advises against all travel to the breakaway regions of South Ossetia and Abkhazia, and against all but essential travel to areas immediately adjacent to the Administrative Boundary Lines with Abkhazia and South Ossetia.
The British government does not recognise the unilateral declarations of independence made by the de facto authorities in the breakaway regions of Abkhazia and South Ossetia. Consular support is not available in parts of Georgia where the FCDO advise against all travel. See Local travel
Before you travel, check the ‘Entry requirements’ section for Georgia’s current entry restrictions and requirements. These may change with little warning. Monitor this advice for the latest updates and stay in contact with your travel provider.
If you plan to pass through another country to return to the UK, check the travel advice for the country you’re transiting.
It is more important than ever to get travel insurance and check it provides sufficient cover. See the FCDO’s guidance on foreign travel insurance.
The political situation in Georgia is generally calm, although demonstrations and rallies, particularly on Rustaveli Avenue in Tbilisi as well as in other large towns do take place at short notice. These can escalate without warning. You should remain vigilant, stay away from any large gatherings and demonstrations and follow the advice of local authorities. See Political situation
Foreign nationals have been detained on arrival in Georgia for possession of medicines that would not normally be problematic in the UK or other countries. See Travelling with medicines
