The information on this page covers the most common types of travel and reflects the UK government’s understanding of the rules currently in place. Unless otherwise stated, this information is for travellers using a full ‘British Citizen’ passport.
The authorities in the country or territory you’re travelling to are responsible for setting and enforcing the rules for entry. If you’re unclear about any aspect of the entry requirements, or you need further reassurance, you’ll need to contact the embassy, high commission or consulate of the country or territory you’re travelling to.
You should also consider checking with your transport provider or travel company to make sure your passport and other travel documents meet their requirements.
Entry rules in response to coronavirus (COVID-19)
Entry to Italy
Entry to Italy from the UK is permitted. You no longer have to justify your reason for travelling.
You should complete a self-declaration form before you travel to Italy. You must provide this to your airline/transport provider, or to the border police if you are stopped for checks.
Entry to the country is still forbidden for visitors who have stayed in or transited through a small number of listed countries in the 14 days before arrival. If you have been outside the UK in the 14 days before your planned date of travel to Italy, you should check the current list of affected countries.
From 12 August, travellers returning from Malta, Spain, Greece and Croatia must undertake a compulsory Covid test. You should check the list of available options.
Self-isolation
Travellers arriving in Italy directly from the UK are now usually exempt from the requirement to self-isolate.
You will need to self-isolate if, in the 14 days prior to your arrival in Italy, you have stayed in or transited through a country where Italy continues to require self-isolation. If these conditions apply to you, then you must report promptly to the local health authorities and self-isolate for 14 days.
More information on these requirements is available on the Ministry of Foreign Affairs frequently asked questions page.
Many airlines and airports serving Italy are resuming service, but may not be operating to their usual schedules. You are strongly advised to check your airline’s website, as well as the website for the airport you are intending to fly to for the latest information. You should also expect to be asked to wear a face mask throughout your flight and within the airport terminal.
Travel to Sardinia
If you are travelling to the island of Sardinia, you are also required by the local authority to register your trip in advance.
Travel via neighbouring countries
You should check travel advice for any countries you plan to travel through ahead of your journey.
Regular entry requirements
Passport validity
Your passport should be valid for the proposed duration of your stay; you do not need any additional period of validity on your passport beyond this.
The rules on travel will stay the same until 31 December 2020.
Visas
If you hold a British Citizen passport, you don’t need a visa to enter Italy. If you’re planning a stay of longer than 3 months, see our Living in Italy guide and contact the Italian Embassy if you have further questions.
The rules on travel will stay the same until 31 December 2020.
UK Emergency Travel Documents
UK Emergency Travel Documents (ETDs) are accepted for entry, airside transit and exit from Italy.
