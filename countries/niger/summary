The Foreign and Commonwealth Office (FCO) is advising British nationals against all non-essential international travel at this time. Existing advice for Niger remains in place:
The FCO advise against all travel to:
all areas of the country north of the city of Abalak, including the Aïr Massif region
the province of Agadez (including the road linking Assamakato Agadez and the city of Agadez)
areas of Tahoua province north of the city of Tahoua, including the city itself
the area of Tillabéri province north of Niamey, including the road from Niamey to Gao and the road from Niamey to Menaka
areas within 40km of the south-western border with Burkina Faso
areas within 40km of the border with Nigeria in Diffa, Zinder and Maradi provinces
the Parc du W, plus the contiguous Dosso and Tamou hunting zones
The FCO advise against all but essential travel to:
the rest of Niger, including the capital city Niamey.
Given the rapidly changing situation in Niger we are temporarily withdrawing a limited number of UK staff and their dependents from our UK Government Office. We will continue to carry out essential work including providing consular assistance and support to British people in Niger.
In order to prevent the spread of coronavirus (COVID-19), Niger has closed its borders and suspended all international passenger flights. See Coronavirus and Return to the UK.
Terrorists are very likely to try to carry out attacks in Niger, including kidnapping. There is a threat of retaliatory attacks in Niger due to its participation in the French-led intervention in Mali and due to Niger’s involvement in the regional fight to counter Boko Haram. See Terrorism
States of emergency are in place in several states across the country. See Local travel
Levels of crime, especially in the capital Niamey, are high. See Crime
You should carry some form of identification at all times. See Local laws and customs
You can contact the emergency services by calling + 227 20 73 37 43/44 (or 17 local number) for the police, and +227 20 73 21 13 (or 18 local number) for the fire service.
Consular support is limited in Niger as there is no British Embassy. However, the British Embassy in Bamako, Mali can provide consular support to British nationals. See Consular Assistance
Take out comprehensive travel and medical insurance before you travel.
