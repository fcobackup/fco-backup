Public medical facilities and treatment is generally sufficient but can be of a lower standard than you would expect in the UK, particularly outside Yerevan. Private hospitals in Armenia are of a good standard but can be more expensive. Treatment is not recommended for anything other than minor or straightforward ailments.
