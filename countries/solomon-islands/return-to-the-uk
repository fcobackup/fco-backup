The Government of Australia has announced that from 9pm Australia Eastern Standard Time on 20 March, entry to the country will only be permitted to Australian citizens or permanent residents. This follows a similar announcement by New Zealand from 19 March.
As many flight connections to and from Solomon Islands connect in Australia and New Zealand, options to depart Solomon Islands are likely to reduce.
If you’re currently a visitor in Solomon Islands, you’re advised to prepare to leave as soon as possible.
