The currency in Senegal is the CFA franc (XOF). Avoid exchanging large quantities of CFA francs for foreign currency anywhere other than reputable exchange bureaus. ATMs are widespread and reliable in Dakar but banking facilities are infrequent in the rest of the country, and withdrawal limits may be quite low. Credit cards are accepted in larger establishments that cater for tourists. Commission is often added for their use.
