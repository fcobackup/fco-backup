Before you travel check that:
your destination can provide the healthcare you may need
you have appropriate travel insurance for local treatment or unexpected medical evacuation
This is particularly important if you have a health condition or are pregnant.
Emergency medical number
Dial 103 and ask for an ambulance. The operator answering may not speak English.
Contact your insurance company promptly if you’re referred to a medical facility for treatment.
Vaccinations and health risks
At least 8 weeks before your trip check:

Medication
The legal status and regulation of some medicines prescribed or bought in the UK can be different in other countries.
Read best practice when travelling with medicines on TravelHealthPro.
The NHS has information on whether you can take your medicine abroad.
Make sure you have enough medication to cover your trip.
Basic medications such as aspirin are available without a prescription. For prescription medication you will need a valid prescription either from a local doctor or your UK prescription translated into Kazakh or Russian. Medications often come under different brand names, so ask for the drug’s generic name. If they are not available locally, it may be possible to get drugs to be couriered through a private clinic, for example, International SOS clinic.
Healthcare facilities in Kazakhstan
The medical facilities in Kazakhstan are not as advanced as in the UK. Make sure you have adequate travel health insurance and accessible funds to cover the cost of medical treatment or evacuation by air ambulance and repatriation. Medical personnel do not typically speak English.
