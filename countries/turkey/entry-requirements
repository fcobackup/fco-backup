If you’re unclear about any aspect of the entry requirements, or you need further reassurance, you’ll need to contact the embassy, high commission or consulate of the country or territory you’re travelling to.
You should also consider checking with your transport provider or travel company to make sure your passport and other travel documents meet their requirements.
Entry rules in response to coronavirus (COVID-19)
Entry to Turkey
From 4am 12 May, direct flights from Turkey to England are prohibited. Different requirements apply for arrivals into Scotland, Wales and Northern Ireland.
All arrivals into Turkey, except Turkish citizens or residence permit holders, must complete an online form within 72 hours of travel. This is not required for those passengers transiting Turkey en route to another country.
Turkey’s international land and sea borders are open. However, short-notice changes, especially temporary closures of land borders, are possible and you should check access locally.
International passengers wishing to transit through airports in Turkey on to a domestic Turkish flight will not be required to submit an HES code, unless the passenger is a Turkish citizen or resident of Turkey and the duration between the two flights exceeds 12 hours.
You must wear a face mask at all times whilst in an airport, and for the duration of all flights, to and from Turkey.
Testing / screening on arrival
All arrivals into Turkey will be subject to a medical evaluation for symptoms of coronavirus, including temperature checks.
Passengers from the UK do not require a negative PCR test or vaccine certificate to enter Turkey.
Passengers who are in direct transit through Turkey to other destinations do not require a negative PCR test, unless their journey originated in India, Brazil or South Africa. Passengers transiting Turkey from India, Brazil or South Africa will be required on boarding to show a negative PCR test result taken within 72hrs of departure to Turkey.
Data collection
You will need to complete a passenger locator form prior to arriving in Turkey. Details will be provided by your airline.
You will be asked to provide the residential address of where you will stay, within the borders of Turkey, and your contact information.
You may be asked by your airline to provide personal information regarding COVID-19 that may be shared with Ministry of Health and third countries when necessary. Anyone who knowingly provides false information may be prevented from travelling.
Regular entry requirements
Visas
British Citizens travelling to Turkey for tourist or business purposes are able to travel without a visa for visits of up to 90 days in any 180-day period.
If you plan to remain in Turkey for a period of more than 90 days, you should either apply for a longer stay visa before you travel, or get a residence permit from the local authorities in Turkey before your 90 day stay has elapsed. If you intend to work in Turkey, ensure you have the correct permits. More information is available from the Turkish Ministry of the Interior. If you don’t abide by the terms of your visa or permit, you may be fined, deported and banned from re-entering the country.
If you’re entering Turkey via a land border crossing, make sure your passport has a dated entry stamp before you leave the border crossing area.
If you hold a different type of British nationality (eg BN(O), British Overseas Citizen, British Protected Person or British Subject), check visa requirements with the Turkish Consulate General before you travel. These types of passport are classed as ‘UK Special Passports’ in the Turkish e-Visa system. You’ll need to apply for a visa from the Turkish Consulate General before you travel.
Passport validity
The Turkish government advise that your passport should be valid for at least 6 months from the date you enter Turkey and that there is a full blank page for the entry and exit stamps. You can find more detail about the requirements for entry into Turkey on the website of the Turkish Ministry of Foreign Affairs.
Travelling with children
If you are leaving Turkey with a child who is a dual British-Turkish national, you may be asked to show the Turkish immigration authorities evidence that the Turkish parent has given permission for the child to travel.
UK Emergency Travel Documents
UK Emergency Travel Documents (ETD) are accepted for entry, airside transit and exit from Turkey within the dates printed on the document. ETDs should be valid for a minimum period of 6 months from the date of entry into Turkey.
