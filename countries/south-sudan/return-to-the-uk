There are currently extremely limited and no routine commercial options available to return to the UK from South Sudan. We know this is concerning for British people trying to leave South Sudan. On 24 March, the government of South Sudan announced the closure of all land borders (except for cargo) and suspended all international passenger flights.
Flights
Since 24 March, the South Sudan government has authorised special permission for a limited number of flights. On 7 April, the government of South Sudan authorised permission for four special commercial passenger flights, operated by Ethiopian Airlines on 10, 17, 24 April and 1 May. These flights are not guaranteed and theflight on 10 April did not happen. A flight did operate on 17 April. The British Embassy Juba is awaiting further details on scheduling and booking arrangements for the authorised flights on 24 April and 1 May. We will share details via this Travel Advice once confirmed.
We continue to work closely with airlines, the South Sudanese authorities and other embassies to make sure options are available for you to return to the UK as soon as possible.
What to do
If you cannot leave South Sudan at this time, you should:
follow the advice of local authorities, including local measures to help minimise your risk of exposure to coronavirus.
find accommodation that’s suitable for your needs
keep in regular contact with family and friends at home, so they know you are safe and well

Future travel options
This travel advice will be updated when departure options become available. Sign up for email alerts and follow the British Embassy Juba on Twitter and Facebook.
You will need to pay for your return travel to the UK. If departure options are available but you cannot afford the travel costs and have exhausted all other options for getting funds, you may be eligible to apply for an emergency loan from the government. This is a last resort option and you would need to repay the loan when you are back in the UK. For more information, you should contact Corporate Travel Management (CTM). CTM are a commercial partner of the FCO and are authorised to administer such loans on behalf of the FCO.
Arrival in the UK
When you arrive back in the UK, follow the guidance for when you return to the UK on steps you should take to protect yourself and others.
