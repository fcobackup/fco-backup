Cases of coronavirus (COVID-19) have been confirmed in Montenegro. The Montenegrin authorities have introduced a number of measures to limit the spread of the virus.
You should comply with any additional screening and other measures put in place by the authorities to monitor and limit the spread of the virus. Violation of these measures is a criminal offence. Additional measures may be introduced at short notice.
Travel restrictions
Entry is forbidden to all foreign nationals except for those with permanent or temporary residence permits in Montenegro, and those driving freight vehicles. All international passenger air, rail and bus traffic, as well as local rail, bus and taxi services have been suspended. No more than two adults are allowed in a vehicle.

All those entering Montenegro from abroad should expect to be subject to a compulsory 14 day quarantine period. Individuals who have had contact with someone diagnosed with coronavirus, or suspected to be infected with coronavirus will be subject to quarantine. Those over 65 years old are recommended to self-isolate.
Local measures
Other measures include closure of all retail, leisure and religious premises, except food shops, pharmacies, hygiene, construction and fuel suppliers. There are limits on the number of people allowed in shops. Hotels are not allowed to accept new guests and may only provide services to guests who have already checked in.
A ban is in force on all cruise ships and yachts entering Montenegro, and all mass gatherings. All schools will be closed until 31 March.
If you develop any symptoms or are concerned about your health do not go to a hospital or a doctor. You should stay in your home or accommodation and call the designated Institute of Public Health hotline 1616, or ask a Montenegrin-speaker to call on your behalf.
