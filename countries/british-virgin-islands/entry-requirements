This page has information on travelling to British Virgin Islands. Check what you must do to return to the UK.
This page reflects the UK government’s understanding of current rules for people travelling on a full ‘British Citizen’ passport from the UK, for the most common types of travel.
The authorities in British Virgin Islands set and enforce entry rules.
All travellers
You will need a valid passport, with validity covering the proposed duration of your stay to enter or travel through the British Virgin Islands as a visitor. See below for further information on travel documentation.
Entry to the BVI by air is through the Terrance B. Lettsome International Airport, Taddy Bay International Airport and Auguste George Airport. You can enter by sea through the Road Town Jetty; Soper’s Hole Dock, West End; Great Harbour, Jost Van Dyke or Spanish Town, Virgin Gorda.
Effective from 15 July, there are no testing or quarantine requirements on arrival.
There is a US$50 tax for all passengers, payable on leaving the BVI by air ($15 departure tax, $5 security charge departure tax and a $30 airport development fee). This is generally included in the ticket price. If you’re departing the BVI by ferry, a departure tax of US$20 per person or US$15 for residents is payable. Visitors arriving by air or sea are also charged an Environmental and Tourism levy of US$10 on arrival.
If you’re fully vaccinated
Entry requirements for the BVI are the same for all travellers, regardless of COVID-19 vaccination status.
Proof of vaccination status
You don’t need to provide proof of your vaccination status for entry to the BVI. Effective from 15 July, there are no testing or quarantine requirements on arrival.
If you’re not fully vaccinated
Entry requirements for the BVI are the same for all travellers, regardless of COVID-19 vaccination status.
If you’ve had COVID-19 in the past year
You do not need proof of COVID-19 recovery to enter BVI. Effective from 15 July, there are no testing or quarantine requirements on arrival.
Children and young people
From 15 July, there are no testing or quarantine requirements for children and young people on arrival.
If you’re transiting through the British Virgin Islands
Transiting is when you pass through one country on the way to your final destination.
If you’re transiting through the British Virgin Islands on your way to another country, effective from 15 July there is no testing regime or proof of vaccination status required in BVI. However, you should meet the requirements of the country of destination. Further information about transiting through the British Virgin Islands can be found on the Government of the Virgin Islands website.
Check your passport and travel documents before you travel
If you’re visiting the British Virgin Islands, your passport should be valid for the proposed period of your stay.
If you are a resident in the British Virgin Islands, your passport must be valid for at least 3 months from the date you arrive.
Check with your travel provider to make sure your passport and other travel documents meet their requirements.
Visas
British nationals don’t need a visa to visit the BVI. It’s normal practice for BVI immigration authorities to issue you with a one-month entry stamp on arrival. You may also be granted an extension for one further month. Extensions for up to 6 months are granted on the discretion of the Chief Immigration Officer, providing the individual can show proof of independent financial means. You may need to show evidence of accommodation and your plans to leave the BVI at the end of your stay.
Work Permits
Travellers who hold an expired work permit and are re-entering the BVI must submit a written request to the Immigration Department at least 5 working days prior to travel. This also applies to holders of valid work permit exemptions.

UK Emergency Travel Documents
UK Emergency Travel Documents (ETDs) are accepted for entry, transit and exit from the BVI. If you’re travelling via the USA on an ETD, you will need to get a valid US visa.
As the BVI is a British Overseas Territory, there is no formal British diplomatic or consular representation. UK ETDs are processed by the British High Commission in Barbados.
