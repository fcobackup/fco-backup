Visas
New Caledonia is a dependent territory of France.
If you hold a British Citizen passport, you don’t need a visa to enter New Caledonia for stays of up to three months. Other British passport holders, and those who plan to stay longer than three months, should check the current entry requirements on the website of the French Ministry of Foreign Affairs and, if necessary, confirm with the nearest French Diplomatic mission.
Passport validity
You should ensure that your passport has at least 3 months of validity after the date you intend to leave New Caledonia.
Check your passport is valid for travel before you book your trip. You will need to renew your passport before travelling if you do not have enough time left on your passport.
