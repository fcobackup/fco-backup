Due to the on-going risk of political demonstrations taking place in the centre of Antananarivo and the possibility of violence, you should avoid the area around Independence Square and the Town Hall. You should monitor local and social media for updates.
Madagascar has experienced political instability since the 2009 coup d’etat. Following the political transition back to democracy in early 2014, riots occurred in December 2014 in Morondava and Port Berge (Boriziny). There is potential for further unrest in the run-up to Presidential elections, expected in late 2018. You should avoid political demonstrations. See Political situation.
Take great care and follow local advice in the south-east of the country. In the southern triangle between Ihosy, Toliara/Tuléar and Fort-Dauphin the security situation remains tense and the roads are in very poor condition. Avoid overnight stays in the countryside.
The Foreign and Commonwealth Office (FCO) advise against all travel to Batterie Beach, north of Toliara (Tuléar), where there have been violent attacks including fatalities.
You should avoid travelling at night on Route Nationale 13 (RN 13) between Ambovombe and Ihosy and on the RN 10 between Betioky and Andranovory (the western route to Toliara/Tuléar). There have been several attacks on vehicles. If you’re planning on travelling to Fort Dauphin via the RN 13, then you should strongly consider travelling by air instead. If this isn’t possible, take great care on the RN 13 during the daytime, be vigilant at all times and follow the instructions of local authorities. See Crime and Local travel.
In October 2013 on the island of Nosy Be, 2 foreigners and 1 Malagasy were lynched and burned by the local population. Remain vigilant during visits to beaches.

Be especially vigilant at night and don’t touch any suspect packages.
