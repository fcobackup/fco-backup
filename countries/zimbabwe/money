Zimbabwe’s economic situation remains unpredictable. Both the Zimbabwe Dollar and US Dollar are currently used. This may change without notice. There is a shortage of physical cash so it is not always possible to make cash withdrawals using an international bank card. If attempting to use an international bank card for payment in supermarkets, shops and restaurants, ensure you state that you are using an international card to avoid overcharging on your account.
There are some Bureaux de Change which will accept and change foreign currency, particularly US dollars. The exchange rate is currently unpredictable.
You should check before making a transaction whether the price quoted is in Zimbabwean or US dollars as the symbol for both is $. It is recommended to check exchange rates prior to any transaction. You should check in advance what payment methods a restaurant, hotel or tour operator will accept. Some businesses, including some medical providers, may not accept payment by credit or debit card. You should always ensure that you are being charged in the correct currency and while credit and debit cards are accepted for transactions, most suppliers prefer USD cash. There are also some challenges with international transfers from outside of Zimbabwe.
It’s illegal to leave Zimbabwe with more than USD $2,000 (or equivalent) in cash, unless it is left over from funds which you have brought in yourself and declared on arrival. You should keep the proof of declaration to avoid problems with officials on exit. It’s illegal to exchange foreign currency anywhere other than at officially licensed dealers (e.g. banks or bureau de change). Carry small denomination notes as change is rarely available.
