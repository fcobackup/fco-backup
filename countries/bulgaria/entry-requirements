The information on this page covers the most common types of travel and reflects the UK government’s understanding of the rules currently in place. Unless otherwise stated, this information is for travellers using a full ‘British Citizen’ passport.
The authorities in the country or territory you’re travelling to are responsible for setting and enforcing the rules for entry. If you’re unclear about any aspect of the entry requirements, or you need further reassurance, you’ll need to contact the embassy, high commission or consulate of the country or territory you’re travelling to.
You should also consider checking with your transport provider or travel company to make sure your passport and other travel documents meet their requirements.
Entry rules in response to coronavirus (COVID-19)
Entry to Bulgaria
There are no restrictions on entry for British nationals.
Commercial flights are operating at a reduced level. Many land borders crossings in the region are restricted or closed for passenger traffic. Furthermore, neighbouring countries are implementing additional health requirements for entry to or departure from Bulgaria including declarations and COVID-19 tests. You should check the relevant FCDO Travel Advice.
If you need to travel, plan ahead and before you travel check border information published by the Ministry of Interior (English and Bulgarian) before you travel.
Quarantine requirements
From 16 July 2020, arrivals from the UK, regardless of nationality, are no longer required to self-isolate for 14 days from the date of arrival.
If you’re travelling to Bulgaria from or via another country, you may still be subject to quarantine measures. Check the latest information on the Ministry of Interior website (English and Bulgarian).
Regular entry requirements
Visas
If you hold a British Citizen passport, you don’t need a visa to enter Bulgaria. If you’re planning a stay of longer than 3 months, see our Living in Bulgaria guide and contact the Bulgarian Embassy if you have further questions.
The rules on travel will stay the same until 31 December 2020.
Visas from 1 January 2021
The rules for travelling or working in Europe will change from 1 January 2021:
You will be able to travel to Bulgaria for up to 90 days in any 180-day period without a visa for purposes such as tourism. This is a rolling 180-day period.
As Bulgaria is not within the Schengen area, visits to other EU countries will not count against this total.
To stay for longer, to work or study, or for business travel you will need to meet the entry requirements set out by Bulgaria. This could mean applying for a visa or work permit. You should check with the Bulgarian Embassy what type of visa, if any, you will need.
Periods of stay authorised under a visa or permit will not count against the 90-day limit.
The European Commission has not yet set out how the limit of 90 days in any 180-day period for visa-free travel will be implemented for those who are already travelling in the EU or Schengen Area on 31 December 2020.
If you are travelling to Bulgaria before 31 December 2020 and will stay until 1 January 2021 or later, you should check with the Bulgarian Embassy for information on how the 90-day visa-free limit will apply to you.
At border control for Bulgaria, you may need to:
show a return or onward ticket
show you have enough money for your stay
use separate lanes from EU, EEA and Swiss citizens when queueing
Your passport may be stamped on entry and exit.
Passport validity
The rules on travel will stay the same until 31 December 2020.
Your passport should be valid for the proposed duration of your stay; you do not need any additional period of validity on your passport beyond this.
Passport validity from 1 January 2021
From 1 January 2021, you must have at least 6 months left on an adult or child passport to travel to most countries in Europe (not including Ireland).
If you renewed your current passport before the previous one expired, extra months may have been added to its expiry date. Any extra months on your passport over 10 years may not count towards the 6 months needed.
Check your passport is valid for travel before you book your trip. You will need to renew your passport before travelling if you do not have enough time left on your passport.
UK Emergency Travel Documents
UK Emergency Travel Documents (ETDs) are accepted for entry, airside transit and exit from Bulgaria.
