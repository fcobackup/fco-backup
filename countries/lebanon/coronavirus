Entry and borders
See Entry requirements to find out what you will need to do when you arrive in Lebanon.
Returning to the UK
When you return, you must follow the rules for entering the UK.
You are responsible for organising your own COVID-19 test, in line with UK government testing requirements. You should contact local authorities for information on testing facilities.
Be prepared for your plans to change
No travel is risk-free during COVID. Countries may further restrict travel or bring in new rules at short notice, for example due to a new COVID-19 variant. Check with your travel company or airline for any transport changes which may delay your journey home.
If you test positive for COVID-19, you may need to stay where you are until you test negative. You may also need to seek treatment there.
Plan ahead and make sure you:
can access money
understand what your insurance will cover
can make arrangements to extend your stay and be away for longer than planned
The Ministry of Public Health (MOPH) is responsible for COVID-19 testing at the airport and will inform you by text if you tested positive on arrival. If you test positive you will be expected to self-isolate in your accommodation. The MOPH or hospital where you got tested will pass on your details to the local authorities, and you may get contacted by the local municipality and offered support, but this is not guaranteed. We would not expect unaccompanied minors to be treated any differently from others.
Travel in Lebanon
COVID-19 lockdown measures have been largely lifted, although they can change at short notice. Contact the Lebanese embassy for more information if you are not sure about COVID-19 measures in Lebanon.
Beirut International airport remains operational although it is sometimes affected by fuel shortages, which can cause air conditioning or lighting to be turned off in the terminal buildings. Fuel shortages may affect the reliability of taxis to and from the airport. You should pre-book and confirm prior to travel. All passengers are required to have their tickets with them when transferring to and from the airport. Some exemptions to COVID-19 restrictions are applied to aid workers. For further clarification, aid workers should contact their employer for advice.
Taxis and private cars should have no more than four people in them (including the driver). Buses are allowed to operate with a maximum capacity of 50%.
Fabric masks covering the mouth and nose must be worn when outside the home and in vehicles (unless travelling alone).
Lebanese authorities may issue fines, impose road blocks, or imprison those violating these measures for up to three years. You should comply with all measures introduced by the Lebanese authorities and obey the instructions of the security forces. These measures may be changed at short notice.
Keep up to date with information from your tour operator, transport or accommodation provider on the impact on any existing travel plans.
Accommodation
Hotels and private rentals are available. You should check that accommodation is open and receiving guests before booking, and request information on the measures being taken to prevent the spread of COVID-19, and on their fuel situation.

COVID-19 vaccines if you live in Lebanon
We will update this page when the Government of Lebanon announces new information on the national vaccination programme. You can sign up to get email notifications when this page is updated.
The Lebanese national vaccination programme started in February 2021 and is using the Pfizer-BioNTech and AstraZeneca vaccines. The Government of Lebanon has stated that British nationals resident in Lebanon are eligible for vaccination if they choose to join the programme. The Lebanese authorities have issued a pre-registration form to register to receive the vaccine in Lebanon (you will need some assistance completing the form if you are a non-Arabic speaker). Private programmes run by employers may use other vaccines such as Sputnik V and Sinopharm in addition to Pfizer-BioNTech and AstraZeneca.
Find out more, including about vaccines that are authorised in the UK or approved by the World Health Organisation, on the COVID-19 vaccines if you live abroad.
If you’re a British national living in Lebanon, you should seek medical advice from your local healthcare provider. Information about COVID-19 vaccines used in the national programme where you live, including regulatory status, should be available from local authorities.
