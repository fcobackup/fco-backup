Political and security situation
The security situation throughout Iraq remains uncertain, and could deteriorate quickly.
On 8 January 2020, Iran fired missiles against two military bases in Iraq containing US personnel, one close to Erbil International Airport. No foreign casualties have been reported and Erbil Airport has resumed normal operations.
Early on 3 January, the US conducted a strike against a vehicle convoy in Baghdad. The Pentagon confirmed the death of Qasem Soleimani, Commander of Islamic Revolutionary Guards Corps-Quds Force and Abu Mehdi Muhandis, a senior commander in the Iraqi Popular Mobilisation Forces. A number of others were killed in the attack.
Large protests have been taking place in central Baghdad and across Iraq since October 2019. While many of these demonstrations have been peaceful, there have been frequent violent clashes between Iraqi security forces and protesters, resulting in significant casualties including loss of life. There may be restrictions on movement, and the Iraqi authorities have discretion to impose curfews as they deem necessary. On 31 December and 1 January, violent demonstrations took place outside the US Embassy in Baghdad. There is a possibility of further protests in Baghdad.
There may be increased attention on Western nationals and interests in Iraq. If you’re in Iraq or decide to travel, make sure you have robust security arrangement and contingency plans in place and keep these under review. You should keep up to date with the latest developments across the country, including via the media and this travel advice, avoid any rallies, marches or processions, and follow the instructions of local authorities.
Curfews and vehicle bans can be enforced at short notice, particularly during the current period of protests and unrest but also around religious holidays, pilgrimages and key political dates like elections.
As part of religious observations, processions and events take place throughout Iraq, especially in Karbala and Najaf. Religious gatherings have previously been targeted by terrorists.
British government officials serving in Iraq live and work under strict security rules. All British officials live in secure, guarded accommodation and travel with close protection teams at all times. Depending on the threat level, they may be prevented from travelling to certain areas of Iraq.
Hotels and guesthouses used by foreign nationals and the government of Iraq are subject to regular threats. The British embassy doesn’t allow official visitors to stay in a hotel overnight except in the Kurdistan Region, however attendance at meetings in hotels is assessed on case by case basis.
If you’re travelling or moving to Iraq, you should take appropriate security precautions before travelling. Outside of the Kurdistan Region you are strongly advised to employ a private security company, make arrangements for secure accommodation and transport and consider pre-deployment training.
Local travel
Northern and western Iraq
Coalition forces, including the UK, continue to carry out targeted airstrikes against Daesh in northern and western Iraq. Areas liberated from Daesh are likely to contain remnants of war and improvised explosive devices.
Mosul Dam
The government of Iraq has begun to take measures to improve the structural integrity of the Mosul Dam as there is a risk the dam could fail. It’s currently impossible to accurately predict if or when this might occur. A failure could lead to major flooding in the Tigris river valley, from Mosul to Baghdad. As there’s likely to be little warning of a failure, it will be logistically impossible for the British Government to evacuate you. The British Embassy has contingency plans to make sure staff are safe in the event of failure. You should make sure you have contingency plans in place and monitor media reporting and this travel advice.
Baghdad
Routes in and out of Baghdad may become blocked and airports closed or inaccessible at little or no notice. You should plan and check your routes in advance of travelling.
There remains a threat to western hotels in Baghdad, which could be targeted by terrorist groups. Local embassies have previously issued travel advice warnings of threats to western hotels in Baghdad. You should remain vigilant and follow the advice of the local authorities.
You should avoid political gatherings and large crowds, and minimise your movement around banks, restaurants and shopping malls. Observe instructions given by the local security authorities.
Kurdistan Region
In response to COVID-19, a suspension of commercial flights remains in force until 1 August. You may continue to experience difficulties in getting to and from Erbil and Sulaymaniyah international airports during this period. The Kurdistan Region of Iraq is subject to strict travel restrictions between provinces which are often introduced at short notice. These are published through local media and on www.moi.gov.krd.
The Kurdistan Region is administered by the Kurdistan Regional Government (KRG). The KRG held a referendum on independence from Iraq on 25 September 2017. Tensions in the region remain, including in neighbouring areas such as Kirkuk Province. You should remain alert, monitor media reports and this travel advice.
While the Kurdistan Region has a different security environment to the rest of Iraq, there remains a risk of attacks by Daesh. The security situation in the Kurdistan Region could deteriorate quickly.
Turkey conducts regular military action in the north of the Kurdistan Region of Iraq (KRI) and on occasion, further south. There is particular risk in mountainous areas, particularly around Qandil, Makhmur, and near the border with Turkey. Crossing points along the Iraq-Turkey border may also be affected.
On 17 July 2019, a Turkish diplomat and 2 Iraqi Kurds were fatally shot in Huqqabaz Restaurant in Empire City district, Erbil. Kurdish authorities are investigating the incident.
Large numbers of internally displaced people and Syrian refugees remain in Dohuk province in the Kurdistan Region.
Foreign nationals crossing the border from Syria into the KRI have been arrested for immigration offences in recent months. If prosecuted offenders could face a prison sentence of up to 5 years.
Basra
Protests took place in Basra in August and September 2018, and again in October and November 2019, linked to demands for improved services and employment opportunities. Casualties were reported. If protests re-start, you should remain alert, monitor media reports and keep up to date with this travel advice.
Land borders
Border crossing points with countries neighbouring Iraq may close with little or no notice. Check whether border crossings will be open before travelling through these areas.
Air travel
Do not leave airports without taking adequate security precautions. You should also take care within all terminal buildings.
Iraqi Airways’ permission to operate to/from points in the EU has been suspended. This is because Iraqi Airways has been unable to satisfy the European Aviation Safety Agency that the airline meets the requirements for non-EU airlines operating to/from the EU. Iraqi Airways operates to several European destinations using aircraft leased [or hired] from other airlines.
Flight schedules may change without notice. Contact your airline or travel company for the latest information before travelling.
Sea travel
Maritime facilities are under a high risk of attack. Maritime and sailing craft should take great care in the northern Persian Gulf. Vessels transiting the Gulf of Oman, Northern Arabian Sea, Gulf of Aden and Bab El Mandeb regions may be at increased risk of attack. You should consider any regional tensions that may affect your route.
Road travel
You need to have a 1968 International Driving Permit to drive in Iraq. 1926 IDPs previously issued by the UK may no longer be accepted. You can get IDPs over the counter from 2,500 UK Post Offices. You will not be able to buy an IDP outside the UK, so get one before you travel.
Road travel within Iraq remains highly dangerous and there continue to be fatal roadside bombings and attacks on military and civilian vehicles. False vehicle checkpoints have been used to launch attacks. There is also a risk of carjacking and robbery.
Road traffic accidents are frequent and often result in fatalities.
Consular assistance
Consular support is severely limited in Iraq. If you need urgent consular assistance, call the FCO in London on +44 (0)20 7008 1500. Or depending on your location please email baghdad.consular@fco.gov.uk or erbil.consular@fco.gov.uk for all enquiries The Embassy and Consulate-General’s ability to visit locations across Iraq is limited and travel to unsecure areas to deliver consular services may not be possible. This is further impacted due to COVID-19 measures.
Advice to business
A number of UK companies visit and operate successfully in Iraq. However, movement is restricted and companies nearly always travel with close protection security teams. Specific guidance for companies seeking to do business in Iraq can be found on the Department for International Trade (DIT) website. DIT are also able to put you in touch with companies operating in Iraq who offer security services. For more information see Operating in high-risk environments: Advice for business
