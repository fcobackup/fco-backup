This page has information on travelling to Macao.
This page reflects the UK government’s understanding of current rules for people travelling on a full ‘British Citizen’ passport from the UK, for the most common types of travel.
The authorities in Macao set and enforce entry rules. If you’re unsure how Macao’s entry requirements apply to you, contact its UK embassy, high commission or consulate.
All travellers
Residents of Macao, Hong Kong, Taiwan or mainland China and travellers from the UK and other specific countries are permitted entry. From 18 August travellers will no longer need to present proof of vaccination before boarding transport to Macao.
For information on visa requirements for entry to Macao and mainland China, see Visas section.
Testing / screening on arrival
Macao has introduced a QR three-colour code system, which replaces the previous digital health declaration needed at border checkpoints and for entering public administration premises, casinos and other venues. The new code requires its users to confirm whether they have been in COVID-19 quarantine at home or in a government-run facility and consists of three colours: red, yellow, green. Visitors receiving red or yellow codes may be subject to testing, hospitalisation or restrictions on their movements.
Quarantine requirements
Travellers who have visited Hong Kong or Taiwan 10 days prior to arriving in Macao, must hold a certificate of a negative result for COVID-19 nucleic acid test performed within the past 24 hours and will need to go to a designated place for up to 7 days of medical observation on arrival in Macao.
Travellers who arrive from Mainland China must hold a certificate of a negative result for COVID-19 nucleic acid test performed within the past 7 days, or past 24 hours if entering from Zhuhai, Guangdong. The Macao Special Administrative Region Government has placed further restrictions on arrivals from specific locations within Mainland China.
Travellers who arrive from specific foreign countries (including the UK) must hold a certificate of a negative test result for COVID-19 nucleic acid test performed within the past 48 hours and will need to undergo up to 7 days of medical observation.

Check your passport and travel documents before you travel
Passport validity
Your passport should be valid for a minimum period of one month from the date of entry into Macao. If you are staying longer than one month your passport must be valid for the duration of your visit.
Visas
Although Macao is now part of the People’s Republic of China, it remains a Special Administrative Region with its own immigration controls. You can stay in Macao for up to 6 months without a visa. If you intend to work in Macao you must get a visa before arrival. Contact the Macao Immigration Department.
Visas for mainland China
If you intend to travel to mainland China via Macao using a British passport you must get a Chinese visa before arrival at the border. Failure to do so could result in a fine and possible detention by the mainland Chinese authorities. If you’re entering Macao via mainland China and leaving again via the mainland you’ll need to have a double or multiple entry visa to re-enter mainland China.
There are reports of greater scrutiny from mainland authorities at border crossings into Macao at this time, including checks on travellers’ electronic devices.
