Libya is a cash society. There are severe shortages of cash and restrictions on bank withdrawals throughout the country. International credit cards are not accepted due to local financial restrictions.
The exchange of foreign currency into Libyan dinar is tightly controlled by the Libyan central bank. It is illegal to take Libyan dinar out of Libya. Accessing Libyan dinar through formal methods is difficult for travellers. Informal methods of currency exchange exist though their use carries the risk of arrest.
