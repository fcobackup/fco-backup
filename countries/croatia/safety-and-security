There have been a number of hoax bomb threats against shopping centres in Zagreb, causing disruption, including to transport. You should keep up to date with local developments and follow the advice of local authorities.
Crime
Crime levels are low and violent crime is rare.
Some tourists have been the victims of overcharging in so-called ‘Gentlemen’s Clubs’, sometimes amounting to thousands of Euros. Victims can be threatened with violence if they refuse to pay.
Take care in busy tourist areas, where pickpockets are known to operate. Avoid carrying large amounts of cash. Don’t leave valuables unattended, particularly on the beach. Use a hotel safe if possible.
Report all incidents of crime to the local police station and get a police report.
Local travel
If you’re planning to travel outside the normal tourist resorts, beware of unexploded mines in war-affected areas like Eastern Slavonia, Brodsko-Posavska County, Karlovac County, areas around Zadar County and in more remote areas of the Plitvice Lakes National Park. For more information about mine-affected areas visit the Civil Protection website (in Croatian only) or contact the Civil Protection offices.
If you’re travelling in these areas, avoid leaving cultivated land or marked paths. If in doubt seek local advice.
If you’re hiking in the mountains, seek expert advice from local guides, however tame the mountain might seem to you. The weather in the Croatian mountains can change quickly, even in summer and temperatures can get very low overnight. There have been reports of hikers getting lost in the mountains when they have gone out alone and left marked paths. You can find tips about mountaineering on the Croatian Mountain Rescue page and on Twitter HrvatskaGSS, as well as their maps. If you get into trouble, call the emergency number 112 and the Croatian Mountain Rescue Service will help you as best they can.
Road travel
In 2020, there were 237 road deaths in the Croatia (source: Department for Transport). This equates to 58 road deaths per 1,000,000 of population and compares to the UK average of 23 road deaths per 1,000,000 of population in 2020.

Licences and documents
UK driving licence holders may drive in Croatia on their UK licence for a period of up to 12 months. An International Driving Permit is not required.
Authorities may ask you to provide proof of ownership if you bring your own or rented vehicle into the country. Proof of ownership can de demonstrated by presenting a V5 log book both at the border or while driving. If you fail to produce this when asked, you will be refused entry or authorities might impound the car until you can prove ownership. Contact the Croatian Embassy in London if you have more detailed questions about bringing a vehicle in to the country. The British Embassy is unable to help individuals attempting to bring vehicles into Croatia and do not have the correct documents.
