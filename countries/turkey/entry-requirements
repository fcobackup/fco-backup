The information on this page covers the most common types of travel and reflects the UK government’s understanding of the rules currently in place. Unless otherwise stated, this information is for travellers using a full ‘British Citizen’ passport.
The authorities in the country or territory you’re travelling to are responsible for setting and enforcing the rules for entry. If you’re unclear about any aspect of the entry requirements, or you need further reassurance, you’ll need to contact the embassy, high commission or consulate of the country or territory you’re travelling to.
You should also consider checking with your transport provider or travel company to make sure your passport and other travel documents meet their requirements.
Visas
British nationals need a visa to enter Turkey, except for cruise ship passengers with ‘British Citizen’ passports who arrive at sea ports for tourist visits to the port city or nearby cities, provided that the visit doesn’t exceed 72 hours.
You can get an e-Visa online before you travel through the official Republic of Turkey e-Visa website. An e-visa costs $20 and you can pay using a credit or debit card. You can apply up to 3 months in advance of your travel date. Turkish visit visas issued on arrival are valid for multiple stays up to a maximum of 90 days in a 180 day period.
If you have any queries regarding e-Visas call the Visa Contact Centre (details provided by the Turkish Ministry of Foreign Affairs).
Some unauthorised websites may charge for information about e-Visas, and for submitting applications. These websites are not endorsed by or associated with the Turkish government. Be wary of such sites and businesses, particularly those that seek additional fees for other services. Some unauthorised websites have also issued fake e-Visas.
In case of problems with the computer systems at the Turkish port of entry, print off and carry a paper copy of your e-Visa, or make sure you have an electronic copy on a smart phone or other device to show to the immigration officer.
Until further notice British citizens can get a multiple entry visitor visa, valid for 90 days, on arrival at any port of entry on payment of £20 in cash (Scottish and Northern Irish currency is not accepted). However, the visa on arrival service is likely to be phased out at some point in the near future. To avoid possible problems or delays at the Turkish border, or when boarding your flight in the UK, get an e-Visa from the official website before you travel.
At Istanbul Ataturk airport (and possibly at other airports) there will be self service e-Visa kiosks and Wi-Fi areas where visitors can apply for an e-Visa on arrival using their own smart devices.
You can also apply for a visa before you travel from the Turkish Consulate General in London. If you’re planning to study or work in Turkey, or are unsure about the type of visa you require, you should apply for a visa before travel.
If you don’t have a ‘British Citizen’ passport, but hold a different type of British nationality (eg BN(O), British Overseas Citizen, British Protected Person or British Subject), check visa requirements with the Turkish Consulate General before you travel. These types of passport are classed as ‘UK Special Passports’ in the Turkish e-Visa system. You’ll need to apply for a visa from the Turkish Consulate General before you travel.
Make sure your passport has a blank page for the visa stamp. If it doesn’t, the Turkish authorities will issue an ‘Entry-Exit form’ and put your entry-exit stamp on there. You should carry this form with you in Turkey and present it to the border officers when you leave.
If you plan to remain in Turkey for a period of more than 90 days, you should either apply for a longer stay visa before you travel, or get a residence permit from the local authorities in Turkey before your 90 day stay has elapsed. If you intend to work in Turkey, ensure you have the correct permits. More information is available from the Turkish Ministry of the Interior. If you don’t abide by the terms of your visa or permit, you may be fined, deported and banned from re-entering the country.
If you’re entering Turkey via a land border crossing, make sure your passport has a dated entry stamp before you leave the border crossing area.
Passport validity
The Turkish government advise that your passport should be valid for at least 6 months from the date you enter Turkey. You can find more detail about the requirements for entry into Turkey on the website of the Turkish Ministry of Foreign Affairs.
Travelling with children
If you are leaving Turkey with a child who is a dual British-Turkish national, you may be asked to show the Turkish immigration authorities evidence that the Turkish parent has given permission for the child to travel.
Medication
The use or possession of some common prescription and over-the-counter medicines is controlled in Turkey. If you’re travelling with prescription medication you should carry a medical certificate confirming that the medicine has been prescribed for a medical condition. For more information on controlled medicines and the relevant documentation required, contact the nearest Turkish Embassy or Consulate before you travel. See our foreign travel checklist for further information.
UK Emergency Travel Documents
UK Emergency Travel Documents (ETD) are accepted for entry, airside transit and exit from Turkey within the dates printed on the document. ETDs should be valid for a minimum period of 6 months from the date of entry into Turkey.
