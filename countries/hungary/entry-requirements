This information is for people travelling on a full ‘British citizen’ passport from the UK. It is based on the UK government’s understanding of the current rules for the most common types of travel.
The authorities in Hungary set and enforce entry rules. If you’re not sure how these requirements apply to you, contact the Hungarian Embassy in the UK.
Passport validity requirements
Hungary follows Schengen area rules. Your passport must:
have a ‘date of issue’ less than 10 years before the date you arrive – if you renewed your passport before 1 October 2018, it may have a date of issue that is more than 10 years ago
have an ‘expiry date’ at least 3 months after the day you plan to leave the Schengen area (the expiry date does not need to be within 10 years of the date of issue)
Check with your travel provider that your passport and other travel documents meet requirements. Renew your passport if you need to.
You will be denied entry if you do not have a valid travel document or try to use a passport that has been reported lost or stolen.
Visa requirements
You can travel without a visa to the Schengen area, which includes Hungary, for up to 90 days in any 180-day period. This applies if you travel:
as a tourist
to visit family or friends
to attend business meetings, cultural or sports events
for short-term studies or training
The requirements for working in Hungary are different.  
If you’re travelling to other Schengen countries as well, make sure your whole visit is within the 90-day visa-free limit. Visits to Schengen countries in the 180 days before you travel count towards your 90 days. If you overstay the 90-day visa-free limit, you may be banned from entering Schengen countries for up to 3 years.
Make sure you get your passport stamped on entry and exit.
If you’re a visitor, border guards will look at your entry and exit stamps to check you have not overstayed the 90-day visa-free limit for the Schengen area. 
If your passport is missing a stamp, show evidence of when and where you entered or left the Schengen area (for example, boarding passes or tickets) and ask the border guards to add the date and location in your passport. 
At Hungarian border control, you may also need to:
show a return or onward ticket
prove you have enough money for your stay
show proof of accommodation, for example, a hotel booking
Staying longer than 90 days in a 180-day period
To stay longer, check which type of visa or work permit you need with the Hungarian Embassy in the UK.
For residence permits, see the National Directorate-General for Aliens Policing.
If you’re in Hungary with a residence permit or long-stay visa, this does not count towards your 90-day visa-free limit.
New Schengen entry requirements
From 12 October 2025, the European Union’s (EU) new Entry/Exit System (EES) will begin. When travelling into and out of the Schengen area, for short stays, you may need to:
have you fingerprints and your photo taken
answer the Schengen Border Code questions 
If you enter the Schengen area through the Port of Dover, Eurotunnel at Folkestone or St Pancras International, this information will be taken at the border, before you leave the UK. You may also need to provide either your fingerprint or photo when you leave the Schengen area.
EES may take each passenger a few extra minutes to complete so be prepared to wait longer than usual at the border once the system starts. 
Read more information on the EU Entry/Exit System and to understand which countries are in the Schengen area.
Customs rules
There are strict rules about goods you can take into and out of Hungary, including pets, hunting weapons, alcohol and tobacco products and some medicines. You must declare anything that may be prohibited or subject to tax or duty.
Taking food and drink into Hungary
You cannot take meat, milk or products containing them into EU countries. There are some exceptions such as powdered baby milk, baby food and special foods or pet feed required for medical reasons. 
Taking money into Hungary
Declare cash or travellers cheques if the value is 10,000 euros or more. You will get a certified declaration to show you brought it in with you. If you do not, your money could be seized when you leave.
