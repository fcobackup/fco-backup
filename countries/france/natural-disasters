Forest fires can occur anywhere in southern France during the summer months but especially along the Mediterranean coast and in Corsica. In recent years, fires have become more frequent due to drought and high temperatures. French Authorities may evacuate areas and close roads for safety reasons. If youâ€™re staying in a high-risk area you should familiarise yourself with the local safety and emergency procedures, be vigilant and follow the advice of local authorities. Information on how to stay safe is available on the French Government website. If you are caught in, or witness, a wild fire, call the emergency services on 18 or 112.
There can be risks of flooding in various areas of France, and avalanches in the mountainous areas. If your accommodation is near a river, check the vigicrues website to be kept informed of any potential flood risks. If you plan a skiing or hiking trip, check weather conditions and follow local advice before going.
