Warning
FCDO advises against all travel to parts of Turkey.

Before you travel check that:
your destination can provide the healthcare you may need
you have appropriate travel insurance for local treatment or unexpected medical evacuation
This is particularly important if you have a health condition or are pregnant.
Emergency medical number
Dial 112 and ask for an ambulance.
Contact your insurance or medical assistance company promptly if you’re referred to a medical facility for treatment.
Vaccine recommendations and health risks
At least 8 weeks before your trip:
check the latest vaccine recommendations for Turkey
see where to get vaccines and whether you have to pay on the NHS travel vaccinations page
See what health risks you’ll face in Turkey.
Altitude sickness is a risk in parts of Turkey. Read more about altitude sickness on TravelHealthPro.
Medication
The legal status and regulation of some medicines prescribed or bought in the UK can be different in other countries.
British prescriptions are not accepted in pharmacies in Turkey. In some cases, you may be able to liaise with Turkish hospitals and your GP to arrange for a Turkish prescription for the equivalent medicine.
Some common medicines are controlled in Turkey. See more information about the documentation you need, or contact the nearest Turkish embassy or consulate.

Healthcare in Turkey
FCDO has a list of medical providers in Turkey where some staff will speak English.
The European Health Insurance Card  and Global Health Insurance card are not valid in Turkey.
Travel and mental health
Read FCDO guidance on travel and mental health. There is also mental health guidance on TravelHealthPro.
Medical tourism
Medical tourism is when people travel to have medical, surgical or dental treatment abroad. Cosmetic surgery, dental procedures and cardiac surgery are the most common procedures for medical tourists.
The standard of medical facilities and available treatments can vary widely globally and also within countries. We are aware of six British nationals having died in Turkey in 2023 following medical procedures. Some British nationals have also experienced complications and needed further treatment or surgery following their procedure.
If you are considering travelling to Turkey for medical, surgical or dental treatment:
discuss plans with your UK doctor, dentist or clinician before going ahead
do your own research - private companies have a financial interest in booking your treatment and their literature should not be your only source of information
See more details about the risks of going abroad for elective surgery.
The Turkish Ministry of Health provides a list of its approved medical providers on the HealthTurkiye website.
The Foreign, Commonwealth & Development Office (FCDO) does not give any endorsement of the competence or suitability of any practitioner or facility.
