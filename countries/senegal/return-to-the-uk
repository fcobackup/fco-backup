There are currently limited commercial options available to return to the UK from Senegal. The Government of Senegal has closed land borders and airspace has been closed to commercial airlines except for flights with ‘special authorisation’.
We know this is concerning for British people trying to leave Senegal. The UK government is working closely with airlines, the Senegal authorities and other governments to make sure options are available for you to return to the UK as soon as possible.
If you cannot leave Senegal at this time, see advice on staying in Senegal during coronavirus.
Future Options
Commercial options via France
Air France flights to Paris are scheduled to depart each Monday and Wednesday throughout June. You can buy tickets from Air France (Senegal).
There are also twice weekly flights to Paris with Air Senegal in June on Wednesdays and Fridays. You can buy tickets from the Air Senegal website.

The British Embassy in Dakar is asking all British nationals currently in Senegal to make themselves known to the Embassy by emailing UKinSenegal@fco.gov.uk.
You will need to pay for your return travel to the UK. If departure options are available but you cannot afford the travel costs and have exhausted all other options for getting funds, you may be eligible to apply for an emergency loan from the government. This is a last resort option and you would need to repay the loan when you are back in the UK.
For more information, you should contact Corporate Travel Management (CTM). CTM are a commercial partner of the FCO and are authorised to administer such loans on behalf of the FCO.
Travelling to the airport
If you’re travelling to the airport, you should plan to arrive in time to respect the curfew and for your driver to also be able to return in time.
The British Embassy understands that you should be able to travel to the airport for a flight that has ‘special authorisation’, but you should expect to show your travel documents (passport and plane ticket) to any officials that may stop you during your journey. Make sure that your driver has photocopies of these documents to justify travel during their return journey.
Carte d’etranger
It is not currently possible to obtain a “carte d’etranger” due to coronavirus restrictions.
If you have been in Senegal for over 3 months, Senegalese authorities have advised this should not present a problem when leaving Senegal, provided that the 3 month period expired after the State of Emergency was put in place (23 March).
Your journey home: re-entering the UK
When you return, you must follow the rules for entering the UK. You:
need to provide your journey and contact details up to 48 hours before you’re due to arrive in the UK
are not allowed to leave the place you’re staying for the first 14 days you’re in the UK except in very limited situations (known as ‘self-isolating’)
See also the list of people who are exempt from the border rules.
The National Travel Health Network and Centre (NaTHNaC) also provides advice on how to stay safe as you travel by air.
