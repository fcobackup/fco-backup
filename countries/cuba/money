From 1 January 2021 the Cuban Convertible Peso (CUC) – previously the currency used by visitors – was removed from circulation as part of the Cuban government’s currency reform. Thereafter, the Cuban National Peso (CUP known as ‘moneda nacional’) is the only legal cash currency in Cuba, although private hotels, bars and restaurants usually accept cash payments in dollars or euros. Sterling is not widely accepted.
You should not take CUP out of the country. Allow plenty of time to change any remaining Cuban currency at the airport. You will need to show your boarding pass to exchange currency. There may be limited international currencies available at that time so you may not be able to change all the Cuban currency that you have. It is recommended to have Euros, pounds sterling or Canadian dollars for cash payments in duty free shops or cafes in the departure area after immigration.
Don’t change money anywhere other than at Cadeca exchange houses, large hotels or banks, due to the prevalence of forged currency. Always check transactions carefully. Where possible ask for a mix of denominations. Ignore individuals offering exchange facilities to avoid queues.
Check with your bank before you travel to confirm that your debit, credit and ATM cards will work in Cuba. If your bank can’t confirm this then you should bring cash, or travellers cheques. Bank notes should be in good condition with no tears, rips or markings. Scottish bank notes cannot be exchanged. From 21 June 2021, Cuban banks stopped accepting cash bank deposits in US dollars. This makes it difficult to exchange US dollars.
Travellers cheques and credit cards drawn on American banks aren’t widely accepted. There are virtually no ATMs available for drawing cash against Cirrus or Switch cards. Credit card transactions, including withdrawals from ATMs, are subject to local commission charges of approximately 3% in addition to your bank transaction charges.
Many international hotel shops now only accept payment by credit card, and not in CUP. Check with your hotel or tour operator before you travel.
