Travel in Peru
On 15 March 2020, Peru announced a national State of Emergency, which has now been extended until 31 October 2020. The regulations are:
A nationwide curfew between the hours of 11pm and 4am
A ban on the use of private cars on Sundays
social and family gatherings and visits are prohibited
special measures are in place for those under 12 and over 65, and people at risk.
children under 12 must stay at home. Each day they are allowed to leave their house for 60 minutes but must remain within 500 meters of their house, and avoid crowded places. When outside, children must be accompanied by an adult who lives with them and maintain a two-meter social distance
It is recommended that people over 65 and those who have underlying health conditions must stay at home, with some exceptions; risk groups must not receive visits at home and must avoid the physical contact with people who leave their home
everyone must wear face masks outside of homes
in addition to wearing a face mask, everyone must wear facial protectors (usually a clear plastic full-face covering) when on public transport.
Future changes to curfew rules will be announced by the President.
If you are leaving Peru on a repatriation or commercial flight and your approved period of stay in Peru has expired during the state of emergency, your visa fine should be waived by the Immigration authorities.
Relaxing of restrictions
The Peruvian government has approved a four-phase Economic Reactivation Plan, between May and August which involves relaxing some restrictions and reopening some industry sectors such as Industry and Mining, Construction, Trade and Tourism and Services.
This planned relaxation of industry restrictions remains under review and continues to change.
Commercial international travel resumed on 5 October within the Latin American region. This will be extended to destinations up to 8 hours flight to/from Peru in November. Passengers need to wear a face mask, a face shield/visor and need to have proof of a negative result from a COVID-19 PCR (molecular) test taken 72 hours before any commercial flight. Repatriation flights to Europe are expected to continue. Please note that if passengers arrive in Peru with symptoms of COVID-19, they will be asked to self-isolate by the Peruvian authorities.
