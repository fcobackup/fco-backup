See Local travel and Terrorism
Before you travel, check the ‘Entry requirements’ section for Côte d’Ivoire’s current entry restrictions and requirements. These may change with little warning. Monitor this advice for the latest updates and stay in contact with your travel provider.
If you plan to pass through another country to return to the UK, check the travel advice for the country you’re transiting.
It is more important than ever to get travel insurance and check it provides sufficient cover. See the FCDO’s guidance on foreign travel insurance.
Protests and demonstrations in the country are likely to occur. You should exercise caution and avoid all demonstrations, large crowds, political gatherings and rallies. See Safety and security
Terrorists are likely to try to carry out attacks in Côte d’Ivoire. There is an increased risk of terrorism and kidnap in northern border areas, due to the porous nature of borders into the Sahel region. However, there remains a risk elsewhere in the country. Attacks on beach resorts, hotels, cafés and restaurants visited by foreigners are possible and could occur without warning. Be especially vigilant in these places. See Terrorism
You will need to get a visa before you travel. See Visas
Violent crime can occur at any time. Be particularly vigilant and take care when travelling by road, especially at night. See Crime.
The British Embassy in Abidjan can provide emergency consular assistance. Consular support is not available in parts of Côte d’Ivoire where the FCDO advises against all but essential travel.
The Overseas Business Risk service offers information and advice for British companies operating overseas on how to manage political, economic, and business security-related risks.
