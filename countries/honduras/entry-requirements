This information is for people travelling on a full ‘British citizen’ passport from the UK. It is based on the UK government’s understanding of Honduras current rules for the most common types of travel. 
The authorities in Honduras set and enforce entry rules. If you’re not sure how these requirements apply to you, contact the Honduran Embassy in the UK (Spanish language website).
Passport validity requirements
To enter Honduras, your passport must have an ‘expiry date’ at least 6 months after the date you arrive and at least 2 blank pages. Check with your travel provider that your passport and other travel documents meet requirements. Renew your passport if you need to.
You will be denied entry if you do not have a valid travel document or try to use a passport that has been reported lost or stolen.
Visa requirements
You must have a visa to visit Honduras.
However, passengers of cruise ships are permitted to enter Honduras under a “short pass”. This allows passengers to disembark during the hours the ship is docked in Honduras (usually less than a day). If passengers remain in Honduras beyond the hours of docking a visa will be required. Check with your cruise line or with your nearest Honduran Embassy for further information.
Applying for a visa
 Find out  how to apply for a Honduran visa (Spanish language website) in London from the Honduran Embassy.
If you are not in the UK, contact the nearest Honduras Embassy for information and instructions about how to apply for a visa. You can also contact the National Institute of Migration (Spanish language website).
To work, study or for business travel, you must meet the Honduran government’s entry requirements. Check which type of visa or work permit you need with the Honduran Embassy (Spanish language website).
If you overstay, you may get a fine that you must pay before you leave Honduras. For information on how to extend your stay or pay a fine, contact the National Institute of Migration (Spanish language website).
Make sure you get your passport stamped.
You will get a 30-day visit entry stamp in your passport when you arrive. Make sure the border control officer puts a stamp in your passport otherwise you may get a fine. If your passport is missing a stamp, return to the immigration desk, or go to the National Institute of Migration in Tegucigalpa as soon as possible.
You can apply at an immigration office to extend your stay.
Travelling through Honduras
If you’re travelling through Honduras to another country (sometimes called ‘transiting’), you must follow Honduran entry requirements even if you do not pass through immigration. Contact the National Institute of Migration (Spanish language website) for information.
Travelling to El Salvador, Guatemala and Nicaragua
Visitors can travel between El Salvador, Guatemala, Honduras and Nicaragua for up to 90 days, under the Central America Border Control Agreement (also known as CA-4). However, from 15 August British nationals are required to have a visa. Check with the Honduran Embassy in London for information on how this CA-4 agreement would be applied to you.
The 90-day period starts when you enter any of these countries and does not restart when you cross borders. You’ll have to go through immigration checks at borders. If you’re expelled from one of these countries, you’re also excluded from the other 3.
If you wish to extend your stay, contact the National Institute of Migration (Spanish language website) in Honduras. If you overstay, you may get a fine.
Travellers aged 20 and under
To enter or exit Honduras, people aged 20 and under travelling alone or with only one parent or legal guardian must have a notarised letter in Spanish from the parents or guardians not travelling with them. Contact the Honduran Embassy (Spanish language website), or if you’re in Honduras the nearest National Institute of Migration (Spanish language website), for information about what documents you need. Single parents will need additional documents.
Airport tax
There is an airport departure tax for international flights of 48.44 US dollars (or the same amount in Honduran lempiras). This is normally included in the cost of your ticket.
There is also a departure tax for domestic flights of 54.13 Honduran lempiras (or the same amount in US dollars).
Land border fee
If you arrive at or depart from a land border, the immigration authorities will charge you a fee of 3 US dollars. Keep the receipt until you leave Honduras and make sure you get a stamp in your passport.
Vaccine requirements
You may need a yellow fever certificate for onward travel to some other countries, due to the risk of yellow fever in Honduras.
For full details about medical entry requirements and recommended vaccinations, see TravelHealthPro’s Honduras guide.
Customs rules
There are strict rules about goods you can take into or out of Honduras. You must declare anything that may be prohibited or subject to tax or duty.
You must complete the Government of Honduras’ customs declaration form prior to entering or leaving the country. After completing the online form, you must present the QR code to the customs authorities, either on paper or electronically.
