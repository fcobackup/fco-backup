Flights, primarily from MIAT, Korean Air, Aeroflot and Turkish Airlines, are leaving Mongolia on a more regular basis. You should contact the airlines direct for details and to purchase tickets.
As further information becomes available it will be shared on these pages and on the British Embassy Ulaanbaatar Twitter and Facebook sites.
You will need to pay for your return travel to the UK. If departure options are available but you cannot afford the travel costs and have exhausted all other options for getting funds, you may be eligible to apply for an emergency loan from the government. This is a last resort option and you would need to repay the loan when you’re back in the UK.
