International travel
The Tunisian government has put into place additional health measures and travel restrictions for travellers from the UK following the emergence of a new strain of COVID-19. On 21 December, the Tunisian government suspended entry for all travellers coming from or transiting through the UK, or other countries where new strains of COVID-19 have been detected. On 24 December, the Tunisian government announced that there will be a system of authorisation to permit travel from the UK to Tunisia in exceptional circumstances. Details of how this system will function have not yet been published.
If you are travelling from a different country and transiting through an EU country on your way back to the UK, or on the way to Tunisia, you should be aware that on 22 October, the EU removed Tunisia from its ‘white list’ of countries. This means that travel between Tunisia and any of the EU’s 27 member states is no longer advised. This decision is not legally binding and EU countries decide their own border rules. You should consult the EU country’s latest government advice before travelling and check travel advice for countries on your route.

If you think you have COVID-19 symptoms, you should call a doctor or lab. They will ask a series of questions to assess whether it is likely that you have COVID-19. If COVID-19 is suspected, then they may arrange for someone to come to your home or hotel to conduct a test and they will advise you to self-isolate.
