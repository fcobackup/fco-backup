The FCO advise against all travel to the whole country.

The Foreign, Commonwealth & Development Office (FCDO) advises against all travel to Chad based on the current assessment of security risks given recent events.
The FCDO advises British nationals in Chad to leave the country as soon as possible. On 11 April an armed convoy belonging to the rebel group “Le front pour l’alternance et la concorde au Tchad” (FACT) crossed into Chad from Libya and engaged in fighting with government forces. The rebel group was reportedly heading towards N’Djamena. The situation is still judged to be unstable and tensions remain high across the country.
On 20 April, the Chadian army announced the death of President Déby, increasing the risk of instability in the capital N’Djamena and the wider country. The national curfew announced following the death of President Débyhas now been lifted. Land and air borders have now been reopened.
On 27 April, there were violent clashes between protesters and security forces in N’Djamena and southern Chad. A number of people were killed, with reports of live ammunition being used against demonstrators. On 2 May a number of people were wounded when security forces reportedly fired live bullets on demonstrators in southern Chad. Further protests are planned in N’Djamena on 8 May. You should consider whether any journey is necessary and exercise extra vigilance and caution, avoiding any demonstrations or large gatherings of people. See Safety and security
Consular support in Chad is provided remotely from the British High Commission in Cameroon. British Nationals in Chad requiring consular assistance should phone + 237 222 22 07 96. Consular officers are available 24/7 to assist with your enquiries. Other services of the UK Government Office in N’Djamena are temporarily suspended and all diplomatic staff have been withdrawn.
Commercial flights are the best way for you and your family to exit the country. However, due to the current security situation, services may be reduced. If you are looking to leave the country, plan in advance if possible and check the status of your flight with the service provider. For all bookings, contact the airline directly or your travel provider.

Terrorists are very likely to try to carry out attacks in Chad. Attacks could be indiscriminate, including in places visited by foreigners. There’s a threat of retaliatory attacks following the French intervention in Mali and due to Chad’s involvement in the regional fight to counter Boko Haram. There is a heightened threat of kidnap in Chad. See Terrorism
