This page gives you guidance on how to stay safely in Turkey as a visitor, if you are unable to return to the UK.
Everyone should comply with the measures put in place in Turkey to limit the spread of coronavirus (COVID-19).
Moving around in Turkey
For information on entering Turkey, see Entry Requirements.
The wearing of masks is obligatory throughout Turkey in crowded places and specifically in markets and supermarkets, hairdressers and barber shops. The wearing of masks is also compulsory on all public transport, including Metro, buses, taxis and ferries, and in some areas, masks must be worn when travelling in private vehicles with more than one person.
In addition to the above, the wearing of face masks is mandatory at all times outside the home in the following cities and provinces -– Adana, Adıyaman, Afyonkarahisar, Amasya, Aydın, Balıkesir, Bartın, Bolu, Burdu, Denizli, Düzce, Eskişehir, Gaziantep, Gümüşhane, Isparta, İzmir, Kahramanmaraş, Karabük, Kastamonu, Kayseri, Kırıkkale, Kırklareli, Kocaeli, Konya, Muğla, Rize, Sakarya, Şanlıurfa, Siirt, Tunceli and Uşak.
Measures may vary across provinces and new measures may be introduced at short notice. Follow Turkish announcements and local media for up to date information.
All residents wishing to undertake intercity travel using public transport are required to obtain an “HES” (“Hayat Eve Sığar”) code. This can be done through the e-Devlet system.
British nationals who do not have a residence card can travel without a HES code until midnight on 5 June. From 6 June, a HES code may be obtained by sending passport details by SMS to 2023 in the following format: HES [space] Nationality [space] passport number [space] year of birth [space] the number of days you will be travelling, plus 7 days.
Turkey has now lifted most restrictions on internal travel. However, you will still need a travel permit if you are over 65 and you must remain at your destination for a minimum of 30 days unless travelling for an international flight. Individuals under 18 no longer require a permit to either travel within the same city, or undertake intercity travel. When travelling they must, however, be accompanied by a parent or guardian, aged below 65 years of age.
Curfews
There remains an ongoing curfew for those aged over 65, those born after 1 January 2002, and those who have a chronic medical condition, with the following exceptions:
Adults over 65 years old will be allowed outside, within walking distance of their home, on Sundays between 2pm to 8pm
Children under 18 years old will be allowed outside, within walking distance of their home, on Wednesdays and Fridays between 2pm and 8pm
Beyond these exemptions, people in these categories must not leave their homes. See “Moving around in Turkey” if you fall into one of these categories and need to travel.
Domestic travel
A reduced schedule of domestic flights will commence from 4th June.
Train services between (Ankara-Konya, Ankara-Istanbul, Ankara-Eskisehir and Konya-Istanbul) are operating on a reduced timetable with 4 services per day.
Visas
Turkish authorities have confirmed that any foreign nationals who overstay their visa, due to COVID-19, will not face any fines or penalties.

Finance
There is a range of financial support from the government that you can access while you are unable to return due to coronavirus restrictions.
If you’re in Turkey, and have exhausted all other options to cover essential living costs while you wait to return home, you can apply for an emergency loan for your living costs from the UK government. You can only apply if you normally live in the UK and you cannot return home. This last-resort option is for those most in need, and you would need to repay the loan when you are back in the UK. Apply for an emergency loan.

Help and support
If you need urgent consular assistance, contact your nearest British embassy, high commission or consulate. All telephone numbers are available 24/7.
