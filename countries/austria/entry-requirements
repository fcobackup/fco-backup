The information on this page covers the most common types of travel and reflects the UK government’s understanding of the rules currently in place. Unless otherwise stated, this information is for travellers using a full ‘British Citizen’ passport.
The authorities in the country or territory you’re travelling to are responsible for setting and enforcing the rules for entry. If you’re unclear about any aspect of the entry requirements, or you need further reassurance, you’ll need to contact the embassy, high commission or consulate of the country or territory you’re travelling to.
You should also consider checking with your transport provider or travel company to make sure your passport and other travel documents meet their requirements.
Restrictions in response to coronavirus (COVID-19)
Entry to Austria
The Austrian government have announced that, effective from Midnight Tuesday 22 December, a flight ban will be imposed on flights from the UK. Precise details have not yet been published.
If you are travelling before 22 December you must quarantine for 10 days upon arrival in Austria. You have the option of taking a self-funded PCR or antigen test after 5 days (the day you arrive in Austria counts as day 0). If your result is negative, you will no longer need to stay in quarantine.
You must fill out and sign a quarantine form, ideally before you travel. You will have to hand this in upon arrival.
The following exceptions do not need to quarantine:
Anyone transiting through Austria
Anyone commuting across borders for work or regular visits to immediate family and partners
Business travellers, if on entry you can show you have had a negative PCR or antigen test within the last 72 hours
Diplomats with accreditation in Austria, if on entry you can show they have had a negative PCR or antigen test within the last 72 hours Entry to Austria without having to quarantine is possible if you have spent the 10 days preceding travel in a country on the Austrian government’s “Anlage A” list.
You should not use the NHS testing service to get a test in order to facilitate your travel to another country. You should arrange to take a private test.
Transit Austria
If you’re transiting through Austria without a stopover, you do not need a medical certificate if you can prove you are transiting.
Neighbouring countries may be restricting movement across borders and conducting health checks. Check the travel advice for any country you need to travel through.
Regular entry requirements
Visas
If you hold a British Citizen passport, you don’t need a visa to enter Austria. If you’re planning a stay of longer than 3 months, see our Living in Austria guide and contact the Austrian Embassy if you have further questions.
The rules on travel will stay the same until 31 December 2020.
Visas from 1 January 2021
The rules for travelling or working in Europe will change from 1 January 2021:
you will be able to travel to countries in the Schengen area for up to 90 days in any 180-day period without a visa as a tourist, to visit family or friends, to attend business meetings, cultural or sports events, or for short-term studies or training
if you are travelling to Austria and other Schengen countries without a visa, make sure your whole visit is within the limit. Visits to Schengen countries within the previous 180 days before you travel would count towards the 90-day limit
To stay for longer, to work or study, for business or for other reasons, you will need to meet the entry requirements set out by Austria. This could mean applying for a visa and/or work permit. You should check with the Austrian Embassy what type of visa and/or work permit, if any, you will need.
if you are in Austria with a visa or permit, your stay will not count towards the 90-day limit.
The 90-day limit for visa-free travel will begin on 1 January 2021. Any days you stay in Austria or other Schengen countries before 1 January 2021 will not count towards the 90-day limit.
At border control for Austria, you may need to:
show a return or onward ticket
show you have enough money for your stay, and
use separate lanes from EU, EEA and Swiss citizens when queueing
Your passport may be stamped on entry and exit.
Passport validity
The rules on travel will stay the same until 31 December 2020.
Your passport should be valid for the proposed duration of your stay; you do not need any additional period of validity on your passport beyond this.
Passport validity from 1 January 2021
From 1 January 2021, you must have at least 6 months left on an adult or child passport to travel to most countries in Europe (not including Ireland).
If you renewed your current passport before the previous one expired, extra months may have been added to its expiry date. Any extra months on your passport over 10 years may not count towards the 6 months needed.
Check your passport is valid for travel before you book your trip. You will need to renew your passport before travelling if you do not have enough time left on your passport.
Travelling with children
If you are a single parent, or travelling with a child who is not your own, you will need documentary evidence of parental responsibility and a letter of consent. For further information on exactly what will be required at immigration contact the Austrian Embassy in London.
UK Emergency Travel Documents
UK Emergency Travel Documents are accepted for entry, airside transit and exit from Austria.
