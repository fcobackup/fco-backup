The information on this page covers the most common types of travel and reflects the UK government’s understanding of the rules currently in place. Unless otherwise stated, this information is for travellers using a full ‘British Citizen’ passport.
The authorities in the country or territory you’re travelling to are responsible for setting and enforcing the rules for entry. If you’re unclear about any aspect of the entry requirements, or you need further reassurance, you’ll need to contact the embassy, high commission or consulate of the country or territory you’re travelling to.
You should also consider checking with your transport provider or travel company to make sure your passport and other travel documents meet their requirements.
Entry rules in response to coronavirus (COVID-19)
Entry to Belgium
If you plan to travel to Belgium by air or boat you must complete the Passenger Locator Form. If you’re travelling by another means of transport, and plan to stay for more than 48 hours in Belgium, or return to Belgium after a stay of more than 48 hours abroad, you must also complete the form.Details of entry and exit restrictions are available from the Belgian government.
Belgium has reopened its borders for travel to and from certain countries, including the UK.
The Belgian Government has introduced a traffic light system of high, medium and low risk regions. Travellers entering Belgium from high risk (red) regions will be required to take a test and to self-isolate for 7 days, provided you take a test on day 5 and that test result is negative for COVID-19. If you test positive for COVID-19 on day 5, you will have to remain in self-isolation for a further 7 days. You should check the map on the Belgian Ministry of Foreign Affairs website (in English) for the latest information on affected regions. Check the map frequently, including both before and during your travel, as the zones are updated regularly.
Regular entry requirements
Visas
If you hold a British Citizen passport, you don’t need a visa to enter Belgium. If you’re planning a stay of longer than 3 months, see our Living in Belgium guide and contact the Belgian Embassy if you have further questions.
The rules on travel will stay the same until 31 December 2020.
Visas from 1 January 2021
The rules for travelling or working in Europe will change from 1 January 2021:
You will be able to travel to countries in the Schengen area for up to 90 days in any 180-day period without a visa for purposes such as tourism. This is a rolling 180-day period.
Therefore, if you’re travelling to Belgium, previous visits to the Schengen area within the 180 days before your date of travel would count against the 90-day limit.
If you are travelling visa-free to Belgium and to other countries in the Schengen area, make sure your whole visit is within the limit.
To stay for longer, to work or study, or for business travel you will need to meet the entry requirements set out by Belgium. This could mean applying for a visa or work permit. You should check with the Belgian Embassy what type of visa, if any, you will need.
Periods of stay authorised under a visa or permit will not count against the 90-day limit.
The European Commission has not yet set out how the limit of 90 days in any 180-day period for visa-free travel will be implemented for those who are already travelling in the EU or Schengen Area on 31 December 2020.
If you are travelling to Belgium before 31 December 2020 and will stay until 1 January 2021 or later, you should check with the Belgium Embassy for information on how the 90-day visa-free limit will apply to you. This also applies if your stay includes travel to other Schengen area countries.
At border control for Belgium, you may need to:
show a return or onward ticket
show you have enough money for your stay
use separate lanes from EU, EEA and Swiss citizens when queueing
Your passport may be stamped on entry and exit.
Passport validity
The rules on travel will stay the same until 31 December 2020.
Your passport should be valid for the proposed duration of your stay; you do not need any additional period of validity on your passport beyond this.
Passport validity from 1 January 2021
From 1 January 2021, you must have at least 6 months left on an adult or child passport to travel to most countries in Europe (not including Ireland).
If you renewed your current passport before the previous one expired, extra months may have been added to its expiry date. Any extra months on your passport over 10 years may not count towards the 6 months needed.
Check your passport is valid for travel before you book your trip. You will need to renew your passport before travelling if you do not have enough time left on your passport.
UK Emergency Travel Documents
UK Emergency Travel Documents (ETDs) are accepted for entry, airside transit and exit from Belgium.
