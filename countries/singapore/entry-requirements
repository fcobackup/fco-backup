This page has information on travelling to Singapore. Check what you must do to return to the UK.
This page reflects the UK government’s understanding of current rules for people travelling on a full ‘British Citizen’ passport from the UK, for the most common types of travel.
The authorities in Singapore set and enforce entry rules.
All travellers
In general, British citizens do not need a visa to transit or enter Singapore. It’s up to Immigration and Checkpoints Authority to decide who can enter Singapore.
There are other measures in place for foreign crew working on ships, small vessels, or pleasure crafts at one of Singapore’s marinas. See guidelines for air/sea crew and pleasure craft owners. Check with your employer or agent for any specific COVID-19 rules at the marina.
Singapore has strict rules on:
wearing masks in indoor settings and on public transport
gathering in groups
being fully vaccinated to enter public buildings, eat out and join some activities
scanning in and out of public venues with the TraceTogether app/token
testing, self-isolation and quarantine, whenever these are required
Breaking these rules can lead to a lengthy investigation, fines, or a prison sentence. See Coronavirus section.
If you’re fully vaccinated (from 1st April 2022)
From 1 April 2022 Singapore’s Vaccinated Travel Lane scheme ends. If you are travelling before 1 April, see the Safe travel website.
From 1 April 2022 if you’re fully vaccinated, you can enter Singapore without needing to quarantine. You must:
be fully vaccinated and have digital or physical copies of your vaccination status
take the required COVID-19 tests within two days before departure and be able to show the result in the required format. Pre-departure tests are required for those entering Singapore by air or sea, but not for those entering by land from Malaysia (foreign vehicles entering Singapore from Malaysia must pre-register here
Children aged 12 years and under who are unvaccinated but travelling with fully-vaccinated parents or guardians can enter Singapore. This includes children turning 12 years old in 2022.
If you’re fully vaccinated and you’ve recovered from COVID-19 in the past three months, you may be exempt from taking COVID-19 tests.
See the Safe Travel website for complete information.
What happens if you test positive for COVID-19
You’ll need to self-isolate at the hotel or home you’re staying in. What happens next will depend on whether you’re well or unwell. See Ask MOH. Breaking self-isolation or quarantine orders is an offence. See Coronavirus section.
Proof of vaccination status
You must show proof that you have been fully vaccinated to enter Singapore.
Singapore will accept the UK’s proof of COVID-19 vaccination record. Your NHS appointment card from vaccination centres is not designed to be used as proof of vaccination and should not be used to demonstrate your vaccine status.
If you’re on a short-term pass in Singapore, you’ll have to download the TraceTogether app or buy a TraceTogether token to scan in and out of public venues.
If you’re not fully vaccinated
If you are not fully vaccinated you cannot enter Singapore unless you are a Singapore Citizen or Permanent Resident. However, it is possible to apply for permission for unvaccinated people to enter for exceptional reasons, such as for unvaccinated children (aged 13-17 years old) of long-term pass holders, or for compassionate grounds. Unvaccinated travellers given permission to enter must undergo 7 days of quarantine on arrival followed by a PCR test and obtain travel insurance with a minimum of S$30,000 to cover any COVID-19 related medical charges. For details, visit Safe Travel.
Children and young people
Children aged 13 and above in 2022 (including 12-year-olds turning 13 this year) must be fully vaccinated to travel to Singapore. Those who have had only one dose must apply for permission by visiting Safe Travel.
Children aged 12 years and under who are unvaccinated but travelling with fully-vaccinated parents or guardians can enter Singapore. This includes children turning 12 years old in 2022.
Children born before 2022 are subject to a pre-departure test if arriving by air or sea.
See Singapore’s Safe Travel website for full guidelines.
If you’re transiting through Singapore
Transiting is when you pass through one country on the way to your final destination.
Check with your airline if it has approval to transit through Singapore.
All passengers transiting Changi Airport for less than 24 hours are not required to have proof of a pre-departure test.
If you recently recovered from COVID-19, different rules apply depending on your vaccination status.
You do not need a visa for an airside transit in Singapore.
More information about transiting through Singapore can be found on the Transiting through Singapore page of the Safe Travel website.
