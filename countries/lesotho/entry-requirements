The information on this page covers the most common types of travel and reflects the UK government’s understanding of the rules currently in place. Unless otherwise stated, this information is for travellers using a full ‘British Citizen’ passport.
The authorities in the country or territory you’re travelling to are responsible for setting and enforcing the rules for entry. If you’re unclear about any aspect of the entry requirements, or you need further reassurance, you’ll need to contact the embassy, high commission or consulate of the country or territory you’re travelling to.
You should also consider checking with your transport provider or travel company to make sure your passport and other travel documents meet their requirements.
Restrictions in response to coronavirus
Entry and borders
Lesotho’s borders are closed for all but essential trade.
SAA Airlink flights between Maseru and Johannesburg Airport have been suspended.
Moshoeshoe International Airport and the border crossing points at Maseru Bridge, Caledonspoort (Butha Buthe), Maputsoe Bridge, Qacha’s Nek Bridge and Vanrooyens Gate (Mafeteng) remain open, but with reduced operating hours, for conveyance of essential goods and services only.
Entry and exit to Lesotho is allowed with approval from the Ministry of Home Affairs to provide or receive emergency medical services for a life threatening condition.
Travel via South Africa
South Africa has put in place travel restrictions and visa requirements for individuals from countries affected by coronavirus, including the United Kingdom. Follow our travel advice for South Africa and consult your nearest South African High Commission.
If you’re in Lesotho, see Return to the UK for further details on requesting special permission to enter South Africa to enable you to return to the UK.
Health screening
Anyone entering Lesotho will be screened for coronavirus. You should also comply with any additional screening measures by the authorities if asked. Anyone showing symptoms of coronavirus may be placed in an isolation facility in a government hospital.
All individuals who have been in coronavirus-affected areas within the past 14 days, including the UK, are required to self-quarantine at their permanent or temporary place of residence for 14 days. This may be monitored by health officials. This self-isolation period may be required to take place in a government-nominated hotel at the visitor’s expense.
If you need further information about entry requirements, contact the local immigration authorities or the nearest Lesotho High Commission.
