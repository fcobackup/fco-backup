Medical clearance
The state Government of Kerala has advised any foreign nationals who have been in quarantine or self-isolation must have a medical clearance certificate before they can board outbound international flights. You must contact your local COVID 19 District Cell to begin the medical clearance process.
Travel to the airport
Do not travel to the airport without a confirmed ticket, as tickets will not be on sale at the airport.
Once you have a ticket, you will receive guidance on how to travel to the airport.
The British High Commission will provide transport to the airport for passengers where possible and submit the necessary permissions to the Indian government. The address that you provide will be where you are picked up from (unless you are asked to meet at a muster point), so you must provide accurate information.
You should not make your own way to the airport due to ongoing restrictions in India, unless in exceptional circumstances we are not able to arrange transport for you.
It may not be possible to buy food or water on the way to the airport, so get these before you travel.
You should allow plenty of time to get to the airport or your muster point as travelling may be more difficult than normal. You should make sure you are able to show authorities:
proof of a booked flight (a boarding pass if possible)
your passport
At the airport
You will not be able to travel if you are currently showing coronavirus symptoms (you will need to self-isolate and travel later). There will be mandatory healthcare screening at the airport. You should comply with any additional screening measures put in place by the authorities prior to your departure. If you travel to the airport when you have symptoms, you may be moved to a mandatory quarantine facility for further testing.
Arrival in the UK
When you arrive back in the UK, follow the guidance for when you return to the UK on steps you should take to protect yourself and others.
Future options
The British High Commission is in contact with airlines, the Indian authorities and other governments to make sure commercial options for returning to the UK are available as soon as possible.
Booking portals for UK special flights have now closed. If you require urgent consular assistance, please contact us as set out in the Travel advice help and support section.
If you cannot leave India at this time, you should:
follow the advice of local authorities, including local measures to help minimise your risk of exposure to coronavirus - comply with local isolation, testing or quarantine requirements, and to rely on the local health system
find accommodation that’s suitable for your needs. Unless you have an urgent reason to travel within India, you may need to stay where you are whilst the flight ban and lockdowns remain in place
check the validity of your Indian visa. If it has or is due to expire you will need to apply online for an extension at E-FRRO
be aware that many additional restrictions are being introduced at state level. Some states are not allowing foreign nationals to either enter or exit. No flights, trains or any form of public transport are operational. Hotels in some states have been instructed to refuse entry to foreign nationals. British Nationals opting for repatriation through special flights are being allowed to travel with special permission obtained by the British High Commission from the Indian Ministry of External Affairs.
keep in regular contact with family and friends at home, so they know you are safe and well
The situation remains fluid. You should continue to monitor the local advice on any state level restrictions and follow the instructions of the local authorities.
