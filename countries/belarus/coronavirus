On 26 March, the Belarusian government announced that all arrivals from countries that are affected by coronavirus must self-isolate for a period of 14 days, regardless of whether they show symptoms. Government officials are carrying out checks and people found not following self-isolation rules could be fined. You should comply with any additional screening measures put in place by the authorities.
Belavia has announced that, from 11 May, all passengers travelling on Belavia airlines will be required to provide and wear protective face masks on all flights. Face masks must also be worn at Minsk airport during check-in, security checks, and when travelling on airport buses.
It is still possible to enter Belarus by land, however, given the current situation, checks at the border may take longer than usual.
