The information on this page covers the most common types of travel and reflects the UK government’s understanding of the rules currently in place. Unless otherwise stated, this information is for travellers using a full ‘British Citizen’ passport.
The authorities in the country or territory you’re travelling to are responsible for setting and enforcing the rules for entry. If you’re unclear about any aspect of the entry requirements, or you need further reassurance, you’ll need to contact the embassy, high commission or consulate of the country or territory you’re travelling to.
You should also consider checking with your transport provider or travel company to make sure your passport and other travel documents meet their requirements.
Restrictions in response to coronavirus
The Italian authorities have advised against travel for tourism purposes throughout Italy, and that tourists already on holiday in Italy should limit their movements to those necessary to return to the place where they live.
Travel to Italy is possible only in case of absolute necessity. All travellers arriving in Italy from abroad are obliged to:
self-isolate for 14 days
carry a form self-certifying their reason for travel to Italy (“the Self-Declaration Form for Travel”) stating the purpose of their trip to Italy
report promptly to local health authorities
The Italian authorities have announced that these requirements will remain in effect until 2 June; and that from 3 June, travellers will not be required to self-isolate, providing that for the 14 days prior to their arrival in Italy, they were physically located in their country of departure. More information on all these requirements is available from the Ministry of Foreign Affairs.
If intending to travel to Italy via an Alitalia flight, passengers should bring two completed copies of the “Self-Declaration Form for Travel” to the airport.
Many airports in Italy are closed, or operating a significantly reduced schedule. The only daily flights between Italy and the UK are between Rome Fiumicino and London Heathrow. See Return to the UK.
All travellers entering Italy must avoid using public transport and must arrange to be collected, take a taxi or hire a car.
Train companies have reduced domestic services and suspended international travel. Some cross-border bus companies are also cancelling their services. Ports remain open for Italian-flagged ships to disembark passengers for transfer to the airport. Passenger ferry schedules remain subject to change and cancellations. Travellers disembarking from ferries are permitted to transit Italy in their own vehicles, but must complete the journey within 24 hours. Speak to your tour operator or transport provider for the latest information.
More information on all these requirements is available from the Ministry of Foreign Affairs.
