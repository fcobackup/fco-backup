This page gives you guidance on how to stay safely in Uzbekistan as a visitor, if you are unable to return to the UK.
Everyone should comply with the measures put in place in Uzbekistan to limit the spread of coronavirus (COVID-19).
Up-to-date statistics on COVID-19 cases in Uzbekistan are available from a dedicated Uzbekistan Government website - coronavirus.uz (in Uzbek and Russian only).
Moving around in Uzbekistan
There are local travel restrictions in place in Uzbekistan.
Local measures
Under measures introduced by the Uzbek authorities, any person subject to quarantine or self-isolation who breaches such controls is liable to a minimum fine of 11 Million UZS (approximately £900) or up to 10 years imprisonment.
From 23 March, it is compulsory to wear a facemask while outside - individuals may be fined (up to approximately £100) for violation of this regulation.
Further restrictive measures introduced by the Uzbekistan authorities include:
prohibition of entry/exit from Tashkent by any mode of transport, with the exception of goods transportation and foreign nationals wishing to depart Uzbekistan (other cities, including Samarkand, are subject to similar restrictions)
closure of restaurants, cafes, bars, fitness centres, entertainment venues, shopping malls and non-essential shops (supermarkets excluded)
ban on holding of public events and some private events, including weddings and other family celebrations
suspension of all public transport
suspension of all domestic flights
severe penalties (fine, community service and prison terms) for individuals found to be spreading false information regarding COVID-19.
Restrictions on use of personal vehicles were relaxed slightly with effect from 30 April. It is now permitted to use personal vehicles between 0700hrs to 1000hrs, and between 1700hrs and 2000hrs, for the purposes of travelling to and from workplaces, to visit hospitals and to buy medicines. British nationals should continue to follow social distancing practices, and not travel in a car with more than two people.
These measures may be subject to change. Entry requirements may vary and further restrictions could be applied at short notice by the Uzbek authorities. See Entry requirements
