Photography and media
Don’t use cameras, binoculars, maps, GPS equipment, etc. near government buildings of any description.
Taking photographs in the streets can draw the attention of the authorities. Your equipment may be confiscated.
Drugs and alcohol
Drug taking and smuggling are offences. Punishments can be severe. Prison conditions are very poor.
If you’re drunk when you arrive at Luanda airport you may be refused entry, detained and deported. Airlines can and do refuse to carry passengers out of Angola if they’re drunk. Conditions inside police stations and the criminal investigation department are very basic.
LGBT
In January 2019 Angola’s Parliament prohibited discrimination against people on the basis of sexual orientation. However, public attitudes towards homosexuality are less tolerant than in the UK and public displays of affection may attract negative attention. See our information and advice page for the LGBT community before you travel.
Providing ID
Carry a certified copy of your passport (data page and visa) and/or identity documents at all times for identification purposes or you will be liable for an on-the-spot fine of 15,000 Kwanzas (Angolan currency).
Importing goods and customs
Angola is a signatory to the Convention on International Trade in Endangered Species of Wild Fauna and Flora (CITES) which bans trade in ivory. Anyone caught buying or trafficking these goods is likely to be prosecuted and receive a prison sentence or fine.
The Angolan Interior Ministry recommends that you have a Portuguese-speaking contact if you don’t speak Portuguese, in case of any dealings with the police or other authorities.
