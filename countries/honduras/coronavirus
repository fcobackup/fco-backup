Travel in Honduras
There is no public transport available in Honduras. If you wish to move to or from the airport you have to hire a private taxi or driver.
From Sunday 10 January to Sunday 17 January 2021, a curfew from 9pm to 5am is in place throughout the country.
Bars, discoteques and convention centres remain closed.
In banks, supermarkets, shopping centres (malls) and shops, capacity should not exceed 50%. There will be special schedules for older people, pregnant women and people with disabilities. Children are prohibited from entering shops.
Those with a “Salvoconducto de Turismo” authorised by the Secretary of Security may travel during curfew hours.
The Director General of the Police issued instructions to the Police Commands throughout the Honduran territory to coordinate, verify and supervise the strict compliance of all control and security measures.
British nationals should respect the curfew. It is mandatory to use facemasks, sanitary gel, and maintain social distancing in public. Ensure you have the documents for your hotel, car rental, tour or ticket reservations with you at all times. Local authorities may stop you and ask for documents confirming your travel plans. “Salvoconducto de Turismos” are now available, which enable you to travel for tourism purposes within Honduras. Make sure your reservations include your name and that of your companions.

If you think you have COVID-19 symptoms you should seek medical advice and check the official page where all important information about COVID-19 as well as all advice from the Honduran authorities can be found.
At present, public hospitals in San Pedro Sula and Tegucigalpa are at capacity, with no space for patients with COVID-19 or patients who require intensive care.
Some private hospitals are accepting patients with COVID-19, but it will cost 1,000,000 Lempiras (over £30,000) to be admitted, with the final medical bill potentially being more.
Small clinics provide testing, basic medical attention and medication to COVID-19 patients that present mild symptoms and do not require special medical care.
British-issued prescriptions cannot be used locally. To find a pharmacy (“farmacia”) look for one of the big national chains such as Farmacias Siman, Farmacias Kielsa or Farmacia El Ahorro, among others; a quick search online should help you to identify the nearest one open.
