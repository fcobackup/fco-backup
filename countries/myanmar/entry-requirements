This page has information on travelling to Myanmar.
This page reflects the UK government’s understanding of current rules for people travelling on a full ‘British Citizen’ passport from the UK, for the most common types of travel.
The authorities in Myanmar set and enforce entry rules. If you’re unsure how Myanmar’s entry requirements apply to you, contact its UK embassy, high commission or consulate.
All travellers
On arrival in Myanmar, foreign travellers are required to present printed proof of travel insurance that covers COVID-19. You will also need to submit a health declaration form, which will typically have been given to you during your flight.
Check your passport and travel documents before you travel
Before travel, we advise that all visitors check with their nearest Myanmar Embassy or Consulate to confirm your current visa will allow you entry, or the criteria for obtaining or renewing a visa.
Visas
British nationals must apply for a visa to enter Myanmar. If you have any queries about visas or entry requirements you should check with your nearest Myanmar embassy. If you overstay your visa you will be liable to pay a fine, and could possibly face detention.
Tourist visas
You will need a visa to enter or travel through Myanmar as a visitor. You can apply for a tourist visa online.
Business visas
Applicants for business e-visas need to be sponsored by a registered Myanmar company or a registered Chamber of Commerce Association.
Proof of invitation must be submitted with the visa application in the form of a letter personally addressed to the applicant, along with a copy of the company registration certificate. The letter must state the purpose and timeframe of the visit. The registration status of a company can be found online at Myanmar Companies Online. NGOs and INGOs are not eligible to sponsor visas.
Passport validity
Your passport should be valid for a minimum period of 6 months from the date of entry into Myanmar.
Yellow fever
Check whether you need a yellow fever certificate by visiting the National Travel Health Network and Centre’s TravelHealthPro website.
