Be prepared for your plans to change
No travel is risk-free during COVID-19. Countries may further restrict travel or bring in new rules at short notice, for example due to a new COVID-19 variant. Check with your travel company or airline for any transport changes which may delay your journey home.
If you test positive for COVID-19, you may need to stay where you are until you test negative. You may also need to seek treatment there.
Plan ahead and make sure you:
can access money
understand what your insurance will cover
can make arrangements to extend your stay and be away for longer than planned
Travel in Andorra
The Andorran authorities have removed all COVID-19 measures. The use of a face mask is no longer mandatory in all settings except healthcare, but is recommended on public transport and in crowded areas.
You can find more information regarding the measures in place on the Andorran government website.
Accepted forms of COVID certificate
Proof of vaccination status
Andorra will accept the UK’s proof of COVID-19 recovery and vaccination record. It will also accept proof of COVID-19 vaccination record issued in the Crown Dependencies. Documents can be in English, Spanish, French or Catalan and in paper or electronic format. Your NHS appointment card from vaccination centres is not designed to be used as proof of vaccination and cannot be used to demonstrate your vaccine status.
At least 14 days must have passed since being fully vaccinated (with both doses of a two-dose vaccine or one dose of a single-dose vaccine). Your date(s) of vaccination must be specified and your final dose must have been administered within the last 270 days. If you completed your vaccination (with both doses of a two-dose vaccine or one dose of a single-dose vaccine) more than 270 days ago, you must be able to show proof of having received a booster jab. There is no requirement for 14 days to have passed since receiving your booster jab.
Diagnostic test
The Andorran authorities accept either a TMA or PCR diagnostic certificate with a negative result carried out within the previous 72 hours, or a certificate of a negative result for an antigen test performed within the previous 12 hours.
The accrediting documentation may be written in Catalan, Spanish, French or English, can be presented in digital or physical format and must contain at least the following information: name and surname(s) of holder, issuing country, date and time of sample and test type.
Recovery certificate
Under the Andorran rules, a recovery certificate must be issued by the competent authority or a medical service at least 11 days after the first positive TMA or PCR test. This certificate is valid for 180 calendar days from the date the sample was taken for this TMA or PCR test.
The accrediting documentation may be written in English, Spanish, French or Catalan, can be presented in digital or physical format and must contain at least the following information: name and surname(s) of holder, date of sample of first test with positive result, test type and issuing country.
Children under the age of 16 are exempt from presenting the certificate, but must follow preventive measures.
