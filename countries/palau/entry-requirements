The information on this page covers the most common types of travel and reflects the UK government’s understanding of the rules currently in place. Unless otherwise stated, this information is for travellers using a full ‘British Citizen’ passport.
The authorities in the country or territory you’re travelling to are responsible for setting and enforcing the rules for entry. If you’re unclear about any aspect of the entry requirements, or you need further reassurance, you’ll need to contact the embassy, high commission or consulate of the country or territory you’re travelling to.
You should also consider checking with your transport provider or travel company to make sure your passport and other travel documents meet their requirements.
Entry rules in response to coronavirus (COVID-19)
Entry to Palau
The wearing of a face covering a face shield is mandatory when exiting the aeroplane in Palau.
Quarantine requirements
A 14 day compulsory quarantine is currently in place for international arrivals into Palau. During this time, you will need to undertake two separate PCR swab tests. If your tests return a negative result then at the end of the 14 days quarantine you can transfer to your residence to complete a further 7 days of self isolation, followed by a further PCR swab test.
Fully vaccinated individuals may be exempted from quarantine, subject to presentation of proof of a complete course of COVID-19 vaccination, with the final dose having been administered at least 14 days prior to departure, and a negative PCR test taken within 3 days of leaving the country of origin. Travellers who have previously contracted COVID-19 may submit proof of recent infection and a letter from a healthcare provider certifying recovery.
Travellers exempt from quarantine must ensure their vaccine has received emergency use authorisation from either the US Food and Drug Administration or the World Health Organization.
Upon arrival, travellers exempted from quarantine must avoid large gatherings or public places, and restrict their movement only to activities related to food, banking, work, or health for seven days. On the fifth day of their arrival, travellers are required to undergo a COVID-19 test.
Demonstrating your COVID-19 vaccination status
Palau has not yet confirmed that it will accept the UK solutions for demonstrating your COVID vaccination status. You should follow guidance for alternative entry requirements. Your NHS appointment card from vaccination centres is not designed to be used as proof of vaccination.
