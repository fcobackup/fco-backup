This page reflects the UK government’s understanding of current rules for people travelling on a full ‘British Citizen’ passport, for the most common types of travel.
The authorities in Bulgaria set and enforce entry rules. For further information contact their embassy, high commission or consulate. You may also check with your transport provider or travel company to make sure your passport and travel documents meet their requirements.
If you are travelling to Bulgaria for work, read the guidance on visas and permits as the rules have changed since 1 January 2021.
Entry rules in response to coronavirus (COVID-19)
Entry to Bulgaria
From 1 July 2021, Bulgaria introduced a new system for classifying travellers arriving in the country based on green, orange and red zones.
From 19 July 2021, the UK is categorised as a ‘red zone’ country, which means that only Bulgarian nationals and permanent and long-term residents in Bulgaria, as well as their immediate family members (who they normally live with), will be eligible to enter the country. Further details regarding the definition of family members for these purposes is provided below.
Family members are defined by Bulgaria’s immigration rules. According to our understanding, family members of a UK national resident in Bulgaria are those who normally live with them in a household and who are:
Husband, Wife or common law partner
Children under 18. This includes stepchildren of either parent and those adopted. Can also include older children up to 21 years old who are in full time education
There are also provisions under the rules for other family members who are normally part of the household who are reliant on the resident or Bulgarian national for care and/or accommodation
Border Police officials have advised that documents to demonstrate the family relationship (i.e. for unmarried partners) can include joint bills and proof that they live at the same address. It is not necessary for the family member to travel with the Bulgarian national or Bulgarian resident. However, family members travelling without the main individual who cannot prove their family relations at the border may be turned away (e.g. a child of a resident UK national has no documentary proof that their family member is resident and therefore would not be allowed to enter).
From 29 July 2021, the regulations for eligible travellers who are travelling to Bulgaria from ‘red zone’ countries such as the UK have changed, and therefore they must also present:
a negative PCR test performed within 72 hours before entry
AND
a vaccination certificate showing an approved vaccine schedule has been completed at least 14 days before entry, or
a certificate of recovery from COVID-19
The PCR document must contain the names of the person in English, date of birth, type of test (PCR) and ‘Negative’ written in English, details of the medical institution that performed the test (name, address or other contact details), date and time of the test sample, the country in which the test has been performed and the authority that issued the document.
The vaccine document can be in the format of an EU Digital COVID certificate or a similar document containing the same information. This should include (in English), the name of the person, date of birth, date of the last administered dose, serial number of the dose, and the total number of doses administered, as well as the brand name of the vaccine, batch number of dose(s), the manufacturer’s name, the country and name of the organisation that issued the certificate.
The COVID recovery document showing a positive result from a PCR or rapid antigen test must be dated at least 11 days, but no more than 180 days before arrival into Bulgaria. The document must contain (in English), the name of the person, date of birth, date of the first positive result of the PCR or rapid antigen test, details of the medical institution that performed the test (name, address or other contact details), the authority that issued the document, the country in which the test has been performed, and ‘Positive’ written in English.
Bulgarian nationals and permanent and long-term residents, as well as their immediate family members (who they normally live with), who do not provide any of the above documents will be required to complete a mandatory 10-day quarantine.
Bulgarian nationals and permanent and long-term residents, as well as their family members, who present only one of the documents – either a certificate of vaccination or recovery or a negative PCR test, will also be required to complete a mandatory 10-day quarantine. However, this 10-day quarantine period can be shortened if they present a negative PCR performed within the first 24 hours after their arrival in Bulgaria. The quarantine will be revoked within 24 hours after the submission of the document showing a negative result of the PCR test.
The document showing a negative result of the PCR should be submitted to the respective Regional Health Inspectorate. See a full list with their contacts.
For Sofia Health Inspectorate, submit your document to the following email address: director@srzi.bg. Due to an increased number of enquiries, the health authorities may not have enough capacity to respond to each individual email, so you should call them directly to find out if your quarantine has been lifted. The relevant telephone numbers are listed.
Children under the age of 12 years old, are exempt from the requirement to present COVID-19 documents upon their arrival in Bulgaria regardless of which colour zone they have travelled from.
Eligible children aged 12 to 18 who arrive from ‘red zone’ countries must present a negative result from a PCR test performed within 72 hours before entry into Bulgaria. If they do not present such a document, they may travel but must self-isolate for 10 days after arrival. This period can be shortened for children who are Bulgarian nationals or permanent and long-term residents of Bulgaria if they present a negative PCR test performed within the first 24 hours after their arrival in Bulgaria. The quarantine will be revoked within 24 hours after the submission of the document showing a negative result of the PCR test.
The measures are in force at all air, road, rail and sea border crossings into Bulgaria.
Exemptions, regardless of nationality, to the entry restrictions in Bulgaria for travellers from UK (and other red list countries) include medical workers, state officials and diplomats, persons traveling for humanitarian reasons, seasonal and tourist workers etc. Other categories of people who can enter Bulgaria without the need to submit documents for COVID-19 include: bus and lorry drivers, crews of vessels and aircraft, border workers, those transiting through the country, students who live in Greece, Turkey, Serbia, Romania or The Republic of North Macedonia and travel daily or at least once a week to Bulgaria for training purposes, travellers between Bulgaria and Romania and between Bulgaria and Czech Republic.
Further information on the full range of exemptions is available on the following Bulgarian Government web site (in Bulgarian). If you fall into one of the exempted categories, you should contact your travel operator in advance of travel for further information on how to demonstrate your exemption from the travel ban.
Many land borders crossings in the region are restricted or closed for passenger traffic. Furthermore, neighbouring countries are implementing additional health requirements for entry to or departure from Bulgaria including declarations and COVID-19 tests. You should check the relevant FCDO Travel Advice.
If you need to travel, plan ahead and before you travel check border information published by the Ministry of Interior (English and Bulgarian) before you travel.
Demonstrating your COVID-19 vaccination status
Bulgaria will accept the UK’s proof of COVID-19 recovery and vaccination record. Your NHS appointment card from vaccination centres is not designed to be used as proof of vaccination and should not be used to demonstrate your vaccine status.
Quarantine requirements
From 19 July 2021, the UK will be added to Bulgaria’s red list and only Bulgarian nationals, long-term residents and their immediate family members are eligible to enter from the UK. See the entry requirements section for the full requirements, including those required to quarantine.
Check the list of UK private providers of Coronavirus testing and make arrangements for your test in good time. It may not be possible to secure a test at short notice.
In some cases (detailed at the Entry regulations section) the 10-day quarantine on arrival can be shortened if you present a negative PCR test performed within 24 hours of arriving in Bulgaria. The quarantine requirement will be revoked within 24 hours of submitting the document demonstrating the negative PCR test result.
A list of places offering PCR testing in Bulgaria is available here in Bulgarian.
You should submit the document showing a negative result of the PCR test to the respective Regional Health Inspectorate.
For Sofia Health Inspectorate, submit your document to the following email address: director@srzi.bg. Due to increased amount of inquiries, the health authorities may not have enough capacity to respond to each email individually so you should call them directly to find out if your quarantine has been lifted. Contact numbers are listed here.
Regular entry requirements
Visas
The rules for travelling or working in European countries changed from 1 January 2021:

visits to other EU or Schengen countries do not count towards your 90-day limit in Bulgaria as it is not in the Schengen area. Visits to Bulgaria do not count towards your 90-day visa-free limit in the Schengen area
to stay longer, to work or study, for business travel or for other reasons, you will need to meet the Bulgarian government’s entry requirements. Check with the Bulgarian Embassy what type of visa and/or work permit you may need
if you stay in Bulgaria with a residence permit or long-stay visa, this does not count towards your 90-day visa-free limit
*any time you spent in Bulgaria before 1 January 2021 does not count towards the 90-day visa-free limit.
At Bulgarian border control, you may need to use separate lanes from EU, EEA and Swiss citizens when queueing. Your passport may be stamped on entry and exit. You may also need to:
show a return or onward ticket
show you have enough money for your stay

Check your passport is valid for travel before you book your trip, and renew your passport if you do not have enough time left on it.
Make sure your passport is:
valid for at least 3 months after the day you plan to leave Bulgaria

The 3 months you need when leaving a country must be within 10 years of the passport issue date.
If you renewed your current passport before the previous one expired, extra months may have been added to its expiry date. Any extra months on your passport over 10 years may not count towards the minimum 3 months needed.
