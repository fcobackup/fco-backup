For security reasons the FCDO advises against all travel to:
The regions of Tombouctou, Kidal, Gao, Mopti and Segou.
All areas situated to the north of the line running from Kayes, north of Koulikoro, to Sikasso and Koni, including the towns of Kayes, Segou, Sikasso and Koni.
Areas west of the border between Mali and Burkina Faso, as far as, and including the towns of Sikasso and Koni.
Within 20km of the border with Côte d’Ivoire from Koni westwards.
The FCDO advises against all but essential travel to the rest of Mali, including Bamako.
On 22 July, there was an armed attack at Kati military base approximately 15km from the centre of Bamako. Following this, the US government issued a security alert advising staff and citizens in Bamako to remain in place due to a heightened risk of violence in the city.

Terrorists are very likely to try to carry out attacks in Mali, including kidnaps. There is a heightened risk of attack in Bamako. Attacks could be indiscriminate and occur without warning, including in places visited by foreigners and large crowds. You should be especially vigilant and where possible avoid places frequented by foreigners and large crowds including, diplomatic premises, hotels, restaurants, bars, nightclubs, stadiums, concert halls, shopping areas, markets, national infrastructure, airports and other transport hubs, places of worship and businesses with western interests. Large crowds and foreign, national or local government facilities, including those belonging to the defence and security forces, may also be a target.
You should be vigilant, be alert to announcements, monitor local media and follow the advice of the local authorities. Avoid all large gatherings, including during national day celebrations and public holidays. Large gatherings can also include music festivals, shows, concerts, sporting events and any public marches or demonstrations. You should exercise caution during election periods and take particular care during festivities, and religious and public holiday periods. See Terrorism
During public holidays and festivals, including New Year and Eid celebrations, security measures in Mali can be heightened due to the ongoing threat posed by terrorist organisations. During such periods you should exercise increased vigilance, limit your movements and continue to avoid large gatherings. If you think a particular venue would present a good target for terrorist activities then you should avoid it.
A nationwide state of emergency was put in place in November 2015 and has been extended several times since. You should expect a robust security presence including police patrols and possible police security checks on restaurants and hotels. There are likely to be more vehicle and personal security checks during this time and nobody will be exempt.
Regular, large and at times violent protests have taken place in Bamako, resulting in burning of tires, clashes with the police, blockage on the roads and bridges, the deployment of tear gas, and small arms fire. There have previously been reports of several deaths and injuries. You should avoid large gatherings, remain vigilant and monitor local social media/news.
Public demonstrations in and around Bamako have encountered a strong police and security force presence. You should stay away from all political demonstrations and any blockades set up by the police and security forces. Maintain several days’ stock of food and water in case disturbances take place. You can monitor daily developments in English through the BBC World Service (88.9 FM in Bamako).
