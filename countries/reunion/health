General health care facilities in Réunion, including emergency services, and the availability of doctors are good.  Some specialist treatment is also available.
You should obtain a free European Health Insurance Card EHIC before leaving the UK. The EHIC is not a substitute for medical and travel insurance, but it entitles you to state provided medical treatment that may become necessary during your trip. Any treatment provided is on the same terms as French nationals. The EHIC will not cover medical repatriation, ongoing medical treatment or non-urgent treatment, so you should make sure you have adequate travel insurance and accessible funds to cover the cost of any medical treatment and repatriation. 
If you are planning to move to Réunion, consult the UK Department for Work and Pensions (DWP) for advice on long-term entitlement to health care provision under the French national system. Please call DWP Overseas Medical Benefits help-line on 00 44 191 218 1999. More information can be obtained direct from the English language service of the Caisse Primaire d’Assurance Maladie (French social security service) on 00 33 8 20 90 42 12 or CLEISS (the Help desk in France for international mobility and social security) on 00 33 1 45 26 33 4.
