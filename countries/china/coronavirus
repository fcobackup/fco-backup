Healthcare
Medical facilities may come under strain in response to localised outbreaks. Designated hospitals have been established in each province to take patients diagnosed with COVID-19. Emergency medical facilities, except in Hubei, are largely functioning as normal but mandatory health checks and quarantine restrictions may delay or limit access to such care.
Travel restrictions and quarantine
From 28 March, China is suspending the entry into China of foreign nationals with visas issued before 27 March. The Chinese authorities have told the British Embassy in Beijing that this includes transit passengers. The only exemptions will be diplomatic, service, courtesy or C visas.
All international passenger flights to Beijing will be diverted to 12 designated airports in Tianjin, Shijiazhuang, Taiyuan, Hohhot, Shanghai Pudong, Jinan, Qingdao, Nanjing, Shenyang, Dalian, Zhengzhou and Xi’an. A small number of international flights are also operating direct between European cities and Shanghai, Guangzhou and Qingdao.
Health regulations surrounding passengers arriving from overseas are continuously changing. All overseas passenger arrivals are subject to health checks (likely involving nucleic acid or swab tests), including during transit, followed by a centralised quarantine period of at least 14 days – costs for which to be covered by the passenger. During this period follow-up swap tests are likely to take place. Those failing health checks may be sent to a designated hospital for treatment. Quarantine requirements can change at short notice and may differ from province to province.
Families, including those with children, may be separated upon entering quarantine. Those undergoing centralised quarantine will be asked to cover the fees for the duration.
There have been reports of discrimination against foreign nationals in China as a result of a perceived risk that they might re-import COVID-19. In Guangzhou, in particular, there are reports of discrimination on the basis of ethnicity, especially of those who are black and minority ethnic, including additional enforced quarantine and testing, as well as hotels and businesses not serving clients. Before you travel, check with your airline, travel operator or hotel for any changes or restrictions.
China issued an order to ensure compliance with health and quarantine regulations at borders. Refusal to comply with procedures or testing put in place or any attempts to deliberately conceal health conditions can result in being sentenced to up to three years in prison. This applies to both Chinese and foreign nationals.
Other measures
Mandatory requirements to check temperatures and use health apps or scan QR codes to prove travel history are in place at transport hubs, hotels, commercial buildings including restaurants, residential compounds and other locations – such locations are also increasingly requiring use of ‘health kit code’ apps to demonstrate health condition and travel history.
Restrictions on movement and quarantine arrangements remain for travel between different parts of the country. Some cities and provinces require travellers to undergo 14 days of isolation in their place of residence or in centralised observation. Quarantine is enforced at the neighbourhood level, procedures vary, it is recommended to check in advance.
The possibility that local authorities impose mandatory quarantine in response to fresh outbreaks is high. There have been reports of individuals who have frequented bars or restaurants where there have been confirmed cases of COVID-19 being mandated to undergo 14 days of centralised quarantine. You should keep up to date with the latest developments and this travel advice.
