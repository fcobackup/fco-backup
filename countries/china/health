At least 8 weeks before your trip, check the latest country-specific health advice from the National Travel Health Network and Centre (NaTHNaC) on the TravelHealthPro website. Each country-specific page has information on vaccine recommendations, any current health risks or outbreaks, and factsheets with information on staying healthy abroad. Guidance is also available from NHS (Scotland) on the FitForTravel website.
General information on travel vaccinations and a travel health checklist is available on the NHS website. You may then wish to contact your health adviser or pharmacy for advice on other preventive measures and managing any pre-existing medical conditions while you’re abroad.
The legal status and regulation of some medicines prescribed or purchased in the UK can be different in other countries. If you’re travelling with prescription or over-the-counter medicine, read this guidance from NaTHNaC on best practice when travelling with medicines. For further information on the legal status of a specific medicine, you’ll need to contact the embassy, high commission or consulate of the country or territory you’re travelling to.
While travel can be enjoyable, it can sometimes be challenging. There are clear links between mental and physical health, so looking after yourself during travel and when abroad is important.

There is an ongoing outbreak of the novel coronavirus. The virus originated in Wuhan City, Hubei Province but cases have been confirmed in other parts of China. In light of the latest medical information, including reports of person-to-person transmission, and the Chinese authorities’ own advice, we are now advising against all but essential travel to Hubei Province. On 23 January the Wuhan authorities closed all transport hubs including airports, railway and bus stations. Travel restrictions are in place within other cities in Hubei Province. Travel restrictions may affect the consular assistance the British Embassy in Beijing is able to provide. Accessing medical assistance for any health issues within travel restricted areas will be difficult.
Public Health England advise that if you’re making an essential visit to Wuhan, you should maintain good hand, respiratory and personal hygiene and should avoid visiting animal and bird markets or people who are ill with respiratory symptoms. Individuals should seek medical attention if they develop respiratory symptoms within 14 days of visiting Wuhan, either in China or on their return to the UK. They should phone ahead before attending any health services and mention their recent travel to the city. Additional health screening measures for travellers may be in place. For more information and advice, visit the TravelHealthPro website. We recommend that you keep up to date with local health advice.
If you’re travelling for Chinese New Year, check the information and advice from the National Travel Health Network and Centre (NaTHNaC).
