There is no access to the island by air. In March 2019 a more frequent shipping service will replace the current quarterly shipping service via cargo ship that operates between Pitcairn and Mangareva in French Polynesia. Details of the service can be found on the Pitcairn Islands Tourism website. Transfer between the ship and the island is by longboat and can be difficult in poor weather. There are no hotels but self-catering and homestay accommodation with local families is available.
