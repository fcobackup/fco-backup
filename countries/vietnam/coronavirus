Quarantine and testing
Although Vietnam’s COVID-19 infection numbers are low, where there are suspected cases Vietnam’s authorities apply quarantine and testing requirements robustly and quickly, often with little or no prior warning. This may result in areas being locked-down and individuals required to self-isolate and/or quarantine and be tested. This may include community testing.
If you come in to contact with someone who has tested positive for coronavirus you must expect to undergo quarantine in a government centre for a minimum of 14 days and possibly longer if you test positive at any point. Should you test positive, you will be treated in a Vietnamese hospital. On discharge, you will be expected to undertake a period of self-isolation. You should expect to be tested at least 5 times prior to release from hospital, and will be required to produce 3 consecutive negative tests during quarantine and a further two consecutive negative tests during self-isolation. Once you have completed quarantine and self-isolation you should receive a document confirming this. Please retain this. The Vietnamese government has confirmed that it will cover quarantine costs in government facilities, but foreign nationals will be personally responsible for paying for any coronavirus hospital treatment costs.
Vietnamese quarantine centres are basic. Should you be asked to undertake testing / self-isolation and / or quarantine you should comply. Failure to comply can be an offence with significant punishments. Vietnam’s quarantine requirements are mandated by the Vietnamese Ministry of Health. The British Embassy and Consulate General are unable to intervene in having these requirements waived, shortened or changed. Violations carry strict penalties
