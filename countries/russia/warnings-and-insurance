Warning
FCDO advises against all travel to Russia.

Your travel insurance could be invalidated if you travel against advice from the Foreign, Commonwealth & Development Office (FCDO).
FCDO advises against all travel to Russia
FCDO advises against all travel to Russia due to the risks and threats from its continuing invasion of Ukraine, including:
security incidents, such as drone attacks, in parts of the country
lack of flights to return to the UK
limited ability for the UK government to provide support
There is also a high likelihood terrorists  will try to carry out attacks, including in major cities. See Safety and security.
Limited UK government support
The British Embassy in Moscow and British Consulate in Ekaterinburg are open, but the situation could change at short notice.
In-person UK government support in Russia is limited. It is very limited in parts of Russia because of the security situation and the size of the country, particularly in the North Caucasus.
If you need support, call our 24-hour helpline +7 495 956 7200 and select the option for consular services for British nationals.
Contact the Russian emergency services on 112.
Dual nationals
Dual British-Russian nationals are treated as Russian nationals by local authorities. The consular support FCDO can provide is severely limited. If you are arrested or detained, Russian authorities are unlikely to allow us consular access.
In 2022, Russia declared a partial mobilisation of Russian citizens to join the military forces. Military recruitment continues. Anyone with a Russian passport could be required to join the military (conscripted).
In August, Russian law was amended to stop Russian nationals eligible for military conscription from leaving Russia from the day their draft notice appears on the federal electronic conscription register.
Travel insurance
If you choose to travel, research your destinations and get appropriate travel insurance. Insurance should cover your itinerary, planned activities and expenses in an emergency.
