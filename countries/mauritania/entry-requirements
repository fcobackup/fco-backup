Entry rules in response to coronavirus (COVID-19)
Entry to Mauritania
As of 10 September 2020, some international flights to and from Mauritania have resumed.
The Mauritanian authorities have introduced a number of measures to limit the risk of travellers spreading COVID-19 on arrival in Mauritania.
You must take a PCR test dated within 5 days before arrival and show evidence of the negative test result, with the date of the test clearly labelled. You should not use the NHS testing service to facilitate your travel to another country. You should take a private test.
Non-Mauritanian nationals that arrive without a PCR test will not be allowed to enter the country and will be obliged to immediately return to their country of origin.
You must wear a face-mask on arrival.
You must complete an individual health declaration on arrival.
You will undergo a contactless temperature check on arrival. If you have a temperature upon arrival, you must agree to a PCR or rapid antigen test. While waiting for the test result you must self-isolate at your own expense in a hotel or your place of residence for 14 days. If the test is negative, you can leave self-isolation before the end of the 14-day period.
If you are arriving from the UK, South Africa, Brazil, or another country identified as a source of new COVID-19 variants, you must quarantine at your own expense in a hotel or your place of residence for 14 days. You must then take a PCR test in Mauritania, and if this is negative, you can exit quarantine. See the Coronavirus section for more information.
Screening on arrival
You must present evidence of a negative COVID-19 PCR test, which must be taken within 5 days before your arrival. You should not use the NHS testing service to get a test in order to facilitate your travel to another country. You should arrange to take a private test.
