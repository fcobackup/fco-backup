This information is for people travelling on a full ‘British citizen’ passport from the UK. It is based on the UK government’s understanding of the current rules for the most common types of travel.
The authorities in Switzerland set and enforce entry rules. If you’re not sure how these requirements apply to you, contact the Swiss Embassy in the UK.
COVID-19 rules
There are no COVID-19 testing or vaccination requirements for travellers entering Switzerland.
Passport validity requirements
Switzerland follows Schengen area rules. Your passport must:
have a ‘date of issue’ less than 10 years before the date you arrive – if you renewed your passport before 1 October 2018, it may have a date of issue that is more than 10 years ago
have an ‘expiry date’ at least 3 months after the day you plan to leave the Schengen area
Check with your travel provider that your passport and other travel documents meet requirements. Renew your passport if you need to.
You will be denied entry if you do not have a valid travel document or try to use a passport that has been reported lost or stolen.
Visa requirements
You can travel without a visa to the Schengen area, which includes Switzerland, for up to 90 days in any 180-day period. This applies if you travel:
as a tourist
to visit family or friends
to attend business meetings, cultural or sports events
for short-term studies or training
At passport control, use the ‘All passports’ lane.
The requirements for working in Switzerland are different.
If you’re travelling to other Schengen countries as well, make sure your whole visit is within the 90-day limit. Visits to Schengen countries in the 180 days before you travel count towards your 90 days.
Make sure you get your passport stamped on entry and exit. 
If you’re a visitor, border guards will look at your entry and exit stamps to check you have not overstayed the 90-day visa-free limit for the Schengen area.
If your passport is missing a stamp, show evidence of when and where you entered or left the Schengen area (for example, boarding passes or tickets) and ask the border guards to add the date and location in your passport.
At Swiss border control, you may also need to:
show proof of your accommodation, for example, a hotel booking or proof of address if visiting your own property
show proof of insurance for your trip
show a return or onward ticket
prove that you have enough money for your stay – around 100 Swiss francs a day
Staying longer than 90 days in a 180-day period
To stay longer, you must meet the Swiss government’s entry requirements. Check which type of visa or work permit you need with the Swiss Embassy in the UK.
If you are in Switzerland with a residence permit or long-stay visa, this does not count towards your 90-day visa-free limit.
See passport stamping if you live in Switzerland.
Vaccine requirements
At least 8 weeks before your trip, check the vaccinations and certificates you need in TravelHealthPro’s Switzerland guide.  
Customs rules
There are strict rules about goods that you can take into and out of Switzerland. You must declare anything that may be prohibited or subject to tax or duty.
