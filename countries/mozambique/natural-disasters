Mozambique is regularly affected by natural disasters, including floods, drought and cyclones. Coastal areas have a risk of cyclones during the rainy season (November to April) with heavy rainfall and a risk of flooding around river basins. Monitor local reports and international weather updates from the World Meteorological Organisation, check your routes before travelling and follow the advice of the local authorities.
See our Tropical cyclones page for advice about what to do if you are caught up in a storm.
