Visas
Given the current situation, the Colombian government issued a decree stating that visas that expire during the emergency will be automatically renewed, with immediate effect for the length of the lockdown period plus one month. This means that those with tourist visas that expired during the period of 23 March to 11 May, you will need to renew your visa, request an extension, or depart from Colombia before 11 June. There will be no penalty for not renewing your visa if it expired during these dates. For more information, please visit the Migración Colombia website.
