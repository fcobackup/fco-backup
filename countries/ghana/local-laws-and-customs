Ghana is a conservative and deeply religious country. Although modern and progressive attitudes also prevail, you should show respect for traditional values and morals.  
Dress modestly in public.
Wearing military clothing including camouflage is prohibited.
Don’t become involved with drugs of any kind. Penalties for drug related offences are severe. Even possession of small amounts of marijuana can lead to a prison sentence in excess of 5 years, usually after a lengthy and expensive legal process. Bail is not normally granted. Class A drugs like cocaine are likely to be laced with other substances. Foreign visitors, including British nationals, have died after taking these drugs.
Carry a photocopy of your passport with you at all times, and put the original document in a safe.
Some same-sex sexual acts could lead to a prison sentence between 3 and 25 years. Although there are no records of this being enforced, there were arrests at a gathering of the LGBT+ community in 2021. Ghanaian society is intolerant of public displays of affection by people of the same sex and many Ghanaians don’t accept that such relationships exist.
An anti-LGBT+ Bill, introduced in 2021, has increased the risk of violence and discrimination targeted at those perceived as being lesbian, gay, bisexual, and transgender. Rhetoric by politicians, religious leaders, and local media can incite violence and psychological abuse of the LGBT+ community. We are aware of reported attacks against LGBT+ individuals. See our information and advice page for the LGBT+ community before you travel.
Photography near sensitive sites like military installations or the airport is strictly prohibited. Ask permission if you want to take a photograph of a building where there are guards on duty. Beware of self-appointed officials trying to charge fees to take pictures of well-known sites of interest.
Ghanaian family law is very different from UK law, particularly when child custody becomes an issue.
