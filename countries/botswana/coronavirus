Travel in Botswana
Botswana is divided in to nine coronavirus zones. You will need to apply for an interzonal travel permit to travel between the coronavirus zones. Travel within a zone does not currently require any special permissions.

Everyone in the Greater Gaborone COVID-19 Zone must stay at home, except to buy essentials like food, medicine or power/fuel.
