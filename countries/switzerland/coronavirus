Travel in Switzerland
You should follow the rules on hygiene and social distancing. These include:
Washing your hands regularly and thoroughly
Keeping a distance of at least 1.5 metres from other people
If it is not possible to maintain that distance, wear a face mask.
Wearing a face mask is compulsory when travelling on public transport, and at Geneva, Zurich and Basel airports. It is compulsory to wear a face mask on all flights to and from Switzerland. Failure to do so is punishable by a fine. Children under the age of 12 are exempt from this requirement, as are individuals who are unable to wear a mask for medical reasons. Cantons have imposed further restrictions, and you should check cantonal websites for further details.

From Saturday 12 December, restaurants, bars, shops, markets, museums, libraries, and sports and leisure facilities will be required to close between 7pm and 6am and, with the exception of restaurants and bars, will not be permitted to open at any time on Sundays and public holidays. Certain cantons with a more favourable epidemiological situation may extend closing time until 11pm.
On 24 December and New Year’s Eve, the closing time for restaurants and bars will be 1am. Takeaways and delivery services can remain open until 11pm

For further information on these measures and exceptions, see the Swiss Government website.
Wearing a face mask is compulsory in indoor public places such as shops, banks, post offices, museums, libraries and cinemas. Wearing a face mask is also required in outdoor zones where social distancing cannot be observed, including establishments such as markets, shops, venues, restaurants, bars. Failure to do so is punishable by a fine. Further information from the Federal Office of Public Health.
