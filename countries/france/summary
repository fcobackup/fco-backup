The FCDO advises against all but essential travel to:
the whole of France based on the current assessment of COVID-19 risks. Check separate travel advice pages for overseas territories of France.
The health situation in France remains severe. The French government has announced a national lockdown. A full list of circumstances under which you can leave your home are detailed on the French government’s website. Some measures will be relaxed as of 28 November, including the re-opening of non-essential shops.
You will need an attestation (or self-certificate) when you do go out. These are available on the Ministry of Interior website, and through France’s digital app ‘Tous anti-Covid.’
If you are returning to the UK from France, you will need to self-isolate on your return (unless you are exempt). Check the latest guidance for England, Northern Ireland, Scotland and Wales. The guidance includes information on the rules if you’re transiting through France from another country to reach the UK.
Travel to France is subject to entry restrictions
Arrivals by sea and air routes will need to complete a ‘sworn statement’ (déclaration sur l’honneur) form self-certifying they are not suffering from symptoms associated with coronavirus and have not been in contact with confirmed cases in the preceding fortnight.
Although there is no restriction on travel from the UK and most European countries, travel from most non-European countries is subject to entry restrictions.
See Entry requirements for more information before you plan to travel.

Terrorists are very likely to try to carry out attacks in France. Due to ongoing threats to France by Islamist terrorist groups, and recent French military intervention against Daesh (formerly referred to as ISIL), the French government has warned the public to be especially vigilant and has reinforced its security measures. Check the French government’s advice about what to do if a terrorist attack occurs. See Terrorism
There remain some migrants around Calais, who may seek to enter the UK illegally. There have been instances of migrants seeking to slow down traffic on approach roads to ports, including by placing obstacles on the Calais Port approach road. If this happens you should keep moving where it’s safe to do so, or stop and call 112 if isn’t safe to proceed (keeping car doors locked).
All vehicles, including motorbikes, driving in central Paris, Lyon and Grenoble now need to display a special ‘pollution sticker’. See Road travel
If you’re abroad and you need emergency help from the UK government, contact the nearest British embassy, consulate or high commission.

The emergency phone number in France is 112. If you need to contact other emergency services, call 15 (medical), 17 (police) or 18 (fire).
