The Foreign and Commonwealth Office (FCO) advise against all but essential travel to within 3km of the entire Syrian border, and to within 6km of the Syrian border between routes 15 and 35. This is due to the risk of small arms fire, stray mortars, or other attacks in the area. See Border areas
There may be protests and demonstrations in Jordan and the wider region in response to military action taken by the US, France and the UK in Syria, following the chemical weapons attack in Douma on 7 April. You should avoid any demonstrations, monitor developments and follow the instructions of the local authorities.
Avoid political gatherings and demonstrations. Stay away from downtown Amman and the centres of other towns and cities after Friday midday prayers as violent incidents have been known to occur at these times.
