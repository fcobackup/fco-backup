The FCDO advises against all but essential travel to:
the whole of Guatemala based on the current assessment of COVID-19 risks.
Travel to Guatemala is subject to entry restrictions
Guatemala does not permit the entry of travellers who have been in the United Kingdom or South Africa in the 14 days prior to their arrival. This measure is not applicable to Guatemalan nationals, diplomats or foreign nationals who are legal residents in the country. This measure came into force on 23 December
If you are eligible for entry you must provide a negative COVID-19 PCR or antigen test, dated no more than 3 days before the date of your arrival at a Guatemalan airport. For a full list of options available to meet the criteria to enter Guatemala, see Entry requirements
Local authorities announced that from 6 January 2021, passengers who do not have a negative COVID-19 PCR or antigen test, will be required to take a test upon arrival at La Aurora International Airport at a cost of US $ 25 or Q.200 (Quetzales, local currency). However, passengers with journeys originating in or transiting the UK or South Africa will not be permitted to board flights to Guatemala
See Entry requirements for more information before you plan to travel.
Preparing for your return journey to the UK
If you’re returning to the UK from overseas, you will need to:
provide your journey and contact details before you travel
check if you need to self-isolate on your return
If your return journey to the UK transits another country, you should check whether it is subject to a travel ban or any other additional requirements. If so, contact your travel provider.

During the COVID-19 pandemic, it is more important than ever to get travel insurance and check it provides sufficient cover. See the Foreign, Commonwealth & Development Office (FCDO) guidance on foreign travel insurance.
You will need to provide contact details on arrival in Guatemala. See entry requirements.
Due to the movement of migrant caravans, you should take extra care at the land border crossings with Honduras and Mexico where a significant security presence is possible. As these migrant caravans move, they may delay or disrupt travel within the country.
15,229 British nationals visited Guatemala in 2019. Most visits are trouble free.
The rainy season in Guatemala normally runs from June to November, coinciding with the hurricane season in the Caribbean. See Rainy season. You should plan any travel carefully. You should monitor local and international weather updates from the US National Hurricane Centre. Follow the advice of local authorities, including any evacuation orders. See Natural disasters.
Guatemala has one of the highest violent crime rates in Latin America. Take care in all parts of the country, including Guatemala City. You should carry personal ID when travelling (certified copies are fine). See Crime
Guatemala has active volcanoes, some prone to heightened activity. See Volcanoes
Avoid travelling on public buses (repainted US school buses). Private inter-city coach services are safer, but not immune from attack. See Local travel
