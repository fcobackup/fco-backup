The FCDO advises against all but essential travel to:
the whole of Rwanda based on the current assessment of COVID-19 risks.
There will be enhanced self-isolation measures for all arrivals arriving in England, Scotland and Wales on or after 4am on 29 January, and arriving in Northern Ireland on or after 4am on 30 January. Check the latest guidance for England, Northern Ireland, Scotland and Wales.
From 1pm on 29 January, visitors who have been in or transited through Rwanda in the previous 10 days cannot enter England. British and Irish nationals, and third country nationals with residence rights in the UK arriving in England from Rwanda will need to self-isolate along with their households on their return. Check the latest guidance and rules that apply for Scotland, Wales and Northern Ireland.
From 1 January onwards people with residence rights include: holders of Indefinite Leave to Remain; holders of existing leave to enter or remain (i.e those with biometric Residence permits) or an entry clearance/visa that grants such leave e.g. students, workers, etc (excluding visit visas); holders of EU Settlement Scheme (“EUSS”) leave; those who have rights of entry under the Withdrawal Agreements (including returning residents with a right of residence under the EEA Regulations and EEA frontier workers); family members of EEA nationals with rights under the Withdrawal Agreement.
Travel to Rwanda is subject to entry restrictions
Kigali International Airport is open. Land borders remain closed except to returning Rwandan citizens and legal residents.
All arrivals must present a negative COVID-19 PCR test result taken within 120 hours of departure. You will then be required to quarantine at a designated hotel for 24 hours whilst awaiting results of a second COVID-19 test, conducted on arrival.
If the results of the second COVID-19 test are positive and you have severe symptoms, you will be required to enter a government treatment facility. If you do not have severe symptoms, you will be moved from the hotel in which you were quarantining to your own choice of accommodation. A medical team will assess whether you can remain there.

During the COVID-19 pandemic, it is more important than ever to get travel insurance and check it provides sufficient cover. See the FCDO’s guidance on foreign travel insurance.
Rwanda is generally safe and crime levels are relatively low, but street crime does occur. There have been reports of an increase in burglary, theft and mugging in Kigali in recent months. You should take precautions with valuables and remain vigilant. See Crime
The security situation near the border with the Democratic Republic of Congo (DRC) and Burundi remains unstable, and there have been armed attacks in Rwanda’s Nyungwe Forest and Volcanoes National Parks Parks and neighbouring areas. If you’re travelling near the DRC or Burundi borders, you should be aware of the risk of attacks and Government of Rwanda security operations. Exercise caution and keep up to date with developments on the current situation, including via your tour operator, the local media and this travel advice. See Local travel
If you’re abroad and you need emergency help from the UK government, contact the nearest British embassy, consulate or high commission.
Although there’s no recent history of terrorism in Rwanda, attacks can’t be ruled out. See Terrorism
