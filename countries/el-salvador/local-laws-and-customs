There are severe penalties for drug trafficking and drug use in El Salvador. Prisons are overcrowded and violent.
There are no legal provisions for same-sex marriage or adoption in El Salvador. (The Family Code establishes that marriage should happen between a man and a woman, although the Constitution does not make this specific point.) Due to prevailing conservative attitudes and the risk of harassment to same-sex couples public displays of affection are not recommended.
