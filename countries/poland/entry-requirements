Coronavirus guidance is being updated.
Read the Prime Minister’s address for the latest information.

The information on this page covers the most common types of travel and is the UK government’s understanding of the current rules. Unless otherwise stated, this information is for travellers using a full ‘British Citizen’ passport.
The authorities in the country or territory you’re travelling to are responsible for setting and enforcing the entry rules. If you’re unclear about any of the entry requirements, or you need further reassurance, you’ll need to contact the embassy, high commission or consulate of the country or territory you’re travelling to.
You should also consider checking with your transport provider or travel company to make sure your passport and other travel documents meet their requirements.
Passport validity
Your passport should be valid for the length of time you plan to stay; you do not need any additional period of validity on your passport beyond this.
The travel rules will stay the same until 31 December 2020.
Coronavirus
The Polish authorities have introduced new measures in relation to coronavirus. See Coronavirus
Visas 
If you hold a British Citizen passport, you don’t need a visa to enter Poland. If you’re planning a stay of longer than 3 months, see our Living in Poland guide and contact the Polish Embassy if you have further questions.
The travel rules will stay the same until 31 December 2020.
UK Emergency Travel Documents
You can use a UK Emergency Travel Document to enter, airside transit and exit from Poland.
Dual nationals 
If you are a Polish passport holder you will be treated as a Polish national while in Poland, even if you hold a passport from another country. If you are a dual Polish-British national you must enter and exit Poland with a Polish passport or Polish national identity card. Check with the Polish Embassy in London if in doubt.
