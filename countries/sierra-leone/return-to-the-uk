There are currently no commercial options available to return to the UK from Sierra Leone. The government of Sierra Leone has announced that all flights scheduled to and from Freetown International Airport have been suspended until further notice from 21 March. There is an exemption for emergency flights.
We know this is concerning for British people trying to leave Sierra Leone. The UK government is working closely with airlines, the Sierra Leonean authorities and other governments to make sure options are available for you to return to the UK as soon as possible.
What to do
If you cannot leave Sierra Leone at this time, you should:
Follow the advice of the local authorities, including local measures to help minimise your risk of exposure to coronavirus. The Freetown City Council website contains useful information on what to do if you have symptoms.
Find accommodation that’s suitable for your needs.
Keep in regular contact with family and friends at home, so they know you are safe and well.
If your visa is close to expiring contact the Immigration Department for advice.

Future travel options
The UK government is working closely with airlines, the Sierra Leonean authorities and other governments to make sure options are available for you to return to the UK as soon as possible.
You will need to pay for your return travel to the UK. If departure options are available but you cannot afford the travel costs and have exhausted all other options for getting funds, you may be eligible to apply for an emergency loan from the government. This is a last resort option and you would need to repay the loan when you are back in the UK. For more information, you should contact Corporate Travel Management (CTM). CTM are a commercial partner of the FCO and are authorised to administer such loans on behalf of the FCO.
This travel advice will be updated when departure options become available.
