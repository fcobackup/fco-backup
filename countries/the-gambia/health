Before you travel check that: 
your destination can provide the healthcare you may need 
you have appropriate travel insurance for local treatment or unexpected medical evacuation 
This is particularly important if you have a health condition or are pregnant. 
Emergency medical number 
There is no equivalent to the UK’s 999 emergency number in The Gambia, it is best to visit in-person to ask for emergency contact details at local stations.  
Contact your insurance company quickly if you’re referred to a medical facility for treatment. 
Health risks and recommended vaccines 
Check TravelHealthPro’s current advice on The Gambia to find out how to reduce the health risks you’ll face there. 
TravelHealthPro also lists the recommended vaccines that could apply to you. At least 8 weeks before you travel, check how to get vaccines and whether you have to pay on the NHS travel vaccinations page. 
Other health risks 
UNAIDS estimated that around 24,000 adults aged 15 or over in Gambia are living with HIV. The prevalence percentage was estimated at around 1.4% of the adult population compared to the prevalence percentage in adults in the UK of around 0.2%. You should use normal precautions to avoid exposure to HIV/AIDS. 
Medication 
The legal status and regulation of some medicines prescribed or bought in the UK can be different in other countries. 
If you bring prescription medication into The Gambia, take a copy of your prescription and keep items in the original packaging. Some prescription and over-the-counter medicines like those containing codeine or diazepam are banned under The Gambia’s drugs laws. For more information on the legal status of a specific medicine, check with the Gambian High Commission in the UK before you travel. 
In The Gambia you will need to go to a pharmacy to get most over-the-counter medicines. Only a very limited selection are available at supermarkets or other stores. Not all medicines available in the UK will be available in The Gambia.  
If you require specialist medication, check availability before travel or make arrangements to bring your medication with you. The widely used symbols are a green cross or a green ‘Bowl of Hygieia’ (a chalice or cup with a snake twined around it).
