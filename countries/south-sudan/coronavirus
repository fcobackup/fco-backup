The South Sudan authorities have introduced a number of precautionary measures in response to the coronavirus (COVID-19) pandemic.
South Sudan has suspended the issue of visas at its Embassies abroad, and all international commercial flights are suspended indefinitely from 24 March.
Although there have been no confirmed cases of coronavirus (COVID-19) in South Sudan, cases have been confirmed in Ethiopia, Kenya, Sudan, Democratic Republic of the Congo and Central African Republic, all on South Sudanâ€™s border. The South Sudan authorities have introduced a number of precautionary measures in response to the coronavirus pandemic, including temperate screening on entry to South Sudan at Juba International Airport, and most key posts (Nimule, Wau and Yambio).
Passengers arriving from the UK and other affected countries are being denied entry, even with valid visas, if they arrive less than 14 days after leaving the affected country. South Sudan Embassies are not currently issuing visas for South Sudan.
You should comply with any additional screening measures put in place by the authorities.
Keep up to date with information from your tour operator, transport or accommodation provider on the impact on any existing travel plans. If you need further information about entry requirements, contact the nearest South Sudan Embassy. You should also check with your airline or travel company for the latest information.
Further information on coronavirus, including advice on preparing for foreign travel and helping reduce the spread of the virus, is available from Public Health England and on the TravelHealthPro website.
