Travelling from and returning to the UK
Check what you must do to travel abroad and return to England, Scotland, Wales or Northern Ireland.
If you plan to pass through another country to return to the UK, check the travel advice for the country you’re transiting. If you will pass through a red list country, book your hotel quarantine package before travelling to the UK.
You are responsible for organising your own COVID-19 test, in line with UK government testing requirements. You should contact local authorities for information on testing facilities or see this list of laboratories offering tests. Some of these can provide test certificates in English on request.
Be prepared for your plans to change
No travel is risk-free during COVID. Countries may further restrict travel or bring in new rules at short notice, for example due to a new COVID-19 variant. Check with your travel company or airline for any transport changes which may delay your journey home.
If you test positive for COVID-19, you may need to self-isolate in your accommodation until you test negative. You may also need to seek treatment. See the Slovak government COVID-19 website for advice in English on “What to do if I am COVID-19 positive”.
Plan ahead and make sure you:
can access money
understand what your insurance will cover
can make arrangements to extend your stay and be away for longer than planned
Public spaces and services
The Slovak government has imposed restrictions on public life to counter the spread of COVID-19.
From 17 December, if you can demonstrate that you are vaccinated or recovered from COVID-19 you can visit shops and services, including ski resorts. If you are not vaccinated or recovered from COVID-19 you can only enter shops selling essential items.
Gatherings of more than 6 people (unless from the same household) are prohibited.
Bars and restaurants may only offer a take-away or delivery service.
Hotels and their restaurants can reopen from 25 December for guests who can demonstrate that they are vaccinated or recovered from COVID-19. Guests aged 6 and above must also show either a negative PCR or LAMP test result no older than 72 hours, or an antigen or lateral flow test result no older than 48 hours.
From 10 December you will need proof of vaccination, recovery or testing to use some long-distance buses and trains.
From 17 December, the nationwide curfew applies only between 8pm every evening until 5am the following morning.
You may only leave your home during the curfew hours for certain specified reasons, including:
Travelling to or from abroad
Going to buy essential food or medicines, or to seek medical treatment
Going to work (you will need to carry written confirmation from your employer) or conducting business. Working from home is recommended where possible
These restrictions and exemptions can change at short notice.
For full details of all the restrictions, exemptions and curfew timings, you should check the Slovak government COVID-19 website (Slovak only). You may wish to use an online translation tool as the pages in English are not updated regularly. There is also information on the latest measures in English on the IOM Migration Information Centre, Slovak Spectator and Radio Slovakia International websites.
Face Masks
It is mandatory to wear an FFP2-standard face mask in all indoor areas, including public transport, taxis and when attending an indoor event. From 25 November it is also mandatory to wear a standard face mask, scarf or an FFP2 mask outside if you are less than 2 meters away from people outside your household or when attending an outdoor event.
UK proof of COVID-19 recovery and vaccination
Slovakia will accept the UK’s proof of COVID-19 recovery and vaccination record. If you are travelling with a printed PDF proof of vaccination status, it must date from 1 November to ensure that the certificate can be scanned successfully, if domestic certification is required. Your NHS appointment card from vaccination centres is not designed to be used as proof of vaccination and should not be used to demonstrate your vaccine status.
Healthcare in Slovakia
If you are in Slovakia and you are concerned that you may have the symptoms of coronavirus, you should follow the advice of the Slovak authorities and contact your usual healthcare provider by telephone or email, not in person. If your symptoms are severe, you should call 155 or 112, where some operators may speak English.
The Slovak government website has information in English and advice on how to get tested for Covid-19 (currently in Slovak only). You can also consult your nearest regional office of the Slovak Public Health Authority on their website.
If you test positive for COVID-19
From 13 September, the period of self-isolation is 10 days if you test positive for COVID-19. The 10 day period begins from the day you first display symptoms or when your test was taken. If you display no symptoms during your final three days of self-isolation, you may end your self-isolation after the tenth day. If you display symptoms during your final three days of self-isolation, you will need to ask your doctor when you may end your self-isolation.
If you are in contact with somebody who tests positive for COVID-19
If you came into contact with someone who tested positive for COVID-19 you can end your self-isolation 10 days after you were last in contact with them. However, if you have no symptoms and receive a negative result after taking a PCR test on the fifth day, you can end your self-isolation seven days after you were last in contact with them. You can book the test on the Slovak government website.
Local hospitals and further healthcare information
For contact details of local hospitals visit our list of healthcare providers. UK-issued prescriptions are not accepted at Slovak pharmacies, and you should bring sufficient supplies with you to cover your stay. If you need repeat medication you would need to consult a local doctor to get a Slovak prescription issued.

COVID-19 vaccines if you live in Slovakia
Wherever possible British nationals should aim to be vaccinated in the country where they live. We will update this page when the Government of Slovakia announces new information on the national vaccination programme. You can sign up to get email notifications when this page is updated.
The Slovak national vaccination programme started in January 2021 and is currently using the Pfizer-BioNTech, Moderna, and Janssen (Johnson and Johnson) vaccines. All British residents of Slovakia and full-time students, can register to receive a COVID-19 vaccination through the Slovak national vaccination programme, regardless of whether they are registered with the Slovak public health insurance schemes. This follows the Slovak Health Ministry’s expansion of eligibility criteria on 14 June.
Further details are on the Slovak Health Ministry website (in Slovak only) and translated into English on the local English-language Slovak Spectator website or the International Organisation for Migration English Language COVID-19 information page.
You can find more information on the Slovak vaccination programme on the Slovak Government COVID-19 Information Website (in Slovak only). You can register for a vaccination by completing and submitting a form (currently in Slovak only). Information and registration is also available by calling 0800 174 174 within Slovakia or +421 222 200 910 from abroad.
Find out more, including about vaccines that are authorised in the UK or approved by the World Health Organisation, on the COVID-19 vaccines if you live abroad.
If you’re a British national living in Slovakia, you should seek medical advice from your local healthcare provider. Information about COVID-19 vaccines used in the national programme where you live, including regulatory status, should be available from local authorities.
If you receive your COVID-19 vaccination in Slovakia, you can get an EU Digital COVID Certificate from the national authorities. The Certificate proves that you have been vaccinated against COVID-19, received a negative test result, or recovered from COVID-19. It will help facilitate your travel within the EU and, in some countries, you can use it to demonstrate your COVID-19 status to businesses and other organisations.
