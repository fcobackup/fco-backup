Cases of coronavirus (COVID-19) have been confirmed in Gabon. The Gabonese authorities have introduced a number of measures to limit the spread of the virus.
Travel Restrictions and Borders
The Gabonese authorities have announced the suspension of all international flights until further notice. All land, sea and air borders have been closed indefinitely. Visa applications for individuals travelling from counties affected by coronavirus, including the UK, have been suspended until further notice.
Local Measures
Gatherings of more than 10 people have been banned.
Failure to comply with the measures above would constitute a criminal offence.
You should comply with any additional screening measures put in place by the authorities and keep up to date with information from your tour operator, transport or accommodation provider on the impact on any existing travel plans.
If you need further information about entry requirements, contact the local immigration authorities or the nearest Gabonese Embassy. You should also check with your airline or travel company for the latest information.
Further information on coronavirus, including advice on preparing for foreign travel and helping reduce the spread of the virus, is available from Public Health England and on the TravelHealthPro website.
