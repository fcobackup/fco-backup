Public spaces and services
As of 3 May, Macao has introduced a QR three-colour code system, which replaces the previous digital health declaration needed at border checkpoints and for entering public administration premises, casinos and other venues. The new code requires its registrants to confirm whether they have been in COVID-19 quarantine at home or in a government-run facility and consists of three colours: red, yellow, green. Visitors receiving red or yellow codes may be subject to testing, hospitalisation or restrictions on their movements.
Bus services between Hong Kong and Macao, using the Hong Kong-Zhuhai-Macao Bridge, recommenced a limited service on 8 May. All passengers wanting to board a shuttle bus to cross the bridge departing from Hong Kong to Macau must present a certificate confirming that they have tested negative for COVID-19 within seven days of their departure. Contact the service provider for the latest schedule.
