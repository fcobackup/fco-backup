Travel in Ecuador
The Ecuadorean government provides coronavirus-related information on the Coronavirus Ecuador website. The Ministry of Health also provides an information page. However, the most up to date information is accessible via their Twitter account.
Public spaces and services
Following the end of a national state of emergency, as of 13 September, curfew restrictions are no longer in place. Power to impose controls and tailor regulations is now devolved to local municipalities and to other competent authorities (amongst others, health, transport and education). Ecuador´s National Emergency Operations Committee (COE) will continue to operate nationwide to review the COVID-19 situation.
A national public health emergency remains in place. The Ecuadorean Ministry of Health issued an emergency extension of 90 days (Acuerdo 57) on 13 September 2020. The general nationwide biosecurity measures include:
extra precaution advised for people over 60 years old, and those whose medical conditions make them vulnerable to COVID-19
mandatory use of face masks in public spaces.
all individuals to comply with social distancing measures and practice frequent hand washing
schools at all levels and universities remain closed nationwide. Classes will be delivered online
remote working continues to be encouraged
public gatherings are prohibited
authorised labs to undertake COVID-19 tests
a nationwide tracing app ( ̔ASI Ecuador̕ ) is available to alert people if they have been in contact with a confirmed COVID-19 case during the last 15 days. The app is supported via Bluetooth and maintains the confidentiality of users
land borders with Colombia and Peru remain closed until further notice. However, Ecuadorean nationals and foreign residents may be allowed to enter Ecuadorvia the Rumichaca and Huaquillas northern and southern borders.
New phase of restrictions
The central government´s “red, amber, green” alert system is no longer in force. However, it will be used as an internal management tool for epidemiological monitoring.
Each municipal government is responsible for determining their own specific restrictions including, but not limited to, maximum capacity for public transport and institutions, operations capacity of private businesses, the circulation of private vehicles against licence plate numbers, health prevention protocols for all businesses and industries and alcohol consumption. You can follow their social media channels to obtain the most up to date notifications, but bear in mind that these might change at any time:
Quito: @MunicipioQuito; Guayaquil: @alcaldiagye; Cuenca: @MunicipioCuenca; Galapagos: @CGGalapagos
Ecuador’s National Emergency Operations Committee (COE) has a website with their official resolutions (Spanish only).
Within the national health emergency, the Ecuadorean Ministry of Health will continue to issue the required health prevention measures, including PCR tests and any mandatory self-isolation (Aislamiento Preventivo Obligatorio – APO) requirements.
You can apply online for a safe passage certificate (‘salvo conducto’) if you need to move in a private vehicle (for example to a doctor’s appointment) on days on which your registration plate would not normally be permitted to circulate. Certificates formerly obtained from the Ministries of Interior and Foreign Affairs can be validated until 31 October 2020.
Inter-provincial bus transport operation has been authorised by local municipalities, at 75% capacity, from/to bus terminals. Accredited tourist transport vehicles are not subject to any mobility restriction.
The reopening of beaches will continue to be monitoring through the “Distancia2” app
All COVID-19 measures will continue to be enforced robustly and infringements will be handled by the related competent authorities.
Restrictions in Quito
Quito Municipality continues with its campaign to increase testing and triage.
In addition to adhering to the standard general biosecurity measures, you must carry an identity card at all times. All public gatherings are suspended. Pubs, nightclubs and gyms are also closed until further notice. All sport activities that cannot comply with the minimum distancing requirements are also suspended temporarily.
Shops, supermarkets, restaurants and banks can operate at 50% capacity; cinemas and theatres at 30% capacity; and the municipality´s public transport, bus terminals and interstate and tourist transport can operate at a maximum 50% capacity.
Private vehicles will continue to circulate through the “Hoy Circula” system as follows:
Vehicles with licence plates ending with odd numbers (1, 3, 5, 7 and 9) can circulate Monday, Wednesday and Friday.
Vehicles with licence plates ending with even numbers (2, 4, 6, 8 and 0) can circulate Tuesday, Thursday and Saturday.
All vehicles can circulate on Sundays.
The Municipality can issue special safe passage documents (“salvoconducto”) for private vehicles which can justify their need to circulate outside the “Hoy Circula” restrictions. There will be an interim period for private vehicles with former special safe passage documents, issued by the central transport authority, to use and replace them with the Municipality documents by 31 October 2020.
Infringements to any of the above restrictions will be handled by Quito´s local government.
