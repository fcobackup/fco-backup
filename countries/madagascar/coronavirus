COVID-19 vaccines if you live in Madagascar
Madagascar has joined the COVAX initiative and a domestic vaccination programme began in May.
The first round of the vaccination programme closed on 17 June. We will update these pages when further information is available on the next round of vaccinations.
The Medicines and Healthcare Products Regulatory Agency (MHRA) is the UK authority responsible for assessing the safety, quality and efficacy of vaccines. It has authorised the Pfizer/BioNTech, Oxford/AstraZeneca, Moderna and Janssen (Johnson and Johnson) vaccines for temporary supply and use in the UK. Find out more about MHRA approval for these vaccines.
British nationals living overseas should seek medical advice from their local healthcare provider in the country where they reside. Information about vaccines used in other national programmes, including regulatory status, should be available from the local authorities. This list of Stringent Regulatory Authorities recognised by the World Health Organisation may also be a useful source of additional information.
