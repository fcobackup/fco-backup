The FCDO currently advises against all travel to Sudan. All parts of the country should be considered potentially unsafe. Significant disturbance and conflict may occur at any time.
Political situation
A military coup in 2021 triggered the ongoing political crisis. The political situation deteriorated significantly when violent clashes broke out in April 2023. The FCDO currently advises against all travel to Sudan.
Telecommunications
There are intermittent communication blackouts. Mobile phone and internet services are currently only partially available and telecommunications networks could be disrupted without warning.
Crime
Due to the current conflict and economic situation there have been increases in opportunistic crime, petty theft, muggings, demands for money at checkpoints, mobile phone and bag-snatching (including drive-by bag snatching by thieves on motorbikes), aggressive begging (including attempts to open the doors of stationary vehicles), and burglaries.
Don’t leave valuable items on display in your car while travelling and keep doors and windows closed and locked at all times. If you are stopped, avoid confrontation.
Road travel
Road travel will involve heightened levels of risk due to the current conflict and should only be undertaken if strictly necessary.
Road traffic accidents are common in Sudan. There is a high risk of being involved in a traffic accident when using public transport or vehicles for hire such as rickshaws and ‘amjad minivans’.
Road conditions are poor and many roads, even major ones, are not tarred or have potholes. Many roads are unsurfaced. Roads are used by pedestrians, donkey-carts and rickshaws, as well as motor vehicles. At night, there is generally no street lighting and many vehicles have no lights.
Many areas south of Khartoum become inaccessible by road during the rainy season from July to October. The wadis (dry riverbeds) are subject to dangerous flash floods, and many are not passable during the rains except on a major road.
You can drive in Sudan using a full UK driving licence for a maximum period of 3 months. You may be able to get a local driving licence from the police traffic department. Although drivers should have a licence and insurance, many do not have these. Make sure you have adequate insurance.
Sudanese law prohibits the use of mobile phones while driving. 
Air travel
Khartoum International Airport (KRT) remains closed following the outbreak of violence in April 2023 and there are no commercial flight services operating to Sudan. However, FCDO understands that some commercial flight operations leaving Sudan, from Port Sudan Airport, have started. We understand that these have been operated by Sudanese airlines. There are no Sudanese airlines that meet international safety standards.
The UK Air Safety List (ASL) lists all known airlines operating in Sudan that do not meet international safety standards and are banned from operating commercial air services to, from and within the UK. Check the UK Air Safety List when considering which airline to fly with. This list is maintained by the Department for Transport, based on advice from the UK Civil Aviation Authority.
Sea travel
Piracy has been reported in the Red Sea around the Gulf of Aden. Be vigilant and seek local advice. For more information , see our piracy and armed robbery at sea page.
If you go ashore along the Red Sea Coast, ensure you have reviewed the relevant country travel advice and have the correct documentation for entry.
