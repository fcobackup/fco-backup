The information on this page covers the most common types of travel and reflects the UK government’s understanding of the rules currently in place. Unless otherwise stated, this information is for travellers using a full ‘British Citizen’ passport.
The authorities in the country or territory you’re travelling to are responsible for setting and enforcing the rules for entry. If you’re unclear about any aspect of the entry requirements, or you need further reassurance, you’ll need to contact the embassy, high commission or consulate of the country or territory you’re travelling to.
You should also consider checking with your transport provider or travel company to make sure your passport and other travel documents meet their requirements.
Visas
Visas aren’t required from visiting British passport holders provided you hold a return/onward ticket and sufficient funds for your stay. You’ll normally be granted a 1 month stay. This can be extended on application to the Ministry of Foreign Affairs and Immigration in Bairiki, for additional 1 month periods for a maximum 3 additional months, provided your passport remains valid. If you’re arriving for employment you should obtain a visa in advance by arrangement with your employer.
