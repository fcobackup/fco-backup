The FCDO advises against all but essential travel to:
the whole of Panama based on the current assessment of COVID-19 risks.
Travel to Panama is subject to entry restrictions
International flights have resumed to and from Tocumen International Airport.
Entry to Panama is closed to all those who have been in the United Kingdom or South Africa 20 days prior to their arrival unless they are Panamanian nationals or residents.
Entry to Panama is open to Panamanian nationals, residents, tourists and business travelers who have a negative COVID19 PCR test certificate and who have not spent time in the United Kingdom or South Africa in the 20 days prior to their journey. The certificate must be obtained no more than 48 hours before you travel. If you cannot do this, a test can be taken at the airport on arrival at a cost of USD 50.00. If the test is positive, there is a mandatory requirement to quarantine for at least 7 days at a government facility.
