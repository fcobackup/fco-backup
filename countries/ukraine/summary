The Foreign and Commonwealth Office (FCO) advise against all travel to Donetsk oblast, Luhansk oblast and Crimea.
The security situation in the south-eastern parts of the Donetsk and Luhansk oblasts of Ukraine remains highly unstable with ongoing clashes between Ukrainian armed forces and Russian-backed armed separatists. Consular support is not available in parts of Ukraine not currently under control of the Ukrainian authorities: Crimea and parts of Donetsk and Luhansk oblasts. See Crimea and Eastern Ukraine
