Cases of coronavirus have been confirmed in Tanzania. The Tanzanian authorities have introduced a number of measures to limit the spread of the virus,
Travel restrictions
The Government of Tanzania have put in place strengthened screening measures at airports for all passengers arriving into Tanzaniaâ€™s three international airports (Dar es Salaam, Kilimanjaro and Zanzibar). You will need to provide personal details and be subject to a temperature check.
The Government of Tanzania is implementing mandatory quarantine for anyone arriving from high risk countries, even for those without symptoms. We are seeking clarification from the Government of Tanzania as to whether this includes the UK. You should comply with any additional screening measures put in place by the authorities.
For information on how to return to the UK from Tanzania, see Return to the UK.
Local measures
The government has also banned public gatherings, closed schools and universities, and suspended sporting competitions.
