The information on this page covers the most common types of travel and reflects the UK government’s understanding of the rules currently in place. Unless otherwise stated, this information is for travellers using a full ‘British Citizen’ passport.
The authorities in the country or territory you’re travelling to are responsible for setting and enforcing the rules for entry. If you’re unclear about any aspect of the entry requirements, or you need further reassurance, you’ll need to contact the embassy, high commission or consulate of the country or territory you’re travelling to.
You should also consider checking with your transport provider or travel company to make sure your passport and other travel documents meet their requirements.
Entry rules in response to coronavirus (COVID-19)
Entry to Bulgaria
From 1 May 2021, Bulgaria has banned the entry of travellers from India, Bangladesh, Brazil and several African countries. Exemptions apply for Bulgarian nationals as well as permanent and long-term Bulgarian residents, but they are required to complete a mandatory 10 day quarantine.
From 1 May 2021, all other travellers to Bulgaria, regardless of their nationality and point of departure (other than above), are required to present one of the following documents:
A vaccination certificate indicating an approved vaccine schedule has been completed at least 14 days before arrival. The document must contain the name in Latin alphabet, date of birth, date(s) dose(s) administered, name of vaccine, batch number of dose(s), manufacturer name, name of country and organisation who has issued the certificate; or
A document showing a positive result from a PCR or rapid antigen test for people who have recovered from COVID-19. This must be dated at least 15, but no more than 180 days before arrival. The document must contain name of the person, details of the medical institution that performed the test (name, address or other contact details), date of test, type of test (PCR or RAT), and ‘Positive’ written in Latin.
The types of vaccine and antigen tests that are accepted by Bulgarian authorities are listed in the annexes (in Bulgarian) at the end of the published ordinance.
In addition to the above, UK nationals, permanent or long-term residents in Bulgaria and family members of Bulgarian nationals can instead submit:
A negative PCR test performed within 72 hours before entry into Bulgaria or a rapid antigen test performed up to 48 hours before entry. The document must contain the names of the person, details of the medical institution that performed the test (name, address or other contact details, date on with the examination of the test (PCR or RAT) and ‘Negative’ written in Latin.
UK nationals, Bulgarian citizens and foreign nationals with valid residence permits, as well as their immediate family members, can opt for a quarantine of 10 days on arrival in lieu of presentation of either a vaccination document or a negative COVID-19 PCR test result upon arrival in Bulgaria (undertaken up to 72 hours before arrival).
Immediate family members are restricted to the following categories: wife, husband, or a person you live with in a relationship akin to marriage; and dependent children under the age of 18 years of age. You will be expected to show documentation to prove relationship status (eg birth or marriage certificate) if you are not in possession of a Bulgarian residence permit.
The option of a 10 day quarantine on arrival, in lieu of a PCR test for people legally resident in Bulgaria, can be shortened if they present a negative PCR test performed within 24 hours of arriving in Bulgaria. The quarantine requirement will be revoked within 24 hours of submitting the document demonstrating the negative PCR test result.
A list of places offering PCR testing in Bulgaria is available from the Bulgarian government (in Bulgarian).
You should submit the document showing a negative result of the PCR test to the respective Regional Health Inspectorate.
For Sofia Health Inspectorate, submit your document to the following email address: director@srzi.bg. Due to an increased amount of inquiries, the health authorities may not have enough capacity to respond to each email individually so you should call them directly to find out if your quarantine has been lifted. Contact numbers are listed here.
The measures are in force at all air, road, rail and sea border crossings into Bulgaria.
Further information on the full range of exemptions is available on the following Bulgarian Government web site (in Bulgarian). If you fall into one of the exempted categories, you should contact your travel operator in advance of travel for further information on how to demonstrate your exemption from the travel ban.
Many land borders crossings in the region are restricted or closed for passenger traffic. Furthermore, neighbouring countries are implementing additional health requirements for entry to or departure from Bulgaria including declarations and COVID-19 tests. You should check the relevant FCDO Travel Advice.
If you need to travel, plan ahead and before you travel check border information published by the Ministry of Interior (English and Bulgarian) before you travel.
Quarantine requirements
Arrivals to Bulgaria, with the exception of those arriving from India, Bangladesh, Brazil and several African countries, are not required to quarantine if they have provided a negative PCR test result taken up to 72 hours before arrival. The negative result must specifically mention it was a PCR test to be accepted by Bulgarian authorities.
Check the list of UK private providers of Coronavirus testing and make arrangements for your test in good time. It may not be possible to secure a test at short notice. There is no exemption set out in the Bulgarian Ministry of Health Ordinance for children or infants.
Bulgarian citizens, residents, and their immediate family members may opt to undertake a mandatory 10-day quarantine period upon arrival to Bulgaria in lieu of providing evidence of a negative PCR test result. This quarantine will be overseen by the Regional Health Authority for the region where you reside. You will be required to provide an address where you will stay for the full 10-day period and should expect checks to be made to ensure that you are complying with the terms of the quarantine in full. Fines or a prison sentence can be imposed on those found to have broken the quarantine requirement.
The option of a 10 day quarantine on arrival, in lieu of a PCR test for people legally resident in Bulgaria, can be shortened if they present a negative PCR test performed within 24 hours of arriving in Bulgaria. The quarantine requirement will be revoked within 24 hours of submitting the document demonstrating the negative PCR test result.
A list of places offering PCR testing in Bulgaria is available here in Bulgarian.
You should submit the document showing a negative result of the PCR test to the respective Regional Health Inspectorate.
For Sofia Health Inspectorate, submit your document to the following email address: director@srzi.bg.

Contact numbers are listed here.
A very small number of travellers are exempted from both the quarantine requirement, and the need to provide evidence of a negative PCR test. These include people transiting through Bulgaria and hauliers and transport crew members of vessels or aircraft who do not remain in Bulgaria following their work-related duties. Check the latest information on the Ministry of Interior website (English and Bulgarian).
Regular entry requirements
Visas
The rules for travelling or working in European countries changed from 1 January 2021:
you can travel to Bulgaria for up to 90 days in any 180-day period without a visa. This applies if you travel as a tourist, to visit for family or friends, to attend business meetings, cultural or sports events, or for short-term studies or training
visits to other EU or Schengen countries do not count towards your 90-day limit in Bulgaria as it is not in the Schengen area. Visits to Bulgaria do not count towards your 90-day visa-free limit in the Schengen area
to stay longer, to work or study, for business travel or for other reasons, you will need to meet the Bulgarian government’s entry requirements. Check with the Bulgarian Embassy what type of visa and/or work permit you may need
if you stay in Bulgaria with a visa or permit, your stay does not count towards your 90-day visa-free limit
Any time you spent in Bulgaria before 1 January 2021 does not count towards the 90-day visa-free limit.
At Bulgarian border control, you may need to use separate lanes from EU, EEA and Swiss citizens when queueing. Your passport may be stamped on entry and exit. You may also need to:
show a return or onward ticket
show you have enough money for your stay
Passport validity
Check your passport is valid for travel before you book your trip, and renew your passport if you do not have enough time left on it.
You must have at least 6 months left on an adult or child passport to travel to most countries in Europe (not including Ireland).
If you renewed your current passport before the previous one expired, extra months may have been added to its expiry date. Any extra months on your passport over 10 years may not count towards the 6 months needed.
There are separate requirements for those who are resident in Bulgaria. If you are resident in Bulgaria, you should carry proof of residence as well as your valid passport when you travel. For further information on these requirements, see our Living in Bulgaria guide.
