Cases of coronavirus (COVID-19) have been confirmed in the Dominican Republic. The local authorities have introduced measures to limit the spread of the virus.
The FCO strongly encourage non-resident British nationals in Dominican Republic to consider leaving quickly to avoid difficulties they will face if travel out of the country and the region are further restricted and they are unable to get home. For information on how to return to the UK from Dominican Republic, see Return to the UK
The Dominican government set up a dedicated website and helpline (call *462) to provide more information on the Dominican Republic’s response to coronavirus. Both of these services operate in Spanish. The helpline is experiencing a high volume of calls and is likely to be under pressure.
Entry and borders
All of the Dominican Republic’s air, land and sea borders closed with effect from 19 March until 30 April. This applies to journeys both to and from the Dominican Republic.
There is a quarantine requirement for visitors who have been in Europe, China, South Korea or Iran during the previous two weeks. You should comply with additional screening and quarantine measures put in place by the authorities. These regulations may be subject to change at short notice and you should check with your travel provider before your journey.
Cruise ships are not being allowed to dock in Dominican ports.
Information is available (in Spanish) from the Ministry of the Presidency.
Local measures
The Dominican Government has announced a national State of Emergency until 30 April.
If you’re in the Dominican Republic, you should follow the regulations set out by the Dominican government in full. All of the measures below remain in place until 30 April:
All air, land and sea borders are closed. Ferry flights for foreign nationals continue, but need authorisation from the Dominican authorities.
A curfew is in place from 5pm to 6am every day (please see below).
There is a lockdown in place: everybody should stay at home and only leave when necessary for food, medical supplies or medical attention.
When leaving home, only one member of the family should go out and they should follow social distancing rules (2 metres away from any other person).
It is mandatory to wear a mask in public places.
All events have been suspended, including international and national events, sports fixtures, bars, nightclubs and cultural events.

There is a curfew in place between the hours of 5pm and 6am (local time). This applies to everyone in the country, except those with specific exemptions (e.g. healthcare workers) or those with a medical emergency travelling to/from a medical facility. All British nationals in the Dominican Republic should observe this restriction.

Visas
During the current coronavirus measures, the tourist visa for the Dominican Republic can be extended up to a total of 120 days and this can be done either online at the Dominican Directorate General for Migration or at the airport on departure. We are working with the Ministry of Foreign Affairs and will request a waiver of the visa extension fee where possible. Contact the Embassy on UK.inDominicanRepublic@fco.gov.uk before your flights to see if this applies in your case.

Further information on coronavirus, including advice on preparing for foreign travel and helping reduce the spread of the virus, is available from Public Health England and on the TravelHealthPro website.
