Local Measures
Visitors from high-risk countries for coronavirus, including the United Kingdom, are no longer permitted to enter Malawi unless they have a residence permit. The Ministry of Health is now screening all travellers on arrival. Individuals showing with symptoms of coronavirus may be moved into a treatment facility.
Returning residents will need to conduct a mandatory period of self-isolation for 14 days on arrival and will remain under surveillance by health workers. Anyone who is unable to self-isolate at home may be transferred to a local treatment facility for the self-isolation period. Travellers are not permitted to self-isolate in a hotel or lodge.
Current information is available from the Malawi Ministry of Health Facebook page.
You should comply with any additional screening measures put in place by the authorities. Keep up to date with information from your tour operator, transport or accommodation provider on the impact on any existing travel plans.
The President of Malawi declared a State of Disaster on 20 March. Schools have been closed since 23 March and gatherings of more than 100 people are banned.
