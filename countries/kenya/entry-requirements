This page has information on travelling to Kenya.
This page reflects the UK government’s understanding of current rules for people travelling on a full ‘British Citizen’ passport from the UK, for the most common types of travel.
The authorities in Kenya set and enforce entry rules. If you’re unsure how Kenya’s entry requirements apply to you, contact its UK embassy, high commission or consulate.
All travellers
From 9 May 2023 the Government of Kenya no longer requires proof of either COVID-19 vaccination or a negative COVID-19 PCR test for entry into Kenya.
Travellers with flu-like symptoms, will be required to undergo a rapid antigen test at their own cost of 30 USD. Those who test positive on antigen RDT will be required to take a PCR test at their own cost of 50 USD and self-isolate as per Ministry of Health guidance on isolation. Those with severe symptoms shall then be allowed to isolate as per the prevailing isolation requirements for mild, moderate and severe disease.
Any traveller entering Kenya with flu-like symptoms will be required to fill the passenger locator form on the ‘jitenge’ platform: https://ears.health.go.ke/airline_registration/ and may be asked to undergo a rapid antigen test at their own cost regardless of age or vaccination status.
Full details of the Government of Kenya’s entry requirements in relation to coronavirus can be found on the Kenya Civil Aviation Authority website.
Drones
The Kenyan Civil Aviation Authority (KCAA) imposes strict controls on the import and export of drones to and from Kenya. You will not be allowed to bring a drone to Kenya without prior approval from the KCAA. If you plan to bring a drone to Kenya, you should contact the KCAA well in advance of travel.
Check your passport and travel documents before you travel
Passport validity
If you are visiting Kenya, your passport should be valid for 6 months from the date you arrive.
You should have at least two blank pages in your passport on arrival.
Check with your travel provider to make sure your passport and other travel documents meet their requirements.
Visas
You need a visa to enter Kenya. Kenyan entry visas are exclusively issued electronically, with passengers required to obtain their e-visas before departure. You can apply for single entry and transit visas on the Kenya e-visa website.
British passport holders visiting Kenya aged 16 and over require a valid individual visa for Kenya.
For more information, see the website of the Kenyan High Commission in London.
Work permits
You must have a work permit before starting employment in Kenya. It’s illegal to work without one. This needs to be applied for before coming to Kenya to work. This also applies to voluntary work and the self-employed. You can apply for a work permit at the Department of Immigration Services website. The government of Kenya has promised swift action against those who do not comply, including deportation. The Government of Kenya is prioritising the availability of high quality jobs for Kenyan nationals, and may not grant a work permit to a British national if the job in question could be done by a Kenyan national.
If you’re already in Kenya, and your application for a work permit is successful, you will be required to hand in your passport to immigration for a permit stamp to be inserted. During this period, you should always carry a certified copy of your passport for identification purposes. A local lawyer can provide this.
Yellow fever certificate requirements
You may need a yellow fever certificate when entering Kenya from certain destinations. Check whether you need a yellow fever certificate by visiting the National Travel Health Network and Centre’s TravelHealthPro website.
Returning to the UK
When leaving Kenya, you will be required to show compliance with entry requirements for the UK and any transit countries.
You can use the UK’s proof of COVID-19 recovery and vaccination record to demonstrate your vaccination record when leaving Kenya.
