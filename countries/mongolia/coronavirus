The government of Mongolia has confirmed that foreign nationals who have permanent residency status in Mongolia are eligible for its national vaccination rollout.

The Medicines and Healthcare Products Regulatory Agency (MHRA) is the UK authority responsible for assessing the safety, quality and efficacy of vaccines.
