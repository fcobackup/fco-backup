The information on this page covers the most common types of travel and reflects the UK government’s understanding of the rules currently in place. Unless otherwise stated, this information is for travellers using a full ‘British Citizen’ passport.
The authorities in the country or territory you’re travelling to are responsible for setting and enforcing the rules for entry. If you’re unclear about any aspect of the entry requirements, or you need further reassurance, you’ll need to contact the embassy, high commission or consulate of the country or territory you’re travelling to.
You should also consider checking with your transport provider or travel company to make sure your passport and other travel documents meet their requirements.
Border controls
The Danish government, from 12 noon, 14 March will temporarily close its borders for foreign nationals who do not have a recognised purpose for entering Denmark. A recognised purpose includes e.g. if the person lives or works in Denmark or has been commissioned to provide goods or services in Denmark. All Danish citizens will be allowed to continue to cross the border. Transport of all goods, food and medicine will be also be allowed to cross the border. Border checks will be implemented at all entry points. The measures are set to run until 13 April. Travellers from the UK will continue to be able to leave Denmark. Airports remain open at present. We recommend that UK travellers contact their airline operators to arrange return to the UK.
The Danish authorities increased border controls at the land border with Germany in January 2016. Border controls were also introduced in November 2019 for travellers from Rønne, Helsingør, Frederikshavn, Grenaa and those using the Øresund Bridge, including all train traffic from Sweden. These checks are temporary but will be in place for an unspecified period of time.
If you’re travelling using the land border, or by rail, road, or ferry you should make sure you have your passport with you. Allow additional time, be vigilant and follow the instructions of local authorities. Check with local media, your carrier, ferry operator or Danish State Railways (DSB) for more information.
When crossing from Denmark to Sweden various forms of ID are accepted, but must include a photograph, the holder’s full name, social security number or date of birth, holders signature, a stated validity and information on the issuing authority. Children under 18 accompanied by an adult with the appropriate ID are not required to carry ID themselves.

Visas
