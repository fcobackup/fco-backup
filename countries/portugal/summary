The Foreign, Commonwealth & Development Office (FCDO) advises against all but essential travel to:
mainland Portugal based on the current assessment of COVID-19 risks.
If you are travelling to the UK from mainland Portugal, you may need to self-isolate on your return (unless you are exempt). Check the latest guidance for England, Northern Ireland, Scotland and Wales.
The autonomous regions of Madeira and Azores are on the list of countries and territories where self-isolation is not required on return to the UK.
Travel to Portugal is subject to entry restrictions
The Portuguese Government has announced that from 1 January 2021, travel by UK nationals to Portugal will not be permitted, except for essential purposes. This restriction does not apply to UK nationals who are legally resident in Portugal or any other EU member state
On arrival in Portugal including Madeira, Porto Santo and the Azores, you will be required to provide a certificate confirming a negative RT-PCR test result for SARS/COVID-19 taken within 72 hours of departure (not required for children aged 2 or under). Airlines are likely to deny boarding if you cannot provide this at check-in. Check the requirements with your airline in advance of travelling
In Madeira, you will be required to take an additional RT-PCR test 5 to 7 days after your initial test. From the day you arrive in Madeira until you receive the results of this additional test, you must remain in isolation
See Entry requirements for more information before you plan to travel.
