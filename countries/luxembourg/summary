The Foreign, Commonwealth & Development Office (FCDO) advises against all but essential travel to:
the whole of Luxembourg based on the current assessment of COVID-19 risks.
If you are returning to the UK from Luxembourg, you will need to self-isolate on your return (unless you are exempt). Check the latest guidance for England, Northern Ireland, Scotland and Wales.
Travel is subject to entry restrictions
Due to COVID-19 restrictions, the Luxembourg Government has announced that from 1 January 2021 UK nationals will not be permitted entry to Luxembourg for non-essential purposes due to EU-wide COVID-19 restrictions on non-EU and EEA nationals. More information is provided on the Luxembourg government website. Essential travel is still permitted and a list of exemptions for entering Luxembourg can be found here.
From Thursday 24 December the Luxembourg Government requires airline passengers from the UK to be in possession of a negative PCR COVID-19 test result. This test should be taken no more than 48 hours before arrival in Luxembourg.
Passengers with a negative PCR test taken between 48 -72 hours before their arrival, must take another test at the airport, and self-quarantine until the results are received.
Antigen tests will also be accepted.
If you are travelling to Luxembourg by air, you will be asked to complete a passenger locator form while on the plane.
