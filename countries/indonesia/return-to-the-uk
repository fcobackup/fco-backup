There are currently very limited commercial options available to return to the UK from Jakarta and no commercial options to return from Bali.
Public health measures by the Indonesian authorities to restrict domestic travel connected with the Eid holiday, announced on 23 April, include a ban on most in-country air travel until 1 June (with some exceptions – which may extend to domestic flights made by foreign nationals as part of a journey home). This has increased commercial pressures on international airlines still serving Indonesia, which is likely to reduce options for travellers.
We know this is concerning for British people trying to leave Indonesia The UK government is working closely with airlines, the Indonesian authorities and other governments to make sure options are available for you to return to the UK as soon as possible.
Flights
Remaining flight options from Jakarta are:
Qatar Airways has one flight daily from Jakarta via Doha. This service will be suspended from 26-28 and 30 April. From 1 May, this service will operate on Monday, Wednesday and Friday only.
Garuda Indonesia has one flight from Jakarta to Amsterdam on 30 April. This service will then be suspended. Onward transfers are available from Amsterdam to the UK.
Garuda Indonesia/JAL are operating flights from Jakarta via Tokyo Haneda airport on 26 and 28 April and 3 and 10 May. This service will then be suspended.
Before booking seats on any flights, check the entry and transit restrictions in place for countries on your proposed flight route. You should also check with your airline regularly ahead of your scheduled flight. The number of flights operating is reducing and continuing to change at short notice.
