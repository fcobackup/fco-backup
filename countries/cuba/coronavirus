Only airline passengers are allowed into the airport terminal buildings. When you are travelling to the airport, you can only be accompanied by the person driving you to and dropping you at the airport
At the beginning of 2021, the only direct flights between UK and Cuba were holiday charter flights to Varadero, although these are now suspended during the UK Covis-19 measures (advising against non essential international travel) announced on 4 January 2020. Commercial airlines may insist you have a ticket for your onward connection to return to the UK to board the plane in Havana, and evidence of a negative test for COVID-19 taken within 3 days before your travel to the UK.

Entry and borders
See Entry requirements to find out about entry requirements and what you will need to do when you arrive in Cuba.
Visa extensions and departure
During the period of Cuban government coronavirus measures, visa extension requirements were suspended while immigration offices have had limited services. If you were unable to renew your visa until now, all types of visas that expired during Coronavirus measures will remain valid for 90 days after the suspension on commercial flights is lifted, i.e. 90 days from 15 November 2020.
If you have dual British and Cuban nationality, you are subject to Cuban measures. From 1 April 2020, dual nationals required permission (from Cuban Immigration offices) to leave Cuba on the special repatriation and humanitarian flights. That is no longer a requirement but could be re-introduced if the Cuban authorities implement any new measures.
Travel in Cuba
Travel and transport within and between Provinces varies according to the measures in place. Any change in the situation in a province or municipality may mean inter-provincial or municipal transport links also change.

Face masks must be worn at all times when travelling on buses, in taxis, and private hire vehicles.
Visitors are allowed to hire cars (see important information in Road Travel section) but should check with the hire companies if they are open, have cars available, and check where you can drive to under current COVID-19 measures, before making plans.

Healthcare in Cuba
If you think you have COVID-19 symptoms, you should contact a local clinic straight away. If you are staying in a hotel, the hotel reception will be able to contact medical personnel for you. Owners of “casas particulares” will be able to help you to contact the local medical services.
If your PCR test is positive (even if you arrived with a certificate of a negative PCR test taken within 72 hours of your departure to Cuba) you will have to go into hospital or a centre being run by the Ministry of Health. You may not have any or much internet access. Your mobile phone roaming may not work in Cuba.
If you need to stay in hospital or under medical care, you must pay the bill by credit card when being discharged, or arrange payment directly by your travel insurance company. Cash payment (GBP, US Dollars, or Euros) is permitted too if credit cards do not work so you are advised to make contingency plans to bring cash with you.
If your PCR test is positive, any travelling companions with you will have to self-isolate in the accommodation and be tested again.
Cuban authorities aim to have PCR test results within 48 hours but that is not always achievable given the high volume of testing.
If you are staying in private home or a hotel, you are likely to receive regular home checks by medical representatives (known as “pesquisia”).
