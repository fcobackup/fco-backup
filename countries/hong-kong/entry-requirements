This page has information on travelling to Hong Kong. Check what you must do to return to the UK.
This page reflects the UK government’s understanding of current rules for people travelling on a full ‘British Citizen’ passport from the UK, for the most common types of travel.
The authorities in Hong Kong set and enforce entry rules.
All travellers
Although Hong Kong is now part of the People’s Republic of China, it remains a Special Administrative Region with its own immigration controls. You can visit Hong Kong for up to 6 months without a visa. However during the COVID-19 pandemic, different entry requirements are being applied in Hong Kong, including refusing entry to all non-Hong Kong residents from ‘high risk’ places. For up-to-date advice on entry requirements and restrictions, please visit the Hong Kong SAR government’s website.
Travellers who have visited the UK (or other specified countries) within the past 14 days are not currently permitted to enter Hong Kong or transit through Hong Kong International Airport. You should visit the Hong Kong SAR Government website for further details.
Direct entry to Hong Kong from all places other than mainland China, Macao and Taiwan is only possible for fully vaccinated Hong Kong residents who will need to undergo 14 days quarantine at a designated quarantine hotel. On arrival, travellers will need to provide confirmation of a hotel room reservation at their designated quarantine hotel. You can find further details on the Hong Kong SAR government website.
You should check the Hong Kong SAR government’s website for important details about the documents required and check the Hong Kong SAR government’s list of designated hotels when you make your booking. You must take designated transport, which is provided by the government, from the airport to your hotel.
Testing on arrival
All inbound travellers via Hong Kong International Airport need to submit a health declaration form.
All travellers ending their journey at Hong Kong International Airport will have to undergo a PCR test for coronavirus. Travellers will be required to remain at the airport whilst awaiting test results which can take a number of hours. Further information is available on the Centre for Health Protection’s website.
If you test positive, the Hong Kong authorities will arrange for admission to a public hospital where will remain in isolation for at least 10 days. If you are deemed to be a contact of a positive case, you will be placed in a Hong Kong government quarantine centre for 14 days. All arrivals including those who test negative for coronavirus need to undergo 14-day compulsory quarantine in a designated hotel, or the Hong Kong SAR Government’s Penny’s Bay Quarantine Centre in some cases. See “Quarantine requirements” below.
You may be separated from your child if one of you tests positive for coronavirus. If this happens to you, you can call +(852) 2901 3000 for 24/7 urgent consular assistance.
Quarantine requirements
Quarantine following travel is mostly spent at either the Hong Kong SAR Government’s Penny’s Bay Quarantine Centre, or a designated hotel.
Family members of someone who tests positive, or those who have been in contact with a positive case, will be placed in a government quarantine centre.
For up-to-date advice on entry requirements and restrictions, please visit the Hong Kong SAR government’s website.
For quarantine arrangements in Hong Kong:
you are not allowed to leave your designated quarantine location/room for 14 days. This means you’re also unable to leave Hong Kong for the duration of the quarantine
if you are allocated a government quarantine centre, you may be asked to contribute around £20 (HK$200) per night towards the cost
items that can be taken in to government quarantine are restricted. There is no smoking allowed and no alcohol. Depending on your centre, facilities may be basic: there may be no fridge and no air-conditioning
Failure to comply with the quarantine conditions may result in you being immediately taken to government quarantine facilities. You could face a 6-month prison sentence and a substantial fine. You should comply with the requirements of your quarantine arrangements.
See the Hong Kong government coronavirus website for further information.
Proof of vaccination status
Travellers who have visited the UK (or other specified countries) within the past 14 days are not currently permitted to enter Hong Kong or transit through Hong Kong International Airport, regardless of their vaccination status.
For travellers arriving from other countries, Hong Kong will accept the UK’s proof of COVID-19 recovery and vaccination record and proof of COVID-19 vaccination issued in the Crown Dependencies. Your last vaccine dose must have been administered at least 14 days prior to travel. Your NHS appointment card from vaccination centres is not designed to be used as proof of vaccination and should not be used to demonstrate your vaccine status.
Travellers arriving to Hong Kong will need to provide a negative nucleic acid test result for COVID-19, taken no more than 48 hours prior to their departure. The Hong Kong Government has specified that this must be a polymerase chain reaction (PCR) based nucleic acid test. Other types of tests such as the reverse transcription loop-mediated isothermal amplification (RT- LAMP) will not be accepted and do not fulfil the relevant boarding requirement. You will need a separate certificate confirming that the testing laboratory meets the required standards.
Travel between Hong Kong, Macao and mainland China
All border crossings with mainland China remain closed indefinitely, with the exception of the Shenzhen Bay Checkpoint and the Hong Kong-Zhuhai-Macao Bridge. All passengers wanting to board a shuttle bus to cross the bridge departing from Hong Kong to Macao must present a certificate confirming that they have tested negative for COVID-19 within 72 hours of their departure. The special ferry service between Taipa Ferry Terminal in Macao and Hong Kong International Airport has now ceased operations. All ferry crossings between Hong Kong and mainland China are currently not in operation with the exception of the service from Shenzhen Shekou Port to Hong Kong International Airport. Kai Tak Cruise and Ocean Terminals are also closed to passengers indefinitely.
Arrivals from mainland China, Taiwan and Macao must quarantine at home or in a hotel for 7 - 14 days. Certain groups of people travelling from mainland China, Taiwan and Macao may be granted an exemption from quarantine requirements by applying in advance to the Chief Secretary of the Administration.
Hong Kong residents in mainland China may be eligible for the Return2hk scheme, which enables quarantine free travel from mainland China to Hong Kong. Non-residents in mainland China may be eligible for the Come2hk scheme, which offers similar exemptions to entry requirements. You can find further information on the Hong Kong SAR government coronavirus website.
If you’re not fully vaccinated
If you are not fully vaccinated and have visited places outside mainland China, Macao or Taiwan within the past 14 days, you will be denied entry into Hong Kong.
If you’ve had COVID-19 in the past year
Travellers who have tested positive for Covid-19 in the past year do not have to follow any different procedures to current entry requirements.
Children and young people
Children travelling from countries on the designated list are not able to enter Hong Kong.
For travellers from other countries, proof of a single dose of the BioNTech vaccination will be accepted for 12-17 year-old Hong Kong residents, or those unable to receive a second vaccination for health reasons. Accompanied unvaccinated minors under the age of 12 who are Hong Kong residents or children of Hong Kong residents are also allowed to enter Hong Kong.
Children travelling alone will also need to quarantine for 14 days on arrival in a designated hotel. It is down to hotel policy whether a child can self-isolate alone. Further details can be found on the Hong Kong SAR government’s website and you should call the Port Heath Division (+852 3904 9333) to understand the latest requirements if your child is travelling alone.
If you’re transiting through Hong Kong
Transit services at Hong Kong International Airport are currently suspended for any-one who has visited a ‘High-risk’ country within the past 14 days. A list of ‘High-risk’ countries can be found on the Hong Kong SAR Government’s website.
Transiting through Hong Kong from, but not to, mainland China is now allowed. You should check with your travel agent or airline before travelling and check the Hong Kong International Airport website.
Transit passengers travelling through Hong Kong International Airport from anywhere other than mainland China, must provide a negative nucleic acid test result for COVID-19, taken no more than 48 hours prior to their departure. The Hong Kong SAR Government has specified that this must be a polymerase chain reaction (PCR) based nucleic acid test. Other types of test such as the reverse transcription loop-mediated isothermal amplification (RT- LAMP) will not be accepted.
There is a risk when transiting that you will be placed into isolation in hospital in Hong Kong or 14 days government quarantine. All passengers transiting Hong Kong Inter-national Airport will be subject to advanced screening measures, including temperature checks. Passengers deemed to have a high temperature will undergo further checks by the Port Health Office at the airport. If you meet further risk criteria, you will be transferred to a Hong Kong public hospital for mandatory checks/treatment, where it is highly likely you will be asked to complete a mandatory COVID-19 test. If you successfully pass health screening you need to sit in designated areas at boarding gates and use designated queues in dining facilities and shops, in line with Hong Kong International Airport anti-virus measures.
