Coronavirus guidance is being updated.
Read what you can and cannot do

There remain commercial options to return to the UK from Togo.
If you are usually based in the UK, you are strongly advised to return to the UK now by commercial means. Donâ€™t run the risk of getting stranded.
Flights
There are options available on Ethiopian Airlines flights to return to the UK from Togo. Check the latest information on the Ethiopian Airlines website.
Air France has operated several special flights for repatriation purposes after its final commercial flight but no further flights are confirmed at this time. If further flights are announced, these will likely become available at short notice.
UK special charter flights will only operate for priority countries where commercial flights are not possible. You should not assume these flights will become available in countries where commercial routes are operating. Please do not contact the contracted travel management company if no flight is advertised here.
You will need to pay for your return travel to the UK. If departure options are available but you cannot afford the travel costs and have exhausted all other options for getting funds, you may be eligible to apply for an emergency loan from the government. This is a last resort option and you would need to repay the loan when you are back in the UK. For more information, contact Corporate Travel Management (CTM). CTM are a commercial partner of the FCO and are authorised to administer such loans on behalf of the FCO.
