If you’re in Italy and wish to leave, you’re advised to contact your travel operator to make arrangements to do so as soon as possible.
Check FCO travel advice for France if you are intending to leave by land at the French border – you may be required to carry an “attestation” for your journey.
Air travel
The majority of carriers have now ceased operating direct flights between Italy and the UK.
Alitalia continue to operate flights on a reduced basis. Passengers on Alitalia flights are required to wear their own face masks onboard where the one metre distance rule cannot be guaranteed. Alitalia reserves the right to deny boarding if passengers do not have a facemask. More information can be found on the Alitalia website.
Other airlines have indicated that they will assist British tourists in Italy who have booked travel with them to return to the UK, which may require travel via other countries. Contact your airline as soon as possible.
Several neighbouring countries have imposed restrictions on people entering from Italy. You should consult travel advice for the country concerned.
