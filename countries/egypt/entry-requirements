Warning
FCDO advises against all travel to parts of Egypt.

This information is for people travelling on a full ‘British citizen’ passport from the UK. It is based on the UK government’s understanding of Egypt’s current rules for the most common types of travel.
The authorities in Egypt set and enforce entry rules. If you’re not sure how these requirements apply to you, contact the Egyptian Consulate General in the UK.
Passport validity requirements
To enter Egypt, your passport must have an ‘expiry date’ at least 6 months after the date you arrive and have at least one blank page.   
Check with your travel provider that your passport and other travel documents meet requirements. Renew your passport if you need to.
You will be denied entry if you do not have a valid travel document or try to use a passport that has been reported lost or stolen. 
Visa requirements
British passport holders travelling to Egypt normally need a visa.
If you are staying for less than 15 days at resorts in Sharm el Sheikh, Dahab, Nuweiba or Taba, you do not need a visa. You will get a free entry permission stamp on arrival. If you plan to travel outside the resorts or stay more than 15 days, you must get a visa. You can get a visa at Sharm el Sheikh airport or online.     
Applying for a visa
You can apply for a visa:
online – getting an e-visa in advance can help to prevent delays, tourist e-visas are valid for up to 3 months
in person or by post – apply through the Egyptian Consulate General in the UK
on arrival in Egypt – approved airports have kiosks in the arrival hall before you reach the immigration counters where you can buy a visa for 25 US dollars (cash only – Egyptian officials prefer dollars, but you may be able to pay in British pounds or euros, visas on arrival are valid for up to 30 days)
British passport holders from British Overseas Territories and Crown Dependencies cannot apply online. 
Visa extensions
You can apply for a visa extension at the Egyptian Passport and Immigration Offices. If you try to leave Egypt on an expired visa, you may face difficulties. You may get a fine if your visa has expired by more than 14 days. Contact the Egyptian Consulate General in the UK for more information.
Visa agents in airports
You do not need to buy a visa from an agent. Agents often charge more than the required 25 US dollars. If an agent harasses you, report the incident to the tourist police in the airport terminal.
Gender expression
You may be denied entry if your gender expression or physical appearance does not match the sex marker in your passport or your passport photograph. See general advice for LGBT+ travellers
Egypt-Sudan border crossing
It is no longer possible to cross the land border into Egypt from Sudan.  
If you are a British national and have previously crossed the border without valid documentation, contact the British Embassy in Cairo on + 20 (0) 2 2791 6000. See Regional risks.
Vaccine requirements
To enter Egypt, you must have a certificate to prove you’ve had a yellow fever vaccination if you’re coming from a country listed as a transmission risk.
For full details about medical entry requirements and recommended vaccinations, see TravelHealthPro’s Egypt guide.
HIV test for work permits
You will need to show HIV test results to apply for a work permit.
Customs rules
There are strict rules about goods you can take into or out of Egypt. You must declare anything that may be prohibited or subject to tax or duty. Contact the Egyptian Consulate General in the UK for more information about customs rules.
Taking money into or out of Egypt
You can bring up to 5,000 Egyptian pounds into or out of Egypt.
You must declare foreign currency worth more than 10,000 US dollars on arrival – there is no limit to the amount of foreign currency you can bring.
Electronic devices and other valuables
You must declare some valuables, including electronic devices and video cameras, when you arrive. Officials will note these in your passport. They may ask you to show the items when you leave the country. If you do not have them, you may have to pay a high rate of customs duty.
Satellite phones or radio equipment
Officials are likely to confiscate satellite phones or radio communications equipment unless you have prior clearance from the Ministry of Telecommunications.
