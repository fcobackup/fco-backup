The information on this page covers the most common types of travel and reflects the UK government’s understanding of the rules currently in place. Unless otherwise stated, this information is for travellers using a full ‘British Citizen’ passport.
The authorities in the country or territory you’re travelling to are responsible for setting and enforcing the rules for entry. If you’re unclear about any aspect of the entry requirements, or you need further reassurance, you’ll need to contact the embassy, high commission or consulate of the country or territory you’re travelling to.
You should also consider checking with your transport provider or travel company to make sure your passport and other travel documents meet their requirements.
Entry rules in response to coronavirus (COVID-19)
Entry to Hungary
Hungary has closed its border to most foreign nationals due to the coronavirus pandemic. There are some limited circumstances in which foreign nationals, including UK nationals, may be allowed entry.
Residents or family
UK nationals may enter Hungary if they hold a permanent residence permit or a permit allowing them to stay in Hungary for at least 90 days, and can present their documents to the authorities at the border. UK nationals travelling with a family member who is a Hungarian citizen or resident should also be allowed entry.
Others
UK nationals may also enter Hungary if they are travelling in the following circumstances:
arriving for the purpose of business or trade activity - see below,
transiting through Hungary through travel corridors – see below,
operating cargo transport,
people able to prove credibly that have recovered from Covid-19 within six months of their travel,
as part of a military convoy,
people travelling on diplomatic or official passports.
Business and trade activity
Foreign (including UK) nationals entering Hungary for business purposes, and representatives of foreign (including UK) companies with a stake in Hungary (i.e. joint venture) may enter the country without restrictions. On entry, you will need to show proof of an essential business requirement for entering Hungary, e.g. an official letter from your company that includes contact details for verification purposes, or an invitation to a business event. You can provide this on paper or electronically. You will be subject to a temperature check on arrival (see below – Testing / screening on arrival) but are not subject to quarantine measures.
Transiting through Hungary
You must provide proof that you entering Hungary is for the purposes of travelling directly to another destination outside Hungary; you must also explain the reason you are travelling and demonstrate that you are able to transit to your final destination, providing, for example, a hotel reservation or proof of address in another country, a travel ticket, or similar evidence.
Throughout the transit you can use only specified routes, dedicated petrol and rest stations and specific border crossing points (more information is available in Hungarian).
Pre-travel exemption
It is also possible to apply to the authorities for an exemption to enter Hungary in a further set of specific circumstances. To enter on this basis, you must gain permission in advance of travelling. You will need to show that you are travelling to Hungary for:
court proceedings,
business activities justified by central government, demonstrated with a letter of invitation issued by an administrative body, an independent regulatory body or an autonomous public administration body,
accessing healthcare with a referral,
studying or taking an exam, with certification from an education institution,
travelling to the point of departure for cargo-related transit,
participation in family events, e.g. marriage, baptism, funeral,
care of a relative,
participation in a sporting, cultural or church event of major international importance,
any other justifiable reason.
You should apply for an exemption in advance using the online form on the police website. While the forms are in the Hungarian, you may complete your submission in Hungarian or English.
Entry rules may change at short notice. You can find the latest announcements on the Hungarian government website (in English).
Testing / screening on arrival
All people entering Hungary will be subject to a temperature check on arrival. Unless resident in Hungary, foreign nationals will be denied entry should they show signs of Covid-19.
Most people entering Hungary must agree to enter mandatory quarantine, usually at home. You must notify the authorities of the location. If you have a suitable device, you must download software for police to monitor your quarantine. If on-site checks cannot be carried out in any other way, those in quarantine must allow police to enter their home.
If you have no place of residence in Hungary, you must enter quarantine at a government-designated location. Quarantine is legally enforced and a fine of around £375 equivalent is levied for breaking the rules.
It is possible to leave quarantine early following two negative Covid-19 tests within 5 days of each other but at least 48 hours apart. Tests are self-funded and your local environmental health office will need to give permission for you to leave quarantine for testing, and also to end quarantine early after showing evidence of two negative test results.
As of 18 September the price of coronavirus tests are capped at Ft 19,500. Having the test conducted at home my incur an additional charge. A list of environmental health offices in Budapest can be found here (in Hungarian); you must contact the office covering your place of residence. There is no single registry of environmental health offices outside Budapest; you will need to carry out an internet search for your local ‘Népegészségügyi Osztály’.
The government’s webpage (in Hungarian) has a list of medical centres where testing is available. Some offer home testing for an additional fee.
Regular entry requirements
Visas
If you hold a British Citizen passport, you don’t need a visa to enter Hungary. If you’re planning a stay of longer than 3 months, see our Living in Hungary guide and contact the Hungarian Embassy if you have further questions.
The rules on travel will stay the same until 31 December 2020.

if you are travelling to Hungary and other Schengen countries without a visa, make sure your whole visit is within the limit. Visits to Schengen countries within the previous 180 days before you travel would count towards the 90-day limit
To stay for longer, to work or study, for business or for other reasons, you will need to meet the entry requirements set out by Hungary. This could mean applying for a visa and/or work permit. You should check with the Hungarian Embassy what type of visa and/or work permit, if any, you will need.
if you are in Hungary with a visa or permit, your stay will not count towards the 90-day limit.
The 90-day limit for visa-free travel will begin on 1 January 2021. Any days you stay in Hungary or other Schengen countries before 1 January 2021 will not count towards the 90-day limit.

show a return or onward ticket
show you have enough money for your stay, and
use separate lanes from EU, EEA and Swiss citizens when queuing
Your passport may be stamped on entry and exit.
Passport validity
The rules on travel will stay the same until 31 December 2020.
Your passport should be valid for the proposed duration of your stay; you do not need any additional period of validity on your passport beyond this.
Passport validity from 1 January 2021
From 1 January 2021, you must have at least 6 months left on an adult or child passport to travel to most countries in Europe (not including Ireland).
If you renewed your current passport before the previous one expired, extra months may have been added to its expiry date. Any extra months on your passport over 10 years may not count towards the 6 months needed.
Check your passport is valid for travel before you book your trip. You will need to renew your passport before travelling if you do not have enough time left on your passport.
UK Emergency Travel Documents
UK Emergency Travel Documents are accepted for entry, airside transit and exit from Hungary.
Fines
Entry into Hungary can be barred if you have failed to pay a previous fine in Hungary. Contact the Hungarian Embassy in London for guidance on paying any outstanding fines before you next enter Hungary.
Customs regulations
Community regulations ensure the free movement of goods between EU member states. This means that no customs procedures are required for exporting goods from Hungary to another EU member state and/or for importing goods from a member state to Hungary. The export and import of goods purchased for non-commercial purposes (for personal use or as gifts) while travelling is not restricted, however, the transport of certain goods (such as: pets, hunting weapons, alcohol and tobacco products, medicines containing drugs, etc.) within the European Union is restricted or subject to special permissions.
Check the customs regulations before entering or leaving Hungary on the National Tax and Customs Administration of Hungary website.
