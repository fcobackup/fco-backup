The FCDO advise against all travel to the whole country.

FCDO advises against all travel to Niger, including the capital city of Niamey, for security reasons.
If you are in Niger
Travel within or out of Niger is at your own risk. The FCDO cannot offer advice on the safety of travelling to any departure point within Niger. We have temporarily withdrawn our UK staff from Niger and our embassy is operating remotely. Limited consular assistance will continue to be provided by the British Deputy High Commission in Lagos as usual.
If you are a British national in Niger and in need of assistance, contact FCDO’s 24/7 services:
by telephone: on +234 (1) 277 0782 and select option 2 for consular services for British nationals
by social media on Twitter and Facebook

If you decide to stay in Niger, or cannot leave, you should:
follow any advice from local authorities, including curfew
avoid protests, gatherings and any military activity
stay indoors where possible
be ready to leave if there is an opportunity

Security situation
There has been a military takeover in Niger, which has led to protests and unrest.
