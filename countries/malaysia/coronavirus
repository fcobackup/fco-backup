Coronavirus (COVID-19) cases have been confirmed in Malaysia.
Entry and travel restrictions
The government of Malaysia has introduced a Movement Control Order that restricts the entry of foreign nationals until 28 April 2020.
Under the terms of that Order, no foreign nationals can enter Malaysia except those with diplomatic passports, those who have Permanent Residence or those who are an “expatriate in an essential service”.
If you or your dependents have other visas, including working visas or “Malaysia My Second Home” visas, these do not qualify for an exemption and you will not be permitted to enter.
The government has published further clarifications setting out some exceptions on immigration, including for foreign national spouses of Malaysian citizens. However, this information has not necessarily been reflected in all guidance and we are aware of reports that airlines are refusing to accept passengers who do not meet the headline requirements in the main Order.
From 3 April 2020, anyone (including British Nationals) entering the country under the immigration rules mentioned above will be obliged to enter quarantine for 14 days in centres designated by the Government.
As of now, there are no restrictions on foreign nationals leaving Malaysia, though you will be subject to the same immigration restrictions and quarantine requirements if you wish to return while the Order remains in place. The Order is not preventing foreign nationals transiting via Kuala Lumpur International Airport (KLIA) provided they remain airside. Transit that requires passage through immigration (to collect bags, or to move between the two Kuala Lumpur terminals - KLIA and KLIA2) is not possible, unless you meet the general immigration requirements above. We understand that foreign nationals may not travel between East Malaysia (Sabah and Sarawak) and West Malaysia, except to transit directly onto an international flight, but have reports that this is being intermittently enforced. You should confirm any transit arrangements with your airline.
The Malaysian government does not require foreign nationals to leave Malaysia. However, the Movement Control Order requires non-essential businesses to restrict or cease operations. Essential services, including supermarkets and basic amenities are still functioning. Hotels and guesthouses have also been designated as essential services and directed by the Ministry of Tourism that they can accept new bookings from foreign (though not Malaysian) tourists, but many hotels are closing or already closed to new arrivals. Those accommodated in hotels are offered room service only and in some cases are being required to remain in their rooms. Further controls on travel within Malaysia may be imposed at short notice. Visitors to Malaysia should plan accordingly, taking account of the fast moving situation and your individual circumstances.
Foreign nationals currently in Malaysia whose visas expire during the Order can return to their country of origin during the period the Order is in place without extending/renewing their visas. They must possess a valid travel document for onward travel. Alternatively, they can extend or renew their expired visa by contacting the Immigration department within 14 days of the end of the Order. This applies to holders of Short Term Social Visit Pass and Long Term Social Visit Pass such as Temporary Employment Visit Pass, Expatriate Pass, Student Pass, Dependent’s Pass (to holders of Long Term Visit Pass) and Long Term Social Visit Pass (MM2H).
