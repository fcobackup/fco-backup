Coronavirus travel health

See the TravelHealthPro website for further advice on travel abroad and reducing spread of respiratory viruses during the COVID-19 pandemic.
International travel
Korean Air and Asiana are running direct flights from London to Seoul. Restrictions based on nationality and visa type have been lifted for regularly scheduled flights, but remain in place for some specially chartered flights.
Airline and ticket booking websites do not typically highlight in the booking process which flights have nationality or visa restrictions. You should contact the airline before booking to confirm that you will be eligible to take your desired flight based on your nationality and visa. Passengers who are ineligible to take a flight may be refused check-in even if they have purchased a ticket. Further information on Korean Air flight restrictions can be found on their COVID-19 Flight Status page.
You should remain aware of the quarantine requirements on entry. See Entry requirements.
Entry and borders
See Entry requirements to find out what you will need to do when you arrive in South Korea.
Returning to the UK
When you return, you must follow the rules for entering the UK.
You are responsible for organising your own COVID-19 test, in line with UK government testing requirements. You should contact local authorities for information on testing facilities.
Be prepared for your plans to change
No travel is risk-free during COVID. Countries may further restrict travel or bring in new rules at short notice, for example due to a new COVID-19 variant. Check with your travel company or airline for any transport changes which may delay your journey home.
If you test positive for COVID-19, you may need to enter a quarantine facility or hospital until you test negative. This could cause a significant delay to your travel plans. See Testing positive for COVID-19 below.
If you are travelling to South Korea, plan ahead and make sure you:
can access enough money to cover unexpected COVID-19-related costs
understand what your insurance will cover
can make arrangements to extend your stay and be away for longer than planned
Testing positive for COVID-19
If you think you might have COVID-19 while in South Korea, you should self-isolate immediately and contact the Korea Disease Control and Prevention Agency on 1339 for guidance (support is available in English). Outdoor sites where you can receive a free test are common in most cities. Results are usually issued via text message within 1-2 days.
If you test positive for COVID-19, you must comply with self-quarantine and treatment instructions issued by the Korean authorities. If you do not need treatment, you will generally be moved to a quarantine centre until you have received two consecutive negative tests. If you do need treatment, you will be moved to a hospital or treatment centre. There is currently no charge for quarantine centre stays or for medical care in a hospital/treatment centre as long as you have not violated any quarantine measures.
Individuals testing positive may spend over a month in hospital/community treatment centres before testing negative and being discharged. You may face additional costs if you have to rearrange your travel.
Anyone displaying symptoms or returning a positive test result for COVID-19 must comply with self-quarantine and treatment instructions issued by the Korean authorities. Failure to do so could result in imprisonment, deportation, the revocation of visas or residence permits and an entry ban, and you may be held liable for the cost of your treatment and for any economic losses incurred by further transmission of the virus. The Ministry of Justice has made clear that this policy applies to foreign residents as well as short-term visitors.
Public spaces and services
Face masks are compulsory in public places and on public transport. Failure to wear a mask can result in a fine of up to 100,000 Korean Won (£62).
South Korea currently has a four-level national social distancing scale.

COVID-19 vaccines if you live in South Korea
Wherever possible British nationals should aim to be vaccinated in the country where they live. We will update this page when the Government of South Korea announces new information on the national vaccination programme. You can sign up to get email notifications when this page is updated.
The South Korean national vaccination programme started in February 2021 and is using the AstraZeneca, Janssen (Johnson and Johnson), Moderna and Pfizer-BioNTech vaccines. British nationals resident in South Korea are eligible for vaccination.
All adults (including pregnant women) in South Korea have now been given the opportunity to book a vaccination, as have children aged 12 to 17. Booster shots are available for those aged 75 and over and those who are immunocompromised or immunosuppressed. Registration windows for different groups to book vaccinations are open at different times. Not all groups are currently able to make reservations. Some age groups and professions continue to be given priority. You should visit the KDCA website or contact the KDCA by phone from South Korea on 1339 (English language support is available) for advice on how to book your vaccination.
If you are eligible to be vaccinated, in addition to booking vaccination appointments via the KDCA you may be able to book an appointment at short notice to receive a “leftover vaccine”. This is a vaccine dose that was not administered because the intended recipient did not attend their vaccination appointment. Foreign nationals who belong to the Korean national health insurance scheme can use this service. “Leftover vaccine” appointments can be booked through the KakaoTalk and Naver apps (in Korean), on a first-come-first-served basis. You should look for guidance on this process (in Korean) inside the apps themselves or on the KakaoTalk and Naver websites.
Find out more, including about vaccines that are authorised in the UK or approved by the World Health Organisation, on the COVID-19 vaccines if you live abroad page.
If you’re a British national living in South Korea, you should seek medical advice from your local healthcare provider. Information about COVID-19 vaccines used in the national programme where you live, including regulatory status, should be available from local authorities.
Demonstrating your COVID-19 vaccination status in South Korea
If you were vaccinated in South Korea, you can demonstrate your COVID-19 vaccination status using the COOV app on your smartphone. If you were vaccinated outside South Korea and recently entered Korea using a Quarantine Exemption Certificate issued by a Korean Embassy overseas (see Entry requirements), you can take your Quarantine Exemption Certificate to your local health centre to register your vaccination and then can use the COOV app. There is no formal process at present for residents and visitors to register their overseas vaccination status with the Korean authorities without a Quarantine Exemption Certificate. The UK’s proof of COVID-19 recovery and vaccination record is not officially accepted inside South Korea.
