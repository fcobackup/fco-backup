The Foreign, Commonwealth & Development Office (FCDO) advise against all but essential travel to Switzerland. This is based on the current assessment of COVID-19 risks.
The FCDO is not advising those already travelling in Switzerland to leave at this time. You should follow the advice of the local authorities on how best to protect yourself and others, including any measures that they bring in to control the virus. Contact your travel operator if you have any questions about your return journey.
If you are returning to the UK from Switzerland on or after 29 August, you may need to self-isolate on your return. Check the latest guidance for England, Northern Ireland, Scotland and Wales.
The rules on self-isolation if returning to the UK from Switzerland changed on 15 August. If you’re travelling in Switzerland and use Basel-Mulhouse-Freiburg airport to return to the UK, you will transit Switzerland and therefore will be required to self-isolate on your return to the UK. For more information, see UK border control in the airport.
Travel is subject to entry restrictions
Travellers from the UK who do not have UK/EU/EFTA nationality will not be permitted to enter Switzerland. However there are some exceptions
Travellers who have visited certain countries within the past 14 days have to quarantine for 10 days on entry to Switzerland. The UK is currently exempt from this requirement, but travellers who have visited Gibraltar are subject to quarantine
