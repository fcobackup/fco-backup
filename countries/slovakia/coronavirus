Public spaces and services
The Slovak Government has imposed restrictions on public life to counter the spread of COVID-19.
Over the weekend of 31 October and 1 November, the authorities implemented a nationwide programme of testing for Covid-19 for everyone, including foreign nationals.
A second round took place in certain specified districts over the weekend of 7 and 8 November, as listed on the Slovak Ministry of Defence website (in Slovak).
Over the weekend of 21 to 22 November, a third round of testing is expected to take place in a smaller number of specified towns and villages with the highest rates of Covid-19 infection. Details of the third round are yet to be confirmed, but lists of testing sites will be published on local authorities’ websites and on social media. Testing in those areas is free of charge, and you will need to take your ID card or passport. More information including a video showing the testing procedure is on the “I am responsible” website (in Slovak only).
From 2 November until 1:00am on 15 November, only those with a negative test certificate from the nationwide testing programme or from the second round in certain specified districts are allowed to move freely, including going to work and shopping for non-essentials. Police and shop staff may ask to see your test certificate, and you should carry this paper document with you. This requirement will end from 1 am local time on Sunday 15 November. There are some limited exceptions for young children and those with certain medical conditions (in Slovak only).
In addition to the above, previous restrictions on activities and social distancing rules remain in force. These will remain in place from 15 November, after the requirement to carry a negative certificate ends:
Facemasks must be worn outdoors in all built-up areas, such as towns and villages. The wearing of facemasks remains compulsory indoors, including on public transport and in shops. Masks are not required in the countryside if you are with others from the same household or can maintain a five-metre distance.
You may only gather in groups of up to 6 people, unless all are from the same household.
Local public transport is running, but face masks are compulsory .
Hotels and guest houses are permitted to remain open, but may close or have reduced or cancelled services in order to comply with nationwide travel restrictions, social distancing and hygiene requirements.
Restaurants, bars and cafés may only offer outdoor seating, or operate a takeaway service.
Fitness centres, wellness centres, swimming pools, water parks, saunas, cinemas and theatres are closed.
The number of people in shops is restricted and temperature checks will be carried out at the entrances. You must maintain a two metre distance when queuing.
Supermarkets and chemists have reserved shopping hours between 9am and 11am for those over 65.
Those who chose not to take part in the nationwide testing programme must remain in self-isolation until 1:00am on 15 November. There are a number of exemptions, including:
Travelling between the hours of 1 am and 5 am
Travelling to take a coronavirus test
Buying food and toiletries at your nearest shop
Visiting a doctor or a pharmacy
For a wedding or christening ceremony, or the funeral of a close friend or relative
Travel to care for relatives or close friends that are vulnerable or unwell
