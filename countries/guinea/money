Credit cards are not widely used. ATM facilities accept foreign cards, but should not be relied on as a means of getting money. International credit cards may be used to draw cash over the counter. Outside Conakry banking can be difficult.
Exchanging foreign currency on the street or using unofficial money changers is illegal. Those using money changers, even for small amounts, including at the international airport, have been arrested and detained in military custody. Obtaining hard currency in Guinea is very difficult.
