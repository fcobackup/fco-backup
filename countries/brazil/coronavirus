Travel in Brazil
Restrictions vary from city to city. The use of face masks in streets, public spaces such as parks, and on public transport including taxis is mandatory across the country. There are additional local requirements for the compulsory use of masks in other places, such as shops and gyms, in various cities including São Paulo, Rio de Janeiro, Belo Horizonte and Brasília. Social isolation measures have been lifted to an extent in some parts of the country, but localised lockdowns continue to varying degrees. You should refer to official guidance in your location for details of what preventative measures are in place and how you can comply with them. Failing to comply with these rules may result in a fine.
Accommodation
Some accommodation options are open such as hotels, hostels and private rentals but this varies area by area. Some popular beach areas remain closed to non-residents. Check with your accommodation provider what facilities, including restaurants, are available.
Public spaces and services
The situation varies around Brazil, Many non-essential services that were closed (i.e. restaurants, shops and bars) are now starting to reopen in some cities. Some tourist attractions, cinemas and theatres remain closed, and in Rio de Janeiro access to the beach is restricted to exercise only. In practice this means that you can now go to the beach, but that the barracas which rent out umbrellas and chairs are not operating.
Healthcare in Brazil
If you think you have COVID-19 symptoms, you should self isolate for 14 days. You should only go to hospital if you are feeling breathless.
The public healthcare system varies across the country, and in some states in Brazil the additional burden of treating Covid-19 patients might affect services such as accident & emergency care. Some private hospitals are no longer accepting credit card payments for admissions and only accepting patients with valid health insurance. Short term foreign visitors are required to demonstrate proof of medical insurance before embarking their flight to Brazil.
Check if your travel or health insurance has comprehensive cover for coronavirus and refer to official channels in your location for further details.
