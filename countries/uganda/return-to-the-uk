Coronavirus guidance is being updated.
Read what you can and cannot do

There are currently no commercial options to return to the UK from Uganda. Since the 22 March, all international flights to and from Uganda have been suspended. Land borders and lake ports are also closed, except for truck drivers.
We know this is concerning for British people trying to leave Uganda. The UK government is working closely with airlines, the Government of Uganda, and other governments to make sure options are available for you to return to the UK as soon as possible. However, you should not expect any additional flights immediately. This travel advice will be updated when departure options become available.
What to do
If you cannot leave Uganda at this time, you should:
follow the advice of the local authorities, including local measures to help minimise your risk of exposure to coronavirus (COVID-19)
find accommodation suitable for your needs
keep in regular contact with family and friends at home so they know you are safe and well
See more information and advice about staying where you are if you cannot return to the UK.

You will need to pay for your return travel to the UK. If departure options are available but you cannot afford the travel costs and have exhausted all other options for getting funds, you may be eligible to apply for an emergency loan from the government. This is a last resort option and you would need to repay the loan when you are back in the UK.
For more information, you should contact Corporate Travel Management (CTM). CTM are a commercial partner of the FCO and are authorised to administer such loans on behalf of the FCO.
If registered with the British High Commission, we will alert you to any opportunities to book onto flights departing Uganda for the UK, should these become available. This travel advice will also be updated when options become available.
We are issuing regular updates on our Twitter and Facebook pages with the latest available information on possible flights.
