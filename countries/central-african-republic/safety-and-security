Local travel
There are reports of rebel activity, banditry and hostage-taking across the country. The situation in the capital, Bangui remains fragile with periodic instances of killings, looting and gunfire. There are armed patrols in Bangui and you will encounter several roadblocks - official and unofficial - that are likely to be manned by armed personnel. Take particular care when approaching these. You are strongly advised not to travel around Bangui especially after dark. You should take extreme care, and travel in groups if possible.
On 21 May in the Ouham-Pendé prefecture fighters from the 3R armed group carried out targeted attacks on civilians, killing at least 42 people. In the Bria (Haute-Koto prefecture) and around Zangba (Basse-Kotto prefecture) armed militia have obstructed humanitarian assistance as well as illegally detained and attacked civilians.
Crime
Incidents of theft and robbery occur regularly and armed gangs are known to operate in the outlying areas of Bangui. Take personal security precautions and be vigilant in public places. Avoid carrying valuables or wearing jewellery in public. Don’t walk alone at night. Avoid isolated or poorer areas.
Road travel
From 28 March 2019, you will need to have a 1968 International Driving Permit (IDP) to drive in Central African Republic (CAR). IDPs previously issued by the UK may no longer be accepted for use in CAR after this date. From 1 February 2019, you can only get IDPs over the counter from 2,500 UK Post Offices. It may be extremely difficult to obtain an IDP in CAR. We recommend buying one in the UK before departure.
Roads are poorly maintained and most require a four-wheel drive vehicle. Road travel is particularly difficult during the wet season (May to November). If you do decide to travel by road, you should keep a private supply of fuel if possible and carry supplies with you if travelling outside Bangui.
Illegal road blocks operate in remote areas. You may be forced to hand over money or possessions in order to continue your journey. There have been indiscriminate and violent attacks on travellers in remote areas. Vehicles have been fired on, and passengers killed or injured. In many of these cases victims have been robbed or taken hostage and vehicles taken or burnt.
Seek local advice before travelling and we recommend that you do not travel after dark.
Political situation
The armed rebel coalition Seleka seized power on 24 March 2013. The interim leader, Michel Djotodia, stood down on 11 January 2014 and was replaced by a transitional government. In early 2016 Presidential and legislative elections were held, leading to the inauguration of President Faustin Archange Touadera on 30 March 2016 and the installation of a new Parliament and government. Despite this change and an increase in the number of international security forces in CAR, the situation in Bangui and the rest of the country remains fragile as reports of widespread looting and violence continue.
You should keep up to date with local political developments and avoid all political rallies, demonstrations or large public gatherings.
Consular assistance
Consular support is severely limited in the Central African Republic as there is no British Embassy. However, the British Embassy Kinshasa, in the Democratic Republic of Congo can provide limited remote consular support to British nationals. In an emergency, British nationals should contact the British Embassy Kinshasa, in the Democratic Republic of Congo. The French Embassy in Bangui may also be able to offer some consular assistance (telephone: +236 613 000 or +236 610 584) to those requiring urgent help.
