Hurricanes
The hurricane season in the Caribbean normally runs from June to November. You should follow and monitor local and international weather updates from the World Meteorological Organisation and the US National Hurricane Centre and follow the advice of local authorities, including any evacuation orders.
See our Tropical cyclones page for advice about how to prepare effectively and what to do if you’re likely to be affected by a hurricane or tropical cyclone.
Earthquakes
Earthquakes are a potential threat and tremors are felt occasionally in the Caribbean. In the event of an earthquake, you should be directed by the local authorities. To learn more about what to do before, during and after an earthquake, visit the website of the US Federal Emergency Management Agency.
Volcanoes
The SVG Prime Minister reported on 29 December 2020 that La Soufriere volcano on St Vincent was in an active state of effusive eruption. It is unknown when or whether there will be also an explosive eruption but the authorities and experts are monitoring closely. Residents in St Vincent from the town of Georgetown upwards on both sides of the island have been placed on evacuation alert and public visits to the volcano are no longer allowed. Travelers should heed the advice of local authorities.
You should monitor the alert level of the underwater volcano ‘Kick’em Jenny’, located 5 miles off the coast of Grenada. Observe any maritime exclusion zones and follow the advice of the local authorities in the event of increased activity or an eruption.
