Entry rules in response to coronavirus (COVID-19)
Entry to Nicaragua
There have been reports of the land borders being closed at short or no notice. There is currently a requirement to have a “negative for COVID-19” certificate. You should not use the NHS testing service to get a test in order to facilitate your travel to another country. You should arrange to take a private test.
Because of the coronavirus pandemic, the authorities have announced that foreigners will be allowed to renew their tourist visas on a month-by-month basis. Extensions will be processed at migration offices throughout the country. Check the Migration Office’s website (Spanish only) for requirements.

Central America Border Control Agreement
Nicaragua is party to the Central America Border Control Agreement (CA-4).  Under the terms of this agreement, British tourists can travel within any of the CA-4 countries (Honduras, Nicaragua, El Salvador and Guatemala) for a period of up to 90 days without completing entry and exit formalities at border immigration checkpoints. This period begins at the first point of entry of any of the CA-4 countries. Fines are applied for travellers who exceed this 90 day limit, although a request for an extension can be made for up to 30 days by paying a fee before the 90 days limit expires. If you are expelled from any of the four countries you are also excluded from the entire CA-4 region.
