This page reflects the UK government’s understanding of current rules for people travelling on a full ‘British Citizen’ passport, for the most common types of travel.
The authorities in The Gambia set and enforce entry rules. For further information contact the embassy, high commission or consulate of the country or territory you’re travelling to. You should also consider checking with your transport provider or travel company to make sure your passport and other travel documents meet their requirements.
Entry rules in response to coronavirus (COVID-19)
Entry to The Gambia
A variety of commercial flights service The Gambia. Check availability with your travel company for the latest information. The land border with Senegal is open.
Fully vaccinated passengers arriving from the UK do not require a negative PCR COVID-19 test to enter The Gambia. You must show proof of vaccination. To enter The Gambia you may be asked to submit to a Rapid Diagnostic Test. If found positive, you will be quarantined at a government facility until your test returns a negative result.
Non-vaccinated or partially vaccinated passengers arriving from the UK will require a negative PCR COVID-19 certificate, taken no more than 72 hours before arrival. Passengers will also be asked to submit to a Rapid Diagnostic Test. If found positive, you will be quarantined at a government facility until your test returns a negative result. Infants below 2 years of age are exempt. All other passengers must show proof of full vaccination or a negative PCR COVID-19 certificate.
Children under 18 are exempt from providing proof of vaccination and/or a negative PCR certificate, but may be required to submit to a Rapid Diagnostic Test on arrival.
Demonstrating your COVID-19 status
The Gambia will accept the UK’s proof of COVID-19 recovery and vaccination record. Your NHS appointment card from vaccination centres is not designed to be used as proof of vaccination and should not be used to demonstrate your vaccine status.
Quarantine requirements
If you are non-vaccinated or partially vaccinated, you must present a negative PCR COVID-19 test taken no more than 72 hours before you arrive in The Gambia to Ministry of Health officials. A positive test on arrival will result in you being tested and quarantined at your own cost.
Screening on arrival
Additional surveillance and detection mechanisms have been put in place at Banjul International Airport and various points of entry along The Gambia’s border.
Regular entry requirements
