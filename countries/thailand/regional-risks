Warning
FCDO advises against all but essential travel to parts of Thailand.

This section has safety advice for regions of Thailand. It only covers regions where FCDO has specific advice.
You should also read FCDO’s overall travel advice and safety and security advice.
Thailand-Malaysia border  
FCDO advises against all but essential travel to parts of the south, near the Thailand-Malaysia border:
Pattani Province
Yala Province
Narathiwat Province
southern Songkhla Province – south of the A43 road between Hat Yai and Sakom, and south of the train line which runs between Hat Yai and Padang Besar
FCDO also advises against all but essential travel on the Hat Yai to Padang Besar train line that runs through these provinces.
This is due to regular attacks in the provinces by the border with Malaysia. See Safety and security .
Thailand-Cambodia border
There are reports of fighting including rocket and artillery fire on 24 July between Thailand and Cambodia at several locations along the border. Casualties have been reported, as well as evacuations of areas close to the border. Land borders/crossings between Thailand and Cambodia have been suspended. Some tourist destinations in border areas such as the Khao Phra Wihan/Preah Vihear temple, the Ta Kwai/Ta Krabey temple and the Ta Muen Thom/Tamone Thom temple are currently closed.
There are also unexploded landmines in the border area.
We advise against all but essential travel to the affected border areas.
Thailand-Laos border
Not all land border crossings into Laos are open to foreign nationals. Even if the border crossing is open, you may need to get a visa for Laos in advance. Check the entry requirements in the Laos travel advice. Follow the instructions of local authorities and be vigilant in the border areas.
Thailand-Myanmar border
The security situation in Myanmar is unpredictable and liable to change without notice. See Myanmar travel advice.
