Given the rapidly changing situation in Angola, we have temporarily withdrawn a limited number of UK staff and their dependents from our Embassy. The Embassy will continue to carry out essential work including providing 24/7 consular assistance and support to British people in Angola.
You should avoid political gatherings and demonstrations, be vigilant and respect advice and instruction given by local security authorities.
You must get a valid visa and/or work permit before you travel to Angola. The process can take a long time and you should apply several weeks before your intended travel date. See Entry requirements
UK health authorities have classified Angola as having a risk of Zika virus transmission. For more information and advice, visit the National Travel Health Network and Centre website.
There is a high level of crime in Luanda. Be particularly careful when withdrawing money from banks and ATMs. Don’t walk around the city after dark. See Crime

If you’re abroad and you need emergency help from the UK government, contact the nearest British embassy, consulate or high commission. Consular support is limited in parts of Angola where we advise against all but essential travel.
