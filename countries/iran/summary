The Foreign, Commonwealth & Development Office (FCDO) advises British nationals against all travel to Iran.
There is a significantly high risk that British nationals could be arbitrarily arrested, questioned or detained in Iran, whether or not you are a British-Iranian dual national. There have been a number of British-Iranian dual nationals detained in Iran serving long prison sentences. Iran has also recently detained non-Iranian European nationals travelling on tourist visas. The criminal justice process followed in such cases falls below international standards. In such cases the FCDO’s ability to provide consular support is extremely limited. Having British connections can be reason enough for the authorities to be suspicious of your activities.
The authorities do not recognise dual nationality, so if you are a British-Iranian dual national and are detained, the FCDO will not be informed of your detention by the authorities, will not be granted access to see you and our ability to provide consular assistance will be extremely limited. For British nationals without Iranian dual-nationality, the Iranian authorities can be slow in allowing a consular welfare visit. See Safety and Security
Kish Island
Kish Island is an Iranian Island close to Qatar. It is controlled by the Iranian authorities and the same risks apply to British nationals as in mainland Iran, where Islamic law is strictly enforced. You could still be the target of arbitrary arrest and detention. The FCDO therefore advise against travel to Kish Island.
Before you travel, check the ‘Entry requirements’ section for Iran’s current entry restrictions and requirements. These may change with little warning. Monitor this advice for the latest updates and stay in contact with your travel provider.
If you plan to pass through another country to return to the UK, check the travel advice for the country you’re transiting.
It is more important than ever to get travel insurance and check it provides sufficient cover. See the FCDO’s guidance on foreign travel insurance.
In the event that the situation deteriorates further, the ability of the British Embassy to provide assistance to British nationals from within Iran may be limited.
If you decide to travel, you should maintain a low profile and keep up to date with developments, including via this travel advice. Avoid any rallies, marches and processions, keep away from military sites and follow the instructions of the local authorities at all times.
Terrorists are likely to try to carry out attacks in Iran. Attacks could happen anywhere, including in places visited by foreigners. On 22 September 2018, there was an attack on a military parade in Ahvaz, capital of Khuzestan province. On 7 June 2017, there were two attacks in Tehran – one in the Majles (the Iranian parliament) in central Tehran and another at the Imam Khomeini Shrine near Imam Khomeini international airport.
