Travel to Zimbabwe is subject to entry restrictions

To enter Zimbabwe you must possess a negative COVID-19 test result, issued no more than 48 hours before your journey. You will be required to self-isolate for 14 days at a designated address.
If you do not have a negative test result, or if you exhibit COVID-19 like symptoms on arrival, you will be detained at a holding facility where you will be required to pay US$60.00 for a test. If your test is negative, you will be required to self-isolate for 14 days at a designated address. If your test is positive, you will be required to enter isolation in a state facility for a period of 14 days.

Availability of fuel is sporadic and queues are common. You are advised to check in advance if you can make payment with an international payment card. See Road travel
