The FCDO advises against all travel to:
the whole of the Central African Republic (CAR)
Before you travel, check the ‘Entry requirements’ section for Central African Republic’s current entry restrictions and requirements. These may change with little warning. Monitor this advice for the latest updates and stay in contact with your travel provider.
If you plan to pass through another country on your journey, check the travel advice for the country you’re transiting.
It is more important than ever to get travel insurance and check it provides appropriate cover. See the FCDO’s guidance on foreign travel insurance.
Consular support is severely limited in CAR as there is no British Embassy. However, the British Embassy Kinshasa, in the Democratic Republic of Congo can provide limited remote consular support to British nationals.
Tensions remain high and there is potential for further violence across the country. Attacks on individuals and groups, including car-jackings, are likely and unpredictable. There is a risk that foreign nationals could be targeted by armed groups and militias. We advise any British Nationals who remain in CAR to remain vigilant and to limit non-essential movements. There are armed patrols that have set up several roadblocks across the country. Detention by police forces and armed groups is a common occurrence, primarily for CAR nationals, but also for expatriates. You should take extreme care, and take personal security precautions, if possible.
Following the constitutional referendum which took place in July 2023, there is an increased risk of social unrest.
The national curfew that was in place between 10pm and 5am has been lifted in Bangui.
Although there’s no recent history of terrorism in the CAR, attacks cannot be ruled out. See Terrorism
