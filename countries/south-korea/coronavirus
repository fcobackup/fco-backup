See the TravelHealthPro website for further advice on travel abroad and reducing spread of respiratory viruses during the COVID-19 pandemic.
International travel
Korean Air and Asiana are running direct flights from London to Seoul. Restrictions based on nationality and visa type have been lifted for regularly scheduled flights, but remain in place for some specially chartered flights.
Airline and ticket booking websites do not typically highlight in the booking process which flights have nationality or visa restrictions. You should contact the airline before booking to confirm that you will be eligible to take your desired flight based on your nationality and visa. Passengers who are ineligible to take a flight may be refused check-in even if they have purchased a ticket.
If you are travelling with Korean Air from London to Seoul in July 2021, please note that flights on Tuesdays have nationality restrictions while flights on Saturdays do not. British nationals should book onto a Saturday flight. Do not book a Tuesday flight. Further information on Korean Air flight restrictions can be found on their Covid-19 Flight Status page.
You should remain aware of the quarantine requirements on entry. See Entry requirements.
Entry and borders
See Entry requirements to find out what you will need to do when you arrive in South Korea.
Returning to the UK
When you return, you must follow the rules for entering the UK.
You are responsible for organising your own COVID-19 test, in line with UK government testing requirements. You should contact local authorities for information on testing facilities.
Be prepared for your plans to change
No travel is risk-free during COVID. Countries may further restrict travel or bring in new rules at short notice, for example due to a new COVID-19 variant. Check with your travel company or airline for any transport changes which may delay your journey home.
If you test positive for COVID-19, you may need to stay where you are until you test negative. You may also need to seek treatment there.
Plan ahead and make sure you:
can access money
understand what your insurance will cover
can make arrangements to extend your stay and be away for longer than planned
Public spaces and services
Face masks are compulsory in public places and on public transport. Failure to wear a mask can result in a fine of up to 100,000 Korean Won (£66). There is a limited exception to this rule if you have received at least one vaccine shot, are outside, can maintain at least a 2 metre distance from others, and are outside of Seoul, Incheon and Gyeonggi.
South Korea currently has a four-level national social distancing scale.

COVID-19 vaccines if you live in South Korea
Wherever possible British nationals should aim to be vaccinated in the country where they live. We will update this page when the Government of South Korea announces new information on the national vaccination programme. You can sign up to get email notifications when this page is updated.
The South Korean national vaccination programme started in February 2021 and is using the AstraZeneca, Janssen (Johnson and Johnson), Moderna and Pfizer-BioNTech vaccines. British nationals resident in South Korea are eligible for vaccination.
All adults in South Korea have now been given the opportunity to book a vaccination, but registration windows for different groups to book vaccinations are open at different times. Not all groups are currently able to make reservations. Some age groups and professions continue to be given priority. You should visit the KDCA website or contact the KDCA by phone from South Korea on 1339 (English language support is available) for advice on how to book your vaccination.
If you are eligible to be vaccinated, in addition to booking vaccination appointments via the KDCA you may be able to book an appointment at short notice to receive a “leftover vaccine”. This is a vaccine dose that was not administered because the intended recipient did not attend their vaccination appointment. Foreign nationals who belong to the Korean national health insurance scheme can use this service. “Leftover vaccine” appointments can be booked through the KakaoTalk and Naver apps (in Korean), on a first-come-first-served basis. You should look for guidance on this process (in Korean) inside the apps themselves or on the KakaoTalk and Naver websites.
Find out more, including about vaccines that are authorised in the UK or approved by the World Health Organisation, on the COVID-19 vaccines if you live abroad page.
If you’re a British national living in South Korea, you should seek medical advice from your local healthcare provider. Information about COVID-19 vaccines used in the national programme where you live, including regulatory status, should be available from local authorities.
