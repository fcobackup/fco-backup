Warning
FCDO advises against all travel to Russia.

Before you travel check that:

This is particularly important if you have a health condition or are pregnant.
Emergency medical number
Dial 112 and ask for an ambulance.
Contact your insurance or medical assistance company quickly if you’re referred to a medical facility for treatment.
Vaccine recommendations and health risks
At least 8 weeks before your trip:
check the latest vaccine recommendations for Russia
see where to get vaccines and whether you have to pay on the NHS travel vaccinations page

HIV and AIDS
There is a higher rate of HIV and AIDS in Russia than in the UK. Take normal precautions to avoid exposure.
Air quality
Air quality can worsen in some weather conditions. Monitor local media and the regional websites for the Ministry of Emergencies for more information.
Health examinations
If you’re in Russia for more than 90 days, you must have a regular comprehensive health examination. This applies to foreign nationals who are:
visiting
working
on highly qualified specialist visas
family members of any of the above, including children aged 6 and over
The examination includes tests for sexually transmitted infections and chest X-rays. You will have to submit fingerprints and other biometric data.
If you are working or on a highly qualified specialist visa, you must complete the first health check within 30 days of arrival in Russia.
If you’re visiting, or in any other category, you must complete the first health check within 90 days of arrival.
Check with your employers and the Ministry of the Interior for the latest requirements.
Medication
The legal status and regulation of some medicines prescribed or bought in the UK can be different in other countries.
If your medication contains narcotic or psychoactive substances, you must carry a prescription in your name, translated into Russian, and notarised. Notarisation services are available in the UK from a notary public.

Healthcare in Russia
European and Global Health Insurance Cards (EHIC and GHIC) are not valid in Russia. Any foreign national has a legal right to free medical care in life-threatening circumstances.
Medical care may not meet western standards. Hospitals do not accept all health cases and may request payments before treatment.
In remote areas, hospitals may not use disposable intravenous (IV) supplies, syringes and needles as standard practice. You may want to have your own supply.
FCDO has a list of medical providers in Russia where some staff will speak English.
