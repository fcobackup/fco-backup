Entry restrictions
Commercial flights in and out of Jordan are suspended and all land and sea borders are closed. The Government of Jordan has confirmed that these measures will remain in place until 25 May, and there are strong indications that the flight suspension and border closures will continue beyond this date.
Local measures
Since 20 March the Government of Jordan has introduced and enforced measures to tackle the spread of COVID-19. Measures are regularly reviewed and updated. Please follow the instructions of the local authorities.
Under current measures you are able to leave your accommodation between 0800 and 1900 hours. You must ensure that you have returned to your accommodation by 1900. A curfew siren will be sounded at 1900 every day after which point you must not leave your property.
The Government has announced that 24-hour full curfews will apply every Friday during Ramadan, during which you are not permitted to leave your accommodation. Further full curfews may be announced in the future. While the atmosphere is fairly calm on the streets, with the curfew generally well adhered to, there have been a number of arrests and vehicles impounded for violations.
The Jordanian Armed Forces announced that the military will be spread out across the entire country at the entry and exit points of large towns and cities. More stringent measures could be enforced if other hotspot areas are identified. You are not allowed to travel between governorates.
The government has announced that from Wednesday 6 May, most sectors of the economy will reopen. However, a number of sectors will remain closed, including places of social gathering like cinemas, cafes and restaurants, places of worship, and schools and universities.
The government has also introduced a law requiring everybody to comply with social distancing by keeping 1.5m away from other people when outside the home, and by wearing gloves and a mask when entering public places such as government buildings, shops, companies and health centres. Failure to comply with these rules is punishable by a fine.
For medical emergencies, you must call the emergency services on 911 before trying to get to a hospital.
Visas
The Government of Jordan have announced that foreign nationals will not be fined for overstays resulting from border closures.
