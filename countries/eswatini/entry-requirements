This page reflects the UK government’s understanding of current rules for people travelling on a full ‘British Citizen’ passport from the UK, for the most common types of travel.
The authorities in Eswatini set and enforce entry rules. If you’re unsure how Eswatini’s entry requirements apply to you, contact its UK embassy, high commission or consulate.
All travellers
Usually British passport holders do not require visas for Eswatini.
Travellers entering and exiting the Kingdom of Eswatini must produce either of the following, upon arrival at the points of entry:
i) If fully vaccinated, a valid COVID-19 vaccination certificate (hard or electronic).
OR
ii) A valid negative COVID-19 PCR test result (hard or electronic) that is not older than 72 hours, for the unvaccinated.
“Fully vaccinated” means complete doses of a vaccine, i.e. two doses for a two-dose vaccine, and one dose for a one-dose vaccine.
Valid vaccination certificates considered are those of COVID-19 vaccine candidates that have been prequalified by WHO. This will be updated periodically as the need arises.
Vaccination cards are not allowed at points of entry – only vaccination certificates allowed.
Outbound travellers from Eswatini must also comply with the requirements of airlines and the country of transit and destination.
Children under 12 years are exempted from the above measures.
