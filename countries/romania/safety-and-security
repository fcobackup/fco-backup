Terrorism
There is a high threat of terrorist attack globally affecting UK interests and British nationals, including from groups and individuals who view the UK and British nationals as targets. You should remain vigilant at all times.
UK Counter Terrorism Policing has information and advice on staying safe abroad and what to do in the event of a terrorist attack. Find out how to reduce your risk from terrorism while abroad.
Terrorism in Romania
Terrorist attacks in Romania cannot be ruled out. Attacks could be indiscriminate, including in places visited by foreigners.
Political situation
There is widespread military activity in Ukraine. You should not attempt to cross into Ukraine from Romania. See Ukraine travel advice.
Crime
Protecting your belongings
Be alert to petty theft in large towns, especially Bucharest. Thieves use distraction techniques and organised attacks by groups can happen. Take care of your passport, money and personal belongings, particularly:
near exchange shops and hotels
on public transport, especially to the airport
in main railway stations
inside airport terminals
Credit or debit cards have been ‘copied’ when used for payment in some bars and restaurants.
Use a hotel safe for valuables where possible and carry a photocopy or scanned copy of your passport.
Organised crime
People-trafficking groups operate in the border areas.
Laws and cultural differences
Illegal drugs and prison sentences
The age of consent is 18. Romanian authorities treat all drug-related and sex offences very seriously. If convicted, you can expect a prison sentence.
Using cameras in secure areas
Most airports and military bases will have signs banning photography. If there could be sensitivity about taking pictures, ask permission.
LGBT+ travellers
Same-sex relationships are legal in Romania. There are active LGBT+ communities and events in Romania, though the majority of LGBT+ people are not openly gay. Find local information on LGBT+ issues in Romania and read more advice for LGBT+ travellers.
Transport risks
Road travel
You can use a UK photocard driving licence to drive in Romania. If you still have a paper driving licence, you may need to update it to a photocard licence or get the correct version of the International Driving Permit (IDP) as well.
If you are planning to drive in Romania, see information on driving abroad and read RAC’s Romania guide.
Hire car companies often have stricter requirements for their customers, such as a year of driving experience, minimum age and holding an IDP.
Driving a British car abroad
Make sure you have:
your full, valid driving licence
proof of insurance/green card (third party or above)
proof of ID (passport)
proof of ownership (V5C certificate)
You need a UK sticker to drive your car outside the UK. Since 2021, UK stickers have replaced GB stickers. Check the government guidance on displaying number plates for more information on what to do if you are driving outside the UK.
Check the driving requirements if you’re living in Romania.
Driving regulations
Carry a first aid kit, fire extinguisher, red warning triangle and a fluorescent jacket. You must have winter tyres from 1 November to 1 March.
You’ll need to pay a road toll ‘Rovinieta’ to use the national roads. Buy the vignette (sticker) at border points and at most petrol stations. If you do not display the sticker you may get a heavy fine. See Roviniete.ro for information, including prices.
It’s illegal to drive under the influence of alcohol. The drink-drive limit is zero.
If your vehicle is damaged before you arrive in Romania, ask a Romanian customs officer or police officer to write a report on the damage, so that you avoid any problems when leaving. If any damage happens inside the country, you must get a report at the scene of the accident.
Road safety
Road conditions are variable and secondary roads can be in a bad state of repair. Driving standards can be poor. Look out for:
double-parked cars
people suddenly braking to avoid a pothole
horse-drawn carts, livestock and stray dogs in rural areas
Taxis
Most taxis in Bucharest should list prices on the side of the vehicle and display a company name. Foreign visitors can be overcharged by taxi drivers.
Extreme weather and natural disasters
Earthquakes
Romania is in a seismically active area and tremors happen regularly. The last major earthquake was in 1977.
See the US Federal Emergency Management Agency guidance about what to do before, during and after an earthquake.
