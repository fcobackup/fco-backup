The information on this page covers the most common types of travel and reflects the UK government’s understanding of the rules currently in place. Unless otherwise stated, this information is for travellers using a full ‘British Citizen’ passport.
The authorities in the country or territory you’re travelling to are responsible for setting and enforcing the rules for entry. If you’re unclear about any aspect of the entry requirements, or you need further reassurance, you’ll need to contact the embassy, high commission or consulate of the country or territory you’re travelling to.
You should also consider checking with your transport provider or travel company to make sure your passport and other travel documents meet their requirements.
Entry rules in response to coronavirus
Entry to Slovakia
There are travel restrictions for travellers from the UK and most other countries. The Slovak Government may change its entry requirements at short notice. Direct flights from the UK are permitted, and regular services are resuming.
Only those UK nationals who are resident in Slovakia, close relatives of residents, close relatives of Slovak citizens, commercial transport personnel, students studying in Slovakia or those falling under certain limited exemptions may enter the country if they arrive directly from the UK or any other non-Schengen country. The above restriction does not apply for UK nationals who enter Slovakia via the land borders with Hungary, the Czech Republic, Austria or Poland, or who fly from any country in the Schengen area.
If you meet one of the criteria for entry to Slovakia, new entry requirements apply from 31 May. The Slovak government has introduced a colour-coded “semaphore” system, with countries listed as either green, red or black.
Entry requirements will differ, depending on the countries where you have been during the 14 days before your arrival in Slovakia. Countries and their colour and respective entry requirements are listed on the Slovak government website (in Slovak only). Currently, the UK is listed as black.
Green countries are seen as having a low risk of infection, red as high risk, and black countries as having either dangerous COVID-19 variants or insufficient data. The government may change the classifications at short notice.
Arrivals from all countries must register in advance of travel on the Slovak government’s website and carry the confirmation during their stay, in case the authorities ask to see it.
If you arrive in Slovakia by air, you also need to complete the Slovak government’s Passenger Locator Form. You should carry a printed confirmation with you in case the airline or border officials ask to see it.
If you display symptoms of COVID-19 during your stay, you should report this to your healthcare provider.
For all categories of country, you must enter self-isolation on arrival. Details of the length of self-isolation and any exemptions are listed below. A number of narrow exceptions to the need to self-isolate, including freight, transport, military and diplomatic personnel are listed on the Slovak government website (in Slovak only).
Black countries
This category currently applies to arrivals from the UK. If you have been in a black country during the 14 days before your arrival in Slovakia, you must self-isolate at home for a full 14 day period. The authorities will contact you no earlier than the 8th day of your self-isolation to arrange a free RT-PCR test for COVID-19. You must complete the 14 days of self-isolation, even if your PCR test result is negative. Unless they meet one of the exemption criteria below or recovered from COVID-19 within the previous 180 days, everyone in the same household must also self-isolate until everyone’s self-isolation period is completed.
Red countries
If you have been in a Red country during the 14 days before your arrival in Slovakia, you must enter self-isolation at home for 14 days. You can end your self-isolation upon receipt of a negative PCR test result, which you can only take at least 8 days after arrival. Unless they meet one of the exemption criteria below or recovered from COVID-19 within the previous 180 days, everyone in the same household must also self-isolate until everyone’s self-isolation period is completed.
Green countries
If you have spent the previous 14 days only Green countries, you must enter self-isolation at home for 14 days. However, you can end your self-isolation early upon receipt of a negative PCR or antigen test result taken in Slovakia. You are permitted to take the test on the first day of your self-isolation. Unless they meet one of the exemption criteria below, everyone in the same household must also self-isolate until everyone’s self-isolation period is completed.
Exemptions to self-isolation (Red or Black Countries)
You are exempt from the self-isolation requirement if you are either resident in a red or black country but working in Slovakia or are resident in Slovakia but working in a red or black country and, in addition, you meet one of the following vaccination conditions. These exemptions also apply to household members as mentioned above:
If you have only received the first dose of a two-dose vaccine and more than 21 days but no more than 90 days have passed since.
If you have received both doses of a two-dose vaccine and more than 21 days but no more than 12 months have passed since.
If more than 21 days but no more than 12 months have passed since you received a single-dose vaccine
If more than 21 days but no more than 12 months have passed since you received the first dose of any vaccine, provided you were vaccinated within 180 days of recovering from COVID-19
As there is currently no agreed way to demonstrate proof of vaccination for entry into Slovakia from the UK, you should be prepared to self-isolate for the full period as above.
Exemptions to self-isolation (Green Countries)
As above,
or
You can show a negative RT-PCR test result no older than 72 hours, or
You can show a negative Antigen test no older than 24 hours which was taken in either Slovakia, Austria, Hungary, Czech Republic or Poland, or
you have recovered from COVID-19 within the past 180 days, or
you are under 18 years of age
Cross border workers
Cross-border workers (also known as ‘pendlers’) commuting to or from neighbouring countries may avoid self-isolation if they can show a negative antigen or PCR test result not older than 7 days and evidence from their employer of the reason for their commute. You can also avoid self-isolation if:
more than 14 days have passed since you were vaccinated with a second dose of a mRNA vaccine (Pfizer-BioNTech or Moderna)
more than 28 days have passed since you were vaccinated with the first dose of a vector vaccine (Oxford/AstraZeneca)
more than 14 days have passed since you were vaccinated with the first dose of a mRNA or a vector vaccine if you received the first dose within 180 days of your recovery from COVID-19.
you have recovered from COVID-19 within the past 180 days
The definition of a cross-border commuter from a neighbouring country includes those living within 100km of the nearest border crossing with Slovakia. Full details are on the Slovak government website.
Transiting Slovakia
Transit through a red or black country according to the Slovak government’s colour-coded ‘semaphore’ system counts as visiting a green country as long as your transit is less than 8 hours and you do not stop other than to refuel or if you do not leave the airport premises. You should also check the entry requirements for the relevant neighbouring countries on your route on FCDO Travel Advice.
Transport
Slovakia’s international airports at Bratislava, Kosice and Poprad are operational with flights to certain permitted destinations.
Border crossings
All land border crossings on major routes between Slovakia and Austria, Hungary, Poland and the Czech Republic are operational but spot checks are increasing and some smaller border crossings have closed. The crossing to Austria from Zahorska Ves and the cycle bridge across the Morava river are closed. For a list of closed crossings at the border with Poland, see the Slovak Ministry of Foreign Affairs website.
Full border checks remain in place with Ukraine. Entry to Slovakia from Ukraine limited to the Vysne Nemecke – Uzhgorod border crossing between 7 am and 7 pm. For more information on crossing the border with Ukraine, see the Slovak Foreign Ministry website (in Slovak only).
Neighbouring countries can change their entry requirements at short notice. You should check the FCDO Travel Advice for all countries on your route.
Regular entry requirements
Visas
The rules for travelling or working in European countries changed on 1 January 2021:
you can travel to countries in the Schengen area for up to 90 days in any 180-day period without a visa. This applies if you travel as a tourist, to visit family or friends, to attend business meetings, cultural or sports events, or for short-term studies or training.
if you are travelling to Slovakia and other Schengen countries without a visa, make sure your whole visit is within the 90 day limit. Visits to Schengen countries within the previous 180 days before you travel count towards your 90 days.
to stay longer, to work or study, for business travel or for other reasons, you will need to meet the Slovakian government’s entry requirements. Check with the Slovak Embassy what type of visa and/or work permit you may need.
if you stay in Slovakia with a visa or permit, this does not count towards the 90-day limit.
Any time you spent in Slovakia or other Schengen countries before 1 January 2021 does not count towards your 90-day visa-free limit.
At Slovak border control, you may need to use separate lanes from EU, EEA and Swiss citizens when queueing. Your passport may be stamped on entry and exit. You may also need to:
show a return or onward ticket
show you have enough money for your stay
There are separate requirements for those who are resident in Slovakia. If you are resident in Slovakia, you should carry proof of residence as well as your valid passport when you travel. For further information on these requirements, see our Living in Slovakia guide.
Passport validity  
Check your passport is valid for travel before you book your trip, and renew your passport if you do not have enough time left on it.
You must have at least 6 months left on an adult or child passport to travel to most countries in Europe (not including Ireland).
If you renewed your current passport before the previous one expired, extra months may have been added to its expiry date. Any extra months on your passport over 10 years may not count towards the 6 months needed.
Make sure your passport is in a presentable state before you travel. The Slovak authorities can refuse entry if your passport is worn or damaged, or looks as if it’s been tampered with.
Registering with the Slovak authorities
If you plan to stay in Slovakia for a longer period of time, you should register with the police within 3 days of arrival. You’ll need your passport, 2 photographs and proof of accommodation. You’ll have an option to apply for a Slovak ‘green card’, which can be used as proof of your ID, while your passport is kept in a safe place. Visit the website of Ministry of Interior of the Slovak Republic for further information.
UK Emergency Travel Documents
UK Emergency Travel Documents (ETDs) are accepted for entry, airside transit and exit from Slovakia. They are also accepted for a return to Slovakia if you normally live there.
Travelling with pets
You cannot use the existing pet passport scheme. Instead, you’ll need an animal health certificate (AHC) for your pet. Allow at least 1 month to arrange this and relevant vaccinations.
Follow the guidance for taking your pet dog, cat or ferret abroad.
If your pet passport was issued in an EU Member State, it remains valid for travel to Slovakia.
See the Slovak Financial Administration guidance on travelling from the UK to Slovakia with pets (in Slovak only).
