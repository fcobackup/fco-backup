The Dominican Republic government has closed the country’s borders and all international flights have been suspended except “ferry flights” to repatriate foreign nationals.
There are still commercial options to return to the UK from the Dominican Republic. If you live in the UK and are currently visiting the Dominican Republic, you are strongly advised to return now by commercial means. Don’t risk getting stranded.
UK special charter flights will only operate for priority countries where commercial flights are not possible. You should not assume that these flights will become available in the Dominican Republic because commercial routes are operating. Please do not contact the contracted travel management company if no flight is advertised here.
Registering with the British Embassy
The British Embassy is keeping a record of British visitors currently in the Dominican Republic. If you’re trying to get home from the Dominican Republic, contact the Embassy on UK.inDominicanRepublic@fco.gov.uk with your name, your passport number and your contact details in the Dominican Republic.
Commercial flights
The last direct ‘ferry flight’ from the Dominican Republic to the UK departed on 19 March.
JetBlue and Delta are still operating a reduced number of flights from Santo Domingo to New York. JetBlue also has flights scheduled to New York from Punta Cana. These routes are the only commercial flights known to the British Embassy that have the necessary authorisation to depart the Dominican Republic during the current border closures.
Flights are in high demand and booking may not be possible given the limited number of seats available. Whilst direct onward flights from the USA to the UK are still operating, these are also becoming limited both in frequency and availability.
Alternative routes from the USA, transiting via a third country such as the Republic of Ireland or the Netherlands to reach the UK, may be possible. Read the FCO travel advice for the USA and any other country you may be transiting, to check entry/transit requirements.
If you book a flight via the USA, inform the Embassy of your flight details by email at UK.inDominicanRepublic@fco.gov.uk.
This travel advice will be updated with information on other commercial flight options if they become available. Sign up to email alerts and follow the British Embassy on Facebook and Twitter.
You will need to pay for your return travel to the UK. If departure options are available but you cannot afford the travel costs and have exhausted all other options for getting funds, you may be eligible to apply for an emergency loan from the government. This is a last resort option and you would need to repay the loan when you are back in the UK. For more information, you should contact Corporate Travel Management (CTM). CTM are a commercial partner of the FCO and are authorised to administer such loans on behalf of the FCO.
Travelling to the airport
