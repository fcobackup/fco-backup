Returning to the UK
When you return, you must follow the rules for entering the UK.
You are responsible for organising your own COVID-19 test, in line with local and UK government testing requirements. You should contact local authorities for information on testing facilities.
Persons booked on a British Airways flight and wanting to return to the UK should contact their tour operator or call the BA Contact Centre on 1877 767 7970.
Alternatively, you may want to explore what regional options exist to connect with a flight travelling to the UK. One such option is to travel with the regional airline LIAT to either Antigua and Barbuda, or Barbados, where you can connect with a BA flight and continue your journey to the UK. If transiting a third country, you will need to check and adhere to the travel protocols of that county.
Be prepared for your plans to change
No travel is risk-free during COVID. Countries may further restrict travel or bring in new rules at short notice, for example due to a new COVID-19 variant. Check with your travel company or airline for any transport changes which may delay your journey home.
If you test positive for COVID-19, you may need to stay where you are until you test negative. You may also need to seek treatment there.
Plan ahead and make sure you:
can access money
understand what your insurance will cover
can make arrangements to extend your stay and be away for longer than planned
