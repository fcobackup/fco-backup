The FCDO advises against all but essential travel to:
the whole of Slovenia based on the current assessment of COVID-19 risks.
If you are returning to the UK from Slovenia, you will need to self-isolate on your return (unless you are exempt). Check the latest guidance for England, Northern Ireland, Scotland and Wales.The FCDO is not advising you to cut short your visit. You should contact your tour operator or airline if you have any questions about your return journey.
Travel to Slovenia is subject to entry restrictions
The Slovenian authorities have implemented a Red list to determine the requirements for people arriving into Slovenia. If you are arriving into Slovenia from a country on Red list, you may have to quarantine for 10 days. As of 26 October 2020, all of the UK is on the Red list. This means that all arrivals to Slovenia from the UK must quarantine for 10 days, unless they meet one of the exemptions listed in the Entry requirements section.
If your travel is deemed by the Slovenian authorities to be non-essential, then you may be denied entry by the Slovenian authorities.
