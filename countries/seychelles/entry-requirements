Cases of coronavirus (COVID-19) have been confirmed in Seychelles. The Seychellois authorities have introduced a number of measures to limit the spread of the virus.
The Government of Seychelles has announced that from 8pm GMT on 18 March entry will not be granted to anyone arriving from the UK, EU countries, Switzerland, Reunion Island and Mayotte. The same measures apply to anyone travelling to Seychelles from China, South Korea, Iran or Italy. This list of countries referenced above is being constantly revised – refer to local information for the latest.
Returning residents are exempt and will be granted access, but will be placed in mandatory quarantine in government quarantine centres for 14 days after arrival.
No marine vessel will be allowed to enter Seychelles waters if any passenger on board has been to the UK, EU, China, South Korea or Iran in the last 14 days. All returning residents who have been to China, South Korea, EU, UK or Iran will be put under mandatory quarantine for 14 days upon arrival. See Coronavirus
