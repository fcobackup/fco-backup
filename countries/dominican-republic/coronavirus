Cases of coronavirus (COVID-19) have been confirmed in the Dominican Republic. The local authorities have introduced measures to limit the spread of the virus.
The FCO strongly encourage non-resident British nationals in Dominican Republic to consider leaving quickly to avoid difficulties they will face if travel out of the country and the region are further restricted and they are unable to get home.

If you’re in the Dominican Republic, follow the regulations set out by the Dominican government in full. Key measures include:
the closure of all air, land and sea borders. Ferry flights for foreign nationals wishing to leave the country will continue to operate in accordance with the regulations of the Dominican authorities.
individuals to limit their own movements to essential travel only.
suspension of all events, including international and national events, sports fixtures, bars, nightclubs and cultural events.
all schools and universities suspended.

On 20 March the Dominican Government announced that an evening curfew would be implemented with immediate effect. The curfew applies from 20 March until 3 April between the hours of 8pm and 6am and applies to all persons in the country, except those with specific exemptions (e.g. healthcare workers and certain other professions) or those with a medical emergency travelling to a medical facility. All British nationals in the Dominican Republic should observe this restriction.
We are aware that some hotels in the main tourist areas of Punta Cana and Puerta Plata are closing. A small number of hotels in Punta Cana are remaining open as well as AirBnB options. Some hotels in Santo Domingo also remain open and are still receiving guests. We are in close contact with the hotels association and monitoring the situation.
