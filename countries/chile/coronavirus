Returning to the UK
When you return, you must follow the rules for entering the UK.
You are responsible for organising your own COVID-19 test, in line with UK government testing requirements. You should contact local authorities for information on testing facilities (in Spanish, under the ‘Laboratories PCR SARS-CoV-2’ tab).
From 8 June, direct flights can arrive in England from Chile, but they must arrive at dedicated terminals at Heathrow and Birmingham airports. Different requirements may apply for arrivals into Scotland, Wales and Northern Ireland.
Be prepared for your plans to change
No travel is risk-free during COVID. Countries may further restrict travel or bring in new rules at short notice, for example due to a new COVID-19 variant. Check with your travel company or airline for any transport changes which may delay your journey home.
If you test positive for COVID-19, you may need to stay where you are until you test negative. You may also need to seek treatment there.
Plan ahead and make sure you:
can access money
understand what your insurance will cover
can make arrangements to extend your stay and be away for longer than planned
Travel in Chile
Travellers arriving in Santiago should be aware that local authorities frequently move municipalities (comunas) back and forth through the quarantine Stages Plan (Paso a Paso). You should review the Chilean Government Paso a Paso website.
If you are travelling from or to the airport to catch a flight from or to one of the areas under quarantine or curfew, presenting your passport and boarding pass will permit you to cross any checkpoints. Use a recognised taxi service or airport transfer whose driver should have the requisite permissions.
Chilean authorities require the use of facemasks in all public spaces / public transport, including the airport. You risk a significant fine for not wearing a mask in public.
From 15 July, there will be two curfew regimes depending on the public health situation and the numbers of vaccinated residents in each region. One curfew is from 10pm to 5am and the other from midnight to 5am (regions with less of 150 active COVID-19 cases and more than 80% vaccinated residents). You should check this information with local health authorities or on the Ministry of Health website, which is updated daily. If you have a medical emergency or funeral during curfew times, you must request a permit (Salvoconducto) online.
Be aware that if you wish to travel to Magallanes Region, you might be required to provide proof of a negative PCR-test result given within 72 hours prior to travel. You should get in contact with your transport operator.
The Chilean government has introduced a four stage plan, “Plan Paso A Paso”, for managing and explaining changes in restrictions applied in different regions.
Additional the government has introduced a special mobility pass (‘Pase de Movilidad’) for vaccinated residents in ‘comunas’ in ‘Cuarentena’ (Stage 1) and ‘Transition’ (Stage 2). You can request the ‘Pase de Movilidad’ on the ‘MeVacuno’ website. This will generate a QR-code after entering your personal information. This permit can only be requested 14-days after completing a full COVID-19 vaccination course in Chile (i.e. after the second dose for a two-dose course COVID-19 vaccine such as AstraZeneca, Pfizer, etc).
From Friday 6 August 2021 onwards, the Chilean government is allowing Chileans and foreigners resident in Chile who have been vaccinated overseas to register for Chile’s Mobility Pass scheme (‘Pase de Movilidad’). You may obtain a Mobility Pass if you fulfil the eligibility criteria on the Chile Government’s MeVacuno website. More details on accepted vaccines and the process to apply for the Mobility Pass, including the documents required to validate the vaccination, is available here (in Spanish).
The COVID MODE Strategy should be followed in all stages and requires that you respect national/local/regional restrictions at all times: wear face masks on public transport and in: public spaces including shops and supermarkets; keep to social distancing rules; self-isolate immediately if you suspect you have been in contact with a confirmed COVID case.
The mobility rules and permitted numbers for gatherings will vary depending on whether you hold a mobility pass (Pase de Movilidad) and the ‘Paso a Paso’ stage of the ‘comuna’:
Stage 1: Quarantine. Mobility Pass holders: free movement only within the ‘comuna’; restricted gathering capacity on funerals, weddings and religion ceremonies; outdoor exercise activities are allowed at any time. Non-Mobility Pass holders: restricted mobility; permits required for essential activity; a maximum of two a week including one only at weekends; Evening curfew between 10pm to 5am social distancing and cordon sanitaire in place; obligatory quarantine for those over 75, except on Mondays, Thursdays and Saturdays between 9am to 11am for 60 minutes or between 4pm to 6pm; prohibition of movement to secondary home. Outdoor exercise activities are allowed from Monday to Friday between 5am to 9am and on weekends and bank holidays between 5am to 10am. You should review the Chilean Government Paso a Paso website.
Stage 2: Transition. Quarantine remains in place at weekends and bank holidays. Mobility Pass holders: free mobility at any time; interregional travels are allowed to any other ‘comuna’; social gatherings are allowed with maximum 10 people (all Mobility Pass holders); out/indoor exercise activities are allowed. Non-Mobility Pass holders: social gatherings of no more than five people allowed inside; Evening curfew regime depends on regional health situation, social distancing and cordon sanitaire in place and a prohibition on movement to other regions. Outdoor exercise activities are allowed from Monday to Friday at any time (except on curfew). On weekends and bank holidays between 5am to 10am. You should review the Chilean Government Paso a Paso website.

Non Mobility Pass holders: social gatherings capped at 10 people; Evening curfew regime depends on regional health situation social distancing and cordon sanitaire in place; and interregional travel is only allowed to regions in Stage 3, 4 and 5. In/Outdoor activities are allowed. You should review the Chilean Government Paso a Paso website.
Stage 4: Initial opening. Significant step that aims to re-open certain low risk activities and to avoid crowds and physical contact. Social gatherings with no more than 40 people permitted if all are Mobility Pass holders; cinemas, theatres, restaurants and cafes allowed to function at 25% capacity; restaurants and cafés allowed to open to the public at 25% capacity; Evening curfew regime depends on regional health situation, social distancing still required; pubs and clubs remain closed; Interregional travel is only allowed to regions in Stage 3 and 4. You should review the Chilean Government Paso a Paso website for more details.
The Government’s ‘Paso a Paso’ website outlines which phase-out stage each comuna of Chile is under the heading (‘Situación Comunal’).
In those areas under Stage 1 ‘quarantine’ you are only allowed to leave your residence under certain circumstances, including for medical reasons, basic services, and public services. If you need to leave your residence for food or medical supplies, you must get a permit from the Comisaria Virtual. Foreigners may use their passport number to access the system. The pages are only in Spanish.
You should be aware that the ‘Pase de Movilidad’ may allow you to move freely among ‘comunas’ in Stage 1 and 2 and interregional travel between ‘comunas’ in Stage 2, 3 and 4.
Individuals that wish to pass the sanitary cordons must obtain a “Salvoconducto” permit and a “Health Passport” (“pasaporte sanitario”) (under “viajeros regionales” for residents or “viajeros regionales” for foreign visitors), at least 24 hours before.
Information on the areas of Chile that have sanitary cordons is available on the Government’s ‘Plan de Acción’.
Checkpoints for health inspections are in force at various points around Santiago and elsewhere. In addition to checking the health of persons passing through, these checkpoints will be used to confirm that specific individuals who have been ordered to quarantine by medical authorities are not violating their quarantine. You will need to get a “Health Passport” prior to travel and present it at any checkpoint.
Public places and services
Chilean authorities require the use of facemasks in all public spaces, irrespective of what stage of the plan ‘Paso a Paso’ the comuna is in.
