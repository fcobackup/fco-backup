There are currently extremely limited commercial options available to return to the UK from Jamaica.
UK special flight
A special flight will depart from Kingston Norman Manley International Airport on Wednesday 3 June to London Heathrow.
The flight costs £537 per person.
These flights are for:
British nationals, normally resident in the UK
Dependants travelling with a British national
Vulnerable British nationals will be prioritised.
Vulnerable non-British UK residents with Indefinite Leave to Remain and other foreign nationals may be accommodated if there is sufficient capacity.
Your eligibility will be checked before your tickets are issued.
How to book
CTM is working on behalf of the Foreign and Commonwealth Office (FCO) to manage special flight bookings.
If you wish to travel, book on the CTM website https://etm.eventsair.com/fco-jamaica/p2fcojamcharter as soon as possible.
To book flights on the CTM website, you will need:
full passport and contact details for each traveller
your UK home address and postcode
your means of payment, such as credit or debit card details
The booking website is available to British nationals and vulnerable Jamaican or other non-British UK residents with Indefinite Leave to Remain. If you are another foreign national, then you will need to contact us. To do so, send an SMS text message containing only your full name to +44(0)786-009-3016. A member of the CTM team will then be in touch.
Tickets will not be on sale at the airport. Do not travel to the airport without a confirmed ticket.
Financial support for a flight
If you have exhausted all other options available to you for getting funds, you may be eligible to apply for an emergency loan from the government to cover the cost of the ticket.
You would need to repay the loan when you are back in the UK.
Our partner CTM is authorised to administer such loans on behalf of the FCO and details will be available when you are asked to pay.
Travel to the airport
You will need to make your own travel arrangements to get to Kingston, Norman Manley International airport. Please do not go to the airport if you do not have a confirmed seat.
Your journey home
The National Travel Health Network and Centre (NaTHNaC) provides advice on how to stay safe as you travel by air.
If you’re returning home before 8 June, follow the guidance for when you return to the UK on steps you should take to protect yourself and others. From 8 June there will be new rules for entering the UK.
Future travel options
The British High Commission is in contact with airlines, the Jamaican authorities and other governments to make sure information on commercial options for returning to the UK is available as soon as possible.
You may be able to make indirect travel arrangements via the USA or Canada if possible but you may have to wait before a flight becomes available. You should refer to those countries’ restrictions before travelling to ensure that you will be allowed to enter the country for onward connection.
Currently no airlines are regularly scheduled to fly to the USA or Canada in May. JetBlue is operating flights at short notice from Kingston and Montego Bay to Fort Lauderdale, Florida from time to time. Miami International Airport is 30 minutes away by bus and flights to the United Kingdom are operating. You will need an ESTA or a valid US visa.
