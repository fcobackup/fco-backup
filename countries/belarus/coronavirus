The Belarusian government have not put in place any restrictions on entering the country and Belavia, the national airline, continues to operate as normal to the UK.
Your travel may be impacted by the restrictions put in place by neighbouring countries, and the situation in Belarus could quickly change. You should check with your airline or travel company for the latest information before you travel.
You should also check FCO travel advice for Russia, Ukraine, Poland, Lithuania, and Latvia.
