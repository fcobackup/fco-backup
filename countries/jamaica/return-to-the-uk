Future travel options
The Government of Jamaica has announced that borders will be open to international travellers from 15 June. This will offer the opportunity to airlines to resume scheduled operations from that date if they choose to do so. The British High Commission is in contact with airlines, the Jamaican authorities and other governments to make sure information on commercial options for returning to the UK is available as soon as possible.
You may be able to make indirect travel arrangements via the USA or Canada, if possible, but you may have to wait before a flight becomes available. You should refer to those countries’ restrictions before travelling to ensure that you will be allowed to enter the country for onward connection.
Currently no airlines are regularly scheduled to fly to the USA or Canada. US and Canadian airlines are operating some services from Jamaica and connecting flights to the UK may be possible. You will need an ESTA or a valid US visa or in the case of Canada, an eTA.
British Airways is now accepting bookings for flights from Kingston to London on 21, 24, 27 and 31 July.
This travel advice will be updated when further departure options become available. Sign up for travel advice email alerts and follow the British High Commission on Twitter and Facebook.
You will need to pay for your return travel to the UK. If departure options are available but you cannot afford the travel costs and have exhausted all other options for getting funds, you may be eligible to apply for an emergency loan from the government. This is a last resort option and you would need to repay the loan when you are back in the UK. For more information, you should contact Corporate Travel Management (CTM). CTM are a commercial partner of the FCO and are authorised to administer such loans on behalf of the FCO.
Your journey home: re-entering the UK
When you return, you must follow the rules for entering the UK. You:
need to provide your journey and contact details up to 48 hours before you’re due to arrive in the UK
are not allowed to leave the place you’re staying for the first 14 days you’re in the UK except in very limited situations (known as ‘self-isolating’)
See also the list of people who are exempt from the border rules.
The National Travel Health Network and Centre (NaTHNaC) also provides advice on how to stay safe as you travel by air.
