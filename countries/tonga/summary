The Tongan authorities have introduced a number of precautionary measures in response to the coronavirus (COVID-19) pandemic. See Health
The Government of Australia has announced that from 9pm local time on 20 March, entry to the country will only be permitted to Australian citizens or permanent residents. This follows a similar announcement by New Zealand from 19 March. As many flight connections to and from Tonga connect in Australia and New Zealand, options to depart Tonga are likely to reduce. If you’re currently a visitor in Tonga, you’re advised to prepare to leave as soon as possible. If you’re resident in Tonga, you should be aware of the potential impact of the border closures and flight restrictions on future travel plans.
There is no British diplomatic representation in Tonga. Consular support is limited in Tonga. However, the British High Commission in Suva in Fiji can provide consular support to British nationals.
Cyclone season is normally between November and April but cyclones can occur throughout the year. Severe weather may result in flooding, landslides, and disruption to essential services and infrastructure. You should monitor local and international weather updates from the World Meteorological Organisation (WMO), from the Tonga Meteorological Service, in local newspapers and on Radio Tonga 1 and 2 on 1017 AM and 90 FM, and follow the advice of the local authorities including any evacuation orders. See our Tropical cyclones page for further advice about what to do if you are caught up in a storm. See Natural disasters
Although there’s no recent history of terrorism in Tonga, attacks can’t be ruled out. See Terrorism
