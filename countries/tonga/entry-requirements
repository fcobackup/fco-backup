On 5 February 2020, the Ministry of Health of Tonga announced temporary restrictions on travellers from mainland China in response to the coronavirus outbreak. Tonga will deny entry to anyone who has left or transited mainland China from 1 February 2020 onwards, with the exception of Tongan citizens, permanent residents, and immediate family members of Tongan citizens and permanent residents including spouses, minor dependants and legal guardians. Given the fast changing situation, you should check the latest entry requirements for your destination or check with your airline before you travel.
