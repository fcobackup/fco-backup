Strikes and demonstrations
There are regular strikes, sometimes called at short notice that can cause disruption to public transport (including air travel and ports), as well as road networks and borders. Political demonstrations can also occur frequently.
Avoid demonstrations wherever possible and follow the advice of the local authorities. Some demonstrations in the past have turned violent. If you do find yourself unexpectedly near a demonstration, move away to the last known safe place. Be aware that security forces often use CS/Tear gas to break up demonstrations, which can adversely affect your breathing and vision.
Demonstrations take place regularly around major squares in central Athens, in particular Syntagma Square. Nationwide strikes and protests can occur at any time and may disrupt road, air, sea travel and cause delays/diversions at border crossings.
Demonstrations can be called at short notice, but there are certain dates on which demonstrations traditionally occur: 1 May, 17 November, and 6 December.
Crime
Most visits to Greece are trouble-free, but theft of passports, wallets and handbags are common on the metro and in crowded tourist places, particularly in central Athens. Leave valuables in a safe place at your hotel or apartment and carry a photocopy of your passport with you. You should maintain at least the same level of personal security awareness as in the UK.
When driving on holiday, keep your valuables out of sight and lock your vehicle at all times. Always park in a well-lit area or secure car park. Be alert to car crime.
In 2022, 33 cases of rape and sexual assaults in Greece were reported to British consular staff. We also saw a small number of other personal attacks reported, and in some cases the alleged attackers were also British nationals. We recommend that all travellers take note of the following the advice:
saving the location of your accommodation on your maps app, so it’s easier to find at the end of the night;
setting up a WhatsApp group to keep in touch with each other;
keeping an eye on each other’s drinks to make sure they don’t get spiked;
not letting a friend walk back to their hotel alone;
not giving a drunk person more alcohol.
You should immediately report anything you see that doesn’t feel right to local authorities or hospitality management.
There have been some racially motivated attacks, mostly but not restricted to inner-city areas.
Alcohol, drugs and use of nitrous oxide can lead to you being less alert, less in control and less aware of your environment. Drinks served in bars overseas are often stronger than those in the UK. We recommended only purchasing branded and labelled drinks.
Road travel
See the European Commission, AA and RAC guides on driving in Greece.
In 2021 there were 578 road deaths in Greece (source: Department for Transport). This equates to 5.8 road deaths per 100,000 of population and compares to the UK average of 2.3 road deaths per 100,000 of population in 2021. If you are planning to drive in Greece, see information on Driving Abroad.
Licences and documents
You can drive in Greece with a UK driving licence.
You should read our guidance on driving in the EU from 1 January 2021.
Driving a British car abroad
You may need a UK sticker to drive your car outside the UK. From 28 September 2021 UK stickers have replaced GB stickers. Check the GOV.UK Displaying number plates website for more information on what to do if you are driving outside the UK.
Road safety
Make sure any vehicle you hire is in good condition and check that you’re insured. When renting mopeds or quad bikes, insurance sold by the hire company usually only provides third party insurance, which only covers the cost of damage to another vehicle. Any damage sustained to the rental vehicle in many cases may need to be paid for by you, or you may face arrest if you do not pay and the hire company decide to press charges.
Quad biking
Quad biking is considered an extreme sport and carries the risk of serious injury or death. Specific travel insurance to cover quad bike rental is essential to avoid you having to pay the costs of private health care and/or repatriation to the UK. Always take care to read the details of your insurance cover before you travel on holiday, paying particular attention to the small print and exclusions on your insurance policy.
If you do rent a quad bike, choose a category in accordance with your driving licence and age. Drivers and passengers must wear helmets. Failure to do so may invalidate your insurance and if stopped, you will be fined and your licence taken from you. If you intend to hire a moped you will need a valid driving licence with at least category A1 - ‘light motorcycle’. Category P, which is valid in the UK for driving mopeds up to 50cc, is not valid in Greece.
Sensitive locations
You shouldn’t approach or take photos or videos of military installations, vehicles or buildings at any time. The Greek authorities will arrest and possibly prosecute anyone doing so. Certain border areas are also militarily sensitive. Although you can visit these areas, you should avoid taking photos or video footage.
Water sports and swimming
Follow local advice if jellyfish are present.
If you are considering taking part in water sports activities, do so through a licensed water sports centre and make sure paperwork is completed before starting the activity. Check the Safe Water Sports website for more information.
However inviting the blue waters may be, make sure you follow any warning signs, adhere to instructions from lifeguards and observe the flag indicators on beaches.
Political situation
Since 1974, Greece has been a stable parliamentary democracy, with its head of state elected by the Parliament. It joined the European Union in 1981. Greece is recovering from a long-running economic crisis and its financial system is fragile. Greece has made positive steps in reducing its debts. Following the latest economic review, international creditors have released funds, but there remains a risk of further economic difficulties and related demonstrations.
Migration
Since 2015, there has been a dramatic increase in the number of migrants and refugees arriving on Greek islands, including Lesvos, Kos and Samos, and seeking to continue their journey via Greece to other EU countries. The flows have recently reduced significantly. At present there are no reports of any specific risks to British nationals visiting these islands or at border crossing points.
