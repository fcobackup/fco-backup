The information on this page covers the most common types of travel and reflects the UK government’s understanding of the rules currently in place. Unless otherwise stated, this information is for travellers using a full ‘British Citizen’ passport.
The authorities in the country or territory you’re travelling to are responsible for setting and enforcing the rules for entry. If you’re unclear about any aspect of the entry requirements, or you need further reassurance, you’ll need to contact the embassy, high commission or consulate of the country or territory you’re travelling to.
You should also consider checking with your transport provider or travel company to make sure your passport and other travel documents meet their requirements.
Restrictions in response to coronavirus
Entry and quarantine
From 10 June, it is no longer compulsory to enter state quarantine on arrival. You should bring with you a negative Covid-19 test and self-isolate on arrival. The exception to this is if you have spent the previous 14 days only in these 19 listed countries: Hungary, Austria, Czech Republic Germany, Lichtenstein, Switzerland, Slovenia, Croatia, Bulgaria, Greece, Cyprus, Malta, Lithuania, Latvia, Estonia, Finland, Norway, Denmark and Iceland.
If you arrive from the UK or any other country which is not currently listed, or if you visited an unlisted country within the previous 14 days, you will need to be able to show to the police at the border a negative Covid-19 (RT-PCR) test no older than 96 hours in English, German, Czech or Slovak or translated into one of these languages. If there are no police controls at the border, you must present your negative test to the nearest regional Public Health Authority office without delay. You must then enter self-isolation and take another test after at least 5 days. Once tested negative again, you may end your self-isolation. People living in the same household as you must also enter self-isolation.
You may transit Slovakia in order to return to your country of residence without the need for a negative Covid-19 test or entering self-isolation if your transit is completed within eight hours. See the Slovak Police Facebook Page (in Slovak only).

Regular entry requirements
Passport validity  
Your passport should be valid for the proposed duration of your stay; you do not need any additional period of validity on your passport beyond this.
The rules on travel will stay the same until 31 December 2020.
Make sure your passport is in a presentable state before you travel. The Slovak authorities can refuse entry if your passport is worn or damaged, or looks as if it’s been tampered with.
Visas
If you hold a British Citizen passport, you don’t need a visa to enter Slovakia. If you’re planning a stay of longer than 3 months, see our Living in Slovakia guide and contact the Slovak Embassy if you have further questions.
The rules on travel will stay the same until 31 December 2020.
Registering with the Slovak authorities
If you plan to stay in Slovakia for a longer period of time, you should register with the police within 3 days of arrival. You’ll need your passport, 2 photographs and proof of accommodation. You’ll have an option to apply for a Slovak ‘green card’, which can be used as proof of your ID, while your passport is kept in a safe place. Visit the website of Ministry of Interior of the Slovak Republic for further information.
UK Emergency Travel Documents
UK Emergency Travel Documents (ETDs) are accepted for entry, airside transit and exit from Slovakia. They are also accepted for a return to Slovakia if you normally live there.
