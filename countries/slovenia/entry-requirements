The information on this page covers the most common types of travel and reflects the UK government’s understanding of the rules currently in place. Unless otherwise stated, this information is for travellers using a full ‘British Citizen’ passport.
The authorities in the country or territory you’re travelling to are responsible for setting and enforcing the rules for entry. If you’re unclear about any aspect of the entry requirements, or you need further reassurance, you’ll need to contact the embassy, high commission or consulate of the country or territory you’re travelling to.
You should also consider checking with your transport provider or travel company to make sure your passport and other travel documents meet their requirements.
Entry rules in response to coronavirus (COVID-19)
Entry to Slovenia
Airports in Slovenia remain open for passenger flights. You should consult airlines for details of flight options, to and from Slovenia.
International passenger train connections have re-started. You should visit the Deutsche Bahn website for the latest schedule.
The Slovene authorities have announced new border entry procedures.
If you are travelling to Slovenia indirectly, please refer to the Travel Advice for the countries which you will be transiting through.
Testing/screening on arrival
Health checks may be conducted at all border entry points. If you display signs of coronavirus infections you will be refused entry, unless you hold a permanent residence permit for Slovenia.
Quarantine requirements
The Slovenian authorities have implemented a Red list of countries, to determine the requirements for people arriving into Slovenia from overseas. The rules around entry are detailed, and subject to regular change. You should regularly consult this Travel Advice and the Slovenian Government websites listed below to ensure you have the latest information. Full details can be found on this Slovenian Government website.
If you arrive into Slovenia from a country on the Red List, you will have to quarantine for 10 days unless you meet one of the specific exemptions that are listed by the Slovenian government or hold a negative COVID-19 test that is no more than 48 hours old . There is more detail and a full list of exemptions on the the Government of Slovenia website.
From 24 October 202, the Slovenian authorities have added the whole of the UK to the Red List. You should not use the NHS testing service to get a test in order to facilitate your travel to another country. You should arrange to take a private test.
You should also be aware that the Slovenian authorities have declared specific regions of neighbouring countries to be on the Red List. This includes regions in Austria, Croatia and Hungary. You can find the full details here.
Anyone required to enter into quarantine will need to provide an address (where they will be staying) to the Border authorities. Failure to do so may result in the Border authorities denying you entry. During self-isolation, you are required to stay in your accommodation and not socialise outside of your household. You can take short walks for exercise, but should maintain social distancing and not engage with people from outside your household. The local municipality can make arrangements for the delivery of essential supplies if friends or family cannot support you.
All arriving travellers will be given advice at the border regarding the steps they may need to take.

Regular entry requirements
Visas  
If you hold a British Citizen passport, you don’t need a visa to enter Slovenia. If you’re planning a stay of longer than 3 months, see our Living in Slovenia guide and contact the Slovene Embassy if you have further questions.
The rules on travel will stay the same until 31 December 2020.
Visas from 1 January 2021

you will be able to travel to countries in the Schengen area for up to 90 days in any 180-day period without a visa as a tourist, to visit family or friends, to attend business meetings, cultural or sports events, or for short-term studies or training.
if you are travelling to Slovenia and other Schengen countries without a visa, make sure your whole visit is within the limit. Visits to Schengen countries within the previous 180 days before you travel would count towards the 90-day limit
to stay for longer, to work or study, for business travel or for other reasons, you will need to meet the entry requirements set out by Slovenia. This could mean applying for a visa and/or work permit. You should check with the Slovene Embassy what type of visa and/or work permit, if any, you will need
if you are in Slovenia with a visa or permit, your stay will not count towards the 90-day limit
The 90-day limit for visa-free travel will begin on 1 January 2021. Any days you stay in Slovenia or other Schengen countries before 1 January 2021 will not count towards the 90-day limit.

show a return or onward ticket
show you have enough money for your stay, and
use separate lanes from EU, EEA and Swiss citizens when queueing
Your passport may be stamped on entry and exit.
Passport validity
The rules on travel will stay the same until 31 December 2020.
Your passport should be valid for the proposed duration of your stay; you do not need any additional period of validity on your passport beyond this.
Passport validity from 1 January 2021
From 1 January 2021, you must have at least 6 months left on an adult or child passport to travel to most countries in Europe (not including Ireland).
If you renewed your current passport before the previous one expired, extra months may have been added to its expiry date. Any extra months on your passport over 10 years may not count towards the 6 months needed.
Check your passport is valid for travel before you book your trip. You will need to renew your passport before travelling if you do not have enough time left on your passport.
