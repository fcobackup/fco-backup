There are occasional political demonstrations in Budapest and elsewhere in the country. Some take place on or close to important national holidays with a political relevance, such as 15 March (anniversary of 1848 Revolution) and 23 October (anniversary of 1956 anti-Soviet Uprising). Due to the campaign leading up to the April general election, there will be a number of mass rallies and marches in Budapest on 15 March this year.
