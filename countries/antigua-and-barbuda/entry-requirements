Entry rules in response to coronavirus (COVID-19)
Testing / screening on arrival
All passengers arriving by air in Antigua and Barbuda, including those transiting the country, must provide evidence of a negative COVID-19 RT-PCR test taken no more than seven days before arrival. Further health screening is in place at VC Bird International Airport and the private jet terminal for all international arrivals. The measures are subject to change but may include mandatory temperature and travel history checks, and further testing for Coronavirus. You should expect long waiting times on arrival.
Passengers arriving by sea are not required to provide evidence of a negative COVID-19 RT-PCR test but must enter via Nevis Street Pier in St John’s and follow the quarantine instructions of Port Health.
Visitors instructed by the local authorities to take a Coronavirus test on arrival must pay a fee of US$ 100 or local equivalent in cash.
Quarantine requirements
The local authorities may instruct you to enter government-provided quarantine, for which a further fee of XCD 100 per night is payable, depending on the results of their screening and testing procedures. Those with pre-booked hotel accommodation will normally be permitted to travel to their accommodation after screening. Those staying with family, friends, or their own place of residence, must spend their first night in mandatory government quarantine and will be subject to an interview to determine their suitability to leave for their private accommodation arrangements. Those not deemed to have suitable private accommodation arrangements will be obliged to remain in government quarantine at their expense for between seven and 14 days.
