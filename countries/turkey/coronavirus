Cases of Coronavirus (COVID-19) have been confirmed in Turkey. The Turkish authorities have introduced a number of measures to limit the spread of the virus.
At midnight on April 12 Turkey lifted the 48 hour curfew imposed in 31 provinces. It is possible that further curfews will be imposed.
A curfew remains in place for those aged over 65, those born after 1 January 2000, and those who have a chronic medical condition. People in these categories must not leave their homes.
Those aged between18-20 and working in the public or private sector, or as a seasonal worker in the agriculture sector, can leave home if they have the necessary documents and permissions to show to the security forces. Those in these categories who must travel or leave home may do so after requesting official permission via the designated phone lines; 112, 155, and 156. Wearing of masks is obligatory in crowded places and specifically in markets and supermarkets. The wearing of masks is compulsory on all public transport, including Metro, buses and ferries.
The Turkish authorities have imposed restrictions on international flights. Passengers who are not Turkish nationals or residents of Turkey are not permitted to enter Turkey. Some airlines are operating flights to Turkey on an occasional basis to repatriate Turkish nationals and residents of Turkey from abroad. Passengers on these flights are subject to medical evaluation on landing and may be subject to enforced quarantine at a government run quarantine facility, or be required to self-isolate at home. You should refer to the operating airline and your nearest Turkish Embassy before you travel, to ensure you are permitted to enter Turkey on these flights.
