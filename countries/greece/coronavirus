The Foreign and Commonwealth Office (FCO) recommends that British nationals who wish to leave Greece, contact their travel operator to make arrangements to do so as soon as possible. This is in response to the ongoing coronavirus (COVID-19) pandemic and in line with various controls and restrictions imposed by the Greek authorities. British nationals in Greece should follow the advice of the Greek authorities.
Countries neighbouring Greece (Albania, Bulgaria, Italy, North Macedonia, Turkey) have also introduced restrictions. Please check country-specific FCO Travel Advice for details
The Greek government has announced that from 16 March, all people arriving in Greece from abroad are required to go into 14 days’ self-isolation.
This is a mandatory measure, which the authorities will enforce by prosecution and fines. UK nationals are not affected by the European Union’s measures to close EU borders to third country nationals.
On 20 March, the authorities announced restrictions on travel to the Greek islands, with effect from 0600 local time on Saturday 21 March. This is to prevent the spread of coronavirus. In order to purchase a ticket to travel to an island, you will need to provide proof of permanent residence (via a tax certificate) on the island to which you wish to travel. One-way travel from islands to the mainland is not restricted.
The Greek authorities announced on 19 March that most accommodation, including hotels, will close at midnight (local time) on Sunday 22 March, in order to help prevent the spread of coronavirus. At present, AirBnB accommodation remains available.
Flights continue to operate between Greece and the UK. Overall airline capacity between Greece and the UK remains good. Some airlines have begun to reduce their flight schedules to and from Greece, due to reduced demand. You should keep up to date with the latest advice from your airline, and contact them directly in case of disruption.
The authorities have imposed a ban on all cruise ships and sailboats (including private yachts) landing in Greek ports. Private sailboat (and yacht) travel between two points within Greece is also forbidden. All yachts currently at sea must dock by midnight local time on Saturday 21 March.
In case of suspected symptoms, including a fever or respiratory difficulties such as shortness of breath or a cough, you should avoid visiting local health facilities, but contact a doctor remotely to see whether a test is recommended. For more information, consult the Greek National Public Health Organisation (NPHO) online or via telephone (dial 1135, or 210 521 2054, from within Greece). The NPHO can provide contact details of a doctor; their telephone line operates 24 hours a day. You should continue to follow this advice if symptoms develop after the conclusion of a 14-day period of self-isolation.
As part of its coronavirus response, the Greek Government has ordered the closure of all cafes, bars and restaurants, as well as shopping centres and malls, theatres and cinemas, children’s playgrounds, beauty salons, libraries, sports centres, museums and archaeological sites as well as beach clubs, ski centres and seasonal accommodation. Take away food services will continue to operate and supermarkets, bakeries and pharmacies remain open. All schools, nurseries and universities are currently closed. Public gatherings of more than 10 people are forbidden. The Government has also banned all large events and conferences for 4 weeks until 5 April. If you are due to attend an event, you should check with the event organiser before travelling.
Changes to what is open/permitted, including international travel options, have been coming frequently and without warning. Please keep up to date with news and advice from your travel contacts/business partners as well as the sources on this page, for the latest information.
Further information on coronavirus, including advice on preparing for foreign travel and helping reduce the spread of the virus, is available from Public Health England and on the TravelHealthPro website.
