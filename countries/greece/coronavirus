National measures and restrictions (‘lock-down’)
Greek authorities have implemented nationwide measures (national ‘lock-down’) which replaced all previous measures and apply to all parts of Greece. These measures will remain in place until at least 6am local time on 18 January 2021; but given the potential for them to be extended or adapted, you should keep up-to-date by checking this page regularly, and following local announcements.
In addition to these nationwide measures, additional local measures are in force in specific regions of Greece. These additional measures, along with the regions to which they apply, are listed below the nationwide measures that follow.
The following nationwide measures are currently in place:
obligatory use of facemasks in all indoor and outdoor public and communal spaces, including work-places and on public transport;
a ban on non-essential movements outside of your home or accommodation (essential movements are defined according to the list below, or for work-related reasons - in which case your employer must provide you with certification of your requirement to travel);
obligatory certification of any essential movements, either by completion of a self-written note, by using the online form provided by the Greek authorities, or by use of the Greek authorities’ free SMS service (only available from Greek mobile numbers). For more detail on the information required under each of these methods of certification, see below). You must be able to show certification to the authorities when requested;
obligatory carrying of an official identity card or passport at all times outside of your home or accommodation;
a near-complete curfew from 9PM to 5AM local time. During these hours, all movements (including those considered essential movements) are prohibited, except for in the following cases: for travel to or from work; to walk a dog (in which case, movement must be limited to an area close to your home or accommodation); or for medical emergencies. Any such movements should continue to be certified in line with the guidance given above and below;
a removal of all retail sector conveniences. From 3 January to 6am on 18 January, bookshops, hairdressers and beauty salons will be closed, and the collection of e-orders by customers (‘click-away’ method) will also be closed;
game hunting and fishing is forbidden;
churches are closed and religious services are suspended;
a ban on travel between different parts of Greece, except for essential reasons. You should not leave the region (‘nomos’/ ‘νόμος’) of your residence or accommodation, except for permitted, exceptional reasons (acceptable reasons include returning to your residence or accommodation address; for family reunification reasons; for health emergencies; for essential business reasons- in which case your employer must provide you with certification that your travel is essential);
closure of all land borders to all non-essential travel, except for the border with Bulgaria, which remains open at the Promachonas crossing point.
the Greek authorities define essential travel as movement by Greek citizens, permanent residents of Greece (anyone in those 2 categories who is returning to Greece), transport workers and anyone travelling for essential professional reasons ( anyone in those categories who needs to travel in either direction for professional reasons);
all arrivals by sea by private yachts, cruise ships, ferries and any other professional tourist ships are prohibited;
Additional requirements for anyone travelling to or from Greece by air, or travelling into Greece via land borders (for details on these requirements, see Entry Requirements);
a maximum limit on the number of persons permitted to travel in taxi or a private vehicle:

Travel in Greece
Travel within Greece is currently restricted, in line with measures outlined above. You should comply with all measures announced by the Greek authorities. The below advice applies to any travel which is permitted within the restrictions currently in place.
You should also note that, as a result of current restrictions on movements, transport services (including flights, intercity buses, trains and ferries) are liable to disruption at the present time.
It is mandatory to wear face masks on public transport (including flights and ferries), at airports and in taxis. Travel in a private car or a taxi is subject to certain restrictions (eg limited to a maximum number of adult passengers per vehicle) according to local measures outlined above.
If you are travelling via ferry, you will need to complete a health questionnaire and hand it to the ferry operator before boarding. The necessary forms will be provided by the operator: you should contact them directly if you need further information. Temperature checks may also be carried out before boarding; and it is obligatory to wear masks on all ferries, including on open air decks, where capacity is limited to allow for social distancing. No celebrations are allowed on board ferries.
If you are travelling by internal (domestic) flights, you are also required to wear masks throughout the journey. Specific measures relating to check-in, baggage allowances and other details are in place to reduce the spread of coronavirus. You should check with your operator directly for further detail.
Changes to what is open or permitted, including international travel options, are subject to change and may occur at short notice. Keep up to date with the latest information and advice from your travel contact or business partners, as well as the sources in this travel advice.
Accommodation
All hotels are permitted to open, and other types of accommodation, including e.g. Airbnb, private rentals and hostels, are also available. However, you should note that many operators are likely to reduce their offer and close some accommodation during the winter months, particularly in light of measures put in place by the Greek authorities to fight the spread of COVID-19. You should check directly with your accommodation provider in case of related concerns.
Healthcare in Greece
If you think you have symptoms, including a fever or respiratory difficulties such as shortness of breath or a cough, you should avoid visiting local health facilities, but contact a doctor remotely to see whether a test is recommended. There is likely to be a cost associated with this, for call out, examination and testing, which you will have to pay.
If you are staying in a hotel or resort, your accommodation provider will have a list of private doctors that they will call to assess your symptoms and conduct a COVID-19 test.
If you have arranged your own accommodation you can find details of English speaking, private doctors on our list of healthcare providers.
If you are tested and the result is positive, the Greek authorities will ask you to quarantine until advised otherwise. You may be able to remain in your existing accommodation, or be required to transfer into a state hospital or other government-provided accommodation. Costs related to transfer to alternative accommodation and treatment at state healthcare facilities will be covered by the Greek Government. The nature of your accommodation may differ from the specifications of your pre-booked hotel, villa or other place of stay. Depending on local arrangements, travellers in groups may be required to stay in separate accommodation (e.g. if a sufficient number of rooms is not available in one venue, your group may be spread across different accommodation locations).
