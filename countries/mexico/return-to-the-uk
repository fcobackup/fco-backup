There remain commercial options to return to the UK from Mexico.
If you live in the UK and are currently visiting Mexico, you’re strongly advised to return now by commercial means. Don’t run the risk of getting stranded.
UK special charter flights will only operate for priority countries where commercial flights are not possible. You should not assume that these flights will become available in countries where commercial routes are operating. Please do not contact the contracted travel management company if no flight is advertised here.
Commercial flights
Various options remain to travel to the UK via the USA, Canada, France and the Netherlands. Check travel advice for any country you intend to transit or enter before booking any flights. Facemasks are now mandatory when flying. Please contact your airline if you have any questions, including what face covering is acceptable.
Some airlines are imposing their own additional restrictions on travellers, different from the Mexican government guidelines. These restrictions may apply for domestic and international flights. Review the airline requirements carefully before booking and before you travel.
You will need to pay for your return travel to the UK. If departure options are available but you cannot afford the travel costs and have exhausted all other options for getting funds, you may be eligible to apply for an emergency loan from the government. This is a last resort option and you would need to repay the loan when you are back in the UK. For more information, contact Corporate Travel Management (CTM). CTM are a commercial partner of the FCO and are authorised to administer such loans on behalf of the FCO.
The British Embassy is issuing regular updates on on Twitter and Facebook with the latest available information on departure options from Mexico.
