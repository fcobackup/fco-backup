The information on this page covers the most common types of travel and reflects the UK government’s understanding of the rules currently in place. Unless otherwise stated, this information is for travellers using a full ‘British Citizen’ passport.
The authorities in the country or territory you’re travelling to are responsible for setting and enforcing the rules for entry. If you’re unclear about any aspect of the entry requirements, or you need further reassurance, you’ll need to contact the embassy, high commission or consulate of the country or territory you’re travelling to.
You should also consider checking with your transport provider or travel company to make sure your passport and other travel documents meet their requirements.
Entry rules in response to coronavirus
Entry to Norway
From 15 July, Norway is allowing entry for those resident in most Schengen or EU/EEA countries (which until the end of the year includes the UK). As a country with a low risk of infection, residents of the UK may travel and do not need to self-quarantine on arrival in Norway.
UK nationals resident in a Schengen or EU/EEA country with a high risk of infection may enter but are required to self-quarantine for 10 days. For countries outside the Nordics, Schengen or EU/EEA, restrictions continue to apply.
For more details on which countries and regions are exempt, see the Norwegian Institute of Public Health’s website. The list of countries is being reviewed every 14 days.
You can travel to Norway to begin work, provided that the work is imminent. In order to gain entry you will need to bring a copy of your work contract. If you are coming to Norway to work on a temporary assignment you should also bring evidence of this. Those who come to Norway to work are required to follow the quarantine regulations.
From 1 July, students who have been accepted on courses for the 2020/2021 academic year can enter Norway.
For more information, contact the Norwegian Embassy in London. Detailed guidance is available on the UDI website.
Transiting Norway
Non-residents are still able to transit via Norwegian airports as long as the final destination is not within Norway, but please check with your airline before departing.
Cruises
The Chief Medical Officer advises British nationals aged 70 and over and those with pre-existing health condition against cruise ship travel at this time. A number of Norwegian ports are restricting passenger embarkation and disembarkation. The situation can change rapidly so check with your cruise provider before travelling.
Visas
The Norwegian authorities have confirmed that if your visa has expired or is at risk of expiring, you will be not punished if you overstay. You are not required to notify UDI or the police, but are asked to try to leave as quickly as possible.
