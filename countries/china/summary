High levels of air pollution can occur in major urban and industrialised areas in China, and may aggravate bronchial, sinus or asthma conditions. Children, the elderly and those with pre-existing medical conditions may be especially affected. You can check the pollution index levels for many cities in real time. When levels are particularly high Chinese authorities may declare a ‘red alert’ and place restrictions on road traffic and flights. Check with your travel provider for up to date details.
Terrorists are likely to try to carry out attacks in China. Although foreigners haven’t been specifically targeted, attacks may occur in places visited by foreigners. You should take particular care during national holidays or when transiting public transport hubs, and always follow the advice of the local authorities. Previous attacks have targeted public places including on one occasion at a railway station and an open air market in 2014. There have been no recent attacks in the main tourist areas. The risk is higher in the Xinjiang Uyghur Autonomous region. You should take particular care and remain vigilant when travelling to or within Xinjiang. See Terrorism

China doesn’t recognise dual nationality. Any person born in China to a Chinese national parent will be considered by the authorities to have Chinese nationality. If you have both British and Chinese nationality you may be treated as a Chinese citizen by local authorities, even if you enter China on your British passport. If this is the case, the British Embassy may not be able to offer you consular assistance. If you’ve formally renounced Chinese citizenship, you should carry evidence that you have done so. See Local Laws and Customs
If you travel to the southern and central regions of China, including the provinces of Fujian, Guangdong, Guangxi, Guizhou, Hunan, Jiangxi and Zhejiang, monitor weather conditions and take suitable precautions.

The rainy season typically begins in February and lasts until September. Temperatures in July and August can be very high and some provinces have issued heat alerts.
If you’re abroad and you need emergency help from the UK government, contact the nearest British embassy, consulate or high commission.
