Visa applications for individuals travelling from counties affected by coronavirus, including the UK, have been suspended until further notice.
Local Measures
A State of Emergency was announced on 12 April and has been extended until 11 May. Restrictions on travel within the Grande Libreville area have been lifted. Travel outside Libreville to inland Gabon remains restricted. Military forces have been granted authority to enter private properties to enforce the restrictions against group gatherings. Markets will only open three times per week.
Gatherings of more than 10 people have been banned. The wearing of masks in public areas is obligatory.
The Government has implemented a daily curfew from 18:00 to 06:00.
Failure to comply with the measures above would constitute a criminal offence and can lead to fines or community service. Check points exist along roads to enforce the above measures.
Pharmacies and health centres remain open.

Visas
The Government of Gabon has confirmed it will not penalise British nationals whose visas have expired while they are unable to leave the country due to the borders being closed. Immigration Police will not pursue you if this is your situation. You will be allowed to leave the country freely when able to, and this will not affect your chances of being granted a visa in the future.
