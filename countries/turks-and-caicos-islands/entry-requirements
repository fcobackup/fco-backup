Entry rules in response to coronavirus (COVID-19)
Entry to Turks and Caicos Islands
Anyone arriving to the Turks and Caicos Islands is required to obtain pre-travel authorisation via the Turks and Caicos Islands Assured Portal. From 14 January 2022, all travellers to Turks & Caicos aged 16 and above must be fully vaccinated and all travellers aged 2 and above (including those fully vaccinated) will be required to upload on to the TCI Assured Portal, one of the following professionally administered test results for entry to the TCI:
Reverse Transcription Polymerase Chain Reaction Tests result (RT-PCR);
Nucleic Acid Amplification test result (NAA);
RNA or molecular test results; or
an Antigen test result
Tests and results need to have been completed within three days of the date of arrival into Turks and Caicos.
You should not use the NHS testing service to get a test in order to facilitate your travel to another country. You should arrange to take a private test. All visitors will be required to wear masks on arrival to the Turks and Caicos Islands. More information on pre-travel authorisation to the Turks and Caicos Islands is available online.
Travellers are also required to provide proof of health/travel insurance with COVID-19 cover and a completed health screening questionnaire.
Demonstrating your COVID-19 status
All visitors aged 16 and above will need to provide evidence of full vaccination against COVID-19 on arrival to TCI.
Turks and Caicos Islands will accept the UK’s proof of COVID-19 recovery and vaccination record and proof of COVID-19 vaccination issued in the Crown Dependencies. Your final vaccine dose must have been administered at least 14 days prior to travel. Your NHS appointment card from vaccination centres is not designed to be used as proof of vaccination and should not be used to demonstrate your vaccine status.
Quarantine requirements
From 1 September 2021, any fully vaccinated tourist testing positive whilst in TCI must self-isolate at their own expense. The length of quarantine, minimum five (5) days, will be determined by the specific conditions of the individual and will be set out in a quarantine order issued at that time by Public Health. Close contacts of an individual who has tested positive for COVID-19 may also be required to quarantine. Further guidance on quarantine requirements for individuals who test positive to COVID-19, and their contacts, is available on the TCI Government website.
Any returning resident who is not fully vaccinated must submit a negative, pre-arrival Covid-19 test, and self-quarantine for a period of 7 days, including their household, and undergo a mandatory test (required to be negative) on day five 5 prior to being released.
Unvaccinated persons who test positive for COVID-19, along with their close contacts and household must self-quarantine for fourteen (14) days post the last exposure to Covid-19.

Customs regulations

Travelling with medicines or any controlled drugs must be accompanied by a doctor’s prescription. Keep all medication in original packaging to avoid confusion and questioning at ports of entry.
