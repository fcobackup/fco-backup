Trekking in Nepal
The Government of Nepal has announced that it will give foreign nationals permission to travel to Nepal for the purpose of mountaineering and trekking. You should liaise with your agency to establish documentation you will require, as this may change at short notice.
See Entry requirements for more information before you travel.
Never trek alone. Use a reputable agency, remain on established routes, and walk with at least one other person. From 1 April 2023 the Nepal Tourism Board (NTB) introduced a requirement that all solo or foreign independent trekkers (FITs) need to use a local guide or porter while trekking in Nepal’s national parks and protected areas. FITs are already required to obtain a trekkers information management system (TIMS) card before proceeding on treks in managed areas. Fines or removal from protected areas are possible for those ignoring these requirements. Check the Nepal Tourism Board website for further information or updates.
Always observe national park regulations and follow your guide’s instructions.
Altitude sickness is a risk in parts of Nepal, including on the Annapurna, Langtang and Everest Base Camp treks. More information about altitude sickness is available from TravelHealthPro (from the UK’s National Travel Health Network and Centre).
Accidents happen due to insufficient information, inappropriate equipment or overestimation of your own capabilities. Follow the advice given by local authorities and guides. Ignoring such advice could put yourselves and other mountain users in danger.
The following hazards exist throughout the year, especially above 3,000m:
sudden weather changes
avalanches and snow drifts
landslides and flooding
glacial crevasses and hollows
rockfall
thunder storms and lightning
altitude sickness
sun exposure
You should:
take note of weather forecasts and conditions
make sure you’re physically fit and have the necessary experience
be in a team of at least 2
inform someone of your plans
take warm clothes and wet weather gear
use sun block (SPF20 or higher) and sun glasses
Make sure your insurance covers you for your intended activity, including travel above 3,000m, mountain rescue services and helicopter costs.
The Trekking Agencies Association of Nepal (TAAN) provides live updates on trekking conditions in Nepal. Online weather forecasts are available on the website of the government of Nepal Department Of Hydrology and Meteorology.
Treks can take longer than expected. Flights across Nepal, particularly in high mountain areas, can be delayed due to poor weather conditions. Keep your tour operator, guide and family informed of your situation and travel plans. Flight cancelations are common, particularly in remote or popular trekking regions. These can lead to travellers having to extend stays at short notice. You should carry sufficient funds in case of such delays (particularly in remote areas, where ATMs may not be readily available and credit cards not accepted).
In remote areas, including long stretches of the Annapurna Circuit trek, mobile phone coverage and internet services are extremely limited. Consider renting a satellite phone.
A valid permit and Trekkers’ Information Management System (TIMS) card are needed to enter Nepal’s main trekking regions. See the Naturally Nepal website
Volunteering and adventure travel
If you’re planning to volunteer or undertake adventure travel in Nepal you should research any organisation or company you’re planning to use thoroughly before committing yourself. Read these information and advice pages on gap year travel and safer adventure travel and volunteering overseas.
The Social Welfare Council of the government of Nepal maintains a list of registered volunteer organisations; you can ask for a copy by sending an email to: info@swc.org.np.
The British Embassy has received reports of volunteer opportunities at orphanages which are profit orientated organisations rather than charities. If you’re volunteering at this type of organisation, you could be contributing to child exploitation. Contact the Nepali Central Child Welfare Board for confirmation before signing up to volunteer for one of these organisations.
Crime
There’s a low rate of serious crime in Nepal. However, you should take sensible precautions.
Watch out for pick-pockets and bag-snatching, particularly in airports, on buses and in areas popular with foreign nationals like Thamel, Sanepa and Kupondol in Kathmandu.
Take care when walking around at night. Assaults and robberies are more likely to occur in the evening in poorly lit areas. Avoid walking on your own and don’t carry large sums of cash. Keep valuables in a hotel safe if possible.
Sexual assaults against foreign nationals, particularly women, have been reported in tourist areas, including Thamel and Sanepa in Kathmandu. Be wary of accepting drinks from strangers, don’t leave drinks unattended and exercise caution, especially when alone after dark. See our advice page for women travelling abroad.
There were reports of some incidents in parts of Nepal of some foreign tourists being threatened or intimidated by locals, allegedly in relation to coronavirus. Such incidents are rare. If you experience such problems, you should return immediately to your accommodation (if safe), or to the local law enforcement agencies (phone 100), or contact the Embassy at +977 (0)1 423 7100.
Victims of crime should call the Tourist Police in Kathmandu on 01 4700750 or the Tourist Police headquarters on 01 4247041.
Road travel
Car and motorbike accidents are one of the biggest causes of injury and death overseas. If possible, avoid travelling at night. Always travel in a well-maintained vehicle with seatbelts. If you travel by motorbike, wear a helmet and proper footwear.
Road Traffic Accidents (RTAs) are a major cause of death and disability in Nepal. The causes range from overloading, negligence of drivers, mechanical failure, over-speeding, poor road conditions and an increasing number of unregulated private vehicles.
Road conditions are poor, especially during the monsoon season or in mountain areas. The 2015 earthquakes affected many roads and reconstruction work is still ongoing, making conditions worse.
If you’re travelling during monsoon season, see Natural disasters
Bus accidents are common in Nepal and there are a number of accidents resulting in fatalities every year. Buses are often overcrowded, poorly regulated, and poorly maintained. Speeding, low driving standards and poor road conditions contribute to the risk of accidents. Avoid travel on overnight buses. Don’t travel on overloaded or overcrowded buses. Tourist buses usually offer a higher standard of comfort and safety.
General driving standards are poor. Many drivers are not properly licensed, trained or insured and vehicles, including taxis, are often poorly maintained. There are few pavements outside central Kathmandu and motorists don’t yield right of way to pedestrians.
Other road users often ignore motorbikes and bicycles. It’s the law to wear a helmet when driving a motorbike. You should also wear a suitable helmet when riding as a passenger, and when riding a bicycle.
When travelling by road use well maintained vehicles, and ensure that you take frequent breaks.
If you’re planning to drive in Nepal, an International Driving Permit (IDP) is recommended. UK driving licence holders are not eligible to drive in Nepal without a Nepali driving licence or an IDP. There is no time limit for the use of IDPs in Nepal. You can get IDPs over the counter from many UK Post Offices. You will not be able to buy an IDP outside the UK, so get one before you travel. Carry your IDP with you at all times as well as any vehicle registration documents.
Air travel
Some major carriers fly to and from Nepal, connecting to major hubs. These flights may be oversubscribed, especially at peak times. You should liaise with your airline or travel provider for more information.
The Government of Nepal requires specific conditions of entry for all passengers originating from or transiting the UK. You can find more information in the Entry requirements section
Travellers should be aware that all Nepal-certified air carriers are included on the UK Air Safety List (ASL).
The UK Air Safety List identifies all known airlines in Nepal that do not meet international safety standards and are banned from operating commercial air services to, from, and within the UK. Check the UK Air Safety List when considering which airlines to fly with. The list is maintained by the Department for Transport, based on advice from the UK Civil Aviation Authority.
You should also check whether your tour operator has concerns about airlines in Nepal as a number of tour operators have decided to stop using certain airlines due to safety concerns. Specific safety concerns about Sita Air have led a number of tour operators to stop using them
