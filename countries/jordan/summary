The Foreign, Commonwealth & Development Office (FCDO) advice against all but essential international travel continues to apply for the whole of Jordan.
Additionally, if you’re already in Jordan you should be aware of our pre-existing advice within the country, unrelated to COVID-19:
The FCDO continues to advise against all but essential travel to:
Within 3km of Jordan’s border with Syria. See Border areas
Travel to Jordan is subject to entry restrictions
Jordan’s international airport reopened to scheduled flights on 10 September. Commercial flights are operating from a limited number of countries.
Passengers must register to travel on the Visit Jordan website and have PCR tests before departure and on arrival. Those who test positive will be allowed to self-isolate in their accommodation unless they are symptomatic. If symptomatic, passengers will be taken to designated COVID-19 hospitals for isolation and treatment if required.
Strict quarantine rules are in place depending on the country of origin. Passengers arriving from the green and yellow category countries are required to self-isolate for one week should their PCR test be negative. Arrivals from the red category countries are required to self-isolate for two weeks should their PCR test be negative. The UK is currently classified as ‘red’.
There are additional PCR testing requirements in place for travellers arriving in Jordan. Please check the requirements listed on the Visit Jordan website.
A total lockdown will be implemented in some areas in Amman, Zarqa and Mafraq starting Wednesday 7 October at 0600, for a period of seven days ending Wednesday 14 October at 06.00. See Travel in Jordan
From 12 am Friday 9 October, a weekend curfew will be in place across all governorates until 0600 Sunday 11 October. The weekend curfew will be in place for subsequent weekends until further notice. You should adhere to the curfew. You are not permitted to leave your accommodation during the curfew. See Travel in Jordan

During the COVID-19 pandemic, it is more important than ever to get travel insurance and check it provides sufficient cover. See the FCDO’s guidance on foreign travel insurance.
Around 95,800 British nationals visited Jordan in 2019. Most visits are trouble free.
The political situation in Jordan is stable. However, protests and demonstrations sometimes occur, and feelings are running higher because of the pandemic. The majority of demonstrations are peaceful, but you should take sensible precautions and avoid all political gatherings and demonstrations. Follow the advice of local authorities and stay informed of the security situation through the media and this travel advice.
Terrorists are very likely to try to carry out attacks in Jordan. There have been a number of incidents since 2016, some serious. Attacks could be indiscriminate including in places visited by foreigners, particularly hotels, shopping malls and tourist sites. You should take extra care, and in the event of an incident, follow the advice of the Jordanian authorities. See Terrorism
Local laws reflect the fact that Jordan is a predominantly Islamic country. You should respect local traditions, customs, laws and religions at all times and be aware of your actions to ensure that they don’t offend.
You can contact the emergency services by calling 911.
If you’re abroad and you need emergency help from the UK government, contact the nearest British embassy, consulate or high commission. Consular support is limited in the border areas of Jordan where the FCDO advise against all but essential travel, as set out above.
