Coronavirus (COVID-19) cases have been confirmed in Malaysia.
Entry and travel restrictions
The government of Malaysia has introduced a Movement Control Order that restricts the entry of foreign nationals until 1 April 2020. Under the terms of that Order, no foreign nationals can enter Malaysia except those with diplomatic passports, those who have Permanent Residence or those who are an “expatriate in an essential service”.
If you or your dependents have other visas, including working visas or “My Malaysia My Second Home” visas, these do not qualify for an exemption and you will not be permitted to enter. The government has published further clarifications setting out some exceptions at immigration, including for foreign national spouses of Malaysian citizens. However, this information has not necessarily been reflected in all guidance and we are aware of reports that airlines are refusing travel to those who do not meet the headline requirements in the main Order.
Anyone entering Malaysia is obliged to self-quarantine for 14 days. Anyone entering Sabah directly from overseas, either via land, sea or air, will automatically be sent to quarantine centres for 14 days. As of now, there are no restrictions on foreign nationals leaving Malaysia, though you will be subject to the same immigration restrictions if you wish to return while the Order remains in place. The Order is not preventing foreign nationals transiting or transferring within terminals at Kuala Lumpur International Airport (KLIA), but you cannot transfer between KLIA and KLIA2 (the terminal for budget airlines, including Air Asia) unless you meet the general immigration requirements above. We understand that foreign nationals may not travel between East Malaysia (Sabah and Sarawak) and West Malaysia, except to transit directly onto an international flight, but have reports that this is being intermittently enforced. You should confirm any transit arrangements with your airline.
The Malaysian government does not require foreign nationals to leave Malaysia. However, the Movement Control Order requires non-essential businesses to restrict or cease operations. Essential services, including supermarkets and basic amenities are still functioning. Hotels and guesthouses have also been designated as essential services and directed by the Ministry of Tourism that they can accept new bookings from foreign (though not Malaysian) tourists, but many hotels are closing or already closed to new arrivals. Those accommodated in hotels are offered room service only and in some cases are being required to remain in their rooms. Flights could be subject to short-notice cancellations. Some airlines, including British Airways, have already stopped operating flights out of Malaysia and more could follow in the coming days. Further controls on travel within Malaysia may be imposed at short notice. Visitors to Malaysia should plan accordingly, taking account of the fast moving situation and your individual circumstances.
If you must travel to Malaysia for essential purposes, check the latest information with your airline and keep up to date with developments, including this travel advice.
