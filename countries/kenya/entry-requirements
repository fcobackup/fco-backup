This page has information on travelling to Kenya. Check what you must do to return to the UK.
This page reflects the UK government’s understanding of current rules for people travelling on a full ‘British Citizen’ passport from the UK, for the most common types of travel.
The authorities in Kenya set and enforce entry rules.
All travellers
All passengers over 18 arriving in Kenya must present proof of vaccination against COVID19. Vaccinated travellers are not required to take a PCR test before travelling to Kenya.
You must upload your vaccine certificate to the Global Haven website before boarding your flight.
See Exemptions below for more information for unvaccinated travellers.
Unvaccinated travellers who meet the criteria for an exemption from presenting proof of vaccination will need to present a negative COVID-19 PCR test certificate, conducted within 72 hours of your departure, to enter or travel through Kenya. You must upload your negative PCR test certificate to the Global Haven website before boarding your flight.
Unvaccinated travellers may also be asked to take a rapid antigen test on arrival. These tests will cost 30 USD. Anyone who tests positive may be asked to take a PCR test at a cost of 50 USD. Passengers aged under 5 are exempt from these requirements.
You must also fill in a traveller’s locator form before travel on the Kenyan Ministry of Health web portal. On arrival, you will be prompted and required to submit daily health information on the Jitenge platform for 14 consecutive days.
If you have been in, or transited through, South Africa, Botswana, Zimbabwe, Malawi, Eswatini, Lesotho, Namibia, Mozambique, Zambia, Malawi, Ghana or Nigeria in the past 14 days, you may be required to take a free rapid antigen test on arrival for surveillance purposes.
Full details of the Government of Kenya’s entry requirements in relation to coronavirus can be found on the Kenya Civil Aviation Authority website.
Data collection
All travellers arriving in Kenya must complete a COVID-19 Travellers Health Surveillance Form before their arrival, even if only transiting. The online registration form can be found on the “Jitenge” platform, accessible via the following link or the “Jitenge” App (available on the Google Play Store).
After submitting the form, travellers will receive a QR code which must be presented to port health officials for them to be allowed to proceed to arrival immigration.
If you’re fully vaccinated
Most adults require a full dose of a COVID vaccine to enter Kenya.
The vaccine must be approved by the World Health Organisation.
Proof of vaccination status
You must present proof that you have been fully vaccinated to enter Kenya.
Kenya will accept the UK’s proof of COVID-19 recovery and vaccination record and proof of COVID-19 vaccination issued in the Crown Dependencies. Your NHS appointment card from vaccination centres is not designed to be used as proof of vaccination and should not be used to demonstrate your vaccine status.
You must also upload your certificate of vaccination to the Global Haven website.
Some airlines may request that British travellers show proof of vaccination on the NHS App at check-in.
If you’re not fully vaccinated
Most unvaccinated individuals cannot enter Kenya, however there are several exemptions. See Exemptions below for more information.
If you’ve had COVID-19 in the past 90 days
If you have tested positive for COVID-19 in the last 90 days, you can enter Kenya without a vaccination. You must provide a letter from a medical practitioner confirming your recovery from COVID-19. You will still need to provide a negative COVID-19 PCR certificate, conducted within 72 hours of your departure to Kenya.
If you have a medical exemption from vaccination
If you have a medical exemption from vaccination, you can enter Kenya with a letter from a medical practitioner confirming your exemption from COVID-19 vaccination. You will still need to provide a negative COVID-19 PCR certificate, conducted within 72 hours of your departure to Kenya.
If you are aged under 18
Children and young people
Children aged 4 and under do not need a negative PCR test to enter Kenya.
Children aged 17 and under do not require a COVID-19 vaccination to enter Kenya.
Exemptions
Crew on layover do not need a negative PCR test to enter Kenya.
Check your passport and travel documents before you travel
Passport validity
If you are visiting Kenya, your passport should be valid for 6 months from the date you arrive.
You should have at least two blank pages in your passport on arrival.
Check with your travel provider to make sure your passport and other travel documents meet their requirements.
Visas
You need a visa to enter Kenya. Kenyan entry visas are exclusively issued electronically, with passengers required to obtain their e-visas before departure. You can apply for single entry and transit visas on the e-visas website.
British passport holders visiting Kenya aged 16 and over require a valid individual visa for Kenya.
For more information, see the website of the Kenyan High Commission in London.
Work permits
You must have a work permit before starting employment in Kenya. It’s illegal to work without one. This needs to be applied for before coming to Kenya to work. This also applies to voluntary work and the self-employed. You can apply for a work permit at the Department of Immigration Services website. The government of Kenya has promised swift action against those who do not comply, including deportation. The Government of Kenya is prioritising the availability of high quality jobs for Kenyan nationals, and may not grant a work permit to a British national if the job in question could be done by a Kenyan national.
If you’re already in Kenya, and your application for a work permit is successful, you will be required to hand in your passport to immigration for a permit stamp to be inserted. During this period, you should always carry a certified copy of your passport for identification purposes. A local lawyer can provide this.
Yellow fever certificate requirements
You may need a yellow fever certificate when entering Kenya from certain destinations. Check whether you need a yellow fever certificate by visiting the National Travel Health Network and Centre’s TravelHealthPro website.
UK Emergency Travel Documents
UK Emergency Travel Documents (ETDs) are accepted for entry, transit and exit from Kenya. ETDs must be valid for at least six months.
Returning to the UK
If you are 18 or over, you will be required to show proof of a COVID-19 vaccination to leave Kenya, unless you have a letter from a medical practitioner confirming your exemption from COVID-19 vaccination. The vaccine must be approved by the World Health Organisation.
You will also be required to show compliance with entry requirements for the UK and any transit countries.
You can use the UK’s proof of COVID-19 recovery and vaccination record to demonstrate your vaccination record when leaving Kenya.
