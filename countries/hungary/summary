The Foreign, Commonwealth & Development Office (FCDO) advise against all but essential travel to:
The whole of Hungary based on the current assessment of COVID-19 risks
Strict border controls remain in place (see Entry requirements).
If you are returning to the UK from Hungary you will need to self-isolate on your return (unless you are exempt). Check the latest guidance for England, Northern Ireland, Scotland and Wales.
Travel is subject to entry restrictions
Most UK nationals are not allowed to enter Hungary. Residents may enter if they hold a permanent residence permit or a permit allowing them to stay in Hungary for at least 90 days, and can present their documents to the authorities at the border. UK nationals travelling with a family member who is a Hungarian citizen or resident should also be allowed entry.
Persons in possession of issued Immunity Certificates issued by the Hungarian authorities may enter Hungary without facing COVID-19 restrictions and with no mandatory quarantine.
UK nationals may also enter Hungary to attend sporting or cultural events, carry out business activity or for the purposes of transit. Otherwise, entry without a Hungarian Immunity Certificate is limited to narrow circumstances, such as operating cargo transport or travelling on a diplomatic or official passport.
It is also possible to apply – before travelling - for an exemption to enter Hungary in a further set of specific circumstances, such as attending a funeral.
See Entry requirements for more information before you plan to travel.

Some 700,000 British nationals visit Hungary each year (pre-COVID-19 data).
If you’re living in or moving to Hungary, read the Living in Hungary guide in addition to this travel advice.
There are occasional political demonstrations in Budapest and elsewhere in the country. Some take place on or close to important national holidays with a political relevance, such as 15 March (anniversary of 1848 Revolution) and 23 October (anniversary of 1956 anti-Soviet Uprising). Peaceful political demonstrations have occasionally ended in violence. You should avoid all political demonstrations, monitor the media coverage of local events and be aware of your surroundings at all times.
Although there’s no recent history of terrorism in Hungary, attacks can’t be ruled out. See Terrorism
If you’re abroad and you need emergency help from the UK government, contact the nearest British embassy, consulate or high commission.
