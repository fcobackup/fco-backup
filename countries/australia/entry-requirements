This page reflects the UK government’s understanding of current rules for people travelling on a full ‘British Citizen’ passport, for the most common types of travel.
The authorities in Australia set and enforce entry rules. For further information contact the embassy, high commission or consulate of the country or territory you’re travelling to. You should also consider checking with your transport provider or travel company to make sure your passport and other travel documents meet their requirements.
Entry and departure rules in response to coronavirus (COVID-19)
Entry to Australia
For full details on entering Australia, please refer to the Australian Government Department of Home Affairs website.
To enter Australia you must hold a valid visa. See ‘Visas during COVID-19’ below for more information.
From 21 February 2022, all fully vaccinated visa holders can travel to Australia without a travel exemption. You can check the Australian Government’s definition of ‘fully vaccinated’ for travel on the Australian Department of Home Affairs website.
Unvaccinated visa holders will still need a valid travel exemption to enter Australia. Exemption applications can be submitted online on the Australian Department of Home Affairs website.
You should check the steps you should take to prepare to travel to Australia from overseas. A negative COVID-19 test is required for travelling to Australia. This can be in the form of evidence of a negative COVID-19 PCR test taken within 3 days of scheduled departure, or evidence of a negative Rapid Antigen Test taken under medical supervision within 24 hours before scheduled departure. If your flight is delayed, you will be considered to meet pre-testing requirements. If your flight is rescheduled or cancelled, you may need to take another COVID-19 test.
If you are a fully vaccinated traveller, you will be required to provide proof of COVID-19 vaccination. If you were vaccinated outside of Australia, you can check the requirements for foreign vaccine certificates. If you were vaccinated in Australia, you should use an International COVID-19 Vaccine Certificate (ICVC) generated by Services Australia.
All travellers to Australia are required to submit a Digital Passenger Declaration within 72 hours before departure. The Digital Passenger Declaration includes a declaration regarding your COVID-19 vaccination status and pre-departure test result. You may be asked to provide evidence you have completed your Digital Passenger Declaration when boarding your flight to Australia.
States and territories can apply their own travel restrictions. You should check requirements for the state or territory in which you will arrive. Border rules, including eligibility criteria, can change quickly. Travellers should prepare for disruptions to their plans.
Quarantine requirements
Each state and territory is responsible for determining and managing quarantine requirements. You should check requirements for the state or territory in which you will arrive.
Travellers will need to comply with the quarantine requirements in the state or territory of arrival before travelling on to another state or territory.
Testing/Screening on arrival
Travellers arriving in Australia may need to undergo enhanced health screening on arrival. This can include temperature testing. You may also be asked to undergo screening or testing in quarantine.
You can also check the website of the airport where you will arrive for further measures.
Transiting Australia
For full details on transiting Australia, please refer to the Australian Government Department of Home Affairs website.
British nationals are eligible to transit through Australia for a maximum of 8 hours without a visa. If you wish to transit without a visa, you must remain airside and you will not be able to clear immigration, including to collect baggage which should have been checked through to your final destination. You can check information from the Department of Home Affairs on transiting without a visa. If you are not eligible to transit without a visa, for example if your transit time is longer than 8 hours, you will need to apply for and obtain a visa before travelling to Australia.
If you plan to transit Australia, check the latest entry restrictions for your destination and keep in touch with your airline, cruise line or tour operator before you travel.
Visas during COVID-19
According to the Australian Department of Home Affairs, there may be disruptions to visa processing arrangements during the COVID-19 pandemic. You can review global visa processing times on the Department of Home Affairs website.
If you’re unable to leave Australia and your visa is nearing expiry or has expired already, you should contact the Australian Department of Home Affairs as soon as possible. Australia does not issue visa extensions so you will need to apply for a new visa to remain lawful in Australia, and provide relevant supporting documentation. If your visa is expiring or has expired, you can follow the advice from the Department of Home Affairs.
You can find more information about visas for Australia, including visa options that may suit your needs, on the Department of Home Affairs website.
Leaving Australia
For full details on leaving Australia, please refer to the Australian Government Department of Home Affairs website.
Fully vaccinated Australian citizens and permanent residents no longer require an exemption to depart Australia. Australian citizens and permanent residents who are unvaccinated (apart from those under 12 and those who cannot be vaccinated for medical reasons) must apply for an exemption to depart Australia.
Temporary visa holders, regardless of COVID-19 vaccination status, do not need an exemption to depart Australia. As of 21 February, fully vaccinated visa holders will be able to enter Australia without obtaining an exemption. See ‘Entry to Australia’
Regular entry requirements
Visas
Subject to current restrictions, British citizens can usually get the following types of electronic visitor visa:
eVisitor visa direct from the Department of Home Affairs. There is no visa application charge or service fee for this
Electronic Travel Authority (ETA) via your travel agent or airline. There is no visa application charge, but a service fee of A$20 applies
Information on all other types of visa is available from the Department of Home Affairs, or from the Australian High Commission in London.
If you hold an ePassport you can use SmartGate to pass through passport control when arriving in Australia. See the Australian Border Force website for more information.
Working holiday visa
If you’re on a working holiday visa you should be aware of your rights as an employee in Australia and how to report any concerns about unfair or unlawful treatment.
Thousands of British working holiday makers travel to Australia each year with the vast majority enjoying their stay without issue. Working conditions, accommodation and medical facilities are generally of a good standard.
In October 2016 the Fair Work Ombudsman published a report following an inquiry into the wages and conditions of people working under the working holiday visa program, which highlighted exploitative workplace cultures where unreasonable and unlawful requirements were being imposed in some isolated and remote workplaces. If you have concerns about your workplace conditions or treatment you can contact the Fair Work Ombudsman on 13 13 94. You can also report concerns to them anonymously.
If you feel you’re being treated unfairly or unlawfully by an employer, you can email the UK’s National Crime Agency (NCA) at the British High Commission in Canberra at: Australia.WHVreferrals@fcdo.gov.uk. The NCA is working with a number of Australian authorities to help identify and address any illegal employer behaviour affecting British nationals.
For further information and advice, see our working holiday makers booklet.
Passport validity
For entry into Australia, your passport should be valid for the proposed duration of your stay. No additional period of validity beyond this is needed.
If you’re transiting another country on your way to or from Australia, make sure you check the entry requirements for that country. Many countries will only permit entry if you have at least 6 months validity remaining on your passport.
UK Emergency Travel Documents
UK Emergency Travel Documents are valid for entry into, transit through, and exit from Australia.
Dual nationals
If you’re a British national living in Australia with Australian citizenship, or you’re a dual national, you should leave and enter Australia on your Australian passport, otherwise you may face difficulties and delays. For more information, see the Department of Foreign Affairs & Trade’s website. Please see the Coronavirus page for more information on current restrictions on dual nationals leaving Australia.
Yellow fever certificate requirements
