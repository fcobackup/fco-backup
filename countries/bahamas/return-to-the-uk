There are currently extremely limited commercial options available to return to the UK from The Bahamas. Due to the travel restrictions there are no direct flights to the UK or Europe. Severely limited options may be possible via other destinations such as the US, but you should refer to those countries’ restrictions before travelling to ensure that you will be allowed to enter the country for onward connection. Travellers should contact their airlines, travel agents and tour operators for advice. The US Embassy are advising that the last flight departures to the US are imminent.
The restrictions on movement also apply to maritime travel. Inter-island travel is banned. Foreign pleasure craft currently anchored or moored in The Bahamas are only allowed to travel to leave Bahamian waters and return home. For those wishing to leave the Bahamas the Association of Bahamas Marinas can provide further advice and a list of marinas helping boaters. Their facebook page is https://www.facebook.com/groups/bahamlandsea. For those wishing to remain on board their vessels, the Bahamian government has not yet published guidance and we are seeking further detail. We have been assured that resupply and refuelling is allowed. Conditions may vary across the islands on The Bahamas.
Bahamian flagged cruise lines are able to have safe anchor in The Bahamas but are not allowed to disembark passengers or crew. Each cruise line is making individual plans for their ships. Crew and staff should contact their cruise company for updates and information on those plans. The Foreign Office have a dedicated team liaising with the Department for Transport and the cruise lines on their plans for crew and other staff. They can be contacted at fcocorrespondence@fco.gov.uk. Or please call 020 7008 1500 option 1 for serious health or other emergency consular assistance.
Future options
The UK operated a special flight from Nassau on Tuesday 7 April for British tourists, short term visitors and their direct dependants to return to the UK.
Further special flights of this kind are not planned. The British High Commission Nassau is in contact with airlines, the Bahamian authorities and other governments to make sure commercial options for returning to the UK are available as soon as possible.
You will need to pay for your return travel to the UK. If departure options are available but you cannot afford the travel costs and have exhausted all other options for getting funds, you may be eligible to apply for an emergency loan from the government. This is a last resort option and you would need to repay the loan when you are back in the UK. For more information, you should contact Corporate Travel Management (CTM). CTM are a commercial partner of the FCO and are authorised to administer such loans on behalf of the FCO.
If you cannot leave The Bahamas at this time, you should:
follow the advice of local authorities, including local measures to help minimise your risk of exposure to coronavirus
find accommodation that’s suitable for your needs
keep in regular contact with family and friends at home, so they know you are safe and well
See more information and advice about staying where you are if you cannot return to the UK.
Arrival in the UK
When you arrive back in the UK, follow the guidance for when you return to the UK on steps you should take to protect yourself and others.
