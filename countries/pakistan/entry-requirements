Entry rules in response to coronavirus (COVID-19)
Entry to Pakistan
The Pakistani authorities have closed land borders with Afghanistan, India and Iran. Despite this, there are ongoing limited border openings for repatriation and trade. Those crossing into Pakistan may have to comply with coronavirus testing and quarantine measures. The FCDO currently advises against travel to the most of the Afghanistan and Iran border areas. See Summary.
Since 20 June, airlines have been able to operate inbound and outbound commercial international flights from all airports apart from Gwadar and Turbat.
Reinforcement of screening and administrative measures at all sea ports has been announced.
Screening and isolation on arrival
International air passengers travelling to Pakistan will be subject to thermal screening on arrival. The current Pakistan Civil Aviation Authority (CAA) guidelines require all passengers arriving in Pakistan to submit a health declaration form which will be made available on your flight or upon arrival at the airport. You will also be subject to thermal screening for high temperatures. If you do not have any COVID-19 symptoms you will be allowed to proceed through the airport and will be given instructions to self-isolate at your residence for 14 days.
If you do have symptoms of COVID-19 including fever, cough, breathing difficulty, you may be taken to a facility for a swab test, where you will be asked to wait for the results of the test. If the test is positive, you will receive advice about next steps including possible self-isolation for 14 days at your residence or transfer to a hospital. If the test is negative you will be allowed to go to your residence with instructions to self-isolate for 14 days.
Call the British High Commission on 051 201 2000 in the event that you are moved to a testing facility. Before travelling, make sure you have a form of payment for food and water during this quarantine and testing period.
You may also be required to follow special measures before boarding flights to Pakistan and while on board the aircraft, including the wearing of a face mask. Reinforcement of screening and administrative measures at all sea ports has been announced.
Screening on departure
If you are leaving Pakistan, you will be screened at the airport for any symptoms of Covid-19. You will also be subject to thermal screening for high temperatures. If you are free from symptoms you will be allowed to travel. If you are suspected of having symptoms of Covid-19, including fever, cough and breathing difficulty, you will be subject to a secondary screening by a medical professional. After which, you may be allowed to board if it is assessed that you do not have symptoms, have not been at risk of exposure and do not have a fever. If the secondary screening assesses that you may have Covid-19 you may be asked to self-isolate for 14 days before you can travel. You may also be referred to a medical facility.
