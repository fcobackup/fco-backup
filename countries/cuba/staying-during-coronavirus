Measures for tourists
Tourists staying in hotels will be confined to those hotels. You cannot leave the hotel unless there are essential reasons, e.g. to get money, go to the clinic, go to the airport (only when flights resume). All excursions are suspended. A medic will visit the hotel twice per day. As the number of guests in hotels reduces, hotels will close and the guests will be moved into one hotel.
Tourists can only stay in authorised casas particulars (private houses), and must stay in the house until they are moved to government hotels. The government will cover the transport. The cost of the hotel may not be the same as the private house.
Tourists who did not leave on the scheduled commercial flights (last one on 1 April 2020) will have to stay in a designated hotel until the Government of Cuba reviews the measures.
All discos, nightclubs, gymnasiums, etc (government or private owned for public access, and in hotels) will be closed.
Restaurants and bars will be restricting services; only delivery or take away services will be allowed unless exceptions are made.
Camp sites will be closed.
Tourists can only move around for essential trips and in officially authorised and licensed transport, e.g. yellow taxis to go to a clinic.Tourists can no longer rent cars.
Local measures
Areas of Havana have been designated as quarantine areas to combat further spread of coronavirus. A number of districts in the Provinces of Camagüey. Holguin, Matanzas, Ciego de Avila, Pinar del Rio and Isla de la Juventud are also in quarantine. It could happen elsewhere.
In these areas, a limited number of people will be given permission to leave and return, e.g. people in essential jobs. There will be designated entry and exit points. Everyone leaving will be tested for coronavirus. No traffic will be allowed in other than essential services and supplies organised by the authorities.
Transport between provinces has been suspended. Urban transport services have been limited from 11 April to essential services and fewer people will be allowed to travel in a bus or car. Private taxi services will be suspended.
Wearing masks in public places is compulsory, including in vehicles.
People in queues must maintain a minimum of distance of one metre between them.
There will be an increased police presence in the streets and shops, to monitor that people are following the measures.
If you have dual British and Cuban nationality, you are subject to Cuban measures and should check your immigration status to clarify if you can leave Cuba while current travel restrictions are in place (and when flights resume). If you need permission to leave, you should get this from the immigration office in Havana; permission cannot be given at the airport.
Visas
During the period of special Cuban government measures, visa extension requirements have been suspended. If you are still in Cuba and your visa has expired or will expire while flights are suspended, you can ask the hotel management to help you to enquire with the local immigration office (there is one in each municipality).
