If you plan to pass through another country to return to the UK, check the travel advice for the country you’re transiting.
Be prepared for your plans to change
No travel is risk-free during COVID. Countries may further restrict travel or bring in new rules at short notice, for example due to a new COVID-19 variant. Check with your travel company or airline for any transport changes which may delay your journey home.
If you test positive for COVID-19 in France and you’re fully vaccinated (including a booster) or if you’ve had COVID-19 in the last 4 months, you must self-isolate for 7 days from the day on which you first develop symptoms, or 7 days from the date of the positive test result. Self-isolation can be reduced to 5 days if you take a negative PCR or antigen test (supervised, not self-administered) on day 5 and you have not displayed any symptoms over the previous 48 hours. These isolation rules also apply to children under the age of 12, regardless of their vaccination status.
If you’re unvaccinated or partially vaccinated and you haven’t had COVID-19 in the last 4 months, you must self-isolate for 10 days from the day on which you first develop symptoms, or 10 days from the date of the positive test result. Self-isolation can be reduced to 7 days if you take a negative PCR or antigen test (supervised, not self-administered) on day 7 and you have not displayed any symptoms over the previous 48 hours.
You will have to extend your stay until the end of your isolation period. This could be in your current accommodation. The French authorities do not provide or pay for quarantine accommodation.
Further information is available on the TousAntiCovid application. The French health ministry also operates a dedicated coronavirus helpline on +33 (0)800 130 000.
Plan ahead and make sure you:
can access money
understand what your insurance will cover
can make arrangements to extend your stay and be away for longer than planned
Travel in France
From Monday 16 May, wearing masks on public transport is no longer compulsory, although some towns and cities may require mask wearing on public transport. You should check local mask rules before you travel. Wearing masks on public transport remains recommended, especially for vulnerable people.
Some travel operators such as airlines may specify types of masks to be worn on board e.g. surgical masks, and may encourage you to take spares for long journeys. Please check with your travel operator before travelling.
There are no internal travel restrictions in France; however, measures may change at short notice either at national or at local level. You should visit the French Government Coronavirus Information page or use the ‘TousAntiCovid’ digital app for further information and to stay up to date on restrictions
Public spaces and services
Face masks are mandatory in all health establishments (hospitals, clinics, retirement homes, nursing homes and assisted living, as well as establishments for people with disabilities).
Pass sanitaire (health pass)
The pass sanitaire is currently required to access the following places:
Hospitals, clinics, social/medical health care establishments
Retirement homes, nursing homes, independent and assisted-living residences
Establishments for people with disabilities
You can find more information on requirements and how to access the “pass sanitaire” from the French Government.
You can get the pass sanitaire by fulfilling one of the following three criteria:
A vaccination certificate (see details on proof of vaccination below), or
A negative PCR or antigen result from a test taken within the last 24 hours, or
A document (dated more than 11 days ago and less than six months ago) proving you have recently recovered from COVID.
Children under 12 are exempt from ‘pass sanitaire’ requirements.
Proof of vaccination
The French Government recognises vaccination certificates that conform to EU norms. This means:
7 days after a third dose of Oxford/AstraZeneca, Pfizer/BioNTech, Moderna, and Novavax for domestic use (to obtain a valid “health pass”), or
28 days after a second dose of Johnson & Johnson, or
7 days after a second injection for those able to demonstrate they have already been infected (this only applies to those vaccinated in France) for domestic use (to obtain a valid “vaccine pass”)
Since 15 February 2022, anyone aged over 18 years and 1 month needs to have received a booster dose within 4 months of the initial course (or after infection for those vaccinated in France) to be considered fully vaccinated for domestic purposes (i.e. to use the pass sanitaire). If the pass deactivates because you have not received a booster within 4 months of the initial course, you can reactivate it by receiving a booster dose.
France will accept the UK’s proof of COVID-19 recovery and vaccination record. Your NHS appointment card from vaccination centres is not designed to be used as proof of vaccination and should not be used to demonstrate your vaccine status.
Those vaccinated in England, Wales, Scotland and Northern Ireland can also choose to scan and save the NHS QR code into France’s “TousAntiCovid” app.
More information on how to obtain a certificate/QR code is available, if vaccinated in Northern Ireland and if vaccinated in Scotland.
Healthcare in France
The French Government advises those with possible coronavirus symptoms to call 112. You should not go directly to the doctor or emergency services.
Your emotional and mental wellbeing is important. Read guidance on how to look after your mental wellbeing and mental health

COVID-19 testing in France
If you have a prescription from a French medical practitioner or are identified as having been in contact with someone who has a confirmed COVID-19 diagnosis, supervised COVID-19 tests remain free as long as you present a valid UK European Health Insurance Card (EHIC) or the new UK Global Health Insurance Card (GHIC). Travellers outside these circumstances will need to pay for a COVID-19 test. The minimum cost of supervised COVID-19 tests in France is €44 for PCR tests and €22 for rapid antigen tests. Self-administered rapid antigen tests can be purchased from pharmacies. The process for accessing these tests in France is via a list of places available from the French government website.
COVID-19 Vaccines if you live in France
Wherever possible British nationals should aim to be vaccinated in the country where they live. We will update this page when the French Government announces new information on the national vaccination programme. You can sign up to get email notifications when this page is updated.
The France national vaccination programme started in December 2020 and is using the AstraZeneca, Janssen (Johnson and Johnson), Pfizer-BioNTech and Moderna vaccines. The French Government have said that residents of France, regardless of their nationality, will have access to the vaccine in France.
The French authorities have issued guidance on how to get a vaccination in France including details of how to book an appointment (only available in French) and which groups are currently being offered the vaccine. Further information on COVID-19 vaccinations in France can be found on the French Government’s coronavirus information website and on their frequently asked questions page.
Find out more, including about vaccines that are authorised in the UK or approved by the World Health Organisation, on the COVID-19 vaccines if you live abroad.
If you’re a British national living in France, you should seek medical advice from your local healthcare provider. Information about COVID-19 vaccines used in the national programme where you live, including regulatory status, should be available from local authorities.
How to obtain a French ‘pass sanitaire’
If you receive your COVID-19 vaccination in France, you can obtain a French ‘pass sanitaire (which is a version of the EU Digital Covid Certificate) in order to travel internationally. To do so, you should scan the QR code on your paper vaccine certification via the French app TousAntiCovid. Once scanned, TousAntiCovid will save your certification in the ‘wallets’ section of the app, allowing you to present it at the border when you travel. The Certificate proves that you have been vaccinated, received a negative test result, or recovered from COVID-19. It will help facilitate your travel within the EU and, in some countries, you can use it to demonstrate your COVID-19 status to businesses and other organisations. For further information visit the French government’s website on the “pass sanitaire”.
