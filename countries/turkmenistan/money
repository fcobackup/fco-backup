Read what you can and cannot do

Turkmenistan remains largely a cash-based society. You should carry cash and pay in the national currency, although some larger hotels accept US dollars. There are only a limited number of international ATMs in Ashgabat (see list below) and there’s a 3% withdrawal charge for each transaction. Visa and MasterCard are the only cards currently accepted and only at some larger hotels, but even they can be used only at some larger hotels and a limited number of shops. ATMs sometimes run out of Manats and are not replenished until banks have the available stocks.
List of ATMs in Ashgabat:
the State Bank for Foreign Economic Affairs, 32 Garashsyzlyk st.
22 Asudalyk st. (near Magtymguly monument)
Berkarar Mall, near the entrance to the Kamil supermarket on the ground floor
Ashgabat airport, in the arrival hall
Nusay, Ak Altyn and Yyldyz Hotels
US Dollars and Euros can be easily exchanged into the local currency (Manat) at banks and Bureaux de Change. As Manat can’t be re-converted into hard currency, convert only as much as you need. Bring new or clean notes in low denominations as damaged or marked notes are often refused even by official travel exchange offices. Other currencies are difficult to exchange.
Foreigners will be expected to pay for hotels and hotel services in dollars if not using credit cards, but all other payments in Turkmenistan need to be made in cash in local currency. Some shopping outlets and taxis might also request dollar payments but caution is recommended as strict controls and harsh penalties are being applied to those who are caught.
Currency regulations are also liable to sudden and unannounced change.
