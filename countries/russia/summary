Following the nerve agent attack in Salisbury on 4 March 2018, there are heightened political tensions between the UK and Russia.

Consular support is severely limited in parts of Russia due to the security situation. The North Caucasus remains an unstable and potentially dangerous region. The Russian authorities take a particularly strict attitude towards security, as well as compliance with visa and registration rules. Short-term travel restrictions are sometimes applied in relation to ongoing security operations. These are publicised at very short notice, if at all. Cross-border traffic with Georgia and Azerbaijan is also subject to restrictions. See Local travel.
If you’re abroad and you need emergency help from the UK government, contact the nearest British embassy, consulate or high commission.
You can contact the emergency services by calling 112.
