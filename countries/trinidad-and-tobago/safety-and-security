Terrorism in Trinidad and Tobago
Terrorist attacks in Trinidad and Tobago cannot be ruled out.
Attacks could be indiscriminate including in places visited by foreign nationals. Stay aware of your surroundings, keep up to date with local media reports and follow the advice of local authorities.  
Violent crime and assault
In Trinidad and Tobago, there is a high level of violent crime, including gang-related attacks and shootings. Instances of homicides and armed robberies are rising.

Protecting yourself and your belongings 
Criminals may carry out attacks, ranging from the threat of violence to sexual assault and robbery, kidnapping for ransom, rape and murder. A significant portion of violent crime in Trinidad and Tobago is gang-related. You can take precautions against being targeted: 
always be alert to your surroundings - do not wear headphones when out and about 
avoid walking or hiking alone, deserted beaches or isolated areas
avoid walking at night 
avoid poorly lit or quiet areas of streets or parks 
consider removing expensive jewellery 
keep money, valuables and passports somewhere safe 
park in well-lit areas 
never leave anything in an unattended vehicle 
do not leave bags, purses, handbags, laptops and phones exposed on the seat of a moving vehicle - there have been incidents of items being snatched through car windows 
be careful when withdrawing cash from ATMs or changing money - use well-lit ATMs, withdraw small amounts only and preferably during daylight hours 
keep an eye on your card when making purchases to avoid card skimming 
if you’re staying in a villa, especially in an isolated area, make sure it has adequate security, including external security lighting, grills and overnight security guards 
be cautious about what you post online - social media platforms are increasingly being monitored by criminals 
if you’re attacked or robbed, don’t resist - criminals are often armed, and you can be seriously injured or killed 
if you’re the victim of a violent crime, especially rape, get urgent medical help
Carnival and other large-scale events 
Robberies and opportunistic crime may occur during the carnival period.  If you are attending a large-scale event, such as the Carnival celebrations in Trinidad, you should take sensible precautions and always be aware of your surroundings. Avoid displaying jewellery or valuable items that may attract attention of criminals. Practice caution at crowded events and have a clear plan to return home safely after attending any events.
Drink spiking
Avoid accepting drinks from anyone you do not know, and do not leave drinks unattended.
Laws and cultural differences
Laws on clothing
It is an offence for anyone, including children, to dress in camouflage clothing or bring any into the country.  
Illegal drugs penalties
Trinidad and Tobago has decriminalised the possession of up to 30g of cannabis or up to 5g of cannabis resin. However, you’re not allowed to smoke cannabis in public spaces or while operating a vehicle.
If you are stopped with these amounts, you can be fined up to  50,000 Trinidad and Tobago dollars. For larger quantities there are more hefty fines and possible imprisonment. There are also severe penalties for other drug-related offences.
LGBT+ travellers
In March 2025, consensual same-sex activity was reinstated as a crime punishable by up to 5 imprisonment. It is also illegal for LGBT+ foreign nationals to enter the country. However, neither of these laws has been enforced in recent times. It is possible LGBT+ visitors could receive negative attention if they show affection in public. 
Take care when using dating apps especially those used by the LGBT+ community. Criminals have used apps like Grindr to trick, rob and assault people.
