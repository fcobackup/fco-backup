The information on this page covers the most common types of travel and reflects the UK government’s understanding of the rules currently in place. Unless otherwise stated, this information is for travellers using a full ‘British Citizen’ passport.
The authorities in the country or territory you’re travelling to are responsible for setting and enforcing the rules for entry. If you’re unclear about any aspect of the entry requirements, or you need further reassurance, you’ll need to contact the embassy, high commission or consulate of the country or territory you’re travelling to.
You should also consider checking with your transport provider or travel company to make sure your passport and other travel documents meet their requirements.
Restrictions in response to coronavirus
Border controls
Since 20 March 2020 entry to France has been limited to those transiting through France, returning French nationals and permanent residents, and a small number of essential travel categories. In order to enter France you will need to complete an international travel certificate, which certifies that your journey is essential and confirms that you have not been suffering from a set of listed symptoms associated with Covid-19. This travel certificate is available on the French Ministry of the Interior’s website. If entering France from the UK, EU, Andorra, Holy See, Iceland, Lichtenstein, Monaco, Norway or Switzerland you will need to complete the travel certificate (also available in English) under “Attestation de déplacement dérogatoire vers la France métropolitaine depuis: l’Union Européenne et Andorre, Islande, Liechtenstein, Monaco, Norvège, Saint-Marin, Suisse, Royaume-Uni, Vatican”. If entering France from other locations or travelling to French overseas territories you will need to fill in tailored versions of the international travel certificate, accessible on the same webpage.
The international travel certificate needs to be produced for entry, along with any supporting paperwork to substantiate the essential nature of your travel. If you are entering or transiting through France, depending on your circumstances, you also need to have:
a travel certificate if travelling in Île-de-France (Greater Paris) on public transport at peak hours (from 06h30 to 09h30 and from 16h00 to 19h00)
From 25 May a voluntary 14 day self-quarantine will apply to those arriving in France from outside the UK, EU (except Spain where arrivals by air will be asked to self-quarantine) Andorra, Holy See, Iceland, Lichtenstein, Monaco, Norway and Switzerland. The UK has announced that it will introduce self-isolation measures for arrivals at its borders from the 8 June; the French Ministry of Interior has indicated that after the UK introduces these measures, France will then also ask arrivals from the UK to observe a voluntary 14 day self-quarantine. Full details and a list of exemptions to self-quarantine in France are set out in a Ministry of Interior press statement (in French) and its translation (in English).
Travellers showing signs of a Covid-19 infection upon arrival in mainland France will have to carry out a mandatory 14 day quarantine at home or in a dedicated location indicated by the French authorities if home quarantine is not feasible.
All travellers to French overseas territories will also have to carry out a mandatory 14 day quarantine.
Border checks are also in place on the borders between France and Italy, Spain, Belgium and Germany.
Certificate requirements for travel within France
To travel in Île-de-France (Greater Paris) on public transport at peak hours (from 06h30 to 09h30 and from 16h00 to 19h00) you will need to complete a travel certificate from your employer to certify your reason for travel. If you are not travelling for work, you will need to self-certify that you are travelling for one of the compelling reasons listed on the certification.
Check the relevant prefecture’s website for information on local travel restrictions.
Travel between the EU and non-European countries
On 16 March, the French Government announced that the EU would suspend travel between the EU and non-European countries for an initial period of 30 days, this remains in force until further notice.
