FCDO advises against all travel to Russia.
Before you travel check that:
your destination can provide the healthcare you may need
you have appropriate travel insurance for local treatment or unexpected medical evacuation
This is particularly important if you have a health condition or are pregnant.
Emergency medical number
Dial 112 and ask for an ambulance.
Contact your insurance or medical assistance company promptly if you’re referred to a medical facility for treatment.
Vaccinations and health risks
At least 8 weeks before your trip check:
the latest information on vaccinations and health risks in TravelHealthPro’s Russia guide
where to get vaccines and whether you have to pay on the NHS travel vaccinations page
Altitude sickness
Altitude sickness is a risk in parts of Russia, including in the Western Caucasus mountains. Read more about altitude sickness on TravelHealthPro.
HIV and AIDS
There is a higher rate of HIV and AIDS in Russia than in the UK. Take normal precautions to avoid exposure.
Air quality
Air quality can worsen in some weather conditions. Monitor local media and the regional websites for the Ministry of Emergencies for more information.
Health examinations
If you’re in Russia for more than 90 days, you must have a regular comprehensive health examination. This applies to foreigners who are:
visiting
working
on highly qualified specialist visas
family members of any of the above, including children aged 6 and over
The examination includes tests for sexually transmitted infections and chest X-rays. You will have to submit fingerprints and other biometric data.
People working or on highly qualified specialist visas must complete the initial health check within 30 days from when you arrive in Russia.
People visiting, and in any other categories, must complete the health checks within 90 days.
Check with your employers and the Ministry of the Interior for the latest requirements.
Medication
The legal status and regulation of some medicines prescribed or bought in the UK can be different in other countries.
If your medication contains narcotic or psychoactive substances, you must carry a prescription in your name, translated into Russian, and notarised. Notarisation services are available in the UK from a notary public.
Read best practice when travelling with medicines on TravelHealthPro.
The NHS has information on whether you can take your medicine abroad.
Healthcare facilities in Russia
FCDO has a list of English-speaking doctors in Russia.
European and Global Health Insurance Cards (EHIC and GHIC) are not valid in Russia. Any foreign national has a legal right to free medical care in life-threatening circumstances.
Medical care may not meet Western standards. Hospitals do not accept all health cases and may request payments before treatment.
In remote areas, hospitals may not use disposable intravenous (IV) supplies, syringes and needles as standard practice. You may want to have your own supply.
COVID-19 healthcare in Russia
Anyone with symptoms of a respiratory illness will normally have PCR and rapid antigen tests taken by their doctor. People who test positive for COVID-19 must self-isolate for 7 days.
Travel and mental health
Read FCDO guidance on travel and mental health. There is also mental health guidance on TravelHealthPro.
