There are an increasing number of scheduled flights, which allow a return to the UK, via third countries.
Flights
British nationals wishing to travel to Vientiane Capital for international flights should carry evidence of their flight booking and identity documents for presentation at any checkpoints you encounter.
If your return journey to the UK transits another country, you should check our travel advice for countries that you will be transiting.
Departing Laos
It is no longer a requirement to notify the British Embassy when you depart Laos. Normal immigration procedures should be now in operation.
Further information
The British Embassy Vientiane will also issue urgent updates on the UKinLaos Facebook page.
