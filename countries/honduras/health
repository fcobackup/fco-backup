Before you travel check that:
your destination can provide the healthcare you may need
you have appropriate travel insurance for local treatment or unexpected medical evacuation
This is particularly important if you have a health condition or are pregnant.
Emergency medical number
Call 911 and ask for an ambulance.
Contact your insurance company promptly if you’re referred to a medical facility for treatment.
Vaccinations and health risks
At least 8 weeks before your trip check:
the latest information on vaccination recommendations and health risks in TravelHealthPro’s Honduras guide
where to get vaccines and whether you have to pay on the NHS travel vaccinations page
Altitude sickness is a risk in parts of Honduras. Read more about altitude sickness on TravelHealthPro.
Tap water is not generally safe to drink, but bottled water is cheap and widely available.
Medication
The legal status and regulation of some medicines prescribed or bought in the UK can be different in other countries.
Read best practice when travelling with medicines on TravelHealthPro.
The NHS has information on whether you can take your medicine abroad.
You cannot use British-issued prescriptions in Honduras. To find a pharmacy (‘farmacia’) look for one of the big national chains such as Farmacias Siman, Farmacias Kielsa or Farmacia El Ahorro.
Healthcare facilities in Honduras
State-funded hospitals are underfunded and medicines are in short supply. Make sure you have adequate travel health insurance and accessible funds to cover the cost of any medical treatment abroad and repatriation. Always carry evidence of your insurance. Use private clinics where possible, though these are only available in major towns.
FCDO has a list of English-speaking doctors in Honduras.
There is also guidance on healthcare if you’re living in Honduras.
Hyperbaric decompression chambers
There is a hyperbaric decompression chamber on Roatán and there are decompression facilitates on the Bay Island of Utila. However, emergency medical facilities on the Bay Islands are extremely limited.
COVID-19 healthcare in Honduras
The public health system has limited capacity for handling severe and critical cases of COVID-19.
Some private hospitals are accepting patients with COVID-19, but admission will cost 1,000,000 Honduran lempiras (over £30,000), with the final medical bill potentially higher.
Small clinics can provide testing, basic medical attention and medication to COVID-19 patients who do not require special medical care.
Travel and mental health
Read FCDO guidance on travel and mental health. There is also mental health guidance on TravelHealthPro.
