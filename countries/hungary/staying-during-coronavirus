Hungary has introduced gradual easing since the end of May. As of 12 June, visitors are allowed in hospitals. Libraries reopened on 15 June. From 18 June, restrictions of shopping hours no longer apply.
People should wear a face covering (ie mask, scarf or shawl) in shops, restaurants, bars and similar indoor settings, and when using taxis or public transport.
Outdoor attractions may open, for example outdoor swimming pools and spas, zoos, playgrounds and outdoor museums.
Mass events are banned until at least 15 August.
Local authorities have some powers to introduce additional restrictions, so follow local instructions.
The full details are set out on the Hungarian government website
Resident permits
UK nationals living in Hungary should note that the National Directorate General for Aliens Policing has introduced changes in in-person appointments to help reduce the spread of the virus. Expiring resident permits from 11 March onwards will automatically remain valid during the state of emergency and for 45 days after the state of emergency terminates. The state of emergency ended on 18 June.
If you are a UK national residing in Hungary for over three months, and trying to register your stay, you should visit the webpage of the National Directorate General for Aliens Policing for guidance on how to do this.

Finance
There is a range of financial support from the government that you can access while you are unable to return due to coronavirus restrictions.
If you’re in Hungary, and have exhausted all other options to cover essential living costs while you wait to return home, you could apply for an emergency loan for your living costs from the UK government. You can only apply if you normally live in the UK and you cannot return home. This last-resort option is for those most in need, and you would need to repay the loan when you are back in the UK. Apply for an emergency loan.
