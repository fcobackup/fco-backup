During the COVID-19 pandemic, it is more important than ever to get travel insurance and check it provides sufficient cover. See the FCO’s guidance on foreign travel insurance.
Consular support is limited in the Republic of Congo as there is no British Embassy. However, the British Embassy Kinshasa, in the Democratic Republic of Congo can provide limited remote consular support to British nationals.
Given the rapidly changing situation in Democratic Republic of the Congo we have temporarily withdrawn a limited number of UK staff and their dependents from our Embassy in Kinshasa. The Embassy will continue to carry out essential work including providing 24/7 remote consular assistance and support to British people in the Republic of the Congo.
Previous periods of unrest have seen an increased police and military presence in Brazzaville. You should maintain a high level of security awareness, avoid political protests and avoid travel after dark.
Although there’s no recent history of terrorism in the Republic of Congo, attacks can’t be ruled out. See Terrorism. Take out comprehensive travel and medical insurance before you travel.
