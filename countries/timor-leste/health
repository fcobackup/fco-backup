Before you travel check that:
your destination can provide the healthcare you may need
you have appropriate travel insurance for local treatment or unexpected medical evacuation
This is particularly important if you have a health condition or are pregnant.
Emergency medical number
Call 110, +670 331 1044 or +670 723 3212 and ask for an ambulance.
Emergency medical services in Timor-Leste are unreliable. Make your own way to hospital if you can.
There may be other numbers for the areas you visit – ask your hotel or the local police.
Contact your insurance company quickly if you’re referred to a medical facility for treatment.

Healthcare in Timor-Leste
Medical services in Timor-Leste are limited, particularly outside Dili.
In a medical emergency, it’s likely you’ll need to be evacuated to Australia or Singapore. However, medical evacuation is difficult because of the limited number of airlines from Timor-Leste. You should make sure you have adequate travel health insurance and accessible funds to cover the cost of any medical treatment abroad and repatriation.
