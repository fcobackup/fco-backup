On 23 March, the Greek authorities announced the suspension of direct commercial flights between the UK and Greece (in both directions) with effect from midnight local time on 23 March. This suspension will be in place until 3pm local time on 15 April. At present, it is possible to travel indirectly between Greece and the UK (and vice versa). You should contact airlines or travel operators directly for more information. Please contact the British Embassy in Athens if you need assistance.
You should note that the UK advises against all non-essential travel overseas. Travellers to Greece must follow restrictions imposed by Greek authorities.
Countries neighbouring Greece (Albania, Bulgaria, Italy, North Macedonia, Turkey) have also introduced restrictions. Check FCO Travel Advice pages for details if you are planning to travel via these countries.
