Cases of coronavirus (COVID-19) have been confirmed in the Dominican Republic. The local authorities have introduced measures to limit the spread of the virus.
The FCO strongly encourage non-resident British nationals in Dominican Republic to consider leaving quickly to avoid difficulties they will face if travel out of the country and the region are further restricted and they are unable to get home.

The Dominican government has established a dedicated website and helpline (to access, please call *462) to provide more information on the Dominican Republic’s response to coronavirus. Both of these services operate in Spanish. The helpline is experiencing a high volume of calls and is likely to be under pressure.
