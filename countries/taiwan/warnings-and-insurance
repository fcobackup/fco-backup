The UK does not recognise Taiwan as a state and has no diplomatic relations with Taiwan, so limited support is available to British nationals. Please refer to the British Office in Taipei for further information.
Typhoons
The typhoon season in Taiwan normally runs from May to November. There’s a risk of road blockages and landslides after typhoons, especially in central and southern Taiwan.
Listen to typhoon alerts on the ICRT, BCC and PRS radio stations, and monitor the websites of the Central Weather Administration and the Japan Meteorological Agency.
