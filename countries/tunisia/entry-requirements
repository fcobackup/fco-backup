The information on this page covers the most common types of travel and reflects the UK government’s understanding of the rules currently in place. Unless otherwise stated, this information is for travellers using a full ‘British Citizen’ passport.
The Tunisian authorities are responsible for setting and enforcing the rules for entry. If you’re unclear about any aspect of the entry requirements, or you need further reassurance, you should contact the Tunisian Embassy in London.
You should also consider checking with your transport provider or travel company to make sure your passport and other travel documents meet their requirements.
Entry rules in response to coronavirus (COVID-19)
Entry to Tunisia
Travellers from all countries into Tunisia must take a PCR test less than 72 hours before travel and carry dated evidence of a negative result. You are also required to self-isolate for seven days on arrival in Tunisia. You should isolate at home for 7 days and pay to take a second COVID-19 PCR test, and receive a second negative result, in order to leave isolation. You need to arrive in Tunisia with evidence of a booking for this second COVID-19 PCR test (to be taken from day 5 of your isolation period). You can organise this online. You are advised to confirm your appointment directly with the clinic.
From 1 June, you are exempt from these requirements if you can present official evidence that you have tested positive for coronavirus at least six weeks before your departure date, or received all doses of your coronavirus vaccination. This evidence should be from the relevant health authorities or contain a QR code, (see ‘Demonstrating your COVID-19 vaccination status’).
Travellers entering Tunisia by land across the Libyan border need a negative PCR test but are not currently obliged to self-isolate on arrival. If you are travelling from Libya to Tunisia by air, you will be subject to the same rules as all other travellers.
Official delegations on professional missions of less than 5 days are exempt from the self-isolation requirement but still need to present a dated negative PCR test on arrival.
The Tunisian government has also announced that travellers arriving in Tunisia as part of a tour or package holiday will not need to self-isolate on arrival, if they adhere to the following measures:
Take a PCR test less than 72 hours before travel and show evidence of the negative test result, with the date of the test clearly labelled, at your point of departure for Tunisia.
Present booking confirmation for a holiday organised by a tour operator.
Remain in a bubble with the tour group for the duration of your trip, including accommodation and all travel.
Complete this Tunisian government short online questionnaire before travelling.
Testing on arrival
Travellers from all countries need to provide evidence of having taken a coronavirus PCR test that is negative less than 72 hours before your travel to Tunisia. You should arrange to take a test and ensure the certificate is dated.
From 1 June, you are exempt from this requirement if you have tested positive for coronavirus at least six weeks ago, or have official evidence of having received all doses of your coronavirus vaccine, (see ‘Demonstrating your COVID-19 vaccination status’).
See Entry to Tunisia for full entry requirements.
Demonstrating your COVID-19 vaccination status
If you live in England, Tunisia will accept the NHS app or your NHS letter to demonstrate your COVID-19 vaccination status. If you live in Scotland or Wales, Tunisia will accept your respective NHS letter to demonstrate your COVID-19 vaccination status. Your NHS appointment card from vaccination centres is not designed to be used as proof of vaccination and should not be used to demonstrate your vaccine status.
Data collection
You must complete this Tunisian government short online questionnaire before travelling.
You must download and use the Tunisian government’s ‘track and trace’ application on your mobile phone.
You will also need to enter personal details when booking any PCR test through this website. Evidence of an appointment booking is required for entry, unless you are exempt for reasons listed above (‘Entry Requirements’).
On arrival in Tunisia, you must also share your contact details and travel information with authorities.
Testing on departure
No testing is available at the airport or sea ports. Passengers travelling from Tunisia, who require a test for the country they are travelling to, should arrange a private test.
There have been some reports of travellers from Tunisia being denied entry to a third country, on suspicion of carrying fake PCR test results. This may affect you if you are transiting in one country before onward travel to the UK.
For verification, travellers are advised to carry the original copy of their negative PCR test result, and ensure this has been signed and stamped by the laboratory, before travelling. A QR code on digital test results, if provided by the laboratory, can also be presented to verify the result. This applies above all for travel through France.
Transiting Tunisia
A small number of transit flights are operating through Tunisia. If you are transiting through Tunisia, you must comply with sanitary measures and temperature checks.
Regular entry requirements
Visas
British passport holders don’t need a visa for visits of up to three months. On arrival, security checks are sometimes carried out on British passport holders who were not born in the UK. This can take a few hours and you will need to be patient until clearance is given. These types of checks rarely take place on departure.
Overstay fines
If you stay in Tunisia for longer than the authorised period, you will have to pay a fine. This rule may not apply if you are vulnerable and current circumstances oblige you to remain in the country.
Passport validity
For stays of up to 3 months your passport should be valid for the proposed duration of your stay; you don’t need any additional period of validity on your passport beyond this.
UK Emergency Travel Documents
Tunisian authorities accept UK ETDs for entry to and exit from Tunisia. If you’re leaving Tunisia on an ETD, make sure you have a copy of the police report about the loss/theft of your full validity passport to present to the Immigration Officer.
Dual nationals
Dual British-Tunisian nationals should enter and leave Tunisia on their Tunisian passports.
