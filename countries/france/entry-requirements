The information on this page covers the most common types of travel and reflects the UK government’s understanding of the rules currently in place. Unless otherwise stated, this information is for travellers using a full ‘British Citizen’ passport.
The authorities in the country or territory you’re travelling to are responsible for setting and enforcing the rules for entry. If you’re unclear about any aspect of the entry requirements, or you need further reassurance, you’ll need to contact the embassy, high commission or consulate of the country or territory you’re travelling to.
You should also consider checking with your transport provider or travel company to make sure your passport and other travel documents meet their requirements.
Entry rules in response to coronavirus (COVID-19)
For the purposes of setting travel rules, France has defined a European Area composed of EU countries, the UK, Andorra, Holy See, Iceland, Liechtenstein, Monaco, Norway, San Marino and Switzerland.
Entry to France
Travellers arriving in France from the UK, European Area, Australia, Canada, Georgia, Japan, Montenegro, Morocco, New Zealand, Rwanda, Serbia, South Korea, Thailand, Tunisia and Uruguay are no longer required to self-isolate, to demonstrate their travel is essential or to hold an international travel certificate.
Arrivals from countries other than those specified above will still need to complete an international travel certificate, which certifies that your journey is essential and confirms that you have not been suffering from a set of listed symptoms associated with Covid-19. This travel certificate is available on the French Ministry of the Interior’s website. You should also produce any supporting paperwork to substantiate the essential nature of your travel. If you are flying into Paris Charles de Gaulle and Paris Orly airports from any country from which you are required to present an international travel certificate, or have spent time in these countries in the last 30 days, you will be invited to provide a negative Covid19 RT-PCR test taken less than 72 hours before departure. Those unable to provide this test result will be subject to 14-day compulsory quarantine/self-isolation on arrival. Travellers will be offered the option to have a free RT-PCR test at the airport on arrival with quarantine being lifted for those whose results are negative.
Border checks may also be in place at points on France’s land borders with Italy, Spain, Belgium and Germany.
Quarantine requirements
There is no quarantine requirement for arrivals from the UK, from the wider European Area (as defined above) and from Australia, Canada, Georgia, Japan, Montenegro, Morocco, New Zealand, Rwanda, Serbia, South Korea, Thailand, Tunisia and Uruguay. Arrivals from other countries will be subject to compulsory quarantine/self-isolation for 14 days on arrival in mainland France unless arriving with a negative RT-PCT test taken in the 72 hours before arrival. Exemptions to self-quarantine in France are set out in a Ministry of Interior press statement (in French) and its translation (in English).
Travellers from any country showing signs of a COVID-19 infection upon arrival in mainland France will have to carry out a mandatory 14-day quarantine at home or in a dedicated location indicated by the French authorities if home quarantine is not feasible.
Travel between the EU and non-European countries
The French Government has suspended travel between France and countries outside the European Area (as defined above) except for Australia, Canada, Georgia, Japan, Montenegro, Morocco, New Zealand, Rwanda, Serbia, South Korea, Thailand, Tunisia and Uruguay.
Some countries are imposing a compulsory period of quarantine for travellers from France. If you are travelling from or through France, check the situation at your destination before you travel.
Travel to French overseas territories
Regular flights between metropolitan France and its overseas territories resumed in late June. Travellers need to provide a negative RT-PCR test taken in the 72 hours preceding arrival for entry into all French overseas territories.
An international travel certificate which includes a self-declaration stating that they do not have any COVID-19 symptoms is necessary for travel to French Guiana and Mayotte. It is available on the Ministry of Interior website. At present, travel to these destinations is only permitted for exceptional family, health or professional reasons. The certificate is to be presented to transportation companies before boarding, as well as to border control authorities.
International travel certificates are not required for travel to other French overseas territories.
See travel advice pages for the French overseas territory you are visiting.
