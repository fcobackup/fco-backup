Entry and borders
See Entry requirements to find out what you will need to do when you arrive in France and for details on France’s current entry requirements and restrictions.
Be prepared for your plans to change
No travel is risk-free during COVID-19. Countries may further restrict travel or bring in new rules at short notice, for example due to a new COVID-19 variant. Check with your travel company or airline for any transport changes which may delay your journey home.
If you test positive for COVID-19 in France and you’re fully vaccinated (including a booster) or if you’ve had COVID-19 in the last 4 months, you must self-isolate for 7 days from the day on which you first develop symptoms, or 7 days from the date of the positive test result. Self-isolation can be reduced to 5 days if you take a negative PCR or antigen test (supervised, not self-administered) on day 5 and you have not displayed any symptoms over the previous 48 hours. These isolation rules also apply to children under the age of 12, regardless of their vaccination status.
If you’re unvaccinated or partially vaccinated and you haven’t had COVID-19 in the last 4 months, you must self-isolate for 10 days from the day on which you first develop symptoms, or 10 days from the date of the positive test result. Self-isolation can be reduced to 7 days if you take a negative PCR or antigen test (supervised, not self-administered) on day 7 and you have not displayed any symptoms over the previous 48 hours.
You will have to extend your stay until the end of your isolation period. This could be in your current accommodation. The French authorities do not provide or pay for quarantine accommodation.
Further information is available on the TousAntiCovid application. The French health ministry also operates a dedicated coronavirus helpline on +33 (0)800 130 000.
Plan ahead and make sure you:
can access money
understand what your insurance will cover
can make arrangements to extend your stay and be away for longer than planned
Travel in France
Wearing masks on public transport is no longer compulsory, although some towns and cities may require mask wearing on public transport. You should check local mask rules before you travel. Wearing masks on public transport remains recommended, especially for vulnerable people.
Some travel operators such as airlines may specify types of masks to be worn on board e.g. surgical masks, and may encourage you to take spares for long journeys. Please check with your travel operator before travelling.
You should visit the French Government Coronavirus Information page or use the ‘TousAntiCovid’ digital app for further information and to stay up to date on restrictions
Public spaces and services
From 1 August 2022, face masks are no longer mandatory in health establishments, but remain strongly recommended. Some local health authorities may still require masks, for example, Paris Hospitals (AP-HP), where masks remain mandatory for those aged 6 and above.
Proof of vaccination
The French Government recognises vaccination certificates that conform to EU norms. This means:
7 days after a third dose of Oxford/AstraZeneca, Pfizer/BioNTech, Moderna, and Novavax for domestic use (to obtain a valid “health pass”), or
28 days after a second dose of Johnson & Johnson, or
7 days after a second injection for those able to demonstrate they have already been infected (this only applies to those vaccinated in France) for domestic use (to obtain a valid “vaccine pass”)
France will accept the UK’s proof of COVID-19 recovery and vaccination record. Your NHS appointment card from vaccination centres is not designed to be used as proof of vaccination and should not be used to demonstrate your vaccine status.
Those vaccinated in England, Wales, Scotland and Northern Ireland can also choose to scan and save the NHS QR code into France’s “TousAntiCovid” app.
More information on how to obtain a certificate/QR code is available, if vaccinated in Northern Ireland and if vaccinated in Scotland.
If your vaccine certificate shows a different name to your passport (e.g. marital / birth name), please also carry any supporting documentation (e.g. marriage certificate) when travelling.
Healthcare in France
The French Government advises those with possible coronavirus symptoms to call 112. You should not go directly to the doctor or emergency services.
Your emotional and mental wellbeing is important. Read guidance on how to look after your mental wellbeing and mental health

COVID-19 testing in France
If you have a prescription from a French medical practitioner or are identified as having been in contact with someone who has a confirmed COVID-19 diagnosis, supervised COVID-19 tests remain free as long as you present a valid UK European Health Insurance Card (EHIC) or the new UK Global Health Insurance Card (GHIC). Travellers outside these circumstances will need to pay for a COVID-19 test. The minimum cost of supervised COVID-19 tests in France is €44 for PCR tests and €22 for rapid antigen tests. Self-administered rapid antigen tests can be purchased from pharmacies. The process for accessing these tests in France is via a list of places available from the French government website.
How to obtain a French ‘pass sanitaire’
If you receive your COVID-19 vaccination in France, you can obtain a French ‘pass sanitaire (which is a version of the EU Digital Covid Certificate) in order to travel internationally. To do so, you should scan the QR code on your paper vaccine certification via the French app TousAntiCovid. Once scanned, TousAntiCovid will save your certification in the ‘wallets’ section of the app, allowing you to present it at the border when you travel. The Certificate proves that you have been vaccinated, received a negative test result, or recovered from COVID-19. It will help facilitate your travel within the EU and, in some countries, you can use it to demonstrate your COVID-19 status to businesses and other organisations. For further information visit the French government’s website on the “pass sanitaire”.
