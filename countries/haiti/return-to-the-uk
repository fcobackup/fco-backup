Where possible, and if they become available in the future, the British Embassy in Haiti will share relevant information about departure options on Twitter.
What to do
If you cannot leave Haiti at this time, you should:
follow the advice of local authorities, including local measures to help minimise your risk of exposure to coronavirus
find accommodation that’s suitable for your needs
keep in regular contact with family and friends at home, so they know you are safe and well
let us know you are in Haiti by e-mailing us: UK.inDominicanRepublic@fco.gov.uk
Future travel options
The UK government is working closely with airlines, the Haitian authorities and other governments to make sure options are available for you to return to the UK as soon as possible.
This travel advice will be updated when departure options become available.
