Local measures
Full details of measures announced by the Dutch government can be found on the Dutch government website (in English).
The Dutch government currently advises wearing a non-medical face mask on public transport. From 1 June 2020, the wearing of non-medical face masks will be mandatory on public transport in the Netherlands. Public transport should be used for essential travel only. Users should avoid rush hour and keep as far apart as possible.
You can find further information on the latest measures from the Dutch National Institute for Public Health (RIVM) and from the Dutch government.
Since 18:00 on April 17, 2020 travellers to the Netherlands from high-risk areas as listed online by the European Union Aviation Safety Agency, including those transiting the Netherlands, are required by airlines to fill in a ‘fit-to-fly’ health declaration form. This will contain questions about your situation and health, including whether you have symptoms of Covid-19. You may be refused permission to board based on your declaration.
On arrival in the Netherlands your declaration will be checked by public health and security authorities. Travellers from high-risk areas are also strongly advised by the Dutch government to quarantine themselves for at least 14 days.
You should comply with any additional screening measures put in place by the authorities.
