Air travel
There are limited flights in and out of Tuvalu, and these can sometimes be unreliable.
Political situation
Tuvalu is a Parliamentary Democracy and a Commonwealth Realm. His Majesty King Charles III is Head of State. The King is represented in Tuvalu by a Governor General, Honourable Sir Iakoba Italeli.
There are no political parties; politics are based on personal, family and island loyalties. Parliamentary elections are held every four years. The current Prime Minister, Kausea Natano, has been in office since 19 September 2019.
Passports
In the event of a lost or stolen passport, the Tuvalu authorities can issue emergency travel documents which will allow you to travel as far as Fiji, where you will then need to apply for a replacement passport, from the Regional Passport Processing Centre in New Zealand.
If your need to travel falls within the minimum full validity passport processing time of 3-4 weeks, you should contact the British High Commission in Suva and they will do their best to help you. You may be eligible for an Emergency Travel Document (ETD).
Keep a photocopy of the relevant pages of your passport to avoid any complications.
Telephone services
There is one local mobile network in Tuvalu; other international networks will not work while in Tuvalu. Local SIM cards can be purchased in Funafuti.
Swimming
Take great care when swimming off the outer coasts of Tuvaluâ€™s atolls as there are very strong rip currents along coast and reef areas. You should wear safety equipment at all times during boating trips.
Swimming in Funafuti lagoon is not recommended as it is highly polluted.
