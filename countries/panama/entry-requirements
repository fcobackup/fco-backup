Entry rules in response to coronavirus (COVID-19)
Panama classifies travellers as fully vaccinated or not fully vaccinated.
To be considered ‘fully vaccinated’ you must have proof of a completed vaccination program (See Demonstrating your COVID-19 status and must complete the traveller affidavit form on arrival at the link above. Or if you are a seaman, physically present your vaccination card with the required doses at your port of entry.
You are considered ‘not fully vaccinated’ if you have not received all doses necessary to complete a vaccination program in the country where you were vaccinated or have received no doses. If you are not fully vaccinated you must take a COVID-19 test – 72 hours before arrival and present a negative PCR or antigen result or have a test carried out at the port of entry at your own cost.
Whilst tests can be carried out on arrival in Panama, some airlines may deny boarding a flight to Panama if you do not already have a negative COVID-19 test result.
Children under 12 years of age are exempt from any type of testing and quarantine if their parents, care givers or guardians comply with the requirements according to their vaccination status.
Exit requirements
Panama does not require a negative COVID-19 result to exit the country, however you are encouraged to check the entry requirements for the country of your final destination as they may vary.
You may be denied boarding if you do not comply with the necessary health requirements of your destination. Do not attempt to travel if you have a positive test result. If you are denied boarding because of a positive COVID19 test, you will be required to quarantine at the designated facilities in Panama until relevant Panamanian health authorities have cleared you to travel.
Mandatory quarantine expenses will be covered by local health authorities, however, quarantine facilities are basic.
