Non-resident British nationals in The Bahamas are strongly encouraged to consider leaving quickly to avoid difficulties they will face if travel out of the country and the region are further restricted and they are unable to get home.
Travellers can expect disruption to flights and should contact their airlines, travel agents and tour operators. The last outbound British Airways flight to the UK is scheduled for 22 March 2020.
