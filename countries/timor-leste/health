Medical services in East Timor are limited, particularly outside Dili. There are very few dental and optical services. In the event of a medical emergency, evacuation to Australia or Singapore is likely to be the only option for treatment.  Make sure you have adequate travel health insurance and accessible funds to cover the cost of any medical treatment abroad and repatriation.
Malaria and dengue fever are present throughout East Timor. Thereâ€™s usually an increase in dengue cases during the rainy season, which runs from November to April.
If you need emergency medical assistance during your trip seek up to date local advice from foreign residents and/or dial 110 and ask for an ambulance. You should contact your insurance/medical assistance company promptly if you are referred to a medical facility for treatment.
