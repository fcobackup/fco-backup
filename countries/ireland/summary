For those with valid proof of full vaccination or COVID recovery within 180 days, no travel-related testing or quarantine will be necessary
For those without valid proof of vaccination or COVID recovery within 180 days, you will need to: present evidence of a negative RT-PCR test result within 72 hours prior to arrival into the country; on arrival self-quarantine at home for 14 days; undergo post-arrival testing no less than 5 days after arrival.
Those travelling to Ireland from Northern Ireland, whose journey originates in Northern Ireland and who have not been overseas in the past 14-days, are not obliged to complete a Passenger Locator Form or provide proof of vaccination, recovery or test results upon arrival into Ireland. However travellers who have been overseas in the past 14 days are subject to the requirements based on their travel history, and according to their health status.
