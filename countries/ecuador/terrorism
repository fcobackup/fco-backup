Although there’s no recent history of terrorism in Ecuador, attacks can’t be ruled out.
There have been serious attacks in 2018. The first on 27 January, involved a car bomb detonated outside a police station in San Lorenzo, a town near the Colombian border in the Esmeraldas province. Twenty eight people were injured, and the Ecuadorean government declared a state of emergency in Esmeraldas. A further bomb attack on 20 March in Mataje, also close to the border, left 4 soldiers dead and 11 injured. Both attacks occurred within 20km of the border, an area to which the FCO advises against all travel. On Wednesday 4 April a home-made explosive was detonated near the town of Viche in the Esmeraldas province (outside the 20km exclusion zone, at 108km from San Lorenzo town), on one of the main roads connecting the highlands to the coast, including various popular beach destinations in the province.
There’s considered to be a heightened threat of terrorist attack globally against UK interests and British nationals, from groups or individuals motivated by conflict in Iraq and Syria. You should be vigilant at this time.
