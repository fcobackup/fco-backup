The Lao Government has suspended the visa on arrival and eVisa service at all international entry points for a period of 30 days for all nationals.
Border crossings remain closed, however the use of the Lao-Thai Friendship Bridge for non-COVID 19 related medical emergencies is permitted by ambulance. The Ministry of Foreign Affairs will facilitate the return of foreigners to their home country who wish to do so, including extending visas as necessary.
Health screening
Enhanced health screening is in place and border crossings between Laos, Thailand, Cambodia, and Vietnam are closed. You should allow additional time to include this possibility and check with your airline if travelling by air.
Anybody travelling to Laos with a fever, cough or difficulty breathing, and a travel history from coronavirus affected countries, will be isolated in hospital and tested. The hospitals being used are Mittaphab, Mahosot, Setthathirath and the National Military Hospital (103).
Anybody travelling to Laos who has visited a country with more than 100 coronavirus cases, visited provinces in neighbouring countries with more than 3 cases, or had close contact with a confirmed coronavirus case, will need to self-quarantine for 14 days.
