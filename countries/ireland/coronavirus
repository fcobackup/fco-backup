You can spread the virus even if you don’t have symptoms.

Cases of coronavirus (COVID-19) have been confirmed in Ireland. The Irish authorities have introduced a number of measures to limit the spread of the virus.
Travel
The availability of transport from Ireland to Great Britain is subject to change. Flights and ferry services continue to operate between Ireland and Great Britain. Some flight operators have already announced that service will reduce in the coming days. If you’re visiting Ireland, you should closely monitor public announcements regarding the scheduling of flight and ferry services, and be prepared to adjust your travel plans accordingly.
On 16 March the Irish Government announced that all persons, including Irish residents, entering Ireland from overseas will be asked to make significant restrictions to their movements for 14 days on arrival. This does not apply to those entering Ireland from Northern Ireland at this time, nor to specified categories of essential supply chain workers such as aircrew, hauliers, maritime staff whether Irish-based or foreign-based.
Local measures
On 27 March the Irish Government updated its guidance on measures to combat the spread of Coronavirus. They have said that everybody should now stay at home. The only times people can leave their homes are:
• to travel to or from work if you are providing an essential service. • to shop for food • to collect medical prescriptions and medical supplies and attend medical appointments • to carry out vital services like caring (including family carers) • for brief individual exercise - within 2 kilometres of your house. You can bring children but must keep 2 metres away from others for social distancing • for farming
Apart from the activities above, there should be no travel outside a radius of 2km from your home, for any reason.
In addition all public and private gatherings outside a single household are prohibited. Shielding, or cocooning, will be introduced for everyone over 70, and categories who are particularly vulnerable to Covid 19. All public transport and passenger travel will be restricted only to essential workers, and people who are providing essential services.
These measures are in place from midnight Friday 27 March until Tuesday 5 May. A link to all of the latest Irish Government guidance can be viewed here.
