This page gives you guidance on how to stay safely in Ukraine as a visitor, if you are unable to return to the UK.
Everyone should comply with the measures put in place in Ukraine to limit the spread of coronavirus (COVID-19).
Moving around in Ukraine
For information on entering Ukraine, see Entry Requirements.
The following quarantine measures have been extended by the Ukrainian government until 22 May:
schools and universities are closed
all public (cultural, entertainment, sports, social, religious and other) gatherings involving more than 10 people are prohibited
metro networks are closed
intercity and interregional trains and buses, domestic flights are suspended
use of public transportation in Kyiv is limited to critical sector workers. Special routes are in operation and travellers need to prove that they work in such sectors to board. Kyiv City Council requires passengers on public transport to wear a face mask
local buses and trams continue to operate in other regions but may only carry 10 passengers at a time
Kyiv State Administration requires all staff and customers to wear face masks in all shops, including supermarkets, grocery stores and pharmacies
It is forbidden to be in public places without a mask or respirator and for under-16s to be in public places, unless accompanied by an adult.
Some restrictions have recently been lifted. Shops, open air cafes, takeaway services, beauty salons and hairdressers, museums, libraries household service centres, shoe repairers, dentists, auditors, attorneys and notaries are now allowed to operate.
Parks and recreation areas have also reopened, and groups of up to 8 people are allowed to gather there.
There may be some variation in the restrictions in different parts of the country. Failure to comply with the restrictions may result in a fine or, in more serious cases, a prison sentence.
Visas
Where the restrictions on travel and availability of government services mean that foreigners stay in Ukraine beyond the period permitted by their visa-free limit or visa validity, or that they are unable to extend residence permits, there will be no penalties imposed.
Health
If you have COVID-19 symptoms, such as a dry cough, respiratory difficulties, and a high temperature, you should:
if you have insurance or a private medical provider in Ukraine, seek assistance from them in the first instance
if you do not have insurance or your symptoms are more severe, call an ambulance on 103. Please note that the ambulance service may not have English-speaking operators available. In this case, please enlist the help of a Ukrainian or Russian-speaking friend, family member, hotel worker etc to help you call the ambulance
In both cases, you are likely to be advised to self-isolate, or be taken to a hospital where you will be tested for coronavirus. In case of a positive diagnosis, please inform the British Embassy Kyiv by calling +380 44 490 3660 or by completing this web contact form, or ask a friend or relative to contact us on your behalf.
If taken to hospital, you are likely to be tested for coronavirus. The choice of hospital will depend on your location and the availability of hospitals and/or beds.
British nationals should receive medical treatment free of charge within Ukraine’s state healthcare system for suspected or confirmed cases of COVID-19 – please speak to your insurance company to determine if you are covered for the cost of any treatment at a private clinic, or treatment for any other illness.
If you come into contact with someone who is confirmed to have COVID-19, or has COVID-19 symptoms, you must self-isolate for 14 days. Contact your insurer or private medical provider, or call an ambulance on 103, should you develop symptoms yourself. Failure to comply with these restrictions may result in a fine or, in more serious cases, a prison sentence.
