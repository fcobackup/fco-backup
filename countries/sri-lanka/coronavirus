Cases of coronavirus (COVID-19) have been confirmed in Sri Lanka. The Sri Lankan Government is taking measures to prevent the spread of the virus. You should comply with screening measures put in place by the authorities.
Flights to Sri Lanka have been suspended since 19 March. If you are visiting Sri Lanka, you should make arrangements to leave while commercial means are available. Speak to your airline or tour company as soon as possible, as it is likely that flight options will become more restricted in coming days. Airlines operating via the United Arab Emirates, including Emirates Airlines and Etihad, have announced that they will suspend flights out of Colombo on 24 March (Etihad) and by 25 March (Emirates).
Airlines are advertising the following flights:
Sri Lankan Airlines, daily
Qatar Airways (via Doha), daily until at least 25 March
Edelweiss (to Zurich), Friday and Sunday
Aeroflot (to Moscow), daily
Some airlines are changing flight schedules with little prior notice. You should keep in close contact with your airline or travel agent.
The government have announced that people who arrived in Sri Lanka from Europe between 1-15 March should register with the police by telephone via the emergency 119 service or by calling the local station. Speak to your hotel or tour company for assistance.
The government has announced that cruise ship passengers will not be allowed to disembark in the country, including for temporary shore visits. You should speak to your tour operator for further information on the impact on any existing travel plans.
Colombo airport authorities have announced that only passengers will be allowed onto the airport premises.
A nationwide curfew is in place. In Colombo and areas of the north west coast, the curfew will be lifted temporarily between 0600 and 1400 (local) on Tuesday 24 March, and then reintroduced. For the rest of the island, the curfew will be lifted temporarily between 0600 and 1400 (local) on Monday 23 March, and then reintroduced. We are unlikely to get significant notice of any changes to curfew hours. Please speak to your hotel or travel agent for the latest information.
Health screening measures have been introduced for all flight arrivals. The Ministry of Health has issued a press release and introduced a 24 hour hotline for anyone requiring information on coronavirus - +94 710170717.
A small number of tourists have reported problems with hotels trying to cancel bookings made by foreign visitors, and some incidents of harassment. Speak to your travel agent about any accommodation booking problems, and report any incidents of harassment to the police first and then to the British High Commission.
Further information on coronavirus, including advice on preparing for foreign travel and helping reduce the spread of the virus, is available from Public Health England and on the TravelHealthPro website.
