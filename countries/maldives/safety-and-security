Terrorism in Maldives  
Terrorists are likely to try to carry out attacks in Maldives.
Attacks could be indiscriminate, including in places visited by foreign nationals. Stay aware of your surroundings, keep up to date with local media reports and follow the advice of local authorities.
The Maldivian authorities have disrupted a number of terrorist attack plans since 2017 and have made several arrests relating to attack planning, recruitment of terrorist fighters and spreading extremist ideology. There have been anti-western protests by extremists on some islands, including expressions of support for Daesh.
Examples of recent significant attacks include:
in 2021, a high-profile politician and a number of bystanders were injured by the detonation of an improvised explosive device (IED) in central Malé
in 2020, an arson attack on a police speedboat in Laamu Gan
in 2020, knife attacks that injured 3 foreigners in Hulhumalé and were claimed by Daesh supporters
Political situation
Political protests take place occasionally in Malé. Avoid any protests or rallies to ensure your safety and security.  
Crime
Crime levels are low in the exclusive resort islands, but petty crime does happen. Do not leave items unattended on the beach or in unlocked hotel rooms.
Outside the resorts, there are incidents of gang-related violence including knife crime, mainly in Malé and in Hulhumalé. Avoid empty roads when on foot, particularly after dark.
Laws and cultural differences
Maldives is an Islamic country. It is illegal to publicly observe a religion other than Islam. Make sure that your actions do not offend, especially during Ramadan or when visiting religious areas around mosques. If you break local laws, you may get a prison sentence.
Ramadan
Ramadan is a holy month for Muslims. The dates vary by year and country. In 2025, Ramadan is expected to start around the end of February and finish around the end of March.
During this time, do not eat, drink or smoke in public in the daytime, outside of holiday resorts.

Wildlife, animal products and souvenirs

have shoulders covered
avoid short or tight-fitting shorts
have arms and upper legs covered when bathing

Outdoor activities and adventure tourism
Swimming safety
The sea around Maldives can have strong tidal currents and tourists drown every year. Always take local advice before going into the sea.
See water safety on holiday from the Royal Life Saving Society.
Scuba diving
Many resort islands are more than an hour away from the nearest hyperbaric chamber. Make sure you understand how your dive operator would get you to one of the 3 chambers in the islands. 
Transport risks
Road travel
If you are planning to drive a car in Maldives, see information on driving abroad.
You’ll need to have both the correct version of the international driving permit (IDP) and your UK driving licence with you in the car. You cannot buy an IDP outside the UK, so get one before you travel.
Hire car companies often have stricter requirements for their customers, such as a year of driving experience and minimum age 20 or 21.
Sea travel
There is a high risk of piracy and armed robbery in the Gulf of Aden and Indian Ocean.
There have been attacks on local fishing sailing vessels (dhows) in the Gulf of Aden and Horn of Africa.
If you’re travelling by sea, read about the regional risks at sea.
