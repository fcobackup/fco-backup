In recent weeks several large-scale political demonstrations have taken place on Hong Kong Island, in Kowloon and various suburbs in the New Territories. In recent weeks clashes have taken place between police and protesters following otherwise peaceful protest activities. There is a likelihood that such clashes could involve significant violence, with the possibility of casualties amongst those involved in clashes or accidentally caught up in events.
You should be prepared that the situation could change quickly in areas where protests and public gatherings are taking place. If you are in and around areas where demonstrations are, you should remain vigilant, follow the advice of local authorities and move away quickly to a safe place if there are signs of disorder.
On Saturday 20 July between 4.30pm and 7pm local time, a rally in support of police officers is scheduled to take place in Tamar Park (adjacent to Government Headquarters and the Legislative Council), Admiralty. Police have also authorised a rally on Hong Kong Island on Sunday 21 July, starting at 3pm local time in Victoria Park in Causeway Bay. The approved route passes through Admiralty and Wan Chai, before finishing at the Court of Final Appeal in Central. Recent marches have seen protest marches deviate from the planned route, which have sometimes prompted clashes with police forces.
Activities related to protests – including violent clashes between protesters and police – have spilled over into large public spaces (e.g. shopping centres, housing estates and metro (“MTR”) stations) on the margins of recent protest routes. Protests may lead to sections of the city being closed off and public transport being significantly affected.
Reports indicate demonstrations are likely to continue to take place in Hong Kong over the coming period. These protests may take place with little or no notice.
