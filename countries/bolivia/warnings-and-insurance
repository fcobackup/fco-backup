Road blockades and transport strike
There are road blockades in place across much of the country with the situation changing daily.  Check Bolivian news websites before travelling and do not attempt to cross blockades in a motor vehicle or on a motorbike.  Pedestrians are not usually prevented from crossing blockades but exercise caution before doing so.  There are petrol and diesel shortages across the country with extremely long queues forming at service stations in anticipation of deliveries. 
For tourist excursions, please check with your operator for any restrictions imposed before travelling. If necessary, taxi drivers at El Alto International Airport may know routes into La Paz that are unaffected by blockades.  The cable car (Mi Telef√©rico) in La Paz and El Alto continues to operate without any restrictions.  Blockades have led to fresh food shortages in La Paz, which has restricted the availability of meat, chicken, fruit, and vegetables.
Forest Fires
Forest fires are affecting some parts of Southern and Eastern Bolivia. This is having an impact on air quality in the areas most affected by the fires but also in other parts of the country, including La Paz. It is advisable to wear a face mask if the air quality is particularly bad, or to stay inside.
