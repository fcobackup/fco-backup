Visitors to Nicaragua should exercise a high degree of caution. Many areas of the country have experienced a period of unrest and street violence since April 2018. The situation is now quieter but underlying tensions could erupt into further violence and disorder without warning. Earlier in the crisis, heavily armed pro-government groups patrolled frequently. Whilst they appear to be less active, you should remain vigilant. In the early months of the crisis, there was use of tear gas, rubber bullets and live ammunition resulting in serious injuries and, according to UN and other reports, over 325 deaths.
You should stay well away from all demonstrations and gatherings, even if apparently peaceful. There are severe restrictions on freedom of expression and assembly. Marches, demonstrations and other expressions of opposition are no longer permitted. Hundreds of people have been detained as a result of the protests and such events have escalated into violence in the past. It is against Nicaraguan immigration law for foreigners to involve themselves in local politics and you may put yourself at risk of arrest if taking part in protests, breaches of the peace, or other activity that could be perceived as acting against the government.
Opposition groups frequently use the blue and white national flag, and these colours, as a symbol. Displaying these may be taken as an indication of support for opposition groups. This could lead to arrest and imprisonment under new terrorism laws which can incur severe penalties, even for apparently minor infractions.
The incidence of crime has risen significantly since the protests began.
Commercial flights are operating normally from Managua Augusto Sandino Airport. However, several airlines have reduced the number and frequency of flights due to lower demand because of the current situation.
