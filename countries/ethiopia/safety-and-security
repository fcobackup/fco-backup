Terrorism 
There is a high threat of terrorist attack globally affecting UK interests and British nationals, including from groups and individuals who view the UK and British nationals as targets. Stay aware of your surroundings at all times.
UK Counter Terrorism Policing has information and advice on staying safe abroad and what to do in the event of a terrorist attack. Find out how to reduce your risk from terrorism while abroad.
Terrorism in Ethiopia
Terrorists are very likely to try to carry out attacks in Ethiopia.
There is a threat of terrorism across Ethiopia. Attacks could target westerners, including British nationals. These could occur at any time including at religious events, public holidays or celebrations. Attacks could be indiscriminate and occur in places visited by foreign nationals, such as:
restaurants, hotels, bars, nightclubs and markets
supermarkets and shopping centres
stations and airports
places of worship and tourist attractions
festivals and sports venues or events
Large crowds are common on key national and religious dates, including:
Ethiopian Christmas on 7 January
Epiphany or ‘Timket’ in January
Victory of Adawa on 2 March
Ethiopian Patriots’ Victory Day on 5 May
Downfall of the Derg Regime on 28 May
Ethiopian New Year from 11 to 12 September
Birthday of the Prophet Mohammed on 27 September
Finding of the True Cross or ‘Meskel’ on 28 September
Ethiopian (Orthodox) Easter
Eid Al Fitr
Eid Al Arafa
Parts of the country also have local festivals (often celebrating saints’ days) which can lead to large gatherings.
Terrorist group Al-Shabaab, based in Somalia, poses a threat across East Africa. The group threatens all countries who have military forces in Somalia, including Ethiopia. In 2022, Al-Shabaab attacked the Somali towns of Aato, Yeed and Washaaqo, near the border with Ethiopia. Al-Shabaab has said it intends to commit further attacks in the area.
Political situation
Conflict and violence 
Between November 2020 and November 2022, conflict took place in the northern regions of Ethiopia, in particular in Tigray but also in Amhara and Afar.
The Government of Ethiopia and the Tigray People’s Liberation Front signed a peace agreement to cease hostilities in Tigray in November 2022. Disarmament and reconstruction measures have begun. The situation in Tigray is still fragile. There have been isolated armed incidents, including gunfire and spontaneous protest. In 2025 there have been increased political and security tensions in some areas with the seizing of administrative offices, checkpoints, the arrest of officials and disruption to goods and services.
Since spring 2023 there has been significant conflict in Amhara region, between Amhara militia groups (Fano) and the Ethiopian authorities, as well as opportunistic crime and banditry.
There have been increased tensions and violence between armed groups and the security forces across Oromia region.
Unrest can start with no notice. There are ongoing armed clashes between ethnic groups in much of the country. Foreigners have not been targeted. However you should:
monitor local media
follow the advice of local authorities and your tour operator
reconsider travel to affected areas
Avoid large gatherings and demonstrations. Comply with the law, including in relation to carrying ID cards, and possession of foreign currency and weapons. Avoid confrontation and follow the instructions of the authorities.
Strikes and protests
Civil unrest, including protests and strikes, may happen with little or no notice. This can cause:
temporary closures of roads, internet and mobile networks
disruption to local businesses and transport
In the past some protests have escalated into serious violence.
Addis Ababa security checks
Travellers may face increased scrutiny, particularly if they are of Amhara, Tigrayan or Oromo ethnicity. Officials may carry out direct police operations including road checkpoints and door-to-door calls. Security services sometimes conduct house searches without authorisation.  
If security officials request access to your accommodation, check the credentials of the officials and then comply with their requests. The authorities have increased security checks at Bole International Airport and there are reports of ethnic Tigrayans being prevented from boarding flights. In all cases, avoid confrontation and follow the instructions of the authorities.
Risk of arbitrary detention  
There have been a small number of cases of arbitrary detention of British nationals in Ethiopia. The risk may increase if tensions are heightened around major events, or in locations that are sensitive for security reasons. Carry a paper copy of your passport and contact details of the British Embassy in Addis Ababa (phone: +251 11 617 0100) in case you are questioned or detained.
The Ethiopian authorities do not always notify embassies when they detain foreign nationals. If you are detained, ask family or friends to contact the British Embassy. The authorities may not permit embassy officials adequate access to detainees.
Crime
Mugging (violent theft or theft with the threat of violence) is on the rise. There have been a number of incidents of sexual harassment of women.
Protecting yourself and your belongings
Take care of your belongings when visiting crowded public places, especially at night. There is a risk of petty theft around Bole International Airport, particularly pickpockets and bag-snatchers. 
Be vigilant if strangers approach you. Criminal groups, often including children and young people, sometimes attempt to steal phones, wallets or other valuables by jostling and pickpocketing. They may use distraction techniques including begging, spitting, spilling food and drink, and feigning illness. 
There has been an increase in reported crime against foreign nationals and Ethiopian nationals in these areas of Addis Ababa:
Bole Medhanealem
Bole Atlas
Meskel Square
Yeka Hills
Entoto
Attacks have included knifepoint robberies and victims being choked unconscious. Do not travel alone in these areas if possible. Be cautious if travelling on foot. Consider using road transport where possible, especially after dark.
Vehicle crime
There is a risk of bag and jewellery snatching from vehicles at traffic lights and of thefts from parked cars.
When travelling in vehicles:
keep belongings with you – do not leave them in vehicles
keep valuables out of sight
keep windows closed and vehicle doors locked
park in well-lit and guarded areas such as hotels, government and tourist locations, which all have security at their entrances
consider fitting anti-shatter film to vehicle windows for longer-term stays
If threatened, hand over valuables without resistance.
Criminal kidnap  
Kidnapping is widespread in parts of Ethiopia, with incidents in the Oromia, Amhara and Somali regions and on the southern border with Kenya.
There have been a number of recent kidnappings in Amhara and Oromia, especially within the Adama special zone south of Addis Ababa, and western areas of Oromia region, particularly West Wollega, East Wollega and Qellem Wollega zones.
Possible targets for criminal kidnap include people engaged in humanitarian aid work, journalism or business sectors. The motivation for kidnappings is extortion, with criminals demanding high sums for ransom.
When arranging meetings, use a secure location. Avoid regular patterns of travel and aim to only travel during daylight hours. If you go to areas where the FCDO advises against travel, you will be at extreme risk. 
Landmines and unexploded bombs
 There is a continued risk of landmines and other unexploded ordinances following the end of the 2020-2022 northern Ethiopia conflict.
The main areas of risk are:
along the internal border between Tigray and Amhara regions.
along the international border with Eritrea
the rural regions and mountains in the south west of Tigray
Most incidents involve farmers in rural areas but be cautious and avoid traveling off the main roads in the affected areas.
Laws and cultural differences
Personal ID
Always carry a copy of the photo page of your passport and your visa and entry stamp. It is not a legal requirement to carry the original.
Religious customs
Ethiopia is religiously diverse and largely tolerant. However, many people are devout in their faith. Take care to not offend local traditions, customs, laws and religions. Dress conservatively and observe local customs. Take particular care if travelling:
during the Islamic holy month of Ramadan
to religious sites of the Ethiopian Orthodox Church
outside Addis Ababa, particularly in rural areas
Ramadan is individually observed but there are no official regulations imposed.
Health and safety
Health and safety precautions like life jackets in boats or protective railings at historical sites are rarely in place in Ethiopia.
Date and time
Traditionally Ethiopia has a different calendar and way of expressing time than are widely used internationally. 
Most documents issued by hotels and larger organisations, including airline tickets, use the international calendar and clock. However:
official documents are often dated using the Ethiopian calendar
individuals and smaller organisations might use the Ethiopian clock
Money
Ethiopia is a cash-based society. Banking facilities, including card payments and ATMs are limited, and unreliable, especially outside of cities. Make sure you have enough cash before leaving cities.
Illegal drugs and prison sentences
Drug offences are treated seriously in Ethiopia. Possession of drugs can lead to prison sentences of 5 to 10 years and potentially large fines. 
Khat is legal in Ethiopia, but it is illegal to take it out of the country. If you’re found with it in your baggage, the authorities are likely to prosecute you.
Alcohol
There are no restrictions on buying or possessing alcohol. This includes the predominantly Muslim regions although it may be more difficult to obtain.  
Dress code
Women are expected to dress conservatively, especially when visiting religious sites.   
LGBT+ travellers
Same-sex acts (applying to both sexes) are illegal and carry penalties of between 1 and 15 years in prison. Local authorities intimidate and detain owners and clients of hotels, bars and restaurants in Addis Ababa where same-sex activity is alleged to take place.
The public are not generally accepting of same-sex relationships. Some religious leaders have called for violence against the LGBT+ community. Showing affection in public may receive unwanted attention. It is dangerous to be openly (or covertly) LGBT+ in Ethiopia, and can lead to great personal risk. 
Read more advice for LGBT+ travellers.
Using cameras or drones in secure areas
It is illegal to take photos:
near military zones or of military personnel
near the Presidential Palace in Addis Ababa
anywhere that there are signs prohibiting photography
The use of drones is subject to permission from the Ethiopian Civil Aviation Authority and Information Network and Security Agency.
Transport risks
Road travel
If you are planning to drive in Ethiopia, see information on driving abroad.
You can use your UK driving licence to drive for up to 2 weeks. To drive for longer, contact the Ethiopian Ministry of Transport and Logistics to apply for an Ethiopian driving licence.     
Driving standards and vehicle maintenance are often poor and there are frequent traffic accidents, especially in Addis Ababa and on the Addis Ababa-Djibouti road. 
Drivers involved in car accidents can face severe punishments, including custodial sentences and fines. If you’re involved in a traffic accident, stay in your vehicle and call the local police. Avoid confrontation and wait for police to arrive to deal with any issues.
Travel from the airport and around Addis Ababa
Only use buses or taxis from the airport that have been organised by your hotel or travel company. If you are booking your own taxi, choose yellow or app-based taxis rather than the blue and white ones.  
Transport outside Addis Ababa   
Avoid driving after dark anywhere outside Addis Ababa. Vehicles often have no lights and livestock may stray onto the roads. 
Mobile networks are not consistent or reliable. The authorities may close down networks with no notice. You should consider travelling in convoy with at least one other vehicle.
Carry food and water, and ensure your vehicle is properly prepared and equipped. Medical facilities outside the capital are extremely limited so carry a comprehensive medical pack.
Local demonstrations have led to temporary road closures, although not all social media reports of such disruptions are accurate. If unsure, contact local authorities or reputable tour operators in the areas you’re travelling to.
If you come to a roadblock, follow advice of police or army personnel if they are present. If you encounter an unattended roadblock, turn around and do not attempt to pass it. 
Always leave details of your travel itinerary with a reliable person.
Public buses
There have been instances where buses from one region have been attacked when passing through another.
Extreme weather and natural disasters
Earthquakes
There is a risk of earthquakes and earth tremors. You should:
familiarise yourself with safety procedures in the event of an earthquake
follow advice given by the local authorities
call the Ethiopian emergency services on 939 if you are in immediate danger (it is likely they will answer in Amharic)
The US Federal Emergency Management Agency has advice about what to do before, during and after an earthquake.
