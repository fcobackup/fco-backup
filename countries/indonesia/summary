The Foreign and Commonwealth Office (FCO) advise against all travel within 4 kilometres of the Mount Agung crater in east Bali and within 7 kilometres of the Mount Sinabung crater in Kalo Regency, North Sumatra due to ongoing volcanic activity. These are exclusion zones put in place by the local authorities. If you’re in either exclusion zone, you should leave immediately.
On 11 May 2018, Mount Merapi, near Yogyakarta in central Java, erupted. The Indonesian authorities have set a 3km exclusion zone around the volcano. If you’re in the area, you should monitor local media, exercise caution and follow the advice of local authorities.
Eruptions of Mount Agung in east Bali led to periodic closures at Bali and Lombok airports in late 2017 and disruption to flights in the region. More recent eruptions of Mount Sinabung have not significantly disrupted local travel in Sumatra. The local authorities have indicated that both Mount Agung and Mount Sinabung continue to show signs of volcanic activity and the possibility of volcanic eruptions remains. Indonesia sits alongside a volatile seismic strip called the ‘Ring of Fire’ in the Pacific. Volcanic eruptions and earthquakes occur regularly, which can also present a potential threat of tsunamis. The alert level for Mount Agung, Mount Sinabung and other Indonesian volcanoes may change at little or short notice. See Natural disasters
The current period of increased volcanic activity affecting Mount Agung and Mount Sinabung may continue for some time and further disruption can’t be ruled out; volcanic activity can escalate very quickly with little or no notice. In the event of a major eruption, areas beyond the current exclusion zones may be affected, and the resulting ash plumes and release of particulate and gaseous pollutants into the air may have an impact on health. You should continue to monitor local media and keep up to date with this travel advice. See General volcano advice and Health for more information.
Around 360,000 British nationals visit Indonesia every year. Most visits are trouble free.
Terrorists are very likely to try to carry out attacks in Indonesia. Terrorist groups continue to plan attacks and have the capacity and intent to carry out these attacks at anytime and anywhere in the country. Types of attacks have included suicide bombing and small-arms fire, targeting public and crowded places.
The threat from Islamist extremism remains high, though the Indonesian authorities continue to disrupt attack planning, including arresting alleged terrorists reportedly in the advanced stages of preparation.
