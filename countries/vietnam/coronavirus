However, check carefully in advance whether these flights are guaranteed to fly. Flights and transit arrangements are still prone to changes and cancellation with little notice.
If you are returning to the UK, a transit stop in the journey may require you to self-quarantine on arrival. See guidance on entering or returning to the UK
There are some restrictions on airside transit which you should check in advance to ensure you can transit, particularly transit times, visa and transit visa requirements and whether your baggage can be transferred airside at transit points.
