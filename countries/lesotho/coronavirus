The Lesotho authorities have introduced a number of precautionary measures in response to the coronavirus (COVID-19) pandemic.
Visitors to Lesotho must travel or transit via South Africa. South Africa has put in place travel restrictions on individuals from countries affected by coronavirus, including the United Kingdom. A number of the border crossing points between South Africa and Lesotho have been closed including the crossing points at Tele Bridge, Peka Bridge and Sani Pass. Follow our travel advice for South Africa and consult your nearest South African High Commission for further information.
All travellers arriving in Lesotho will be screened for coronavirus. You should comply with any additional screening measures by the authorities if asked to go through extra checks. Anyone showing symptoms of coronavirus may be placed in an isolation facility in a government hospital.
All individuals who have been in coronavirus affected areas within the past 14 days, including the UK, are required to self-isolate for 14 days. The Prime Minister of Lesotho recently announced that this self-isolation period will take place in a government-nominated hotel at the visitorâ€™s expense.
If you need further information about entry requirements, contact the local immigration authorities or the nearest Lesotho High Commission. You should also check with your airline or travel company for the latest information.
Further information on coronavirus, including advice on preparing for foreign travel and helping reduce the spread of the virus, is available from Public Health England and on the TravelHealthPro website.
