Crime
Pick pocketing and street crime are risks in common parts of Dakar, particularly around Place de l’Independence, the central area of the Plateau and the Western Corniche.. This type of crime is more common in the run up to religious festivals. Recent examples have included attackers grabbing bags whilst driving scooters or motorbikes. You should be vigilant and take sensible precautions: e.g. avoid walking alone in the evening and after dark, be alert if using a mobile phone in public and avoid carrying valuables and bags in public.
If you’re expecting a greeter or driver to collect you at the airport, make sure they properly identify themselves before you set off. Fake greeters are known to operate at the airport.
British nationals are increasingly being targeted by scam artists operating in West Africa. The scams come in many forms (romance and friendship, business ventures, work and employment opportunities) and can pose great financial risk to victims. You should be cautious about requests for funds, a job offer, a business venture or a face to face meeting from someone you have been in correspondence with over the internet who lives in West Africa. This includes requests from people who claim to be victims of various Western African conflicts (notably refugees from Sierra Leone) or relatives of present or former political leaders.
Local travel
The Casamance region of south-western Senegal (between the southern border of Gambia and the northern border of Guinea-Bissau) has suffered for decades from low intensity separatist violence, largely directed at Senegalese security forces.
The security situation has improved significantly since 2012. The main faction of the separatist MFDC (Movement of the Democratic Forces of Casamance) declared a ceasefire in 2014, and political discussions with the government are ongoing. Armed separatist groups are however, still present in Casamance, and the region continues to suffer from banditry. On 7 January 2018, 13 Senegalese nationals were killed, and a further seven injured in an attack by gunmen in the Casamance region in the south of Senegal. The incident took place in the forest of Boffa-Bayotte, in the département of Ziguinchor, where the victims were reported to have been gathering wood.
There’s a lower level of risk in the main tourist areas of the Casamance, notably Cap Skirring, the city of Ziguinchor, and the residential areas along the Casamance River.
You should be vigilant when travelling to the west of Kolda. Where possible avoid travelling at night and stick to the main road from Ziguinchor to Cap Skirring (which is frequently used by groups of tourists during daylight hours) and the main road north of the Guinea-Bissau/ Senegal border, from Sao Domingos to Ziguinchor (N4 bis (Route National 4 bis). You should monitor the local security situation before travelling. On other roads you should travel in convoy where possible. The N4 and N5 roads in the Casamance region are closed each night from 10pm to 6am.
Land mines remain a hazard in certain areas of the Casamance, and have caused several hundred deaths since 1990. De-mining operations are ongoing. You should stick to paved roads. If you must leave paved roads, seek local advice.
Road travel
You can drive in Senegal with a valid UK driving licence for up to 6 months, or on a valid International Driving Permit. If you’re staying longer or living in Senegal, you’ll need to get a Senegalese driving licence.
While some main roads are of good quality, other roads can be poor especially during the rainy season from June to September. Torrential rains can cause floods and landslides. Monitor local weather reports and expect difficulties when travelling during the rainy season.
Driving standards are unpredictable. Some taxis and public mini-buses (‘car rapide’) are not roadworthy by UK standards.
Traffic in the Dakar area is heavy and you should take particular care and attention to avoid accidents. Driving after dark is more dangerous because of poor street and vehicle lighting. If you do have an accident you must contact the police and wait for them to arrive at the scene. In more remote areas you may need to go directly to the nearest police station in order to report the incident.
Political situation
Avoid any demonstrations or large gatherings of people.
