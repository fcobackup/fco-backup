The British Embassy is exploring options to enable British nationals who want to depart El Salvador to do so, but this will take some time. In the meantime there is no reason to believe that you are at heightened risk in El Salvador. The FCO strongly encourages non-resident British nationals in El Salvador, and residents who are considering leaving, to follow the situation closely in case a flight is permitted, and to leave as soon as possible, given the growing restrictions on flights within the region and to the UK. Make sure you have informed your family or friends where you are and of your situation.
Local travel agents (or airlines, though these may be difficult to reach) are often a more reliable source of information on if/when flights might operate and have availability; the British Embassy will also try to share information on @UKinElSalvador on Twitter. Please also check FCO travel advice for any countries you will transit en route. Contact the local immigration office if your visa is about to expire.
The British Embassy office is now closed and staff are working remotely. British Nationals requiring consular assistance should call +503 2511-5757 and follow the options for the Consular Emergency call centre, but please be patient getting through due to the volume of calls at present.
See additional advice on making travel plans to return to the UK, or what to do if you cannot depart immediately.
