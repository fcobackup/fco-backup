Central Sulawesi earthquake
A 7.4 magnitude earthquake and tsunami hit Central Sulawesi on 28 September 2018, affecting the Donggala, Palu, Mamuju, Utara, Sigi and Parigi Moutong regions. Casualty figures are significant and are still being assessed, with rescue and humanitarian relief operations on-going. Communications, water and electricity supplies, buildings and transport infrastructure have been severely damaged. The British Embassy in Jakarta is monitoring the situation closely and liaising with the Indonesian authorities to establish facts. There is a continued risk of aftershocks. If you’re in the area you should exercise caution, stay away from collapsed buildings, monitor the local news, liaise with your travel company/accommodation provider and seek advice and support from the local authorities on how to leave the area safely if you wish to do so. More information and advice on safety considerations in an active earthquake zone is available from the International Rescue Corps.
If you have essential upcoming travel in these areas or plan to travel for non-essential reasons against FCO advice, you should plan your journey very carefully, have robust contingency plans in place and check with your travel insurance provider.
Lombok earthquake
There were a series of major earthquakes and a significant number of aftershocks to the north-east of the island of Lombok in late July and August 2018, with tremors still being felt in September. The earthquakes resulted in over 500 deaths and significant damage to buildings and infrastructure, most severely in northern and western areas of Lombok, north of the capital Mataram. The FCO advise against all but essential travel to these areas.
The Gili Islands (Gili Trewangan, Gili Meno and Gili Air) were also significantly affected by the earthquakes. However they have recovered rapidly, with utilities and transport connections restored. The FCO no longer advise against all but essential travel to the Gili Islands. However, if travelling to the islands you should exercise caution around any severely damaged buildings.
Ngurah Rai (Denpasar) and Lombok airports and the major tourist resorts in Bali and southern Lombok are operating as normal.
If you’re in northern Lombok, you should exercise caution, stay away from collapsed buildings and follow the advice of the local authorities. If you have essential upcoming travel in these areas or plan to travel for non-essential reasons against FCO advice, you should plan your journey very carefully, have robust contingency plans in place and check with your travel insurance provider. In other areas of Lombok, check any existing travel plans with your transport and accommodation providers before travelling, ensure you have travel insurance in place and keep up to date with developments, including through this travel advice.
Summary of other advice
There are many active volcanoes in Indonesia, any of which can erupt with little or no warning. This often results in the evacuation of villages within a 3 to 7 kilometre radius and disruption to air travel in the wider region. In the past, repeated eruptions have caused destruction and fatalities. Check media reports before travelling to areas that are prone to volcanic activity. The local alert level may change at short notice. Take extra care and follow the advice of local authorities, including respecting any exclusion zones. See Natural disasters
Terrorists are very likely to try to carry out attacks in Indonesia. Terrorist groups continue to plan attacks and have the capacity and intent to carry out these attacks at anytime and anywhere in the country. Types of attacks have included suicide bombing and small-arms fire, targeting public and crowded places. Be vigilant and take care at all times.
