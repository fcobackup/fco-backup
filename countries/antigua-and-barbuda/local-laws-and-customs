There are severe penalties for all drug offences. Pack all luggage yourself and don’t carry anything through customs for anyone else.

Local attitudes towards the LGBT community are mostly conservative throughout the Caribbean. Public displays of affection (such as hand-holding or kissing) between opposite or same-sex couples are uncommon. Whilst Antigua and Barbuda no longer has legislation against same-sex sexual acts, LGBT travellers should be mindful of local attitudes and be aware that public displays of affection may attract unwanted and negative attention. See our information and advice page for the LGBT community before you travel.
