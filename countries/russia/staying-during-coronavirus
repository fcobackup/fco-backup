This page gives you guidance on how to stay safely in Russia as a visitor, if you are unable to return to the UK.
Everyone should comply with the measures put in place in Russia to limit the spread of coronavirus (COVID-19).
Moving around in Russia
For information on entering Russia, see Entry requirements
The Federal Government has delegated responsibility for a gradual, phased relaxation of restrictions to the regional authorities. It is therefore possible different restrictions will be in force in different regions. You should follow regional advice. The latest advice for Moscow is available on the Mayor’s website.
From 1 June in Moscow it is mandatory to wear a face mask at all times when leaving your place of residence and gloves in stores or other institutions, at work and when travelling by any type of public transport or taxi.
Social distancing of 1.5 metres is to be followed everywhere except in taxis.
Visas
Temporary measures have been introduced to regulate the legal status of foreign nationals in the Russian Federation in response to COVID-19. Therefore, if your visa or residence permit expires between March 15th and June 15th 2020 it is not necessary to apply for an extension to leave the country within 93 days, counting from the date your visa expired. The procedure to extend visas after 15th June will depend on any further COVID-19 measures being imposed.
If your visa expired before March 15th you will need to contact your nearest police office for more information.
If you live in Moscow and wish to extend your visa or migration registration, the Moscow Ministry of Interior urges you to visit your district police office at the earliest convenience. You can find the working hours and contact details for district police offices on the Moscow Ministry of Interior’s website (link may only open in Chrome).
If you live outside of Moscow you should check the guidance from your local police office.
Health
If you show any symptoms of coronavirus, such as respiratory illness or a temperature, you and your cohabitants are required to self-isolate even if you haven’t been tested. You will only be permitted to go outside in order to seek medical help. In Moscow you will need a digital code for this journey if using transport, details can be found on the Moscow City website.

Finance
There is a range of financial support from the government that you can access while you are unable to return due to coronavirus restrictions.
If you’re in Russia, and have exhausted all other options to cover essential living costs while you wait to return home, you could apply for an emergency loan for your living costs from the UK government. You can only apply if you normally live in the UK and you cannot return home. This last-resort option is for those most in need, and you would need to repay the loan when you are back in the UK. Apply for an emergency loan.

Help and support
If you need urgent consular assistance, contact your nearest British embassy, high commission or consulate. All telephone numbers are available 24/7.
