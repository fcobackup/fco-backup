Entry and borders
Given the fast changing situation, you should check the latest entry requirements for your destination and keep in touch with your airline, cruise line or tour operator. New restrictions may be imposed with little warning. Some airlines are imposing their own additional restrictions on travelers, different from the Mexican government guidelines. These restrictions may apply for domestic and international flights. Review the airline requirements carefully before purchasing any flights and before you travel.
On 20th April, the Mexican government confirmed that the land border between the US and Mexico will remain closed to all non-essential traffic for a further 30 days. This closure applies primarily to tourism and recreational travel. Cargo, trade and healthcare workers will still be able to cross the border. Please check with your closest US Embassy/Consulate before attempting to cross the border.
There have been reports of disruptions and tensions at the Mexico-Guatemala border. Periodic closures are possible and you are advised to check with local authorities before attempting to cross the land border. There have been reports of foreigners being held up in the neutral zone between both countries, after leaving Guatemala by land. Once foreigners leave Guatemala, you will not be allowed re-entry. Although Mexico’s border remains open, local communities at the border with Guatemala have been blocking foreigners from entering the country and passing through their towns. Before you try to cross the land border between Guatemala and Mexico, you should speak to local authorities on both sides to establish if it’s safe to cross.
Local measures
The government has declared a national health emergency, and the suspension of all non-essential activities in the public and private sector until 30 May.
People should remain at home wherever possible, and particularly the over 60s, those with underlying medical conditions, and pregnant women.
Hotels will no longer receive reservations and only some hotels are authorised to offer limited accommodation to foreign nationals for humanitarian reasons. The Mexican Ministry of Tourism and Ministry of Health request that non-resident foreign nationals currently in Mexico return to their home countries immediately.
Events of more than 50 people are discouraged.
If you are a resident in Mexico, you should follow the advice of the local authorities. Individual states in Mexico are imposing additional measures and restrictions; please review your local government website for detailed information on where you live.
Healthcare
If you present symptoms upon arrival at an airport in Mexico, you should ask for the International Health Team (“Sanidad Internacional”). If you present symptoms after having entered the country, you should call 800 0044 800. You will be attended by trained personnel of the Ministry of Health. For further information (in Spanish), please see the Mexican Ministry of Health website.
