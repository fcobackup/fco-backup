The authorities in Suriname set and enforce entry rules. For further information contact the embassy, high commission or consulate of the country or territory you’re travelling to. You should also consider checking with your transport provider or travel company to make sure your passport and other travel documents meet their requirements.

Restrictions include enhanced medical screening and border closures, which is stopping people travelling into and out of the country and limiting those who wish to leave. See Return to the UK
