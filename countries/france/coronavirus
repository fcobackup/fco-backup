Travel in France
There continues to be a sharp rise in the number of COVID-19 cases in France. France has put measures in place to limit the spread of the virus.
The French government has introduced curfews in large parts of the country, where the virus is in high circulation. In these regions, people are required to remain at home from 9pm-6am. Outings within the curfew hours are only permitted in certain specified circumstances and authorised with a certificate, this can be accessed with further details at this French government website. Other restrictions include the partial or total closure of bars, and a ‘rule of six’ limiting the number of people allowed to gather at home or in restaurants. To find out more about local restrictions, please refer to the French government website as well as local guidance.
Public spaces and services
Wearing face masks in enclosed public spaces has been compulsory since 20 July. This applies to those aged 11 and over. Local authorities in an increasing number of cities and regions (including Paris), have extended this to also include outdoor public spaces. Failure to comply with these restrictions may result in a fine. Please refer to local guidance for more information.
Since 11 May, wearing masks on public transport has been compulsory for all users aged 11 and over, with fines for those who are not compliant. Masks are also compulsory in taxis and private hire vehicles without a plexiglass screen.
Some travel operators such as airlines may specify types of masks to be worn on board e.g. surgical masks, and may encourage you to take spares for long journeys. Please check with your travel operator before travelling.
