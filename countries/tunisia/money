Coronavirus guidance is being updated.
Read the Prime Minister’s statement for the latest information.

ATMs are widely available though they don’t always work. Almost all ATMs will accept Visa cards, and many (including Bank of Tunisia and BIAT) will also accept Maestro cards for cash withdrawals.
UK issued credit and debit cards are accepted in some but not all of the larger shops, restaurants and hotels. In places that do take cards, there can be problems authorising Mastercard purchases. Travellers Cheques are accepted in some hotels but not others.
It is strictly prohibited to take Tunisian dinars out of the country. To exchange any Tunisian dinars left over at the end of your stay into Sterling or other hard currency you will need to show the receipt from the bank where you first withdrew the dinars. Please note that receipts from cash machines are not accepted.
