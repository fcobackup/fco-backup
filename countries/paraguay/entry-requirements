This page reflects the UK government’s understanding of current rules for people travelling on a full ‘British Citizen’ passport, for the most common types of travel.
The authorities in Paraguay set and enforce entry rules. For further information contact the embassy, high commission or consulate of the country or territory you’re travelling to. You should also consider checking with your transport provider or travel company to make sure your passport and other travel documents meet their requirements.
Entry rules in response to coronavirus
Non-resident foreign nationals may enter Paraguay subject to compliance with health protocols.
From 21 August 2021, the Paraguayan government no longer requires mandatory quarantine for incoming travellers who have been fully vaccinated and upload their vaccination card or vaccination certificate when filling the online health declaration form, available on the Paraguayan Health Ministry website.
The new policy will be in place for 30 days and entails the following: all individuals over the age of 12, regardless of their vaccination status, must take a RT-PCR, LAMP or NAAT test within 72 hours before embarkation or an antigen test within 24 hours before embarkation. Children under the age of 12 are not required to take a test. Those individuals who have tested positive for COVID-19 in the last 14 to 90 days prior to their arrival, also may enter without a current test if they have documentation from their health care provider and laboratory results showing positive antigens.
Fully vaccinated travellers must present a negative test result, fill the online health declaration form, available on the Paraguayan Health Ministry website, and upload their vaccination certificate or vaccination card issued by their country’s health authority upon filling the online form, prior to embarkation and arrival to the country. (‘See ‘Demonstrating your COVID-19 status’)
Fully vaccinated travellers will not have to quarantine if they provide these documents. Individuals are considered fully vaccinated only 14 days after receiving final dose of their COVID-19 vaccine.
Individuals over the age of 12 who are not fully vaccinated before travelling to Paraguay must present a negative test result and the Paraguayan online health declaration form upon embarkation and arrival. Travellers who are unvaccinated and those not fully vaccinated over the age of 12, will continue to have to quarantine for five days after the date of their pre-departure test (the first day counting from 24 hours after the test was taken).
After arriving in Paraguay all individuals over the age of 12, regardless of vaccination status, should take a RT-PCR test from a public or private laboratory authorised by the Ministry of Public Health’s Central Laboratory on the fifth day after their pre-departure test.
In the event of a positive RT-PCR test on the fifth day, individuals should quarantine for an additional seven days. Individuals may leave quarantine in the event of a negative test.
More information about the new entry requirement policy can be found on the Paraguayan Health Ministry website.
Foreign travellers must complete an online health declaration available on the Paraguayan Health Ministry website. All travellers must complete the health card at the time of entering the country at the immigration check informing the Paraguayan Ministry of Health of any potential issues or exposure.
Non-resident foreigners, or within another MERCOSUR country, must present international medical insurance with complete health coverage to include attention to COVID-19 cases, PCR tests, laboratory studies, outpatient care, hospitalisation, and stays in the ICU. Children under 18 years old that have a mother or father with Paraguayan nationality are exempt from this requirement.
All people entering the country must comply with the sanitary measures imposed by the Ministry of Health, such as physical distancing, use of facemasks and frequent hand washing.
Demonstrating your COVID-19 status
Paraguay will accept the UK’s proof of COVID-19 recovery and vaccination record. Your NHS appointment card from vaccination centres is not designed to be used as proof of vaccination and should not be used to demonstrate your vaccine status.
Visas
From 2 November 2020, tourists and non-resident foreigners who are still within Paraguayan national territory and whose period of lawful stay in the country has expired, must pay the corresponding penalty (Gs. 253,050) when registering their departure at the border post or airport immigration control or when approaching the offices of the Direccion General de Migraciones.
Likewise, foreign citizens whose temporary residence has expired must approach the Direccion General de Migraciones to obtain a new residence card, pay the corresponding penalty in case of being in breach and update their immigration status.
If you are in Paraguay and your period of lawful stay has expired, contact the Direccion General de Migraciones for further information.
You can find more information on the Paraguayan Dirección General de Migraciones website (in Spanish).
Regular entry requirements
Visas
British Passport holders do not need a visa to enter Paraguay. On presentation of a valid British passport you will normally be granted a 90-day stay in the country.
You must make sure on arrival that your passport is stamped by an immigration official, dated and signed. Anybody without an entry stamp in their passport will be fined when they leave the country. This is particularly important for anyone entering Paraguay at a land border, typically the crossing between Ciudad del Este and Foz de Iguazu (Brazil). Sometimes long distance bus drivers tell foreign nationals that they can complete immigration formalities in Asunción. This is not true, and visitors will incur a fine if they do not get their passport stamped at the point of entry.
If you wish to extend your stay for another 90-day period, seek advice from the Direccion General de Migraciones.
If you are travelling to Paraguay to work or study you should contact the Paraguayan Embassy in London.
Passport validity
Your passport should be valid for the proposed duration of your stay. No additional period of validity beyond this is required.
Travelling with children
If you’re under 18, travelling across borders in the region without one or both parents, it’s advisable to have written permission to travel from both parents, duly certified by the Paraguayan Embassy in London, or your nearest Paraguayan Embassy. Single parents or other adults travelling alone with children should be aware that immigration officers often request documentary evidence of parental responsibility before allowing lone parents to enter the country or, in some cases, before permitting the children to leave the country. For more information on this contact the Paraguayan Embassy in London.
Yellow fever certificate requirements
Check whether you need a yellow fever certificate by visiting the National Travel Health Network and Centre’s TravelHealthPro website.
UK Emergency Travel Documents
UK Emergency Travel Documents are accepted for entry, airside transit and exit from Paraguay. The validity requirements are the same as for full validity British passports. If you plan to travel to Argentina or the US you will need a visa in your ETD. You must contact the nearest Embassies of those countries in order to apply.
Be aware that the British Embassy in Asunción does not produce ETDs. In case you require an ETD it will be done so through the British Embassy in Buenos Aires.
