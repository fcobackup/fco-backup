Entry rules in response to coronavirus (COVID-19)
Entry to Solomon Islands
All countries with the exception of Australia, New Zealand, China, Taiwan and neighbouring South Pacific island nations (not Papua New Guinea or French Polynesia) have been designated by Solomon Islands as ‘high risk’ for COVID-19. Prospective travellers who have been in a ‘high risk’ country must spend 28 days in a low risk country before being considered eligible to enter Solomon Islands. This is unlikely to change until at least February 2021.
There is a complete prohibition on yachts or pleasure craft entering Solomon Islands territory by sea. This applies to all ports and islands in the territory. You may not enter Solomon Islands by yacht or pleasure craft. Mariners in distress seeking entry as an emergency safe haven should make all efforts to contact Solomon Islands Authorities well in advance of entering. The penalties for entering Solomon Islands by yacht or pleasure craft without permission include forfeiture of the boat, imprisonment, fine and deportation.
Prospective incoming air passengers must be approved for travel into Solomon Islands by the Solomon Islands government.
You will have to show evidence of at least 3 negative coronavirus tests prior to travelling. These tests should be undertaken 21 days before travel (first test) 12-14 days before travel (second test) and 48 hours before travel (third test). You should not use the NHS testing service to get a test in order to facilitate your travel to another country. You should arrange to take a private test.
Quarantine for a minimum of 14 days (for travel from designated ‘low risk’ country) is mandatory on arrival and all passengers will undertake at least 3 COVID tests before being permitted to leave quarantine. Non-Solomon Islanders will be expected to pay for quarantine in one of the local hotels.
If you are already in Solomon Islands and hold a short term visa for Solomon Islands which is close to expiry, you should contact Solomon Island Immigration to get your visa extended. If you are outside Solomon Islands and have a work permit, visa or exemption, you should contact the Ministry of Commerce and Immigration before beginning the return process; visa conditions may have changed since your visa was issued.
Quarantine requirements
Entering the country illegally/not observing the mandatory 14 day quarantine period could result in a fine of up to SBD 1 million (approx. £100,000) and/or 20 years imprisonment.
Testing / screening on arrival
All incoming travellers eligible to enter the country must complete a Traveller’s Public Health Declaration card. You must provide full details of your place of stay, travel itinerary and current personal contact details in Solomon Islands for 14 days after your arrival/quarantine in Solomon Islands.
You should comply with any additional screening measures put in place by the authorities. If you need further information about entry requirements, contact the local immigration authorities or the nearest Solomon Islands high commission. You should also check with your airline or travel company for the latest information.

A vaccine card (yellow card) or other documentation that lists the measles vaccine as having been administered at any date prior to the 15 days stipulated, or in childhood.
