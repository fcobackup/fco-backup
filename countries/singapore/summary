There is an ongoing outbreak of coronavirus (COVID-19) globally, including Singapore. The Singapore government has introduced a number of measures to limit the spread of the virus.
From 23 March at 23:59 local time, no short-term visitors from anywhere in the world will be able to enter or transit through Singapore.
In addition, the Singaporean Ministry of Manpower will only allow work pass holders and/or their dependents to enter/return to Singapore if they work in essential services eg. healthcare and transport. These work pass holders are required to obtain approval from the Ministry of Manpower before they start their journey.
Permanent Residents will be permitted to return to Singapore but will be issued with a 14-day Stay at Home Notice. Anyone under a Stay at Home Notice must remain in their place of residence at all times for the full period.
This significant tightening of restrictions on those who can enter or transit via Singapore is likely to have an impact on the availability of flight options to leave Singapore.
British nationals in Singapore who wish to leave, including visitors, should make arrangements to do so as soon as possible. You may otherwise find you are not able to leave Singapore when you had planned to.
