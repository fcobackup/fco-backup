Smoking has been banned throughout Switzerland in the workplace and in most enclosed spaces accessible to the public, including bars, restaurants, cinemas, schools, shopping centres and sports centres. Exceptions can be made at a local level where smoking licences are sometimes granted to small restaurants, cafés and bars. Larger restaurants and bars have the option of providing separate areas for smokers.
It’s illegal to cover your face in public places in the Italian-speaking Swiss canton of Ticino. Failure to comply with the ban is punishable by a fine ranging from 100 CHF to 10,000 CHF. The law doesn’t provide any exemption for tourists.
