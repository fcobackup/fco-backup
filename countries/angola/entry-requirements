Warning
FCDO advises against all but essential travel to parts of Angola.

This information is for people travelling on a full ‘British citizen’ passport from the UK. It is based on the UK government’s understanding of Angola’s current rules for the most common types of travel.
The authorities in Angola set and enforce entry rules. If you’re not sure how these requirements apply to you, check with the Angolan immigration department or contact the Consulate General of Angola in the UK.
Passport validity requirements 
Your passport must have an ‘expiry date’ at least 6 months after the date you arrive in Angola and have at least 2 blank pages.  
Check with your travel provider that your passport and other travel documents meet requirements. Renew your passport if you need to.  
You will be denied entry if you do not have a valid travel document or try to use a passport that has been reported lost or stolen. 
Visa requirements 
You do not need a visa to visit Angola for up to 30 days.  
If travelling for work, study or business, you must get a visa in advance. If you do not have a visa, or if you have the wrong visa, you may be stopped from boarding or detained at the airport on arrival. Angola’s deportation process can take a long time.  
You can be fined 15,000 Angolan kwanzas a day if you overstay your visa. You may not be allowed to leave the country until your fine has been paid. You may also not be allowed to re-enter Angola. 
The Angolan authorities can fine you for visa offences, including: 
working, studying or living in Angola without the correct visa 
changing employment without notifying the authorities 
employing staff with incorrect visas 
failing to renew residence cards  
changing address without notifying the authorities 
Vaccine requirements 
There is a risk of yellow fever transmission in Angola. This means you will need a certificate of yellow fever vaccination for some onward travel, including to South Africa. 
For full details about health entry requirements and recommended vaccinations, see TravelHealthPro’s Angola guide. 
Customs rules 
There are strict rules about goods you can take into or out of Angola. You must declare anything that may be prohibited or subject to tax or duty. 
Taking money into and out of Angola 
Declare cash or travellers cheques if the value is 5,000 US dollars or more (10,000 if you’re a resident). You’ll get a certified declaration to show you brought it in with you.  
You cannot take out more than 5,000 US dollars (10,000 if you’re a resident) or its equivalent in any foreign currency.   
You can take out up to 50,000 kwanzas in cash in addition to the foreign currency. 
Officials at the airport may search you to make sure you’re not leaving the country with more than the allowed amount.
