Hurricanes
Hurricane Tammy is forecast to affect St Kitts and Nevis; hurricane-strength winds and flooding are possible.  You should follow and monitor local and international weather updates from SKN Information Service and the US National Hurricane Centre, and follow the advice of local authorities, including any evacuation orders.
The hurricane season normally runs from June to November. This means tropical storm conditions are possible.
See our Tropical cyclones page for advice about how to prepare effectively and what to do if youâ€™re likely to be affected by a hurricane or tropical cyclone.
Earthquakes
Earthquakes are a potential threat and tremors are felt occasionally in the Caribbean. In the event of an earthquake, you should be directed by the local authorities.
