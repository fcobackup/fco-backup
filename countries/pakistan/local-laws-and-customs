Coronavirus guidance is being updated.
Read the Prime Minister’s statement for the latest information.

Local laws reflect the fact that Pakistan is a Muslim country. You should respect local traditions, customs and laws at all times and be aware of your actions to ensure that they do not offend.
Avoid eating, drinking or smoking in public during daylight hours during Ramazan (Ramadan). There may also be a higher risk of terrorist incidents during this month. Avoid large gatherings and exercise caution and remain vigilant at hotels, airports, markets, shopping malls and restaurants. For more information, see our Travelling during Ramadan page and Terrorism section.
You should dress modestly at all times. Men and women should cover their shoulders and legs when in public. Women should cover their heads when entering mosques or other holy places, and when travelling in rural areas.
Homosexuality is illegal. See our information and advice page for the LGBT community before you travel.
Cohabitation by an unmarried couple is illegal.
If you or your parents were born in Pakistan, you might be considered a Pakistani national by the local authorities even if you don’t hold a Pakistani passport, and the British government may be prevented from providing the full range of consular assistance.
You should carry some form of photo ID at all times.
Possession of even small quantities of illegal drugs can lead to imprisonment. A number of British nationals have been arrested on drug trafficking charges and face long periods in detention on remand as their cases make their way through the Pakistan legal system. Drug trafficking can attract the death penalty.
Importing alcohol and pork products is illegal.
The death penalty can and has been imposed for crimes including blasphemy, murder, drug offences, rape and unlawful assembly.
Don’t take photographs at military establishments, airports or any infrastructure, including bridges and dams including from aircraft. In the past British nationals have been arrested on suspicion of ‘spying’. Seek permission from any official, especially in border areas.
