Emergency services are ill equipped to cope with a major disaster. Should a hurricane strike Haiti, basic services such as transport and communications are likely to be severely disrupted.
Flash floods and landslides occur regularly.
Hurricanes
Hurricane Matthew, which made landfall in Haiti in October 2016, left much of the south and west devastated. That part of the country is still recovering. While most areas are accessible again, some rural areas are still difficult to reach by road. Access to clean water and food supplies in those areas are still a challenge.
The Atlantic hurricane season runs from June to November. You should monitor local and international weather updates from the National Hurricane Centre and follow the advice of local authorities.
See our Tropical Cyclones page for advice about what to do if youâ€™re caught up in a storm.
Earthquakes
There are occasional earthquakes in Haiti. The most significant in recent years hit Haiti in 2010 causing mass casualties and extensive damage to infrastructure in the Port au Prince area.
If a major earthquake occurs close to shore, you should follow the instructions of the local authorities, bearing in mind that a tsunami could arrive within minutes.
The US Federal Emergency Management Agency has advice about what to do before during and after an earthquake and tsunami.
