This information is for people travelling on a full ‘British citizen’ passport from the UK. It is based on the UK government’s understanding of the current rules for the most common types of travel.
The authorities in Japan set and enforce entry rules. If you’re not sure how these requirements apply to you, contact the Japanese Embassy in the UK.
COVID-19 rules
There are no COVID-19 testing or vaccination requirements for travellers entering Japan.  
Passport validity requirements  
If you’re visiting Japan, your passport must be valid for the length of your stay. No additional period of validity is required. You need a blank page for your visa stamp.
Check with your travel provider that your passport and other travel documents meet requirements. Renew your passport if you need to.
You will be denied entry if you do not have a valid travel document or try to use a passport that has been reported lost or stolen.
Visa requirements
You can get a visa on arrival in Japan for tourism or business for up to 90 days. You do not need to apply before you travel.
If you need a multiple-entry visa, you must ask the immigration officials when you arrive. 
If you want to stay longer, you can apply at your nearest immigration office for an extension for another 90 days. Your passport must be valid for the period of the extension.
For long-term stays or to work or study, you must meet the Japanese government’s entry requirements. Check which type of visa you need. It is illegal to work in Japan without the correct visa no matter how informal or temporary the work.
If you overstay your permission to remain in Japan, you risk arrest, detention and a heavy fine.
For residency information, see the Japanese Immigration Services Agency website and read about living in Japan.
Vaccine requirements
For details about medical entry requirements and recommended vaccinations, see TravelHealthPro’s Japan guide.
Customs rules
There are strict rules about goods you can take into or out of Japan. You must declare anything that may be prohibited or subject to tax or duty.
Taking food into Japan 
It is illegal to bring meat products including sausages, bacon and ham to Japan without permission from the Japanese Animal Quarantine Service. Penalties include a heavy fine and prison sentence.
Whale meat is available in Japan but importing it into the UK and EU is illegal. If you import whale meat to the UK, you can get a fine of up to £5,000 and a prison sentence. Customs officers will seize the meat.
Taking money into Japan 
Japan is still a predominantly cash-based society. You may have difficulty using credit and debit cards issued outside Japan. Cirrus, Maestro, Link and Delta cash cards are not widely accepted. Japanese post offices, 7-Eleven stores and JP Post Bank have cash machines that will accept some foreign cards during business hours.
