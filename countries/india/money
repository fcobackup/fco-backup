In November 2016, the Prime Minister announced that old 500 and 1,000 Rupee banknotes would be withdrawn from immediate circulation. It’s no longer possible for non-Indian nationals to exchange these old notes. For more information and advice about how to get access to cash, visit the Reserve Bank of India website
There are restrictions on bringing Indian rupees into India. Visitors, including tourists, are not permitted to bring any amount of Indian currency into the country. If you’re visiting India, you can bring cash or travellers’ cheques (in pounds sterling or another foreign currency) and/or a bank card with you and exchange or withdraw rupees once in India. If you’re resident in India, you can bring up to INR 7,500 into the country.
