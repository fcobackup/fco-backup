The area around State House in Harare (the President’s official residence) is patrolled by armed members of the Presidential Guard. They don’t allow loitering, by motorists, cyclists or pedestrians, and photography is strictly prohibited. The roads in this area are closed at night (from 6pm – 6am). Avoid using GPS navigation systems around the President’s Residence and if possible avoid the area altogether.
Holding dual nationality (i.e. holding a Zimbabwean and a foreign passport at the same time) has been prohibited under Zimbabwean law since 1984. Following the passage of a new constitution in 2013, this legal position has been subject to some debate and the Constitutional Court recently ruled that some categories of dual nationality were in fact legal. However, the legislation remains inconsistent and it is possible that the Zimbabwean authorities may obstruct, detain or even seek to prosecute those they consider offenders. The British Embassy is not able to provide the full range of consular services to people with dual British and Zimbabwean nationality.
Conservative attitudes towards same-sex relations, especially between men, prevail in Zimbabwe. Sex between men is considered to be “sexual deviancy” and an “unnatural sexual act” under local law, which are illegal. Same-sex marriage is explicitly prohibited by the 2013 constitution. However, there is a small but active underground gay scene in Harare and prosecutions are rare. Public displays of affection may cause offence, regardless of gender or sexuality. See our information and advice page for the LGBT community before you travel. You can also find more local information on the GALZ Association website.
