Moving around in Turkey

The wearing of masks is obligatory in crowded places and specifically in markets and supermarkets. The wearing of masks is also compulsory on all public transport, including Metro, buses and ferries, and in some areas, masks must be worn when travelling in private vehicles with more than one person.
Measures may vary across provinces and new measures may be introduced at short notice. Follow Turkish announcements and local media for up to date information.

The government of Turkey has announced its intention to continue to impose weekend curfews throughout the month of May.
