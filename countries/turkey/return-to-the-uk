The Turkish government has begun to reopen its international land, sea and air borders. Scheduled passenger flights will resume on an individual country basis, subject to coordination with the Ministry of Health. Direct, scheduled passenger flights between Turkey and the UK resumed on 11 June. All passengers, of all nationalities, who meet Turkish immigration rules are permitted entry to Turkey from 12 June.
If you live in the UK and are currently visiting Turkey, but wish to return to the UK, you are advised to take one of the newly operating commercial flights.
Turkey has opened its land crossings into Turkey from Greece, Bulgaria, Georgia and Iraq. The land crossing from Iran remains closed. Leaving Turkey via these land borders is subject to any entry restrictions imposed in the country of arrival. You should check the relevant FCO Travel Advice page for that country for further information.
Sea ports of entry into Turkey are now open.

See ‘Travelling to the Airport’ section below for guidance on what documentation you may need.
Flying to / from Turkish Airports
The Turkish Government have implemented a series of additional requirements at Turkish airports, including measures which apply to passengers. It is important to comply with these measures, as not doing so could mean you are prevented from travelling.
Passengers wishing to depart from Turkey will be subject to temperature checks using thermal cameras or remote thermometers, prior to entering the airport terminal;
Passengers arriving into Turkey will be subject to a medical evaluation for symptoms of coronavirus, which will include temperature checks using thermal cameras or remote thermometers, on exit from the aircraft and/or inside the airport terminal;
Anyone showing symptoms including high fever, coughing or respiratory difficulties will be required to undergo a PCR swab test for coronavirus. See the guide to COVID-19 tests for details. In the event that a test returns a positive result, you will be provided with medical treatment at a facility determined by the Ministry of Health or, if preferred, at a private medical facility in Turkey at your own expense.
Entrance into airports is restricted to staff and arriving or departing passengers, and no family members, friends or others may enter with you, or meet you on arrival;
Departing and arriving passengers are required to wear a mask at all times whilst within the airport terminal and on all flights to and from Turkey. There may be penalties for not wearing a mask, including fines;
There will be random temperature checks conducted by thermal cameras within the airport terminal;
Social distancing measures are applied within the airport, and there is signage and announcements made in English and Turkish;
Passengers are not permitted to carry cabin baggage, other than a laptop computer, handbag, briefcase and baby items with a maximum weight of 4kgs. All other baggage must be checked in;
Security measures are applied to minimise physical contact, however where it is necessary, appropriate personal protective equipment will be utilised by security staff. Please be aware that if you do not consent to physical contact, where it is deemed necessary, you may be refused travel;
Passengers travelling to Turkey, will be asked to provide the residential address of where they will reside, within the borders of Turkey, and their contact information;
Passengers may be asked by their airline to provide personal information regarding COVID-19 that may be shared with Ministry of Health and third countries when necessary. Anyone who knowingly provides false information may be prevented from travelling.
Additionally:
Shops and restaurants open within airports may be limited;
Airport and airline staff will be required to wear personal protective equipment appropriate to their role, which may include masks, gloves and face/eye protection;
Enhanced cleaning and disinfectant procedures are in operation, with hand sanitizer dispensers installed throughout airports;
Ventilation systems in airports have been changed to provide fresh air, where it is possible;
Airlines may provide an amended in-flight catering service.
Please also be aware that the Turkish Ministry of Health has the authority to refuse travel to anyone they consider unsuitable to travel, either to or from Turkey.
Travelling to the airport
Turkey has now lifted most restrictions on internal travel.
Anyone wishing to undertake intercity travel using public transport is required to obtain an “HES” (“Hayat Eve Sığar”) code. This can be done through the e-Devlet system, the Hayat Eve Sığar’ smartphone application and by SMS.
Non-Turkish nationals with a domestic flight connecting to/from an international flight which is booked on the same ticket, do not currently require an HES code. Where a domestic flight is booked separately or with a different airline, an HES code is required.
For international travel, Turkish nationals are required to obtain an HES code, however this does not apply to non-Turkish nationals, including British visitors to Turkey.
For intercity travel, British nationals without a residence card can obtain an HES code by sending their passport details by SMS to 2023 in the following format: HES [space] Nationality (GBR) [space] passport number [space] year of birth [space] surname. Example: HES GBR 123456789 1980 SMITH. You will need to use the passport which you entered Turkey on, and the SMS message must be sent from a mobile phone registered on a Turkish mobile network.
If you are over 65, and are visiting Turkey, you no longer require a travel permit to travel between cities. A permit is still required if you are a Turkish resident and you must remain at your destination for a minimum of 30 days unless travelling for an international flight. Given the lifting of this restriction for visitors, we will no longer be providing supporting letters for travel permits. Individuals under 18 no longer require a permit to either travel within the same city, or undertake intercity travel. When travelling they must, however, be accompanied by a parent or guardian, aged below 65 years of age.
Regular bus services have resumed in most areas. The following transport providers have been able to offer transfer options previously and are operating services according to demand at reasonable prices:

Financial assistance
You will need to pay for your return travel to the UK. If departure options are available but you cannot afford the travel costs and have exhausted all other options for getting funds, you may be eligible to apply for an emergency loan from the government. This is a last resort option and you would need to repay the loan when you are back in the UK.
For more information, you should contact Corporate Travel Management (CTM). CTM are a commercial partner of the FCO and are authorised to administer such loans on behalf of the FCO.
Your journey home: re-entering the UK
When you return, you must follow the rules for entering the UK. You:
need to provide your journey and contact details up to 48 hours before you’re due to arrive in the UK
are not allowed to leave the place you’re staying for the first 14 days you’re in the UK except in very limited situations (known as ‘self-isolating’)
See also the list of people who are exempt from the border rules.
The National Travel Health Network and Centre (NaTHNaC) also provides advice on how to stay safe as you travel by air.
