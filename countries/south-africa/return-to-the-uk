Registering with the British High Commission
The British High Commission is currently gathering information on British nationals who were planning to return to the UK after 1 May. Register your details with the British High Commission.
UK special flights
A programme of ten UK Government-backed special charter flights operated between 9 and 17 April, based on demand from British travellers wanting to return to the UK. No further UK Government-backed special charter flights are currently planned from South Africa.
Your journey home
The National Travel Health Network and Centre (NaTHNaC) provides advice on how to stay safe as you travel by air.
When you arrive back in the UK, follow the guidance for when you return to the UK on steps you should take to protect yourself and others.
Future options
It is not yet clear when the South African authorities will permit normal commercial flights to operate again. This travel advice will be updated with any information on resumption of commercial flights. In the meantime, you should continue to follow any regulations set out by the South African government during the lockdown.
You will need to pay for your return travel to the UK. If departure options are available but you cannot afford the travel costs and have exhausted all other options for getting funds, you may be eligible to apply for an emergency loan from the government. This is a last resort option only available to British nationals and you would need to repay the loan when you are back in the UK.
