There are currently no commercial options available to return to the UK from Montenegro, due to measures taken by the government and neighbouring countries. Non-commercial air transport (general aviation) is exempt from this ban.
Future travel options
The British Embassy understands that there may be a Montenegrin Government repatriation flight from Podgorica to Vienna and Zurich departing on Wednesday 27 May. If you are a British traveller seeking to return home and this would be helpful for you as an option, contact the Embassy via consular.podgorica@fco.gov.uk or by calling +382 (0)20 420 100.
This travel advice will be updated when departure options become available. Sign up for travel advice email alerts and follow the British Embassy on Twitter and Facebook.
You will need to pay for your return travel to the UK. If departure options are available but you cannot afford the travel costs and have exhausted all other options for getting funds, you may be eligible to apply for an emergency loan from the government. This is a last resort option and you would need to repay the loan when you are back in the UK.
For more information, you should contact Corporate Travel Management (CTM). CTM are a commercial partner of the FCO and are authorised to administer such loans on behalf of the FCO.
