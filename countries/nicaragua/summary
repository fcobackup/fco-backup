The Foreign and Commonwealth Office (FCO) advise against all but essential travel to Nicaragua.
There has been a prolonged period of political unrest and street violence in many areas in Nicaragua since mid-April 2018. This has involved the use of tear gas, rubber bullets and live ammunition, resulting in many serious injuries and over 300 deaths. Some marches and demonstrations continue to occur. While most are now peaceful, the situation remains volatile and there is the potential for further violence and disorder at any time. You should stay well away from all demonstrations and gatherings, even if apparently peaceful. Such events can quickly escalate into violence, including with indiscriminate shootings. It is also against Nicaraguan immigration law for foreigners to involve themselves in local politics, and you may put yourself at risk of arrest if taking part in protests or breaches of the peace.
Heavily armed groups patrol around the clock. You should avoid these as they can be unpredictable and violent.
The incidence of crime has risen significantly since the protests began.
