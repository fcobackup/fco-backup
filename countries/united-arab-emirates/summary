The FCDO advises against all but essential travel to:
the whole of the United Arab Emirates based on the current assessment of COVID-19 risks.
From 4am on 9 April direct flights from the UAE to Scotland will no longer be prohibited. Flights from the UAE to England, Wales and Northern Ireland will continue to be prohibited. Visitors arriving into the UK who have been in or transited through the UAE in the previous 10 days will not be permitted entry. British and Irish nationals, and third country nationals with residence rights in the UK arriving in England from the UAE will continue to be required to quarantine in a hotel. Different requirements apply for arrivals into Scotland, Wales and Northern Ireland.
From 1 January onwards people with residence rights in the UK include: holders of Indefinite Leave to Remain; holders of existing leave to enter or remain (i.e. those with biometric Residence permits) or an entry clearance/visa that grants such leave e.g. students, workers, etc (excluding visit visas); holders of EU Settlement Scheme (“EUSS”) leave; those who have rights of entry under the Withdrawal Agreements (including returning residents with a right of residence under the EEA Regulations and EEA frontier workers); family members of EEA nationals with rights under the Withdrawal Agreement.
Travel to the United Arab Emirates is subject to entry restrictions
Residents returning to Dubai still need to get approval before travelling. Those returning to other parts of the UAE no longer need to get approval
The Dubai authorities have issued visit and tourist visas since 6 July 2020. The Abu Dhabi authorities have issued visit and tourist visas since 24 December 2020
All tourists, visitors and residents travelling from or through the UK and arriving in Dubai or Abu Dhabi must have a negative COVID-19 Polymerase Chain Reaction (PCR) test which was taken no more than 72 hours before departure and present the certificate at check in. Travellers arriving in Abu Dhabi will also be required to undertake a COVID-19 PCR test on arrival. Travellers arriving in Dubai may be required to undertake a further COVID-19 PCR test on arrival and will have to isolate pending the result of the COVID-19 PCR test
The UK was added to the Abu Dhabi ‘Green List’ of countries, regions and territories on 25 April 2021. This means that any travellers from the UK to Abu Dhabi will be exempt from quarantine requirements and can enter Abu Dhabi by following a series of procedures that include COVID-19 tests. However the UK may be removed from the ‘Green List’ at any time. More details are available on the Visit Abu Dhabi website
If you’re travelling from the UAE to other countries that require a negative COVID-19 PCR test before arrival, you must have a negative test result within 96 hours of your departure from the UAE
You should check specific requirements with your airline before you travel
Travellers who test positive for COVID-19 on arrival in the UAE will be required to quarantine for at least 10 days even if they had a negative COVID-19 PCR test before travelling
