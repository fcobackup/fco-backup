COVID-19 vaccines if you live in Djibouti
Wherever possible British nationals should aim to be vaccinated in the country where they live. As further information is available about the national vaccination programme, this page will be updated. Sign up to email notifications.
The Djiboutian Government has said that they will provide the vaccine to all resident adults living in Djibouti, regardless of their citizenship. Therefore, you should follow the advice given to the general public to access vaccines in accordance with the phased roll out. They are prioritising those over 50, with underlying medical problems, health worker, public facing workers and migrants and immigrants.
The Medicines and Healthcare Products Regulatory Agency (MHRA) is the UK authority responsible for assessing the safety, quality and efficacy of vaccines. It has authorised the Pfizer/BioNTech, Oxford/AstraZeneca and Moderna vaccines for temporary supply and use in the UK. Find out more about MHRA approval for these vaccines.
British nationals living overseas should seek medical advice from their local healthcare provider in the country where they reside. Information about vaccines used in other national programmes, including regulatory status, should be available from the local authorities. This list of Stringent Regulatory Authorities recognised by the World Health Organisation may also be a useful source of additional information.
