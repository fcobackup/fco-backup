Transnational criminal organisations involved in drug trafficking and arms smuggling operate along Paraguay’s eastern border with Brazil, especially from Pedro Juan Caballero south to Ciudad del Este, including the Tri-Border Area of Paraguay, Brazil and Argentina. Their presence has increased violent crime in these areas. They have also carried out isolated violent criminal attacks in Asunción targeting the Paraguayan security forces and people associated with rival organisations. While tourists have not been the target of such incidents, anyone in the vicinity of an incident could be affected and you should exercise due caution.
Demonstrations are taking place frequently in the downtown area of Asunción, particularly in the proximity of government buildings and offices, often without warning. You should avoid large gatherings, monitor local media and follow the guidance of local authorities.
