There are ongoing security operations in Baalbek and the surrounding areas following clashes between rival criminal gangs, and instances of armed carjacking have increased in the area. See Safety and security.
On 4 August 2020 a large explosion occurred in the port area of Beirut causing widespread damage to buildings and infrastructure in the city and surrounding areas.
There is disruption to services across the city. The airport remains operational, with direct and indirect commercial flights available.
Damage and the ongoing situation at the port and in areas close to the port remains an ongoing hazard and could pose a risk to your personal safety. You should exercise caution in the area, stay away from collapsed buildings, monitor the local news and follow the advice of the local authorities.
The British Embassy in Beirut has been informed by the Lebanese authorities that, exceptionally given the current situation, British nationals travelling to the UK will be permitted to depart Lebanon on an expired passport, without requiring an emergency travel document. Before travelling you should confirm with your airline that they will accept this. If you are travelling to, or transiting, another country then you will need to ensure that your passport will also be accepted there.
On the evening of 6 August anti-government protests broke out around the Lebanese parliament and further large protests took place in Beirut on 8 August, resulting in clashes between security forces and protestors. There is an increased risk of protests and demonstrations. If you’re in Beirut, you should avoid protests, remain vigilant and follow the advice of the local authorities.
If you’re in Beirut and need urgent consular assistance, call +961 (0)1 960800. If you’re in the UK and worried about a British national in Beirut, call the FCDO in London on 020 7008 5000. Additionally, the Lebanese Ministry of Health have set up a hotline for missing persons, +961 1 832700.

Protests against the political and economic situation in Lebanon, which began in October 2019, are continuing. The protests have centred on Beirut and Tripoli, but have occurred at various locations nationwide, including in the Beqaa Valley and Saida, often with little notice. Violent confrontations between protesters, security forces and supporters of political groups have occurred across the country, often resulting in injuries to protestors and security forces.
As a result of protests, major roads (including to and from Beirut airport) have become blocked, banks have closed, and there is a risk that supplies (including medical) may become increasingly scarce. See Political situation
Crime, including reports of sexual harassment in public spaces, has increased as a result of the economic decline in Lebanon. This includes in Beirut. See Safety and security.
A conflict with Israel could spark with little warning and lead to a rapid escalation in violence. There have been exchanges between Hizballah and the Israeli Defence Force across the Blue Line in the South of Lebanon. This has included cross-border shelling. The most recent such incident took place on 27 July 2020 and there remains a risk of a further escalation. See Security situation
Terrorists are very likely to try to carry out attacks in Lebanon. You should be vigilant at all times, avoid crowds and crowded places and follow the advice of the Lebanese authorities. Previous attacks have targeted the security forces, as well as locations where Western visitors may congregate. There have been police and military casualties in recent security incidents linked to the arrest of an individual suspected of plotting a terrorist attack in Beirut. You should follow the advice of the local authorities, and check local news and this travel advice regularly. See Terrorism
There’s a heightened risk of terrorism against aviation. Additional security measures have been in place on flights departing from Lebanon to the UK since March 2017. You should co-operate fully with security officials.
Groups within Lebanon, including Hizballah, are proscribed under the Terrorism Act 2000 and the Terrorist Asset-Freezing Act 2010. Offences committed under the act – including funding and supporting proscribed organisations – may be liable to prosecution in the UK.
There are unexploded ordnance and land mines in many places. You should avoid travelling away from established paths, especially when hiking. This is particularly a concern in southern Lebanon. See Local travel
You can contact the emergency services by calling 112.
If you’re abroad and you need emergency help from the UK government, contact the nearest British embassy, consulate or high commission. Consular support is severely limited in parts of Lebanon where we advise against all travel and limited where we advise against all but essential travel.
The Overseas Business Risk service offers information and advice for British companies operating overseas on how to manage political, economic, and business security-related risks.
