The rainy season runs from November to April and can make roads harder to pass, and make some areas impassable. Flooding is also a possibility. Monitor local reports and international weather updates from the World Meteorological Organisation, check your routes before travelling around the country and follow the advice of the local authorities.
Earthquakes
In 2009, there were a series of earthquakes in northern Malawi around Karonga. Some of them registered up to 6.2 on the Richter scale, and caused deaths and damage to buildings. The US Federal Emergency Management Agency has advice about what to do before, during and after an earthquake.
