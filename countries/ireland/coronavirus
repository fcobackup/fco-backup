The revised strategy includes a ‘Framework for Restrictive Measures’ designed to allow people to understand, anticipate and prepare for the measures the government might introduce to stop escalation of the virus. The Framework consists of 5 Levels, which will be imposed depending on the incidence of COVID-19. All of Ireland is currently at Level 3, as of 6 October.
You should check the Irish Government website for comprehensive guidance on public health measures currently in force.
