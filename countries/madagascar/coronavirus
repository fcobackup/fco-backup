You should remain in contact with your travel agent or airline. Private flights require advance permissions from the Presidency and Prime Minister’s office.

Entry and borders

Returning to the UK
When you return, you must follow the rules for entering the UK.
You are responsible for organising your own COVID-19 test, in line with UK government testing requirements.
Be prepared for your plans to change
No travel is risk-free during COVID. Countries may further restrict travel or bring in new rules at short notice, for example due to a new COVID-19 variant. Check with your travel company or airline for any transport changes which may delay your journey home.
If you test positive for COVID-19, you will be notified within 72 hours of your test and you will be expected to self-isolate for 14 days in your hotel or private accommodation. The local health authorities may phone daily to check on your welfare and provide any medications required. If you develop serious symptoms, you may be referred to the designated COVID-19 clinic in Antananarivo for treatment.
Plan ahead and make sure you:
can access money
understand what your insurance will cover
can make arrangements to extend your stay and be away for longer than planned

COVID-19 vaccines if you live in Madagascar
Wherever possible British nationals should aim to be vaccinated in the country where they live. We will update this page when the Government of Madagascar announces new information on the national vaccination programme. You can sign up to get email notifications when this page is updated.
The Madagascan national vaccination programme started in May 2021 and is using the AstraZeneca and Janssen (Johnson and Johnson) vaccines. British nationals resident in Madagascar are eligible for vaccination under the national programme.
The first round of Madagascar’s national vaccination programme using the AstraZeneca vaccine closed on 17 June. The second dose programme is now available in Antananarivo and other regions of the country in many different medical centres (hospitals and CSB). If you received a first dose of the AstraZeneca vaccine in the first round, you will be able to attend a vaccination clinic for your second dose without the need to register again. Do take your ID and vaccination card with you.
If you have not yet received a vaccination and you are in one of the following priority groups, you can now register for a Janssen (Johnson & Johnson) single dose vaccination: health workers, social workers, law enforcement, persons with a chronic illness, and persons with a proven need to travel overseas for work or study. You can register online at the Ministry of Public Health website (website is in French) or in person at your local neighbourhood health centre.
You can call free on 910 for information on the vaccination programme (English language support may not be available).
Find out more, including about vaccines that are authorised in the UK or approved by the World Health Organisation, on the COVID-19 vaccines if you live abroad.
If you’re a British national living in Madagascar, you should seek medical advice from your local healthcare provider. Information about COVID-19 vaccines used in the national programme where you live, including regulatory status, should be available from local authorities.
