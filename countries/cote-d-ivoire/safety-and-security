Political situation
Protests and demonstrations are likely to occur. You should exercise caution and avoid all demonstrations, large crowds, political gatherings and rallies. Crowds can gather quickly and roadblocks are common. In the event of unrest, monitor local media and follow instructions and announcements from the local authorities. You should comply with any additional checks or security measures requested by the authorities, which may be introduced at short notice.
Presidential elections took place in October 2020. There were outbreaks of violence (including between communities), which caused a number of civilian deaths. Legislative elections in March 2021 were broadly peaceful. You should be vigilant near military barracks, military installations, large crowds and demonstrations
Security
If you’re staying longer in Côte d’Ivoire you should regularly review personal security arrangements and seek professional security advice. You should keep a stock of food and water.
Crime
There’s a risk of crime in Abidjan, including violent crime, car-jackings, armed break-ins to private residences, hold-ups in the street, and theft from cars. These incidents aren’t common, but they do occur. In vehicles, keep doors locked, windows shut and valuables out of sight. If possible, avoid using public transport, shared taxis, or walking around after dark. On bridges to and from the Le Plateau areas of Abidjan, pedestrians have been attacked and robbed even during the day. Avoid displaying your wallet; for instance, have money to hand to tip supermarket trolley attendants. Attacks by armed robbers have occurred on the main road between Yamoussoukro, Bouaké and Korhogo. Attacks have been reported in the west of the country, during daylight hours as well as night.
Please be alert to the risks of cyber criminality and card fraud during your visit.
Local travel
Northern border with Mali and Burkina Faso (including Comoé national park area)
The FCDO advises against all travel to within 40km of the border with Mali and Burkina Faso, due to the security situation in these neighbouring countries. See Terrorism
The FCDO advises against all travel to Northern Zanzan and Savenes provinces, and Comoé national park.
Border with Liberia
The FCDO advises against all but essential travel to within 20km of the border with Liberia owing to the risk of serious violence by local militias. Fatal clashes between militias and the security forces have taken place in and around this area in the past. Seek professional local advice before embarking on any travel to these areas. Take care if you intend to travel to any rural areas.
Road travel
Driving standards and road conditions in Côte d’Ivoire are poor, although they are improving in Abidjan where the road infrastructure is being upgraded. There is a high rate of fatal road accidents, and emergency service provision outside Abidjan can be limited or absent. Avoid driving outside towns and cities at night as roads and vehicles can be poorly lit, and unlit broken-down vehicles can block the road. You should be alert to the risk of stray livestock that could cause a safety hazard. Grass or leaves strewn on the carriageway often means an accident or other hazard in the road ahead. During the rainy season roads, especially those that are minor and unpaved, may become impassable.
Take care when using public transport; driving standards and vehicle maintenance are poor. Unskilled drivers, poorly maintained vehicles and overloaded vehicles and inadequate lighting make driving conditions hazardous. Taxis are available in main cities, but are likely to be in bad mechanical condition. Red taxis, which can be hailed on the street tend to be for private use and yellow ones are shared. Caution is advised with shared taxis and try to avoid using them after dark. Online taxi booking services operate in Abidjan. Wear a seat belt at all times.
Roadblocks and checkpoints
You might still occasionally encounter checkpoints in and around Abidjan. You might also find official and unofficial roadblocks and checkpoints on the major routes outside of Abidjan. Take care and co-operate with those operating them.
Air travel
The European Commission has published a list of air carriers that are subject to an operating ban or restrictions within the European Union. You should check the list to see whether this will affect your travel.
You should monitor changes to travel restrictions and make sure that you have adequate and flexible travel arrangements in place for your onward journey from Côte d’Ivoire.
Swimming
Ocean currents are very strong along the coast, and rip tides cause many swimming accidents. There is no lifeboat or rescue service and numerous drownings occur each year.
