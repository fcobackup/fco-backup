Public spaces and services
The Government of Tanzania has announced that it is relaxing the ban on public gatherings, university and school openings, and sporting competitions. Many hotels, bars and restaurants remain closed for the time being, though some restaurants offer take away service. You should continue to practice measures recommended by PHE such as hand washing and social distancing.
Healthcare in Tanzania
Due to a rise in the number of coronavirus cases in Tanzania, medical facilities and personnel are under strain throughout the country. The availability of treatment for non-coronavirus-related illnesses, particularly for non-urgent care, has been adversely impacted. There have been instances during the COVID-19 outbreak when hospitals in Dar es Salaam reached full capacity due to the high volume of COVID-19 cases. Limited hospital capacity throughout Tanzania could result in life-threatening delays for emergency medical care.
