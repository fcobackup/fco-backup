The information on this page covers the most common types of travel and reflects the UK government’s understanding of the rules currently in place. Unless otherwise stated, this information is for travellers using a full ‘British Citizen’ passport.
The authorities in the country or territory you’re travelling to are responsible for setting and enforcing the rules for entry. If you’re unclear about any aspect of the entry requirements, or you need further reassurance, you’ll need to contact the embassy, high commission or consulate of the country or territory you’re travelling to.
You should also consider checking with your transport provider or travel company to make sure your passport and other travel documents meet their requirements.
Coronavirus
The Australian Government has announced temporary restrictions on travellers in response to coronavirus. From 9pm local time on 15 March, all travellers, except for Australian citizens or returning permanent residents, will be stopped from entering Australia. British nationals who are permanent residents and are currently outside of Australia will be required to self-isolate for 14 days on arrival in Australia. See Coronavirus.
A number of airline operators are starting to announce that international flights to/from Australia have been suspended or will be suspended shortly. British nationals already in Australia should contact their airline, travel provider and insurance company for the latest travel information. Those who want to return to the UK soon should take account of the fast moving situation and plan accordingly. If you are unable to leave Australia and your visa is nearing expiry, you should contact the Australian authorities as soon as possible.
The government has also announced a ban on international cruise ships, effective midnight on 15 March for an initial 30 day period. Australian cruise ships continue to be able to dock in Australia. Cruise operators have put in place arrangements for passengers to transit to airports for onward travel. All passengers remaining in Australia are required to self-isolate for 14 days.
Further information on entry requirements related to Coronavirus can be found on the Department of Home Affairs website. With the fast moving situation it is recommended to check this site regularly if you are considering travel to Australia.
On 1 February 2020, the Australian Government announced temporary restrictions on travellers from mainland China in response to the coronavirus outbreak. Australia will deny entry to anyone who has left or transited mainland China from 1 February 2020, with the exception of Australian citizens, permanent residents, and immediate family members of Australian citizens and permanent residents including spouses, minor dependents and legal guardians. Given the fast changing situation, you should check the latest entry requirements for your destination or check with your airline before you travel. The Australian Government has since announced similar restrictions in relation to Iran to take effect from 1 March 2020, in relation to South Korea to take effect from 5 March, and in relation to Italy to take effect from 11 March 2020.
Visas
You need a visa to travel to Australia. British citizens can get the following types of electronic visitor visa:
eVisitor visa direct from the Department of Immigration & Border Protection. There is no visa application charge or service fee for this;
Electronic Travel Authority (ETA) via your travel agent or airline. There is no visa application charge, but a service fee of A$20 applies
Information on all other types of visa is available from the Department of Immigration & Border Protection, or from the Australian High Commission in London.
In certain circumstances you may be asked to undergo a health examination before a visa can be granted, for example if you are aged 75 years or older. Factor in extra time for this when applying for a visa.
On arrival you may be asked to provide evidence of funds to support your stay and a return or onward ticket.
If you hold an ePassport you can use SmartGate to pass through passport control when arriving in Australia. See the Australian Border Force website for more information.
Working holiday visas
If you’re on a working holiday visa you should be aware of your rights as employees in Australia and how to report any concerns about unfair or unlawful treatment.
Thousands of British working holiday makers travel to Australia each year with the vast majority enjoying their stay without issue. Working conditions, accommodation and medical facilities are generally of a good standard.
In October 2016 the Fair Work Ombudsman published a report following an inquiry into the wages and conditions of people working under the working holiday visa program, which highlighted exploitative workplace cultures where unreasonable and unlawful requirements were being imposed in some isolated and remote workplaces. If you have concerns about your workplace conditions or treatment you can contact the Fair Work Ombudsman on 13 13 94. You can also report concerns to them anonymously.
If you feel you’re being treated unfairly or unlawfully by an employer, you can email the UK’s National Crime Agency (NCA) at the British High Commission in Canberra at: Australia.WHVreferrals@fco.gov.uk. The NCA is working with a number of Australian authorities to help identify and address any illegal employer behaviour affecting British nationals.
For further information and advice, see our working holiday makers booklet.
Passport validity
For entry into Australia, your passport should be valid for the proposed duration of your stay. No additional period of validity beyond this is required.
If you are transiting another country on your way to or from Australia, make sure you check the entry requirements for that country. Many countries will only permit entry if you have at least 6 months validity remaining on your passport.
Dual nationals
If you’re a British national living in Australia with Australian citizenship, or you’re a dual national, you should leave and enter Australia on your Australian passport, otherwise you may face difficulties and delays. For more information, see the Department of Foreign Affairs & Trade’s website.
