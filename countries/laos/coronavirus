Departing Laos
Normal immigration procedures should be now in operation.
Entry and borders

Visa on entry and e-Visa are available for entry at Wattay Airport and some land border posts (check availability at land borders in advance of travelling). See Entry requirements
Be prepared for your plans to change
No travel is risk-free during the COVID-19 pandemic. Countries may further restrict travel or bring in new rules at short notice, for example due to a new COVID-19 variant. Check with your Travel Company or airline for any transport changes, which may delay your journey home.
If you test positive for COVID-19, you may need to stay where you are until you test negative. You may also need to seek treatment there.
Plan and make sure you:
can access money
understand what your insurance will cover
can make arrangements to extend your stay and be away for longer than planned
Travel in Laos
Travel restrictions within Laos have been lifted. Authorisation for travel by road, water and air between provinces is no longer required for travellers carrying proof of full vaccination. You should consult with provincial COVID-19 Task Forces for guidance for those who are not fully vaccinated or are too young to be vaccinated.
You should monitor local official announcements for guidance in the latest restrictions. There may be short notice lockdowns introduced in provinces with reports of COVID-19 outbreaks.
Thailand land border
From 1 July, you are no longer required to apply for permission to enter Thailand.
You should keep up to date with the latest information on the websites of the Thai Ministry of Foreign Affairs, the Royal Thai Embassy in Vientiane, and the Thai Ministry of Public Health.
Accommodation
Hotels and private rental accommodation is available throughout Laos, although a number of hotels/hostels are currently closed due to reduced tourist numbers. You should arrange accommodation in advance of travel.
Public places and services
You should still carry evidence of your vaccination status at all times as some places and services may still require this.
Additional requirements:
COVID-19 outbreaks mean further measures may be introduced at short notice, including measures applying to individual provinces. You should follow the advice of the Lao authorities.
