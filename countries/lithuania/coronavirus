Healthcare in Lithuania
Many non-essential health services have been temporarily suspended. If you have a medical appointment, check with the service provider to confirm whether the appointment can take place as planned.
If you have symptoms of COVID-19 or have been in contact with a confirmed case within the previous 14 days, call the Lithuanian COVID-19 hotline on +370 37367 963 to request a COVID-19 PCR test. The hotline is open daily between 8am and 11pm. In case of an emergency, call 112. Tests booked through the hotline are free of charge.
A list of private clinics offering PCR and antigen tests is available on the Lithuanian Ministry of Health website. The tests booked through these clinics will be charged.
Please note that not all testing centres in Lithuania offer results in English. Should you require your results in English, you should request at the point of booking. English language result certificates are likely to incur additional charges.
If you do not have access to a private vehicle, you will need to travel to the testing centre by taxi. You are advised to check at the time of booking whether the taxi company is able to take you to a testing centre, as some taxis may not have the precautions in place to provide this service.
You must self-isolate for 14 days if you have tested positive for COVID-19 or are known to have had contact with a confirmed COVID-19 case in the previous 14 days. If you are awaiting COVID-19 PCR test results, you must self-isolate until you receive your results and receive instructions from public health officials, even if you are asymptomatic.
Additional isolation requirements will apply to those arriving in Lithuania from the UK or countries deemed be high risk. More information on isolation for arrivals to Lithuania can be found on the Entry requirements page.
While in isolation, following contact with a confirmed case or after displaying COVID-19 symptoms, you must:
not leave your place of isolation without the permission of a healthcare professional;
not go to the shops;
not attend face to face public services;
not have guests/visitors;
organise for essential provisions to be delivered by friends, family or delivery services;
consult with a GP by phone/email to arrange extensions to prescriptions;
call the Lithuanian COVID-19 hotline on +370 37367 963 if you display COVID-19 symptoms; and
call the Emergency Response Centre on 112 if your symptoms become severe.
While in isolation, you may be contacted by Lithuanian health officials. Failure to comply with self-isolation requirements could result in a fine of between 60€ and 1,500€.
The Lithuanian Government advises against isolating in properties with those who are not isolating. If this is not possible, you should stay in separate, well-ventilated rooms, restrict your movement within the home and minimise use of common spaces.
If you have a pet, but are unable to arrange alternative pet care, you may leave your place of isolation for up to 15 minutes at a time to walk your pet. This exception only applies to individuals who have no COVID-19 symptoms.
British nationals needing to temporarily break isolation, who meet one of the requirements set out by the Lithuanian Government, must notify the NVSC in advance. You do not need to inform the NVSC if you are breaking isolation for a COVID-19 PCR test or for emergency medical treatment.
British nationals may leave Lithuania before the end of their isolation period in order to return to the UK/their country of residence. However, you must register your travels plans with the Lithuanian Government at least 24 hours before departure.
COVID-19 vaccines if you live in Lithuania
Wherever possible British nationals should aim to be vaccinated in the country where they live. As further information is available about the national vaccination programme, this page will be updated. Sign up to get email notifications.
Those UK nationals with Lithuanian residency will be contacted by Lithuanian health services for a COVID-19 vaccination. We recommend that your residency is up-to-date and that you are registered with a GP.
The Lithuanian authorities have issued a list of priority categories for vaccination (only available in Lithuanian). The national programme of vaccinations began in December 2020.
The Medicines and Healthcare Products Regulatory Agency (MHRA) is the UK authority responsible for assessing the safety, quality and efficacy of vaccines. It has authorised the Pfizer/BioNTech, Oxford/AstraZeneca and Moderna vaccines for temporary supply and use in the UK. Find out more about MHRA approval for these vaccines.
British nationals living overseas should seek medical advice from their local healthcare provider in the country where they reside. Information about vaccines used in other national programmes, including regulatory status, should be available from the local authorities. This list of Stringent Regulatory Authorities recognised by the World Health Organisation may also be a useful source of additional information. Find out more about COVID-19 vaccines on the World Health Organisation COVID-19 vaccines page.

Returning to the UK
