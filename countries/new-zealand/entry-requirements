This advice reflects the UK government’s understanding of current rules for people travelling on a full ‘British citizen’ passport from the UK, for the most common types of travel.
The authorities in New Zealand set and enforce entry rules. If you’re not sure how these requirements apply to you, contact the New Zealand High Commission in the UK.
COVID-19 rules
There are no COVID-19 testing or vaccination requirements for travellers entering New Zealand.
Passport validity requirements
To enter New Zealand, your passport must have an ‘expiry date’ at least 3 months after the day you plan to leave. If you’re travelling through another country on your way to or from New Zealand, check the entry requirements for that country. Many countries will only allow entry if you have at least 6 months validity remaining on your passport. Renew your passport if you need to.
You will be denied entry if you do not have a valid travel document or try to use a passport that has been reported lost or stolen.
Visa requirements
You do not need a visa to enter New Zealand if you are a visitor staying less than 6 months. You do need a New Zealand Electronic Travel Authority (NZeTA).
At New Zealand border control, you will also need to show that you meet the criteria for visa-free entry:
proof of a return or onward ticket
proof that you have enough money for your stay
Check the full criteria on New Zealand Immigration.
New Zealand has strict immigration rules, particularly on employment. Visitors cannot work in New Zealand.
New Zealand Electronic Travel Authority (NZeTA)
If you are entering without a visa, you need a New Zealand Electronic Travel Authority (NZeTA) before you travel. You will also need to pay an International Visitor Conservation and Tourism Levy when you apply.
Allow up to 72 hours for it to be processed. Your NZeTA is valid for up to 2 years.
Applying for a visa
Check the visa options and costs on New Zealand Immigration.
To extend your visa, first check your visa expiry date on the New Zealand Visa Verification Service. See further information from New Zealand Immigration on how to apply for a visa extension.
Travelling through New Zealand
You will need to get a NZeTA before you travel if you are travelling through New Zealand to another country.
In most cases, transit passengers must hold an NZeTA or transit NZeTA before travel.
Vaccination requirements
At least 8 weeks before your trip, check the vaccinations and certificates you need in TravelHealthPro’s New Zealand guide.
Customs rules
There are strict rules about goods you can take into or out of New Zealand. It is illegal to import most food products. You must declare anything that may be prohibited or subject to tax or duty.
Some products, including wood products, golf clubs, footwear, tents, fishing equipment and items made from animal skin, can carry harmful pests or diseases. Check what items you are permitted to bring into New Zealand. If in doubt, declare items to a Biosecurity New Zealand official or dispose of them in one of the marked bins available at the airport.
If you break any of these rules you could get a fine of up to 100,000 New Zealand dollars or a prison sentence.
