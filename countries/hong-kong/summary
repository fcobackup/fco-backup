This travel advice covers the Hong Kong Special Administrative Region (SAR). For mainland China, see travel advice for China.
The Hong Kong SAR Government has implemented a range of entry restrictions in recent weeks. All travellers entering Hong Kong, including Hong Kong residents, will be required to take a test for coronavirus and undergo mandatory quarantine for 14 days, during which they must wear a wristband that monitors their location. From 22 April onwards, travellers will have to wait for test results at a designated location, before proceeding to their mandatory quarantine location. See Entry requirements.
Throughout 2019, large-scale political demonstrations took place all over the Hong Kong SAR, including in areas popular with tourists. While a number of peaceful activities have taken place, many other protests have led to clashes between police and protesters involving significant violence.
