The information on this page covers the most common types of travel and reflects the UK government’s understanding of the rules currently in place. Unless otherwise stated, this information is for travellers using a full ‘British Citizen’ passport.
The authorities in the country or territory you’re travelling to are responsible for setting and enforcing the rules for entry. If you’re unclear about any aspect of the entry requirements, or you need further reassurance, you’ll need to contact the embassy, high commission or consulate of the country or territory you’re travelling to.
You should also consider checking with your transport provider or travel company to make sure your passport and other travel documents meet their requirements.
Entry rules in response to coronavirus (COVID-19)
Entry to Germany
The German government has restricted air and sea travel into the country at its external Schengen borders, except for travel from countries on its designated travel corridor list. The UK is not currently on this list, so travellers from the UK are only permitted to enter Germany if they are returning to their place of residence, if they serve in an important role or if they have an urgent need.
UK nationals resident in Germany will require proof of residence. If you are not yet in possession of a residence card, you will be required to provide credible evidence that you are resident in Germany.
This could include an address registration certificate (Meldebescheinigung), a tenancy agreement, a utility bill in your name, or a certificate of application (Fiktionsbescheinigung).
The German authorities have confirmed that individuals who are registered at a German address in the population register (Melderegister), who can present identification (including residence documents) displaying a German address, or documents (paper or electronic) issued in their name by third parties stating an address in Germany, may be presumed to be resident in Germany. A document which has been left in Germany but which can be accessed by someone else may be photographed or scanned and sent to the traveller abroad by email or via cloud for presentation at checks. See the guidance from the German Federal Ministry of the Interior, Building and Community.
Non-resident travellers from the UK will need to prove an urgent need for their travel. This exemption includes healthcare workers, some skilled workers, and travel for urgent medical reasons. See the detailed guidance on acceptable urgent needs from the German Federal Ministry of the Interior, Building and Community. The decision on whether to allow entry in such circumstances is at the discretion of border guards.
The German government has published guidance on circumstances in which individuals may enter Germany for urgent medical reasons and the process to be followed. This includes obtaining a certificate completed by the treating physician.
All travellers from the UK must comply with the pre-departure digital registration requirement.
Travellers arriving in Germany who have been in the UK in the preceding 10 days must present a negative COVID-19 test to border officials whilst entering Germany. Airline passengers will have to present their negative test at the start of their journey. In both cases the result can either be in paper or electronic form. The test must have been taken less than 48 hours before entry to Germany. Children aged five or under are exempt from the test requirement. Even with a negative test, travellers will still be required to self-isolate for 10 days following arrival in Germany, with the possibility of test and release after 5 days in some parts of Germany. Contact your local public health authority for further details on test and release.
Molecular based tests (PCR tests) from the UK are accepted in Germany. Antigen tests are accepted as well, provided they meet the minimum criteria recommended by the WHO. This includes tests that meet ≥80% sensitivity and ≥97% specificity, compared to a PCR test. Most lateral flow tests work on the same basis as antigen tests and must meet the same criteria to be accepted. Details on the antigen or lateral flow test manufacturer must be given on the test certificate. ‘LAMP’ (loop-mediated isothermal amplification) tests are also now accepted. Border officials and local public health authorities will not accept a negative test result if there is justified doubt about whether the test meets the minimum performance requirements.
You can find more information about acceptable tests from Germany’s public health agency, the Robert Koch Institute’s, website (in German). Further information on testing requirements can be obtained from your local public health authority.
You can find further details about the current restrictions, including quarantining after a negative test on the German Health Ministry website (in German).
If you’re travelling to Germany from an EU/EEA country, you do not need to demonstrate a valid reason to enter Germany but may be required to quarantine (see below). Please be aware that the German government is advising against all non-essential travel.
If you’re travelling to Germany from a country outside the UK or EU/EEA, you will also not need a valid reason for travel if you are a German resident (this also applies for any core family members travelling with you). Guidance for other travellers is available on the Federal Ministry of Interior, Building and Community website.
If you’re travelling to Germany from an area designated as presenting an increased risk of infection, you will need to follow the rules on quarantine on arrival, as set out below. The UK is currently designated as an increased risk area.
For further details about German travel restrictions and border controls see the Federal Ministry of Interior, Building and Community website.
Travel from increased risk areas
If, in the 10 days before you travel to Germany, you have been in an area designated as presenting an increased risk of infection, you must register online in advance of travelling to Germany. This online registration process replaces the paper landing cards previously required for travellers from risk areas.
On arrival you must travel to your accommodation and quarantine there for ten days. After five days it is possible to secure release from quarantine with a negative test in some parts of Germany. Contact your local public health authority for further details on test and release.
There are some exemptions from the quarantine requirement, including for frontier workers and individuals deemed to be providing essential activities. Precise rules are set by the federal states, so please consult the provisions applicable in the place where you are staying.
The UK is currently designated as an increased risk area. You can find the full list of areas in English on the Robert Koch Institute website.
Transiting Germany
British citizens (and all EU/EEA citizens) may transit via Germany as part of a longer journey, provided they do so directly, their stay in Germany is limited to the minimum period necessary, and their admission to their country of destination is demonstrably secured. Travellers in transit should therefore have onward travel booked. Travellers transiting through Germany who have been in the UK at any point in the previous 10 days, even as part of a longer journey, will still need to present a negative COVID-19 test at the border. Further information about the transit requirements is on the Federal Ministry of Interior, Building and Community website. You should also check the travel advice for any country that you are transiting on the way back to the UK.
Regular entry requirements
Visas
The rules for travelling or working in European countries changed on 1 January 2021:
you can travel to countries in the Schengen area for up to 90 days in any 180-day period without a visa. This applies if you travel as a tourist, to visit family or friends, to attend business meetings, cultural or sports events, or for short-term studies or training
if you are travelling to Germany and other Schengen countries without a visa, make sure your whole visit is within the 90-day limit. Visits to Schengen countries within the previous 180 days before you travel count towards your 90 days
to stay longer, to work or study, for business or for other reasons, you will need to meet the German government’s entry requirements. Check with the German Embassy what type of visa and/or work permit, if any, you will need
if you stay in Germany with a visa or permit, this does not count towards your 90-day visa-free limit
Any time you spent in Germany or other Schengen countries before 1 January 2021 does not count towards your 90-day visa-free limit.
At German border control, you may need to use separate lanes from EU, EEA and Swiss citizens when queueing. Your passport may be stamped on entry and exit. You may also need to:
show a return or onward ticket
show you have enough money for your stay
Passport Stamps
UK nationals resident in Germany should not have their passports stamped on entry and exit, though they are required to demonstrate credible evidence of residence during checks to avoid receiving a stamp (see above). If a resident’s passport is stamped, this has no bearing on their legal status or rights, for instance as a beneficiary of the Withdrawal Agreement. You should consult the Federal Police (Bundespolizei) if you wish, as a resident, to have any stamp annulled. You should bear in mind that if your passport is stamped and you subsequently exit the Schengen area after more than 90 days, you must carry credible evidence of residence status with you.
Entry for British citizens who are resident in Germany
If you are resident in Germany, please carry proof of your residence when travelling.
If you were living in Germany before 1 January 2021, you should carry your residence document (Aufenthaltsdokument-GB), as well as your valid passport when you travel. If you have applied but not yet received your document, carry your certificate of application (Fiktionsbescheinigung).
If you have not yet applied for a residence document GB, you should carry credible evidence that you are resident in Germany. This could include an address registration certificate (Meldebestätigung), tenancy agreement, or a utility bill in your name, dating from 2020.
If you cannot show that you are resident in Germany, you may be asked additional questions at the border to enter the Schengen area, and your passport may be stamped. This will not affect your rights in Germany.
Passport validity
Check your passport is valid for travel before you book your trip, and renew your passport if you do not have enough time left on it.
You must have at least 6 months left on an adult or child passport to travel to most countries in Europe (not including Ireland).
If you renewed your current passport before the previous one expired, extra months may have been added to its expiry date. Any extra months on your passport over 10 years may not count towards the 6 months needed.
UK Emergency Travel Documents
UK Emergency Travel Documents (ETDs) are accepted for entry, airside transit and exit from Germany.
Working in Germany
If you intend to work in Germany, you should get detailed information on employment regulations from the German Embassy.
