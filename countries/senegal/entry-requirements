This page reflects the UK government’s understanding of current rules for people travelling on a full ‘British Citizen’ passport, for the most common types of travel.
The authorities in Senegal set and enforce entry rules. For further information contact the embassy, high commission or consulate of the country or territory you’re travelling to. You should also consider checking with your transport provider or travel company to make sure your passport and other travel documents meet their requirements.
Entry rules in response to coronavirus (COVID-19)
Entry to Senegal
British nationals are not subject to entry restrictions when entering Senegal.
You should still check with your airline before travelling what documentation you will need to carry with you.
The Senegalese Embassy has now stopped issuing letters of support for UK nationals to enter Senegal, as they are no longer required.
You will be asked to fill a ‘Public Health Passenger Locator’ and a Public Health form at check-in or on board the flight.
Airlines request passengers to fill in a locator form at check-in.
To enter Senegal individuals over 2 years old must provide either a negative PCR COVID-19 test dated no more than 5 days earlier, issued in the country where you started your trip and authorised by that country, or a recognised health organisation or a vaccination certificate issued by the health authorities of the country of vaccination. For those who cannot prove vaccine status, including children over 2 years, a negative PCR test remains necessary for entry into Senegal.
Senegal’s Ministry of Health have said the vaccination certificate, also called a “Pass Sanitaire”, should certify that the individual has received the required doses of vaccine at least 14 days before the date of travel. Only vaccines approved by the World Health Organization are accepted.
You should not use the NHS testing service to get a test in order to facilitate your travel to another country. You should arrange to take a private test.
Demonstrating your COVID-19 status
Senegal will accept the UK’s proof of COVID-19 recovery and vaccination record. Your NHS appointment card from vaccination centres is not designed to be used as proof of vaccination and should not be used to demonstrate your vaccine status.
