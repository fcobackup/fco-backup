Romania is increasingly a card economy. While most businesses do accept credit cards, it may be safer to use cash due to the risk of credit card fraud. There is a large network of ATMs that accept standard international credit and debit cards but you may incur a fee. Check with your card provider whether you will be able to use these machines.
Sterling and most western currencies can usually be exchanged for local currency at any of the large number of exchange bureaux in towns and cities but you may have difficulty using travellersâ€™ cheques. Scottish and Northern Irish bank notes may not be accepted in banks and bureaux de change.
