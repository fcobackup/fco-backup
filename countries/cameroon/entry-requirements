This page reflects the UK government’s understanding of current rules for people travelling on a full ‘British Citizen’ passport, for the most common types of travel.
The authorities in Cameroon set and enforce entry rules. For further information contact the embassy, high commission or consulate of the country or territory you’re travelling to. You should also consider checking with your transport provider or travel company to make sure your passport and other travel documents meet their requirements.
Entry rules in response to coronavirus (COVID-19)
Entry to Cameroon
There are multiple commercial flight options to enter and leave Cameroon. See Coronavirus
Access across Cameroon’s land and sea borders is currently restricted due to COVID-19.
Travel requirements to enter and exit Cameroon can change without notice and without proactive communication. The Centre for the Coordination of Public Health Emergency Operations conditions of entry and exit to Cameroon website is the best source of the latest information.
The British High Commission understands that the following requirements apply:
You must have proof of a recent (no older than 72 hours before first boarding) negative coronavirus PCR test to board your flight to Cameroon and to enter at Yaoundé or Douala Airports.
The Government of Cameroon demands a negative Coronavirus PCR test from all travellers aged five and above. (Some airlines demand a PCR test from travellers aged two and above, so check with your airline.)
Your negative coronavirus test result should be in PDF format, clearly stating the date of the test and the type of test. Electronic copies are accepted.
You should not use the NHS testing service to get a test in order to facilitate your travel to another country. You should arrange to take a private test.
Testing/screening on arrival
In addition to the requirement to have a negative PCR test 72 hours before embarkation for Cameroon, all international travellers are subjected to extra rapid flow testing for Coronavirus on arrival at Yaoundé and Douala international airports. These tests are compulsory. Results are returned while passengers are at the airport. There is no fee.
Quarantine requirements
If you have a proof of a recent (no older than 72 hours before boarding) negative coronavirus test, you will normally not have to self-isolate. Anyone that has developed symptoms of Coronavirus on their travel or tests positive on arrival at Yaoundé or Douala airport will be held for further enquiries to trace contacts and movements. We believe that anyone testing positive can quarantine at the location of your host or private accommodation until a negative PCR test is produced. These requirements are regularly evolving.
Exit requirements
Negative PCR certificates are no longer required for all passengers leaving Cameroon, and are only necessary if it is the requirement of your country of destination. Call 1506 for any complaints regarding airport checks.
If you require a PCR test to leave Cameroon, you will be charged a standard rate of FCFA 30,000. You can request and pay for a test online. You can also pay in-person at various sites including: the National Public Health Laboratory in Yaoundé, the Laquintinie Hospital in Douala and the Regional Hospital Centre in Garoua. For further information on the testing process, you should call 1510. Your country of destination or transit may have other requirements.
Travellers leaving Cameroon are frequently asked for their Yellow Fever certificate as they pass through security. You should carry it with you as you pass through the airport.
Regular entry requirements
Visas
The Cameroonian High Commission in London is open for business.
Each visa application is considered on a case-by-case basis.
There is currently no visa-on-arrival service at either Yaoundé or Douala International Airport.
If you have a query about your immigration status while in Cameroon, contact the General Delegation for National Security in Yaoundé (telephone: +237 22221 2884).
Dual nationality
Cameroon does not recognise dual nationality in adults. If you have acquired British citizenship but previously held Cameroon citizenship, or as an adult still hold a Cameroon passport, you should not attempt to enter Cameroon on your Cameroonian passport because this is against the law.
Passport validity
Your passport should be valid for a minimum period of six months from the date of entry into Cameroon.
UK Emergency Travel Documents
UK Emergency Travel Documents are accepted for entry into Cameroon, provided they include the necessary visa.
Yellow fever certificate requirements
You must present a yellow fever certificate upon arrival in Cameroon, and you may be asked for it on exit as well. Check the requirements by visiting the National Travel Health Network and Centre’s TravelHealthPro website.
