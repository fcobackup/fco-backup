Greece is exempt from the Foreign, Commonwealth & Development Office (FCDO)’s advice against all non-essential international travel. This is based on the current assessment of COVID-19 risks.
If you are returning to Scotland from Greece on or after 3 September, you will need to self-isolate on your return (unless you are exempt). Check the latest guidance from the Scottish Government, and separate guidance if returning to England, Wales or Northern Ireland.
If you’re returning to Wales on our after Friday 4 September from the islands of Mykonos, Zakynthos (Zante), Lesvos, Paros and Antiparos and Crete you are required to self isolate for 14 days. More information is available from the Welsh Government.
Travel is subject to entry restrictions
If you travel to Greece, you will need to complete a Passenger Locator Form (PLF) at least 24 hours before travel. Failure to do so in advance may result in your carrier not allowing you to travel, a 500 Euro fine on arrival or the Greek authorities not allowing you to enter the country.
Every traveller, including children, must have their details included on a PLF. If you’re travelling with others outside of your household, you should all complete your own form. If you’re travelling together as a household, the Greek authorities ask for you to complete one form with all adults and children included. You can add additional members of your household at the top of the form before you submit.
Some airlines may require individual PLFs for every traveller over the age of 18 within the same household. You should check directly with your airline what you will need to show in order to be allowed boarding.
See Entry requirements for more information before you plan to travel.

In early March large numbers of migrants and refugees gathered at multiple locations along the Greek-Turkish border. Protests, including some violent clashes, broke out, primarily on the Turkish side of the border. There is potential for further unrest on both sides of the border. Avoid crowds and demonstrations and follow instructions from the local authorities. If you are in affected areas, monitor the local media for information.
There were incidents of unrest and violence on the Eastern Aegean islands of Lesvos, Chios and Samos in response to an increase in arrivals of migrants from Turkey in March. It is possible that further incidents may arise. If you’re on these islands, you should remain vigilant, avoid any demonstrations or related large gatherings, keep up to date with developments and follow the advice of the local authorities.
