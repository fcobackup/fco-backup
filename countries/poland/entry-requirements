The information on this page covers the most common types of travel and is the UK government’s understanding of the current rules. Unless otherwise stated, this information is for travellers using a full ‘British Citizen’ passport.
The authorities in the country or territory you’re travelling to are responsible for setting and enforcing the entry rules. If you’re unclear about any of the entry requirements, or you need further reassurance, you’ll need to contact the embassy, high commission or consulate of the country or territory you’re travelling to.
You should also consider checking with your transport provider or travel company to make sure your passport and other travel documents meet their requirements.
Restrictions in response to coronavirus
Self-isolation rules
EU, European Economic Area, Swiss and UK nationals are not required to self-isolate on arrival in Poland, if they arrive across the land border from Germany, Czechia or Slovakia.
If you arrive in Poland from a non-EU country, you may be required to self-isolate for 14 days, unless you are transiting to your place of residence. There are exceptions, including for freight drivers, airline cabin crew, train workers, agriculture workers, students and school pupils studying in Poland and members of diplomatic missions, Consulates or International Organisations and their families.
Driving into Poland
Border controls with EU countries have now been lifted and there are no border checks and no quarantine requirements for those entering Poland by land from Germany, Czechia and Slovakia. At the borders with Russia, Ukraine and Belarus checks remain in place and you are only allowed to drive into Poland if you are:
a Polish national
a spouse, child or individual under the permanent care of a Polish national
a holder of a Pole’s Card;
a holder of the right to permanent or temporary stay in Poland or a work permit holder
a foreign national driving a means of transport used for transporting goods
a freight driver driving to or from a rest break in a vehicle not used for transporting goods
a diplomat, consular staff member, representative of an international organisation or a member of their family
a school pupil or student studying in Poland
a European Economic Area, Swiss or UK national or a member of their family transiting Poland within 12 hours to return to your permanent residence.
Regular entry requirements
Passport validity
Your passport should be valid for the length of time you plan to stay; you do not need any additional period of validity on your passport beyond this.
The travel rules will stay the same until 31 December 2020.
Visas 
If you hold a British Citizen passport, you don’t need a visa to enter Poland. If you’re planning a stay of longer than 3 months, see our Living in Poland guide and contact the Polish Embassy if you have further questions.
The travel rules will stay the same until 31 December 2020.
UK Emergency Travel Documents
You can use a UK Emergency Travel Document to enter, airside transit and exit from Poland.
Dual nationals 
If you are a Polish passport holder you will be treated as a Polish national while in Poland, even if you hold a passport from another country. If you are a dual Polish-British national you must enter and exit Poland with a Polish passport or Polish national identity card. Check with the Polish Embassy in London if in doubt.
