See the TravelHealthPro website for further advice on travel abroad and reducing spread of respiratory viruses during the COVID-19 pandemic.
Entry and borders
See Entry requirements to find out what you will need to do when you arrive in Denmark.
Everyone should comply with the measures put in place in Denmark to limit the spread of coronavirus (COVID-19).
Returning to the UK
When you return, you must follow the rules for entering the UK.
You are responsible for organising your own COVID-19 test, in line with UK government testing requirements. You can find a local test centre in Denmark. You do not need an appointment and will receive a certificate with the test result. You must create an account at Covidresults.dk before being tested.
Be prepared for your plans to change
No travel is risk-free during COVID. Countries may further restrict travel or bring in new rules at short notice, for example due to a new COVID-19 variant. Check with your travel company or airline for any transport changes which may delay your journey home.
If you test positive for COVID-19 in Demark, you should immediately self-isolate. The Danish authorities will contact you within 24 hours and help you trace your close contacts. You may also need to seek treatment there. See the Coronasmitte website for more details.
Plan ahead and make sure you:
can access money
understand what your insurance will cover
can make arrangements to extend your stay and be away for longer than planned
Travel in Denmark
The Danish Government regularly monitors the risks of COVID-19, and adjusts measures in line with the levels of infection to contain the spread of Coronavirus.
Full details can be found on the Coronavirus in Denmark website.
Public spaces and services
The outdoor limit on gatherings is 500 people, and the indoor limit is 250 people.
Restaurants and cafes are open. For indoor dining, you will need to have a ‘corona pass’ (full vaccination, a negative test taken within 72 hours, a positive test taken between 14 days and 12 weeks ago). For outdoor dining, a ‘corona pass’ is not required.
Outdoor attractions, museums, libraries, cinemas, concert venues and gyms are open, but you will need a `corona pass’ for entry. Nightclubs remain closed.
You should follow Danish guidelines on physical distancing, health protection and business opening hours.
The Danish authorities have issued recommendations for travellers using public transport. You must wear a facemask on all public transport, including taxis and ferries and in all public spaces to avoid a fine. From 14 June, this only applies to standing passengers.

COVID-19 Vaccines if you live in Denmark
We will update this page when the Danish government announces new information on the national vaccination programme. You can sign up to get email notifications when this page is updated.
The Danish national vaccination programme started in December 2020 and uses the Pfizer-BioNTech and Moderna vaccines. AstraZeneca and Janssen (Johnson and Johnson) may also be available. British nationals resident in Denmark are eligible for the vaccine. The Danish authorities have issued guidance (in English) on how to get a vaccine in Denmark. Vaccination is voluntary and free of charge.
Find out more, including about vaccines that are authorised in the UK or approved by the World Health Organisation, on the COVID-19 vaccines if you live abroad.
If you’re a British national living in Denmark, you should seek medical advice from your local healthcare provider. Information about COVID-19 vaccines used in the national programme where you live, including regulatory status, should be available from local authorities.
If you receive your COVID-19 vaccination in Denmark, you can get an EU Digital COVID Certificate from the national authorities. The Certificate proves that you have been vaccinated against COVID-19, received a negative test result, or recovered from COVID-19. It will help facilitate your travel within the EU and, in some countries, you can use it to demonstrate your COVID-19 status to businesses and other organisations. For further information visit the European Commission’s EU Digital COVID Certificate page.
