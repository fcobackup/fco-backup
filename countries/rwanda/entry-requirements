Entry rules in response to coronavirus
Entry to Rwanda
The Government of Rwanda has published guidance for passengers arriving into and departing from Rwanda. This is mandatory for all incoming passengers, including those who have received the COVID-19 vaccine.
Arriving passengers at Kigali International airport must present a negative COVID-19 PCR test taken within 72 hours prior to first departure. Negative test certificates must include the term ‘PCR’. COVID-19 testing is not mandatory for accompanied children under 5 years. All passengers must complete the passenger locator form and upload the COVID-19 test certificate before heading to the airport. You should not use the NHS testing service to get a test in order to facilitate your travel to another country. You should arrange to take a private test.
All passengers will be screened upon entry.
If you are entering Rwanda you will need to take a PCR test on arrival. The testing costs 60 US dollars. You must wait 24 hours for the results in a designated transit hotel and respect all COVID-19 prevention measures. Test results can be checked on the Rwanda Biomedical Centre website. If your test result is positive, even if asymptomatic, while in Rwanda, you will be treated in line with Rwanda’s COVID-19 management guidelines until you have fully recovered, at your own cost.
If you are transiting Rwanda you may or may not need to take a test, depending on the length and type of transit. You should follow the Rwandan Government’s guidance for arriving into and departing from Rwanda and comply with health guidelines.
All passengers arriving from India are required to complete 7 days in mandatory quarantine upon arrival at a designated hotel at their own cost.
Entry at land borders remains restricted.
Screening on arrival
Screening procedures are in place for coronavirus at all entry points.
Testing on departure
Departing passengers must present a negative PCR test before departure, taken within 72 hours before departure. All departing passengers are required to wait 48 hours for the results of their COVID-19 test from the time of sample collection. You should follow the Rwandan Government’s guidance for arriving into and departing from Rwanda.
Regular entry requirements
Visas
You need a visa to enter Rwanda. Thirty-day tourist visas are free and available on arrival for citizens of member states of the Commonwealth (including the UK), as well as for those of the African Union and the Francophonie.
You can also choose to get a visa in advance at any Rwandan diplomatic mission or online. Further information about visa requirements is available from the Rwandan High Commission.
If you’re planning to apply for resident/business or missionary multiple entry visas on entry to Rwanda you will need to get UK police clearance before you travel. You can find details of how to do this on the ACRO Criminal Records Office website. This usually takes a minimum of 10 working days to process.
Passport validity
Your passport should be valid for at least 6 months from the date of entry into Rwanda. You’ll need one blank page on your passport for entry stamps.
If your UK passport has expired since 1 January 2020, or is due to expire before October 2020, the Government of Rwanda have agreed that such passports will be treated as valid for travel until December 2021. However, you still need to ensure you have a valid visa to remain in Rwanda. You should renew your visa if required at the Rwanda Directorate-General of Immigration and Emigration
UK Emergency Travel Documents
UK Emergency Travel Documents (ETDs) are accepted for entry, airside transit and exit from Rwanda. If you’re travelling into Rwanda on an ETD, you’ll be expected to provide Rwandan Immigration with a reason for the use of an ETD, eg proof of residency. If you’re seeking to use a two-way ETD, should clear this with Rwandan Immigration before you travel.
