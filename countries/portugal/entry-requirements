The information on this page covers the most common types of travel and reflects the UK government’s understanding of the rules currently in place. Unless otherwise stated, this information is for travellers using a full ‘British Citizen’ passport.
The authorities in the country or territory you’re travelling to are responsible for setting and enforcing the rules for entry. If you’re unclear about any aspect of the entry requirements, or you need further reassurance, you’ll need to contact the embassy, high commission or consulate of the country or territory you’re travelling to.
You should also consider checking with your transport provider or travel company to make sure your passport and other travel documents meet their requirements.
Entry rules in response to coronavirus
Entry to mainland Portugal and the autonomous region of the Azores
You can travel to Portugal and the Azores if you are resident and returning home.
If you are travelling from:
the UK or any other non-EU/EEA country, or
an EU/EEA country where the COVID-19 incidence rate is 150 cases or more per 100,000 inhabitants
you can only enter for essential purposes, such as to live with immediate family members, or for professional, educational, health or humanitarian reasons.
If you are travelling to Portugal as a resident, be prepared to show evidence of your residence status, such as your residence card or certificate, to your airline and to the immigration officer on arrival.
If you are travelling to Portugal for an essential purpose, be prepared to show evidence to support your reason for travel, to your airline and to the immigration officer on arrival.
In addition, travel to Portugal from Australia, China, Hong Kong, Macao, New Zealand, Rwanda, Singapore, South Korea and Thailand is permitted for any purpose, subject to reciprocity and providing you are also a resident in one of these countries. Contact your airline and the Portuguese Embassy before you travel.
For further information, see the Portuguese Immigration Service website
Where there are no direct flights from the above countries to Portugal, you may still be allowed entry provided you have remained airside while in transit through other countries.
You need to complete an online passenger locator card before you arrive in Portugal.
Screening on arrival
All passengers, excluding children up to the age of 2, travelling to Portugal must show a negative RT-PCR test result for SARS/COVID-19 at the time of boarding. The test must have been taken within 72 hours of departure. Your airline is likely to deny boarding if you cannot provide this at check-in. Check with your airline before you travel.
If your journey originated in India, South Africa, Brazil or in an EU member state where the COVID-19 incidence rate exceeds 500 per 100,000 inhabitants, or you have been in one of these countries in the last 14 days, you must self-isolate on arrival for 14 days at home or at a place indicated by the Portuguese health authority. This applies to passengers arriving by air, as well as by road, rail or sea. For more information, see the Portuguese Immigration Service website and complete this passenger locator form before you travel.
You will be exempt from the need to self-isolate if you are travelling to Portugal to participate in an international sporting event, or the purpose of your journey is essential and your stay in Portugal does not exceed 48 hours. You will have to show evidence of your return trip.
If you are in direct airside transit through Portugal, you do not need a COVID-19 test for Portugal. Check the entry requirements for your final destination.
If you are resident in Portugal and your airline has allowed you to travel without proof of a COVID-19 test, you will need to take the test on arrival at the airport. You will need to pay for the test and remain at the airport until you receive your test result.
All passengers travelling to Portugal will be subject to health screening on arrival. Your temperature will be checked and if it is 38ºc or over or you show signs of being unwell, you will be referred to the health authorities at the airport. You may be required to take a further RT-PCR COVID-19 test and remain at the airport until you receive your test result.
For further information, see the Portuguese Immigration Service website.
You should not use the NHS testing service to get a test in order to facilitate your travel to another country. You should arrange to take a private test. Make sure you have a RT-PCR COVID-19 nasal swab test. Check your test result identifies the type of test taken and gives your name, date of birth, the date and time the sample was collected and the date of the result.
Transiting Spain and France
There are restrictions on transiting Spain by air from the UK to Portugal and overland from France. Check the requirements for entering and transiting France and Spain on FCDO Travel Advice, before you travel.
Entry to Madeira and Porto Santo
Travel to the autonomous region of Madeira is permitted for all purposes.
Before you arrive in Madeira and Porto Santo:
Complete and submit a traveller questionnaire 12 to 48 hours before departure.
Take a RT-PCR COVID-19 test 72 hours before you travel and upload your test result. If you are travelling from the UK, you should arrange to take a test privately and ensure it is a RT-PCR COVID-19 nasal swab test
In the unlikely event that your airline has allowed you to travel without a RT-PCR COVID-19 test, you will have to take a test on arrival at the airport and remain in government provided accommodation until the results are known. This will take about 12 hours.
On arrival, you will be subject to health screening. If you have not uploaded your RT-PCR COVID-19 test result, you will be asked to show it at the airport.
If at any stage you test positive or inconclusive, you will have to repeat the test until the result is negative.
For further information, see the Madeira Tourist Board’s information for visitors.
The regional government has announced that anyone who has recovered from COVID-19 in the previous 90 days, or has had both doses of the vaccine at least 15 days prior to travel, will be exempt from showing a RT-PCR COVID-19 test on arrival in Madeira or Porto Santo. For more information, see the Madeira Tourist Board’s information for visitors and contact your tour operator or airline.
Entry to the Azores
If you are travelling to the Azores, you will need to:
Show a RT-PCR COVID-19 test taken, at most, 72 hours before you travel. If you are travelling from the UK, you should arrange to take the test privately and ensure it is a RT-PCR COVID-19 nasal swab test, or
Take a PCR COVID-19 test on arrival, or
Show a medical report which proves you have recovered from COVID-19 in the previous 90 days.
You will also need to complete a passenger questionnaire before you depart.

Regular entry requirements
Visas
Should you meet the criteria of the current COVID-19 restrictions, you should be aware that the rules for travelling or working in European countries changed on 1 January 2021:
you can travel to countries in the Schengen area for up to 90 days in any 180-day period without a visa. This applies if you travel as a tourist, to visit family or friends, to attend business meetings, cultural or sports events, or for short-term studies or training
if you are travelling to Portugal and other Schengen countries without a visa, make sure your whole visit is within the 90-day limit. Visits to Schengen countries within the previous 180 days before you travel count towards your 90 days
to stay longer, to work or study, for business travel or for other reasons, you will need to meet the Portuguese government’s entry requirements. Check the Portuguese Immigration Service (scroll to the bottom of the page) and check with the Portuguese Embassy what type of visa and/or work permit you may need.
if you stay in Portugal with a visa or permit, this does count towards your 90-day visa-free limit
Any time spent in Portugal or other Schengen countries before 1 January 2021 does not count towards your 90-day visa-free limit.
At Portuguese border control, you will need to use separate lanes from EU, EEA and Swiss citizens when queueing. Your passport may be stamped on entry and exit. You may also need to:
show a return or onward ticket
show you have enough money for your stay
There are separate requirements for those who are resident in Portugal. If you are resident in Portugal, you should carry proof of residence as well as your valid passport when you travel. For further information on these requirements, see our Living in Portugal guide.
Passport validity
Check your passport is valid for travel before you book your trip, and renew your passport if you do not have enough time left on it.
You must have at least 6 months left on an adult or child passport to travel to most countries in Europe (not including Ireland).
If you renewed your current passport before the previous one expired, extra months may have been added to its expiry date. Any extra months on your passport over 10 years may not count towards the 6 months needed.
Travelling with children
Portuguese Border Control (SEF) advise that a child under the age of 18 who is travelling to Portugal alone or without a parent or legal guardian should either:
be met at the airport or point of entry by their parent or guardian, or
carry a letter of authorisation to travel from their parent or guardian. The letter should name the adult in Portugal who will be responsible for them during their stay. There is no legal requirement for the letter to be notarised. However, the onus is on the parent or legal guardian to provide reasonable evidence, including contact details, to confirm that adequate care arrangements are in place.
Resident minors leaving Portugal
A child under the age of 18 who is resident in Portugal must carry a notarised letter of authority from their parent or guardian if they’re travelling out of the country alone or without a parent or legal guardian. The letter of authority can be issued by:
one of the child’s parents (if the parents are married)
the parent the child lives with (if the parents are separated or divorced)
one of the adoptive parents (if the child is adopted) or
the child’s legal guardian
Further information in English, together with a standard form of words (in Portuguese), are available on the Portuguese immigration service website
UK Emergency Travel Documents
UK ETDs are accepted for entry, airside transit and exit from Portugal.
