Terrorists are likely to try to carry out attacks in the Maldives. Attacks could be indiscriminate, including in places frequented by expatriates and foreign travellers including tourists.
UK Counter Terrorism Policing has information and advice on staying safe abroad and what to do in the event of a terrorist attack. Find out more about the global threat from terrorism.
In April 2020 Daesh (formerly referred to as ISIL) claimed that an arson attack against boats in Mahibadhoo Island harbour in Alifu Dhaalu atoll was carried out by supporters of the group. Police investigations are ongoing. The Maldivian authorities have designated this as a terrorist incident and charged two individuals in relation to the arson attack. This follows knife attacks against three foreigners (two resident employees and one tourist) in Hulhumale’ in February, which were claimed by Daesh supporters. The Maldives police made a number of arrests in relation to the knife attacks. You should remain vigilant.
The Maldivian authorities have disrupted a number of terrorist attack plans since 2017, and have made several arrests relating to attack planning, recruitment of terrorist fighters and spreading extremist ideology. There have been anti-Western protests by extremists on some islands, including expressions of support for ISIL.
There’s a heightened threat of terrorist attack globally against UK interests and British nationals, from groups or individuals motivated by the conflict in Iraq and Syria. You should be vigilant at this time.
