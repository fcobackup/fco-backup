The FCDO advises against all but essential travel to:
the whole of Zambia based on the current assessment of COVID-19 risks.
Travel to Zambia is subject to entry restrictions
All visitors and returning residents must have proof that they have tested negative for COVID-19 in the 14 days before their arrival in Zambia. There is no requirement to self-isolate on arrival.
Temperature checking is routine on arrival. If your body temperature is 38 degrees Celsius or higher, you will be tested for COVID-19. If you also show additional symptoms, you will be taken to government facilities for treatment and quarantine.
As of 20 October, all travellers wishing to leave Zambia to travel to a country that requires a negative COVID-19 test will be required to produce a medical certificate stating that they have tested negative for COVID-19 in the previous 14 days. This requirement does not apply to travellers to a destination that does not require a negative test (including the UK) but travellers are advised to check with their airline on their requirements prior to travel.
See Entry requirements for more information before you plan to travel.
Return travel to the UK is subject to self-isolation requirements
If you’re returning to the UK, you will need to:
provide your journey and contact details
self-isolate for 14 days
Check the guidance on entering or returning to the UK.
