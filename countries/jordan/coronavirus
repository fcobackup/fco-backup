Entry restrictions
On 14 March, the Jordanian Government announced that commercial flights in to and out of Jordan will be stopped and all land and sea borders will be closed at 11.59pm on Monday 16 March. This decision will be reviewed on 30 March.
Local measures
The Government of Jordan announced on 20 March further measures to tackle the spread of COVID-19. The Prime Minister imposed a full curfew from 0700 on 21 March until further notice. Anyone violating the curfew will be liable to immediate imprisonment. A very narrow exception to the curfew has been authorised by the Prime Minister for those whose work is necessary to keep the country running. While the atmosphere is fairly calm on the streets, with the curfew generally well adhered to, there have been a number of arrests for violations of it.
The Jordanian Armed Forces announced that the military will be spread out across the entire country at the entry and exit points of large towns and cities.
The Central Bank of Jordan announced on 17 March that banks will be closed until 31 March. ATM machines will remain available and continue to be refilled. Citizens and those in Jordan are currently not permitted to visit ATMs due to the curfew.
All health sector visits and operations have been stopped except for critical or life threatening cases. For medical emergencies, you must call the emergency services on 911 before trying to get to a hospital.
