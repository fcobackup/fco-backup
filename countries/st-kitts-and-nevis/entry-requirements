Visitors will be able to leave quarantine after 5 days once negative PCR tests have been received. Whilst in quarantine, visitors will not be allowed to move freely around their hotel.
Vaccinated parents travelling with a non-vaccinated child under 18 will not be allowed to integrate into St Kitts and Nevis until PCR tests for the child taken on day 14 have come back negative.
