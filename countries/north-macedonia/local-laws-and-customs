Same-sex relationships arenâ€™t illegal, but Macedonians/citizens of the Republic of North Macedonia are not particularly open about the issue and there are few bars and restaurants which are LGBT friendly. See our information and advice page for the LGBT community before you travel.
Taking photographs of any military installation, establishment or site of government or strategic importance is prohibited.
