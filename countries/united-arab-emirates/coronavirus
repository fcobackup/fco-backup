Local measures
The authorities have introduced strict measures to limit the spread of COVID-19.

In Dubai and Abu Dhabi, a permit is required during these hours and you should apply through the Dubai permits website or the Abu Dhabi Police website.
While there has been some relaxation of daytime movement restrictions during Ramadan, you should monitor UAE government advice closely as this may be subject to change at short notice. You can keep up to date with information via official sources such as Dubai Media Office and Emirates News Agency.
Tourist and cultural sites have been closed temporarily. Pharmacies and supermarkets remain open. Since 24 April, Dubai shopping malls, markets and commercial outlets will be open for restricted hours, social distancing and other measures will apply.
All schools in the UAE are now closed for the remainder of this academic year. Many events have been cancelled. If you are planning to attend a specific event in the UAE, check with the organisers.
