This page gives you guidance on how to stay safely in Poland as a visitor, if you are unable to return to the UK.
Everyone should comply with the measures put in place in Poland to limit the spread of coronavirus (COVID-19).
Moving around in Poland
For information on entering Poland, see Entry Requirements
You must cover your nose and mouth when outside (with a mask or scarf). Children under 4 are not required to wear a mask and you do not need to wear a mask in a car if you are travelling with people you live with.
When outside, you should keep a 2 metre distance from others, unless you are a parent with a child under 13 or the carer of a disabled person. A limited number of people at any one time are allowed to attend religious services and no more than 50 people are allowed to attend a cemetery for a funeral. You are encouraged to participate in religious events via television, radio or the internet if possible.
Public transport use is limited to reduced capacity seating to maintain appropriate distance between passengers. You can still use taxis.
There are fines between £1000 to £6000 (5000 to 30000 PLN) if you are found breaking these rules.
Hotels and short term accommodation establishments are open subject to strict sanitary rules and some facilities may be closed (for example swimming pools).
Beaches, zoos, playgrounds, cinemas, operas and theatres are currently closed. Some museums, libraries and cultural venues are open with limitations.
Some sporting facilities are open with limits on visitor numbers. If you plan to visit a cultural or sports venue we recommend first consulting their website for information about opening. Many have information in English as well as Polish. National Forests and parks are open, though the nose and mouth covering and social distancing rules above apply if you visit them.
Grocery shops, pharmacies and banks remain open. The number of customers at any one time has been restricted and you may have to queue outside until others have finished their shopping. You will be required to wear gloves in shops for sanitary reasons. Shopping centres are open with limits on how many customers can be present at any one time.
Restaurants and pubs are permitted to open provided they put in place distancing and specific hygiene measures. Hairdressers may also open by appointment only and where possible face masks should be worn during the visit.
Some nurseries and kindergartens are open subject to strict sanitary procedures. A staged relaxation of the rules for students began on 18 May, including allowing classes and childcare for Grades 1-3 of primary schools (6 to 9 year olds). From 25 May Higher Education Institutions will be allowed to open for some classes. If you are a student or parent you should consult your education provider for more information.
The above measures may be extended further, in scope and time, at short notice.
UK nationals living in Poland should note that the Office for Foreigners has put limitations on in-person appointments. If you are a UK national residing in Poland for over 3 months, and trying to register your stay, please check the guidance on residency during the coronavirus pandemic applicable to UK nationals.

Finance
There is a range of financial support from the government that you can access while you are unable to return due to coronavirus restrictions.
If you’re in Poland, and have exhausted all other options to cover essential living costs while you wait to return home, you could apply for an emergency loan for your living costs from the UK government. You can only apply if you normally live in the UK and you cannot return home. This last-resort option is for those most in need, and you would need to repay the loan when you are back in the UK. Apply for an emergency loan.

If you need urgent consular assistance, contact your nearest British embassy, high commission or consulate. All telephone numbers are available 24/7.
