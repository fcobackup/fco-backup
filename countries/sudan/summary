Consular support is severely limited in parts of Sudan where the FCO advise against all travel and all but essential travel. The British Embassy no longer registers British nationals in Sudan and the capacity of the British Embassy to help in times of crisis may be limited. You should consider your own travel arrangements carefully and make sure you have up-to-date travel documents and visas in case you need to leave at short notice. See this crisis guidance page for more information about the precautions you should take in the event of a crisis and the help and support the British Embassy can provide.
Terrorists are likely to try to carry out attacks in Sudan. Attacks could be indiscriminate, including in places frequented by expatriates and foreign travellers. See Terrorism
