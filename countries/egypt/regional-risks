Warning
FCDO advises against all travel to parts of Egypt.

This section has safety advice for regions of Egypt. It only covers regions where FCDO has specific advice.
You should also read FCDO’s overall travel advice and safety and security advice.
Egypt-Libya border
FCDO advises against all travel to within 20km of the Egypt-Libya border, except for the town of El Salloum, where we advise against all but essential travel. There are active military operations targeting criminal activity in this area.
North Sinai
FCDO advises against all travel to North Sinai Governate due to continuing criminal activity and terrorist attacks on police and security forces that have resulted in deaths. See Terrorism in Egypt.
Northern part of South Sinai
FCDO advises against all but essential travel to the northern part of South Sinai Governate, beyond the St Catherine-Nuweibaa road, except for the coastal areas along the west and east of the peninsula.
We advise against all but essential travel due to criminal activity and terrorist attacks on police and security forces that have resulted in deaths. See Terrorism.
If you plan to travel in a 4-wheel-drive vehicle from mainland Egypt through the Suez crossing, you must get a permit from Travel Permits Department of the Egyptian Ministry of the Interior. You should book any activities outside of resort areas through approved agents or tour operators.
There is no FCDO travel warning for Red Sea tourist areas in the southern part of the Sinai Peninsula and further south. Security forces carry out routine checks on vehicles and at airports to protect resorts such as Sharm el Sheikh, Hurghada and Marsa Alam.
Eastern part of Ismailiyah Governorate
FCDO advises against all but essential travel to the parts of the Ismailiyah Governorate which are east of the Suez Canal, due to ongoing military operations against terrorists and criminals. Egyptian authorities at checkpoints may prevent onward travel to this region. See Terrorism.
Western Desert
FCDO advises against all but essential travel to the area west of the Nile Valley and Nile Delta regions due to risks from criminal activity and military operations, except for:
Luxor, Qina, Valley of the Kings, Aswan and Abu Simbel
the Faiyum Governorate
the coastal areas between the Nile Delta and Marsa Matruh
the Marsa Matruh-Siwa road
the oasis town of Siwa
the Giza Governorate north-east of the Bahariya Oasis
the road between Giza and Farafra (but we advise against all but essential travel on the road between Bahariya and Siwa)
Bahariya Oasis, Farafra, the White Desert and Black Desert
Tourists who enter the Western Desert areas of Bahariya Oasis, Farafra, the White Desert and Black Desert must apply for permits in advance and use an official guide. There is limited phone reception and poor medical facilities. Monitor travel advice and follow guidance from official guides and local authorities.
FCDO advises against all but essential travel on the road between Al Bawiti and Siwa, including the desert areas near the start of the road in Bahariya. The road is closed and there are military checkpoints.
If you travel to the south-west corner of Egypt near the border with Sudan or Libya, you will need a permit from the Ministry of Interior. Bandits and armed groups operate in these areas.
Be extremely cautious in all border areas.
Hala’ib Triangle and Bir Tawil Trapezoid
FCDO advises against all but essential travel to the Hala’ib Triangle and Bir Tawil Trapezoid.
The Hala’ib Triangle remains disputed territory between Egypt and Sudan. If you’re in the Hala’ib Triangle and need urgent UK government support, contact the British Embassy in Cairo.
The Bir Tawil Trapezoid is unclaimed by either Egypt or Sudan. If you’re in this area and need urgent UK government support, contact FCDO in the last country you travelled through.
Egypt-Sudan border
People continue to try to cross the border from Sudan into Egypt. There are 2 main land border crossings – Qustul and Argeen. There is almost no infrastructure at these crossings. The nearest town in Sudan is Wadi Halfa, 30km from the border.
The British Embassy in Cairo does not have staff at the border and our ability to provide assistance is very limited. Travel in and from Sudan is at your own risk. See Sudan travel advice.
If you are a British national and have crossed into Egypt from Sudan without valid documents, contact the British Embassy in Cairo for support.
