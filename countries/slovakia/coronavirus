Public spaces and services
Following a phased lifting of restrictions, most shops, restaurants, services, nightclubs, schools and tourism and leisure facilities have reopened, but with social distancing and hygiene measures in place.
Local public transport is running as normal, but face masks are required.
Wearing face masks outside is no longer required but it remains compulsory in most indoor situations (such as on public transport, and in shops, cinemas and theatres).
Large events may now take place if they maintain social distancing and hygiene.
