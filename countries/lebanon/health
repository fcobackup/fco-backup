Warning
FCDO advises against all travel to parts of Lebanon.

Before you travel check that:
your destination can provide the healthcare you may need
you have appropriate travel insurance for local treatment or unexpected medical evacuation
This is particularly important if you have a health condition or are pregnant.
Emergency medical number
Dial 112 and ask for an ambulance.
Contact your insurance company promptly if you’re referred to a medical facility for treatment.
Vaccinations and health risks
At least 8 weeks before your trip check:
the latest information on vaccinations and health risks in TravelHealthPro’s Lebanon guide
where to get vaccines and whether you have to pay on the NHS travel vaccinations page
There have been reported cases of cholera in Lebanon. More guidance is available in TravelHealthPro’s cholera factsheet.
Medication
Medical supplies are increasingly hard to find in country. You should take any medicines you need with you to Lebanon. The legal status and regulation of some medicines prescribed or purchased in the UK can be different in other countries. If you’re travelling with prescription medication you should carry a medical certificate confirming that the medication has been prescribed for a medical condition.
Read best practice when travelling with medicines on TravelHealthPro.
The NHS has information on whether you can take your medicine abroad.
Healthcare facilities in Lebanon
The availability and quality of medical treatment available in Lebanon is being affected by the economic crisis and fuel shortages. For example:
air conditioning and lighting may be turned off
non-essential medical treatment may be cancelled
hospitals may refuse to take patients if they are unable to treat them
emergency and life-saving care, including life support care, could be severely impacted
Medical care in Lebanon can be expensive. Most medical providers and hospitals are insisting on significant cash deposits before admitting patients, including in emergency situations. Make sure you have adequate travel health insurance and accessible funds to cover the cost of any medical treatment abroad and repatriation.
Doctors are generally well qualified, though nursing standards vary. The economic crisis has caused a number of health care professionals to leave the country. This may affect staffing levels. The majority of medical staff speak French and English.
