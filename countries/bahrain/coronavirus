Travel in Bahrain
Bahrain International Airport remains open, including for transit and transfer passengers. All arrivals aged 6 years and above, except for those transferring within the airport, will be required to undergo and pay for the enhanced arrivals testing procedure for COVID-19 and need to self-quarantine until test results have been received. Any person staying in Bahrain for 10 days or more must repeat the testing procedure on the fifth day and tenth day following their arrival in the Kingdom.
Exemptions to these rules, which include those who have been fully vaccinated in Bahrain and the GCC, are set out on the Entry requirements page.
All passengers (including transit) who are 6 years old and above arriving from India, Pakistan, Sri Lanka, Nepal and Bangladesh must also provide proof of a negative PCR test with a QR code, conducted not more than 48 hours before departure. For information on this and other updates please also check Bahrain’s Airport website.
From 13 May, on-arrival tests and quarantine will no longer be required for fully vaccinated individuals and/or COVID-19 recoverees. Currently this will only apply to those vaccinated within Bahrain and able to show their vaccination and COVID-19 recovery status certificates which can be downloaded via the Bahrain BeAware App.
In addition to fulfilling visa requirements, unvaccinated arrivals into Bahrain via the King Fahd Causeway are required to provide a negative Polymerase chain reaction (PCR) certificate valid from a test taken up to 72 hours before arrival into the Kingdom of Bahrain. The negative PCR test result required can be provided on any official COVID-19 phone application, such as the “BeAware” app, “Tatamman”, “Sehhaty” and “Alhusen”. Travellers can also provide a printed negative PCR certificate containing a QR code. From Sunday 17 January 2021 PCR testing services at the Causeway will no longer be available.
The King Fahd Causeway reopened on 3 January 2021 to allow travel into Saudi Arabia from Bahrain. Check the latest information on the Saudi Arabia Travel Advice page.
