The information on this page covers the most common types of travel and reflects the UK government’s understanding of the rules currently in place. Unless otherwise stated, this information is for travellers using a full ‘British Citizen’ passport.
The authorities in the country or territory you’re travelling to are responsible for setting and enforcing the rules for entry. If you’re unclear about any aspect of the entry requirements, or you need further reassurance, you’ll need to contact the embassy or consulate of the country or territory you’re travelling to.
You should also consider checking with your transport provider or travel company to make sure your passport and other travel documents meet their requirements.
If you are travelling to Norway for work, read the guidance on visas and permits as the rules have changed since 1 January 2021.
Entry rules in response to coronavirus
From 1 January 2021 UK nationals are no longer classified as EU/EEA nationals and will not be allowed to visit Norway unless they meet certain exceptions. You may be exempted if for example you are resident in another EEA/EU country or if you are a close family member of a Norwegian resident. Please see the UDI website for more detail on these exceptions.
However, these restrictions do not apply to UK nationals who were legally resident in Norway by 31 December 2020. Those who are legally resident will be allowed to re-enter the country when travelling but may need to show evidence of residency. This could happen at the Norwegian border or at an airport outside of Norway. The Norwegian authorities are introducing a residency card for eligible UK nationals living in Norway to help prove their status when travelling. The application process opened on 4 January 2021.
UK nationals residing in Norway and under the scope of the Separation Agreement, can use one of the following documents to prove their residence status on entry into Norway:
certificate of application under sections 19-33 to 19-35 of the Immigration Regulations
certificate for job seeker
registration certificate or proof of permanent residence issued under the registration scheme for EEA nationals
residence card
residence certificate from the National Population Register
receipt for registration under the registration scheme for EEA nationals, dated prior to 1 January 2021

Testing and quarantine requirements
Travellers who arrive in Norway from a red country (which currently includes the UK) must present a negative COVID-19 test certificate upon arrival in Norway. The test must have been taken within the 24 hours prior to departure and be in English, Norwegian, Swedish, Danish, French or German. The approved testing methods are PCR or Rapid antigen test. You may be denied entry at the Norwegian border, or boarding at the airport, if you do not produce a valid test certificate when required. You should not use the NHS testing service to get a test in order to facilitate your travel to another country. You should arrange to take a private test. For details on exemptions, see here.
You are also required to complete a self-declaration form within 72 hours prior to arrival and you should expect to be tested on arrival.
Quarantine requirements for the UK, EU, EEA and Schengen countries will be specific to each country. From 21 June, travellers legally allowed to enter Norway who have been in the UK in the last ten days will be required to stay in a quarantine hotel. A negative PCR test taken no earlier than three days after entry may allow the period of stay in the quarantine hotel to be shortened. Follow on quarantine requirements will depend on your personal circumstances. Please speak to the authorities on arrival.
For more details on Norway’s quarantine rules please see the FHI and MFA websites.

A free coronavirus testing service is available at many international airports in Norway.
Further updates will be published when available. Check our advice on things to consider, and be prepared to stay overseas longer than planned.
For more information, contact the Norwegian Embassy in London. Detailed guidance is available on the UDI website.
Transiting Norway
Non-residents are still able to transit via Norwegian airports as long as the final destination is not within Norway, but please check with your airline before departing.
Cruises
The Foreign, Commonwealth & Development Office (FCDO) advises against cruise ship travel at this time. This is due to the ongoing pandemic and is based on medical advice from Public Health England.
A number of Norwegian ports are restricting passenger embarkation and disembarkation. The situation can change rapidly so check with your cruise provider for the latest information.
Visas
The Norwegian authorities have confirmed that if your visa has expired or is at risk of expiring, you will be not punished if you overstay as a result of COVID-19 or airline cancellations. You are not required to notify UDI or the police, but are asked to try to leave as quickly as possible.
UK military arrivals
Separate arrangements are in place for UK military arrivals in Norway, who should consult their unit.
Regular entry requirements
Visas
The rules for travelling or working in European countries changed on 1 January 2021:
you can travel to countries in the Schengen area for up to 90 days in any 180-day period without a visa. This applies if you travel as a tourist, to visit family or friends, to attend business meetings, cultural or sports events, or for short-term studies or training.
if you are travelling to Norway and other Schengen countries without a visa, make sure your whole visit is within the 90-day limit. Visits to Schengen countries within the previous 180 days before you travel count towards your 90 days.
to stay longer, to work or study, for business travel or for other reasons, you will need to meet the Norwegian government’s entry requirements. Check with the Norwegian Embassy what type of visa and/or work permit, you may need.
if you stay in Norway with a visa or permit, this does not count towards the 90-day visa-free limit
Any time you spent in Norway or other Schengen countries before 1 January 2021 does not count towards your 90-day visa-free limit.
At Norwegian border control, you may need to use separate lanes from EU, EEA and Swiss citizens when queueing. Your passport may be stamped on entry and exit. You may also need to:
show a return or onward ticket
show you have enough money for your stay
There are separate requirements for those who are resident in Norway. If you are resident in Norway, you should carry proof of residence as well as your valid passport when you travel. For further information on these requirements, see our Living in Norway guide.
Passport validity
Check your passport is valid for travel before you book your trip, and renew your passport if you do not have enough time left on it.
You must have at least 6 months left on an adult or child passport to travel to most countries in Europe (not including Ireland).
If you renewed your current passport before the previous one expired, extra months may have been added to its expiry date. Any extra months on your passport over 10 years may not count towards the 6 months needed.
Svalbard
You’ll need your passport with you to travel to and enter Svalbard.
UK Emergency Travel Documents
UK ETDs are accepted for entry, airside transit and exit from Norway.
Pets
Check with the Norwegian Embassy in London before travelling with pets.
