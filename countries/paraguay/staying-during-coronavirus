This page gives you guidance on how to stay safely in Paraguay as a visitor, if you are unable to return to the UK.
Everyone should comply with the measures put in place in Paraguay to limit the spread of coronavirus (COVID-19).
Moving around in Paraguay
For information on entering Paraguay, see Entry Requirements.
Paraguayan authorities have declared a nationwide health-related State of Emergency. Measures include:
a ban on all non-essential movement nationwide. There are exceptions to buy food, go to the pharmacy or hospital, and for key workers. Stay in your accommodation unless absolutely necessary to go out
in-person classes have been suspended until December 2020
the cancellation of mass events and gatherings (public and private) such as at cinemas, concerts and conventions, as well as religious, sports, leisure and political activities
a requirement to wear a face mask in public, including on public transport, throughout Paraguay
If you’re in Paraguay, follow the advice of the Paraguayan authorities.
Easing of restrictions
From 4 May onwards, “smart quarantine” measures will be introduced to relax nationwide measures in 4 phases. Phase 1 started on 4 May, phase 2 on 25 May, phase 3 on 15 June and phase 4 is to be confirmed.
Phase 1 consists of the reopening of industries, small businesses with up to 3 people inside, and all delivery services.
Phase 2 consists of the reopening of corporate buildings with up to 50% of the workforce present and under a rotation schedule. This includes, civil construction, shopping centres and medium-sized businesses, hairdressers (up to 30 minutes per appointment), religious services (such as weddings and baptisms) with no more than ten people present, and moving services. This is to be carried out in compliance with strict health and safety measures, including the washing of hands coming in and out of venues/sites, mandatory physical distancing and the wearing of face masks at all times.
Outdoor individual physical activity, such as walking, can occur within 500 meters of a person’s home. Underage children must be accompanied by at least one adult and avoid interaction with children outside of the immediate family. Access to public and private parks for walking/running trails only is permitted but observing the following: * From 5:00am to 10:00am access for people, age 65 and older. * From 10:30am to 20:00pm access for people between the ages of 10 and 64. The use of common areas such as playgrounds, exercise machines, courts and benches are not allowed.
Visas
Due to travel restrictions, the Paraguayan immigration authorities have automatically extended the 90-day permission for tourists and non-residents to stay in Paraguay from 13 March onwards, for the duration of the emergency.
You can find more information on the Paraguayan Dirección General de Migraciones website (in Spanish).
Health
If you present symptoms, you should contact the Paraguayan Ministry of Health at 154 or INERAM hospital at (021) 290 838.
People who have tested positive for COVID-19 and do not need to be admitted to hospital, will stay in specialised shelters. This includes the following:
those who would like to do so voluntarily
those in vulnerable situations whose accommodation is not suitable for self-isolation (because it is crowded and/or small)
those who have broken self-isolation
those who have come from abroad and tested positive during their quarantine period
Further information is also available on the Paraguayan Ministry of Health website or official Twitter channel (both in Spanish).

Finance
There is a range of financial support from the government that you can access while you are unable to return due to coronavirus restrictions.
If you’re in Paraguay, and have exhausted all other options to cover essential living costs while you wait to return home, you could apply for an emergency loan for your living costs from the UK government. You can only apply if you normally live in the UK and you cannot return home. This last-resort option is for those most in need, and you would need to repay the loan when you are back in the UK. Apply for an emergency loan.
For further UK government guidance on support you can access whilst abroad, visit our waiting to return guidance. This includes guidance on finance, health, and staying connected.
Help and support
If you need urgent consular assistance, contact your nearest British embassy, high commission or consulate. All telephone numbers are available 24/7.
