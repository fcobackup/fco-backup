Travel in El Salvador
The legally enforced 24/7 curfew has ended and El Salvador has started a phased reopening plan. However many restrictions remain in force and most businesses and services are closed or limited.

Anyone leaving their accommodation must wear a face covering. Public transport is not operating. You should familiarise yourself with any local measures or restrictions. You should comply with these and other emergency measures.

Hotels and some private rentals are closed to tourists. Under the government’s phased reopening plans tourist services are unlikely to resume before mid August.
Public spaces and services
Key services (including supermarkets, pharmacies, banks, petrol stations and take away/home delivery food services) are open; entry controls, temperature checks, social distancing measures and limits on customer numbers are common. Schools and universities and many other businesses and organisations, including eat in services, are closed. Public beaches and parks are closed and large gatherings are discouraged.
