The information on this page covers the most common types of travel and reflects the UK government’s understanding of the rules currently in place. Unless otherwise stated, this information is for travellers using a full ‘British Citizen’ passport.
The authorities in the country or territory you’re travelling to are responsible for setting and enforcing the rules for entry. If you’re unclear about any aspect of the entry requirements, or you need further reassurance, you’ll need to contact the embassy, high commission or consulate of the country or territory you’re travelling to.
You should also consider checking with your transport provider or travel company to make sure your passport and other travel documents meet their requirements.
Covid-19 entry requirements
Travel between the UK and France
From Monday 31 May, travel to France from the UK is permitted only for EU nationals, French residents, or those travelling for essential reasons. This applies to all air, car, ferry and train passengers.
Arrivals from the UK who are resident in France may need to show proof of residence. Those who are not French residents or EU nationals will need an essential reason to travel and to complete an International Travel Certificate. Further information is available on the French government’s website.
Arrivals from the UK will need to complete a ‘sworn statement’ (déclaration sur l’honneur) form self-certifying they are not suffering from symptoms associated with coronavirus and have not been in contact with confirmed cases in the preceding fortnight. This can be found on the French government’s website.
The French government strongly advises limiting international travel to a minimum.
Testing requirements
All travellers from the UK, including children aged 11 and above, will need to present a negative PCR COVID-19 test result, carried out less than 72 hours before departure. As of Monday 31 May, this requirement will change: a negative PCR or antigen test result will be accepted, carried out less than 48 hours before departure.
HGV or van drivers arriving in France from the UK are no longer required to provide a negative COVID-19 test to enter France. The latest information for HGV or van drivers is available here.
You should not use the NHS testing service to get a test in order to facilitate your travel to another country. You should arrange to take a private test from a private coronavirus testing provider.
Self-isolation
Passengers arriving in France from the UK must agree to self-isolate for seven days on arrival, and, if over 11 years of age, to take a PCR test at the end of the isolation period. Find more information on how to get a PCR test in France.

Check our COVID-19 advice on things to consider, and be prepared to stay overseas longer than planned.
Travel within the EU
All air, car, ferry and train passengers arriving from the European area (defined by the French Ministry of the Interior as EU Member States, Andorra, Holy See, Iceland, Liechtenstein, Monaco, Norway, San Marino and Switzerland) will need to present a negative COVID-19 PCR test result, carried out less than 72 hours before departure. Arrivals will also need to present a completed ‘sworn statement’ (déclaration sur l’honneur) form, self-certifying they are not suffering from symptoms associated with coronavirus and have not been in contact with confirmed cases in the preceding fortnight. This form can be found on the French government’s website. Travellers should then self-isolate for seven days on arrival, before taking another PCR test. There are some exemptions to this requirement for cross-border workers and hauliers from within the European area, as well as people travelling within a 30km radius of their home. Please check local guidance for further information.
You should consult the French government’s advice for foreign nationals in France page for further information.
Travel between the EU and non-European countries
Any international travel – to or from France – from a country outside of the European area is prohibited, with the exception of certain essential reasons as listed on the international travel certificate, including airside transit stops of less than 24 hours.
From 12 March, this no longer applies to travel from Australia, South Korea, Israel, Japan, New Zealand and Singapore. Travellers arriving from these countries who have stayed in another country outside the European area in the 14 days preceding their arrival remain subject to the requirement to evidence a compelling reason.
Additional measures apply to those arriving from: Argentina, Bangladesh, Brazil, Chile, India, Nepal, Pakistan, Qatar, South Africa, Sri Lanka, Turkey and the United Arab Emirates; and from 16 May, Bahrain, Colombia, Costa Rica and Uruguay. Arrivals from these countries are required to present a negative PCR test result, carried out less than 36 hours before departure, or a negative PCR test less than 72 hours before departure accompanied by a negative antigen test from within 24 hours of departure. Arrivals will also be required to quarantine at a given address for 10 days upon arrival, before taking another PCR test. Travel from these countries is permitted for French nationals and residents only. The period of self-isolation will be subject to police checks, with fines of €1500 for non-compliance. Please see the French government’s website for further guidance.
The French government has put in place COVID-19 travel restrictions on international arrivals. Essential travel is still permitted and the latest list of exemptions for entering France can be found on the French government’s advice for foreign nationals in France page. Persons (including UK nationals) who are legally resident in France will be allowed to re-enter the country, but may need to show proof of residence.
You should not use the NHS testing service to get a test in order to facilitate your travel to another country. You should arrange to take a private test. A list of private providers of coronavirus testing is available here.
If you wish to travel from France to a country outside the European area, you must also complete a ‘Certificate to leave Metropolitan France’, which specifies exemptions for travel outside the European.
Further information on French COVID-19 travel restrictions can be found on the French government’s website.
If you are travelling from a country which is not exempt from French COVID-19 travel restrictions you may only enter France if your journey is essential and meets the criteria for exceptions. You will also need to complete both an exempted international movement certificate and a sworn declaration that you do not have COVID-19 symptoms, which can be found on the French government’s website. You will also be required to present a negative test result, carried out less than 72 hours before departure, upon your arrival in France. If you do not have this result, you could be asked to take this test at your airport of arrival in France.
Arrivals will also be required to self-isolate for 7 days on arrival, before taking another PCR test. Further information is available from the French Government’s advice for foreign nationals in France.
Travellers should equip themselves with the necessary attestation whilst travelling to their point of international departure if travel takes place during the daily curfew. Some countries are imposing a compulsory period of quarantine for travellers from France. If you are travelling from or through France, check the situation at your destination before you travel.
Travel between France and the UK
From 12 March, arrivals no longer need to justify an essential reason for travel from France to the UK. If you intend to travel to England, Scotland, or Wales, including UK nationals returning home from travel abroad, you must provide evidence of a negative COVID-19 test result taken up to 3 days before departure. If you do not comply (and you do not have a valid exemption) your airline or carrier may refuse you boarding and/or you may be fined on arrival. You can access tests in France via the French government’s website. Travellers will then be subject to quarantine measures in place in the UK upon entry.
Travel to French overseas territories
Regular flights between metropolitan France and its overseas territories resumed in late June. Travellers need to provide a negative RT-PCR test taken in the 72 hours preceding arrival, and complete a self-declaration of absence of COVID-19 symptoms and contact with confirmed cases in the 14 days preceding arrival for entry into all French overseas territories. This is available in English on the French Embassy London’s travel and quarantine page.
For travel to certain French Overseas Territories, you must present an international travel certificate confirming that your journey is essential and that you have not been suffering from a set of listed symptoms associated with COVID-19 or in contact with confirmed cases in the 14 days prior to travel. This international travel certificate and further information on travel requirements for the French Overseas Territories is available on the French Ministry of Interior website. The certificate is to be presented to transportation companies before boarding, as well as to border control authorities.
See travel advice pages for the French overseas territory you are visiting.
Regular entry requirements
Visas
The rules for travelling or working in European countries changed on 1 January 2021:
You can travel to countries in the Schengen area, which France is part of, for up to 90 days in any 180-day period without a visa. This applies if you travel as a tourist, to visit family or friends, to attend business meetings, cultural or sports events, or for short-term studies or training. Find more information here
If you are travelling to France and other Schengen countries without a visa, make sure your whole visit is within the 90-day limit. Visits to Schengen countries within the previous 180 days before you travel count towards your 90 days.
To stay longer, to work or study, for business travel or for other reasons, you will need to meet the French government’s entry requirements. To see what your individual entry requirement might be, you should visit the France Visas website
If you stay in France with a visa or permit, this does not count towards your 90-day visa free limit.
British citizens who are unable to return to the UK before the expiry of their visa / permit or the end of their visa-free limit due to COVID-19 restrictions should contact their local immigration authorities in France.
Any time you spent in France or other Schengen countries before 1 January 2021 does not count towards your 90-day visa-free limit.
At French border control your passport may be stamped on entry and exit. You should also be prepared to:
Queue in separate lanes from EU, EEA or Swiss citizens.
Show proof of where you intend to stay, for example, a booking confirmation or proof of address if visiting your own property (e.g. second home). Further information is detailed below.

France categorises possible accommodation arrangements for visitors as follows:
Staying with family, friends or third party You may be asked to provide an ’attestation d’accueil’ (welcome invitation) from your host if you are staying with friends or family. The French resident hosting you will need to obtain this attestation d’accueil from their local Mayor’s office, and send the original attestation before you enter France. You should also be prepared to show proof of funds of at least €32.50 per day, for the duration of your stay. If you do not have an ‘attestation d’accueil’ you should be ready to fulfil the requirements of option 4 below.
You have a second home in France You will need to be able to prove ownership or tenancy of your property e.g. a tax or utility bill.
You are staying in a hotel or other commercially provided accommodation You may be asked for confirmation of your reservation when entering France. You should also be prepared to show proof of funds of at least €65 per day for the duration of your stay.
You do not have an ‘attestation d’accueil’ or any pre-booked accommodation In this instance, you may be asked to prove you have sufficient funds to pay for your accommodation. You should also be prepared to show proof of funds of at least €120 per day for the duration of your stay.
British citizens who are unable to return to the UK before the expiry of their visa/permit or the end of their visa-free limit due to COVID-19 restrictions should contact their local immigration authorities in France.
There are separate requirements for those who are resident in France. If you are resident in France, you should carry proof of residence as well as your valid passport when you travel. For further information on for residents, see our Living in France guide.

Passport validity
Check your passport is valid for travel before you book your trip, and renew your passport if you do not have enough time left on it.
You must have at least 6 months left on an adult or child passport to travel to most countries in Europe (not including Ireland).
If you renewed your current passport before the previous one expired, extra months may have been added to its expiry date. Any extra months on your passport over 10 years may not count towards the 6 months needed.
