During periods of unrest, police checks may increase. Make sure you have all required documentation with you and avoid large gatherings.
Consular support may be limited in Gabon. However, the British High Commission in Yaoundé, Cameroon or Honorary Consul in Libreville can provide consular support to British nationals. See Consular assistance
