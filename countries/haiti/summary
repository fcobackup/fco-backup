The Foreign, Commonwealth & Development Office (FCDO) advises against all travel to Haiti due to the volatile security situation.
Before you travel, check the ‘Entry requirements’ section for Haiti’s current entry restrictions and requirements. These may change with little warning. Monitor this advice for the latest updates and stay in contact with your travel provider.
If you plan to pass through another country to return to the UK, check the travel advice for the country you’re transiting.
Tropical Storm Franklin
The Atlantic hurricane season runs from June to November. In the Caribbean this frequently coincides with heavy rains, which may cause flash floods and landslides. Tropical Storm Franklin is forecast to bring hazardous weather conditions across Haiti from around Tuesday 22 August and may develop into a hurricane. Follow the advice of local authorities and your tour operator, including any evacuation orders. See Hurricanes for more information.
There are currently no British consular officials in Haiti and our ability to provide consular assistance is severely limited and cannot be delivered in person within Haiti.
If you choose to travel to or stay in Haiti against FCDO advice, you should keep a low profile. Be vigilant, try to avoid all crowds and public events, and take appropriate security precautions
If you are a British national in Haiti and need to speak to a consular officer, you can:
call the FCDO on +44 (0)1908 516666 (or 01908 516666 in the UK) (available 24 hours a day)

contact us on Twitter or Facebook.
British nationals may access consular services at our diplomatic missions in neighbouring countries.
The FCDO cannot offer advice on the safety of travelling to any departure point within Haiti.
It is more important than ever to get travel insurance and check it provides sufficient cover. See the FCDO’s guidance on foreign travel insurance.
Although there’s no recent history of terrorism in Haiti, attacks cannot be ruled out. See Terrorism
There are no central emergency services in Haiti. Medical facilities are very limited and offer a poor standard of care. Serious conditions may require medical evacuation, which can be very expensive. See Health
