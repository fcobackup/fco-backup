This page has information on travelling to Greece. Check what you must do to return to the UK.
This page reflects the UK government’s understanding of current rules for people travelling on a full ‘British Citizen’ passport from the UK, for the most common types of travel.
The authorities in Greece set and enforce entry rules.
All travellers
From 15 March 2022 onwards, arrivals in Greece are no longer required to complete a Passenger Locator Form (PLF).
Additional restrictions on entry by air
Air connections with Greece are liable to suspension or amendment, sometimes at short notice. If you are due to fly to or from Greece, you should contact your airline or operator for the latest information.
Additional restrictions on entry by land borders
Greece’s land borders are subject to restrictions at present. Monitor official information from the Greek authorities on any changes to border arrangements. You should also refer to the ‘Coronavirus’ page for details of how local or national measures may affect travel across land borders
If you’re fully vaccinated
The following requirements for entry to Greece apply regardless of your vaccination status, and apply to all travellers who are 5 years old and over.
Precise rules are subject to change and you should follow any instructions given on arrival at immigration or airport testing facilities. For more information, check the Greek authorities’ advice.
The Greek government has confirmed that from 1 May, travellers arriving from the UK, USA and European Union countries are exempt from the requirement to show a vaccine certificate, proof of a negative test, or a certificate of recovery from Covid to enter Greece.
Until 1 May, travellers from the United Kingdom, United States, Canada, Australia, Member States of the European Union (EU) and the Schengen Agreement, as well as from the other non-EU countries that have joined the European Union Digital Covid Certificate system can enter the country by:
a) showing a valid vaccination certificate. There must have been at least 14 days, and not more than nine months, since the completion of your primary vaccination for COVID-19. Booster jabs are not subject to the same time restrictions. See ‘Demonstrating your COVID-19 status’ for further details
Or;
b) showing a certificate of recovery from COVID-19. See ‘Demonstrating your COVID-19 status’ for further details
Or;
c) showing proof of a negative COVID-19 PCR test, undertaken within the 72 hour period before arrival into Greece.
Or;
d) showing proof of a negative COVID-19 rapid antigen test from an authorised laboratory, undertaken within the 24 hour period before your arrival into Greece.
Travellers from all other countries can enter Greece by:
a) showing proof of a negative COVID-19 PCR test, undertaken within the 72 hour period before arrival into Greece.
Or;
b) showing proof of a negative COVID-19 rapid antigen test from an authorised laboratory, undertaken within the 24 hour period before your arrival into Greece.
The test provider must be certified by the competent national certification authority of the country in which you received the test, and must provide you with a certificate of your test result in English. The certificate must include the full name of the person, as stated on the passport.
In addition, arrivals into Greece may be required to undergo a rapid COVID-19 test on arrival. If you test positive on arrival in Greece, you (and those you are travelling with) will have to self-isolate for at least 5 days at home or in quarantine hotels provided by the Greek state. If you have no symptoms on day 5, or your symptoms have improved (e.g. having no fever for the past 24 hours without the use of medicine), you will be allowed to end your quarantine. However, if you still have a fever you will be required to continue to quarantine until your fever drops.
Travellers leaving quarantine are also legally required to wear an FFP2 / N95 mask, or double masks (at least one of which should be surgical), in all public indoor and outdoor spaces for at least 5 days after the end of their quarantine.
See ‘Coronavirus’ page for details of what to do if you test positive for COVID-19 while in Greece.
You should also be aware that if other passengers on your flight, bus, train or ferry later test positive, you may be subject to self-isolation requirements. These will be mandatory and you should comply with the Greek authorities’ requirements.
Travellers who are travelling from, or permanent residents of, certain countries may be required to take a further antigen or PCR test upon their arrival, or show a completed vaccination certificate or proof of recovery from Covid-19. Non-Greek nationals travelling from some countries may only be allowed to enter Greece for essential travel. You can find the list of which countries travellers can enter Greece from, and whether there are any further requirements from the Greek authorities.

Children and young people
The measures to enter Greece apply to all travellers aged 5 and above. Children under 5 do not need to provide a negative test for entry to Greece. In Greece, children aged 5 and over who have not had the COVID-19 vaccine are considered unvaccinated and must follow the same requirements as unvaccinated adults, see ‘If you’re not fully vaccinated’.
If you’re transiting through Greece
International passengers wishing to transit through airports in Greece are not required to carry negative COVID-19 tests or present a vaccination certificate. These measures are subject to change. You should check what is required for entry at your final destination with your travel operator and relevant authorities.
Exemptions
There are no exemptions to the entry requirements for Greece.
Check your passport and travel documents before you travel
Passport validity
If you are planning to travel to an EU country (except Ireland), or Switzerland, Norway, Iceland, Liechtenstein, Andorra, Monaco, San Marino or Vatican City, you must meet the Schengen area rules.
Your passport must meet 2 requirements. It must be:
less than 10 years old on the day you enter (check the ‘date of issue’)
valid for at least 3 months after the day you plan to leave (check the ‘expiry date’)
We are asking the European Commission to clarify the 10-year rule. Their guidance for Schengen border guards may not be updated until the spring of 2022. Until then, for some Schengen countries your passport may need to be less than 10 years old during your whole visit, and the 3 months at the end of your visit may need to be within 10 years of your passport’s issue date.
Check both the issue date and the expiry date in your passport. If you renewed your passport early, extra months may have been added to its expiry date. This could affect the requirement for your passport to be less than 10 years old.
Contact your travel provider or embassy of the country you are visiting if you think that your passport does not meet both these requirements. Renew your passport if you need to.
Visas
You can travel to countries in the Schengen area for up to 90 days in any 180-day period without a visa. This applies if you travel as a tourist, to visit family or friends, to attend business meetings, cultural or sports events, or for short-term studies or training.
If you are travelling to Greece and other Schengen countries without a visa, make sure your whole visit is within the 90-day limit. Visits to Schengen countries within the previous 180 days before you travel count towards your 90 days.
To stay longer, to work or study, for business or for other reasons, you will need to meet the Greek government’s entry requirements. Check with the Greek Embassy what type of visa and/or work permit, if any, you may need.
If you are travelling to Greece for work, read the guidance on visas and permits.
If you stay in Greece with a residence permit or long-stay visa, this does not count towards your 90-day visa-free limit.
Passport stamping
Check your passport is stamped if you enter or exit the Schengen area through Greece as a visitor. Border guards will use passport stamps to check you’re complying with the 90-day visa-free limit for short stays in the Schengen area. If relevant entry or exit stamps are not in your passport, border guards will presume that you have overstayed your visa-free limit.
You can show evidence of when and where you entered or exited the Schengen area, and ask the border guards to add this date and location in your passport. Examples of acceptable evidence include boarding passes and tickets.
You may also need to:
show a return or onward ticket
show you have enough money for your stay
If you are resident in Greece, read our Living in Greece guide for passport stamping information.
Travelling with medication
According to Greek law, a visitor can bring up to 5 different prescribed medicines for personal use, with a maximum of 2 boxes of each medicine.
Some prescribed and over-the-counter medicines available in the UK, including medication containing codeine, are considered controlled substances in Greece. A doctor’s prescription is required in all cases, which should mention your details, the types of medicine and the condition treated. On arrival, Greek Customs may in some cases require you to obtain permission from the Greek National Organisation of Medicines - if you need to carry more than the permitted number of boxes, for example. The National Organisation of Medicines examines these requests on a case by case basis.
For more information on controlled medicines, contact the Greek National Organisation of Medicines (telephone: 0030 213 2040 285 / 307 / 225, open Monday to Friday, 12pm to 3pm Greece time, or email: relation@eof.gr).
UK Emergency Travel Documents
UK Emergency Travel Documents are valid for entry, airside transit and exit from Greece.
