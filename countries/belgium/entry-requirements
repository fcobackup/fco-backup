The information on this page covers the most common types of travel and reflects the UK government’s understanding of the rules currently in place. Unless otherwise stated, this information is for travellers using a full ‘British Citizen’ passport.
The authorities in the country or territory you’re travelling to are responsible for setting and enforcing the rules for entry. If you’re unclear about any aspect of the entry requirements, or you need further reassurance, you’ll need to contact the embassy, high commission or consulate of the country or territory you’re travelling to.
You should also consider checking with your transport provider or travel company to make sure your passport and other travel documents meet their requirements.
Entry rules in response to coronavirus (COVID-19)
The Belgian Government has announced that from 1 January 2021 entry to Belgium for UK nationals resident in the UK or outside the EU will be restricted to essential travel only due to EU-wide COVID-19 restrictions. A list of permitted reasons for essential travel can be found in the ‘travelling to Belgium from a third country’ section on website of the Belgian Immigration Office.
You must have documentation which proves that your journey is essential. Examples of documents which can be used to prove an essential journey are listed on the Embassy of Belgium in the UK’s website. These include: a work permit, an onward travel airline ticket for transit passengers, a diplomatic passport, written appointment for surgical intervention in hospital. The Embassy of Belgium in the UK may be able to issue an Essential Travel Certificate (ETC) as documentation for those who have difficulties obtaining proof that their journey is essential.
These restrictions do not apply to UK nationals who are resident in Belgium, who will need to show valid proof of residence when entering Belgium. Further information is available on the website of the Belgian Immigration Office.
All travellers from the UK, including those resident in Belgium, must complete the Belgian Passenger Locator Form (PLF) before travel and carry proof of the completed PLF throughout their journey and for the following 48 hours. Travellers who have not completed the form before travelling may be refused entry and/or face a fine.
All non-residents aged 12 years and over who plan to stay in Belgium for more than 48 hours, will need to provide evidence of a negative COVID-19 PCR test upon entry. This PCR test is to be taken no more than 72 hours prior to arrival in Belgium. Transiting passengers are advised to check the Belgian guidance for requirements. Further information is available on the website of the Belgian Embassy to the UK.
Those resident in Belgium (who do not have a negative test upon entry) will be required to take a test on arrival using a code that you will receive via SMS after submitting your PLF. Both residents and non-residents who have been out of the country for more than 48 hours will then need to quarantine for at least seven days on arrival . Following the seven days, both residents and non-residents should take another Covid-19 test. If this test is negative, you may end your quarantine. You should follow closely the instructions you receive via SMS after submitting your Passenger Locator Form. Further information on quarantine is available on the Belgian Government’s website.
If you are travelling through France, you should also check the France Travel Advice. Please note that transport services are subject to change, so please check with your transport operator before travel, including whether they will require evidence of a negative COVID-19 test before boarding.
The Belgian Government has introduced a traffic light system of high, medium and low risk regions. You should check the map on the Belgian Ministry of Foreign Affairs website (in English) for the latest information on affected regions. Check the map frequently, including both before and during your travel, as the zones are updated regularly.
Regular entry requirements
Visas
The rules for travelling or working in European countries changed on 1 January 2021:
you can travel to countries in the Schengen area for up to 90 days in any 180-day period without a visa. This applies if you travel as a tourist, to visit family or friends, to attend business meetings, cultural or sports events, or for short-term studies or training
if you are travelling to Belgium and other Schengen countries without a visa, make sure your whole visit is within the 90-day limit. Visits to Schengen countries within the previous 180 days before you travel count towards your 90 days
to stay longer, to work or study, for business or for other reasons, you will need to meet the Belgian government’s entry requirements. Check with the Belgian Embassy what type of visa and/or work permit, you may need
if you stay in Belgium with a visa or permit, this does not count towards your 90-day visa-free limit
Any time you spent in Belgium or other Schengen countries before 1 January 2021 does not count towards your 90-day visa-free limit.
At Belgian border control, you may need to use separate lanes from EU, EEA and Swiss citizens when queueing. Your passport may be stamped on entry and exit. You may also need to:
show a return or onward ticket
show you have enough money for your stay
Passport validity
Check your passport is valid for travel before you book your trip, and renew your passport if you do not have enough time left on it.
You must have at least 6 months left on an adult or child passport to travel to most countries in Europe (not including Ireland).
If you renewed your current passport before the previous one expired, extra months may have been added to its expiry date. Any extra months on your passport over 10 years may not count towards the 6 months needed.
UK Emergency Travel Documents
UK Emergency Travel Documents (ETDs) are accepted for entry, airside transit and exit from Belgium.
