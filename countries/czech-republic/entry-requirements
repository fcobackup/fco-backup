Restrictions in response to coronavirus
Restrictions on entry
You can enter the Czech Republic as long as you have either temporary or permanent residency. You will need to provide evidence of residency (ideally your residence card but there are other ways of demonstrating residency, see the Ministry of Interior’s website for further details).
You may also be able to enter the Czech Republic if you don’t have residency for certain purposes of travel, including business and study at university. Details outlining valid reasons for entry, along with information on the documents you will need to present and the restrictions you will need to follow are available on the website of the Czech Ministry of the Interior (See the first bullet point in section two ‘Conditions for entry to the territory of the Czech Republic and quarantine measures (from 11 May, 2020)’).
In addition to demonstrating residency or a valid reason for entry, you must follow one of three options to enter the Czech Republic:
Option 1: Present a negative coronavirus test result on arrival
To follow this option, you must present a negative coronavirus test result on arrival. The test must be no more than days old and the results should preferably be recorded on the Medical Certificate available on the Ministry of Interior’s website. You will still need to restrict your movement in the Czech Republic to essential journeys only for the first 14 days, but will not need to fully self-isolate.
Option 2: Present a negative test result within 72 hours of arrival
If you enter the Czech Republic without a negative test result, you can choose to take a test within 72 hours of arrival in order to avoid self-isolation requirements. You must register by phone with the public health authority “Hygiene station” (Hygienická stanice) of the region where you will be staying to arrange the test. You can find contacts for Hygiene Stations here.
You must self-isolate until you receive your test results. If they are negative, you may then leave the house but, as with option 1, you must restrict your movement within the Czech Republic to essential travel only. A list of testing sites is available here.
Option 3: Self-isolate for 14 days
You can also choose to enter the Czech Republic and not take a test for coronavirus. If you do not take a test, you must still register on arrival by phone with the public health authority “Hygiene station” (Hygienická stanice) of the region where you will be staying, and then self-isolate at a given address for 14 days. You can find contacts for Hygiene Stations here.
For all the above options, there are no restrictions on travelling to your place of residence from the airport or border. You are allowed to use public transport or a taxi. However, you must take responsibility for following social distancing rules.
You will need to show your residency card when boarding flights or an international coach or when crossing a land border into the Czech Republic. Family reunification is possible, but subject to restrictions. Up to date guidance, including the certificate template with which to present your test results at the border, can be found on the website of the Czech Ministry of Interior.
Transit through the Czech Republic from a third country
UK nationals can transit from a third country through the Czech Republic without Czech residency if they have a letter of confirmation from the British Embassy and can demonstrate their purpose is to travel straight back to the UK. Alongside an official letter from the Embassy, those intending to transit the Czech Republic must provide evidence of onward travel and meet the requirements set out below to cover their mouth and nose.
If you would like to transit through the Czech Republic from another country in order to return to the UK, contact the British Embassy in Prague on +420 257 40 2111 (choosing option 1 for English, then option 4 for consular assistance) at least 24 hours before making your journey, to request a letter of confirmation to allow you to transit the Czech Republic. You will need to provide:
full name, date of birth, and passport/ID number for each individual making the journey
intended route, including date, time (approximate) and location of entry to, and exit from, the Czech Republic
number plate of any vehicle to be used to cross the border
flight details for those seeking a flight connection, or intended route for those seeking to drive across the Czech Republic
You should also contact your travel provider to confirm your journey can go ahead.
Further information is available on Ministry of Interior’s website.
