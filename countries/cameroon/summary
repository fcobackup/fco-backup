Before you travel, check the ‘Entry requirements’ section for Cameroon’s current entry restrictions and requirements. Due to COVID-19, these may change with little warning. Monitor this advice for the latest updates and stay in contact with your travel provider.
If you plan to pass through another country on your journey, check the travel advice for the country you’re transiting.
There has been an outbreak of the Marburg haemorrhagic fever in Kie Ntem Province, northern Equatorial Guinea. Travel is restricted in and around this area. You should be extremely vigilant in and near Kie Ntem in Equatorial Guinea, and in the neighbouring areas of Ambam, Kye-Ossi and Olamze in southern Cameroon, and Ntem and Woleu in Gabon. Check with local authorities before travelling.
It is more important than ever to get travel insurance and check it provides appropriate cover. See the FCDO’s guidance on foreign travel insurance.
You should read this travel advice in full, noting the areas to which the FCDO advises against all or all but essential travel. You should pay close attention to our Safety and security advice if you plan to travel to Cameroon. For more information, visit TourCMR, a National Travel Guide App.
General strikes (or ‘ghost towns’) are called in the North West and South West (Anglophone) regions for each Monday, with additional days often called in particular periods including February (around Youth Day, 11 February), May (around National Day on 20 May) and October (around 1 October). Violence and travel disruption is regularly reported on these days.
Improvised Explosive Devices (IEDs) are increasingly being used by non-state armed groups and have previously been used to target civilians in the North West and South West regions. There have also been a number of reported civilian fatalities in these regions at or near checkpoints due to accidental discharge of weapons. If you decide to travel to, or within, areas of the North West and South West regions where the FCDO advises against all travel or all but essential travel, you should consider carefully the risks of travel, monitor developments closely, keep a low profile and minimise your movements.

Political developments and increased tensions related to the North West and South West (Anglophone) regions could lead to isolated incidents of violence in other parts of the country. This could affect western interests, as well as places frequented by foreigners. You should enhance your vigilance and plan your movements carefully. In November 2020, a threat was made against diplomatic missions in Yaoundé, including the British High Commission. You should remain vigilant when moving around the city.
On 2 July 2022, an IED was detonated at Mokolo market in Yaoundé. Four people were injured in the explosion. On 12 July 2022, another IED was detonated at the Mokolo Market in Yaoundé, injuring one person.
This follows small IEDs being detonated in populated areas of Yaoundé and Douala between June 2020 and February 2021. It is possible that more attacks will occur in urban areas, or other locations around the country, in the future. You should remain vigilant and keep up to date with developments via the media and local authorities. See Political situation
Terrorists are very likely to try to carry out attacks in Cameroon, particularly in the Far North region. Attacks could be indiscriminate, including in places visited by foreigners such as restaurants, bars, markets, hotels, shopping centres and places of worship. The terrorist groups Boko Haram and Islamic State West Africa (ISWA) are active in the Far North region but attacks could occur anywhere, potentially including major towns and cities such as Yaoundé and Douala. There have been numerous suicide attacks since 2015, which have resulted in over 200 dead in the Far North region, although since 2017 these have been predominately adjacent to the border with Nigeria. Key targets have been large open markets, hotels, parks and sporting venues. There have also been hostages taken and heavy gunfights reported in Babouang and Mbarang in Adamawa region (Cameroon). See Terrorism
There is a heightened threat of kidnap to western nationals in the north of Cameroon, including in the major cities and along the border between the Far North region and Nigeria. Boko Haram has publicly threatened Cameroon with attacks and further kidnappings due to Cameroon’s involvement in the regional fight to counter Boko Haram.
There have been reports of criminality including large armed gangs and highway bandits, stopping travellers, taking hostages and demanding payment, particularly in the east of Cameroon, close to the Central African Republic (CAR) border. There are frequent instances of violence in CAR spilling across the border to Cameroon, there is now an even greater likelihood of this occurring given the ongoing insecurity in that country. See Crime
Nigerian military operations in the states of Borno, Yobe and Adamawa in Nigeria could have an impact across the border in Cameroon.
Avoid travelling at night across Cameroon unless absolutely necessary, due to risks from criminality, poor infrastructure and erratic driving.
There are increased reports of piracy in the Gulf of Guinea. Take great care when travelling in coastal waters, including the coastline of Cameroon and the Doula port.
Despite the high crime levels, most visits to Cameroon are trouble-free. Only a few British nationals needed consular assistance in the past year.
If you’re abroad and you need emergency help from the UK government, contact the nearest British embassy, consulate or high commission. Consular support is severely limited in parts of Cameroon (particularly East, Far North, North-West and South-West).
