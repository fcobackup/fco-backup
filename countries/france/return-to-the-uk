If you live in the UK and are currently travelling abroad, you are strongly advised to return to the UK now.
The availability of transport from France to the UK is subject to change. Many airlines and cross-Channel operators are operating very substantially reduced services for passenger traffic. Passengers should check with their operator before departing, and may still be subject to severe disruption.
Flights departing from French airports may be cancelled or rescheduled. You should check with your airline for the latest information.
The availability of transport may reduce further. Travellers should contact their travel operator, checking the website of their airlines or ferry companies for further advice.
