This page has information on travelling to Ghana. Check what you must do to return to the UK.
This page reflects the UK government’s understanding of current rules for people travelling on a full ‘British Citizen’ passport from the UK, for the most common types of travel.
The authorities in Ghana set and enforce entry rules.
All travellers
You need a visa to enter Ghana. See Visas section for more information.
You must complete an online health declaration form, not more than three days before travelling. You will also need to complete a separate health declaration form for children aged 5 to 12. Vaccinated travellers do not need to pay for an on arrival COVID test as part of this health declaration process. The travel certificate you generate will be checked prior to departure and on arrival.
When arriving to Ghana all travellers:
may be requested to wear a face-mask at all times at the airport
undergo a temperature check
If you’re fully vaccinated
All travellers aged 18 years and over are required to provide evidence of being fully vaccinated against COVID-19 at the point of embarkation and upon arrival into Ghana. The Ghana Health Service defines a fully vaccinated person as someone who has taken the full dose of vaccines approved and registered by the Food and Drugs Authority of Ghana. This is one dose of Johnson and Johnson, or two doses of AstraZeneca (Covishield), Pfizer-BioNTech, Moderna or Sputnik V.
You will need to present your vaccination certificate before boarding and on arrival. Expect this certificate to be checked multiple times before leaving the airport, including on leaving the plane, at the health counter, at immigration, and on leaving the airport. You may choose to carry a hard copy of your certificate with you if you are unsure you will have access to the electronic version during your journey.
There is no pre travel or on arrival testing requirement if you are fully vaccinated.
If you’re not fully vaccinated
Non-resident
Non-resident unvaccinated travellers will not be granted entry into Ghana. Ground staff at your departure airport will not allow you to travel.
Resident
You will need to take the following steps in addition to completion of the online health declaration form, set out in more detail below: take a pre travel PCR test; load that onto the Trusted Travel Scheme website and generate a Travel Code; pay for an on arrival test; and be subject to vaccination on arrival. Carrying paper copies of everything will make your journey through the airport more straightforward.
You will be required to present a negative PCR test that was taken not more than 48 hours before the start of your journey, both to the airline before embarkation, and upon arrival.
The test on arrival is an antigen fluorescent immunoassay test. It is conducted before baggage is collected at a cost of $150 per passenger. (ECOWAS citizens pay $50). Payment should be made online, before travel, as part of the pre travel health declaration form process. Airport staff expect to see the proof of payment as well as your travel certificate before allowing you to check-in. Test results are normally ready within one hour. You can check your results online while you wait.
All partially vaccinated our unvaccinated travellers will undergo COVID-19 vaccination at the airport on arrival. The full list of approved vaccines is set out here. Either Moderna or Pfizer will be offered to pregnant women.
Ghana is part of the Trusted Travel Scheme. As soon as you have your negative test result, before travel, you also need to complete the following steps;
Create an online account with the same email address and mobile telephone number you give your PCR test provider. Log on and select check-in; select UK and Ghana as your departure and destination countries; select lab tests (TT); select the matching lab test from the drop down options; click save; provide your flight and passport details as requested; click save to generate a Travel Code (TC); your TC code is then generated for you to copy or download
If your provider is unable to upload your test certificate on your behalf you should enter your TT or BIOMARS code from your PCR certificate, or upload the certificate yourself. You can do that by selecting at any other lab instead of lab tests (TT)
Your PanaBios account details will also allow you to log on to the UNDP endorsed Global Haven site to validate your PCR test for travel in the same way.
Quarantine requirements for those testing positive on arrival
All arriving passengers should be prepared to comply with Ghana’s COVID-19 Health Protocols.
Those that test positive for COVID-19 on arrival will be assessed by the Port Health Unit for either quarantine in a Government Health facility or isolation centre. This will be at a cost to passengers. Quarantine and/or medical costs can be expensive so it is important that all passengers arrive with adequate access to financial resources. The isolation will be for a period of 7 days. Passports of those who test positive are likely to be retained by Ghana Immigration Services for the duration of isolation. The quarantine process is managed by Ghana Health Service.
The Government of Ghana also advise that all arrivals should have valid insurance. It is more important than ever to get travel insurance and check it provides sufficient cover. See the FCDO’s guidance on foreign travel insurance.
Exemptions
Children under 18 will not be tested at the airport upon arrival. Children between 10 and17 who are unvaccinated must submit a negative PCR test prior to embarkation as set out above. Children under 10 are exempt from pre-departure COVID-19 PCR testing and COVID-19 testing at the airport upon arrival. Passengers who arrive under emergency circumstances such as diverted flights will not be required to undergo testing if they do not leave the airport or remain in isolation at a hotel.
If you’re transiting through Ghana
Transit passengers, except where they will remain in the airport throughout or those who were diverted to Accra for an emergency, will also be subject to mandatory COVID-19 protocols as outlined above.
Check your passport and travel documents before you travel
Check with your travel provider to make sure your passport and other travel documents meet their requirements.
Passport validity
Your passport should be valid for a minimum period of 6 months from the date of entry into Ghana.
Visas
You need a visa to enter Ghana. Ghana’s UK visa service is operating. Visit the Ghana High Commission website to stay up to date and to make an online application.
If you are in Ghana and need to extend your visa, you will need to visit the Ghana Immigration Service (GIS) office in person. It isn’t possible to call about an individual case or to book an appointment in advance. Office opening hours are 8 am to 5 pm. The GIS office is off Ako Adjei overpass on Independence Avenue in Accra.
Dual nationality
Ghana recognises dual nationality. To avoid visa fees, Ghanaian-British dual nationals should register with the Interior Ministry in Ghana and get a Dual Nationality card. Production of this card at point of entry into Ghana will indicate that a visa is not required.
UK Emergency Travel Documents
UK Emergency Travel Documents (ETDs) are not valid for entry or transit through Ghana. However, ETDs are accepted for exit from Ghana. To leave Ghana on an ETD, you will need to visit the Ghana Immigration Service (GIS) to complete the exit formalities. GIS is located on John Kasavubu Road, Independence Avenue, Accra; Tel: +233 302 224445/221667 or visit the GIS website.
Yellow fever certificate requirements
You will be expected to present a yellow fever certificate on arrival in and departure from Ghana.
Volunteering
If you are travelling to work in a volunteer programme or for work experience you should be fully aware of the terms and conditions of your stay and be sure that you will be working for a reputable organisation before you commit yourself to travel. You should read further information on how to stay safe and healthy overseas when volunteering.
Residents
If you live in Ghana you should register with the National Identification Authority (NIA) of Ghana and get a non-citizen Ghana card. This applies to:
foreign nationals permanently resident in the country
foreign nationals resident in the country for at least 90 days in any calendar year
foreign nationals aged 6 years and above
A non-citizen Ghana card is required to apply for a residence permit, for admission into educational institutions in Ghana, for all financial transactions including opening a bank account, payment of taxes, registration of sim cards, and applications for public or government services, facilities, approvals and permissions. You can complete this registration process at any one of the following places:
