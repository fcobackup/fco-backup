The Foreign and Commonwealth Office (FCO) advise against all travel to Libya, and for British nationals still in Libya to leave immediately by commercial means. This advice has been in place consistently since 2014. Local security situations are fragile and can quickly deteriorate into intense fighting and clashes without warning.
Terrorists are very likely to try to carry out attacks in Libya. At least 13 people were killed and many injured following a terrorist attack on the High National Election Commission in Tripoli on 2 May 2018. On 10 September 2018, a terrorist attack on the National Oil Corporation in central Tripoli killed 2 people and wounded many more.
There remains a high threat throughout the country of terrorist attacks and kidnap against foreigners, including from Daesh-affiliated extremists (formerly referred to as ISIL) and Al Qaida, as well as armed militias. Daesh and Al Qaeda have attacked a number of oil and gas installations and killed or kidnapped workers, including foreign nationals. See Safety and security and Terrorism
Fighting has caused the temporary suspension or closure of airports, closed roads and led to the closure of some border crossings. All airports are vulnerable to attack. Tripoli International Airport has been closed since 13 July 2014. On 15 January 2018, there were at least 20 fatalities and 60 wounded after clashes around Mitiga airport in Tripoli, temporarily closing the airport. Heavy clashes between militia groups have been ongoing in southern Tripoli since 27 August 2018. At least 115 people are reported dead with many more wounded. There is a risk of further escalation and fighting spreading to other parts of the city. Mitiga airport was closed as a precaution on 31 August 2018. While it reopened briefly on 7 September, it closed again overnight on 11 September after rockets were fired at the airport. Flights are currently being diverted to Misrata.
If you choose to travel to Libya against FCO advice, you should consider your security arrangements carefully and take all necessary security precautions, including contingency plans. You should also take out comprehensive travel and medical insurance before you travel. If you’re entering Libya as a media representative, you should get press accreditation from the relevant Libyan authorities.
You must get permission before taking any photographs or interviewing at or near military facilities. If you choose to travel to Libya against FCO advice, you should get the right visa, or risk deportation. See Entry requirements
