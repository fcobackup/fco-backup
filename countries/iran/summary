The Foreign, Commonwealth & Development Office (FCDO) advises British nationals against all travel to Iran.
British and British-Iranian dual nationals are at significant risk of arbitrary arrest, questioning or detention in Iran. Holding a British passport can be reason enough for the Iranian authorities to target you. If you are detained in Iran, you could face months or years in prison.
Our ability to provide consular assistance is extremely limited. In an emergency – such as serious deterioration in the security situation – it is extremely unlikely the British government will be able to evacuate you or provide assistance on the ground in Iran. If you are a British national already resident in Iran, you should carefully consider your presence there and the risks you are taking by remaining.
A number of British-Iranian dual nationals have been arbitrarily detained in Iran and made to serve long prison sentences. In January 2023 a British national was executed after receiving the death penalty. Iran has also recently arrested and detained non-Iranian European nationals travelling on tourist visas. The criminal justice process followed in such cases falls below international standards. If you are detained in Iran your case will be in the hands of the Iranian authorities, who have shown a pattern of hostility towards the UK and its citizens. Our consular assistance to British nationals in Iran is therefore extremely limited.
The Iranian authorities do not recognise dual nationality. If you are a British-Iranian dual national and are detained in Iran, the FCDO will not be informed of your detention by the authorities and will not be granted access to see you.
For British nationals without Iranian dual-nationality, the FCDO may not be informed for some time of your detention and may be denied consular welfare visits for long periods of time. See Safety and Security.
The Iranian authorities have accused people with links to the UK of inciting protests. If you are in or near a protest, you are at serious risk of arrest. Mass arrests, including of bystanders, is a frequent occurrence. Anyone who is arrested in connection with protests and holds British nationality may come under added suspicion of espionage or working to undermine the Iranian government, increasing the risk of lengthy detention, criminal charges and/or receiving the death penalty. It is difficult to predict where protests will take place. The Iranian authorities can restrict internet access and in some cases there are internet shutdowns. Mobile data, non-Iranian mobile apps and international calls may not work and should not be relied on for personal safety.
See ‘Political situation’ on the ‘Safety and security’ page for more information.
Terrorists are likely to try to carry out attacks in Iran. Attacks could happen anywhere, including in places visited by foreigners.
If you need consular assistance you should contact the British Embassy on telephone: +98 (0)21 6405 2000 . See Consular assistance services.
