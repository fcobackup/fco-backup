The information on this page covers the most common types of travel and reflects the UK government’s understanding of the rules currently in place. Unless otherwise stated, this information is for travellers using a full ‘British Citizen’ passport.
The authorities in the country or territory you’re travelling to are responsible for setting and enforcing the rules for entry. If you’re unclear about any aspect of the entry requirements, or you need further reassurance, you’ll need to contact the Embassy, High Commission or Consulate of the country or territory you’re travelling to.
You should also consider checking with your transport provider or travel company to make sure your passport and other travel documents meet their requirements. Furthermore, you should consider clarifying whether there are any testing requirements or measures put in place by your airline or countries you are transiting that may affect your travel.
Entry rules in response to coronavirus (COVID-19)
International flights have resumed to and from Tocumen International Airport.
An electronic affidavit of good health for all travellers entering the country needs to be filled in upon arrival. The affidavit form will be available at the website: https://www.panamadigital.gob.pa/RegistroPacoViajero. The completed affidavit will generate a QR code, which will needs to be scanned on arrival at Tocumen Airport.
Panama encourages the use of the IATA Travel Pass app. This app will have up-to-date information on travel restrictions, authorised labs for COVID-19 tests and vaccine information. It will have the option to enter personal data, such as vaccination information and tests undertaken. The government will accept the “OK to Travel” certification from this app as a validation for COVID-19 tests on travellers.
Entry restrictions on people who have been in the UK, South Africa, India or South America within 15 days of their arrival into Panama
From 3 May, travellers who have spent the last 15 days in the UK, South Africa, India or South America, or have transited through the UK, South Africa, India or South America, must provide a negative PCR or antigen test taken no more than 48 hours before their arrival in Panama. Upon arrival in Panama, travellers must take another test prior to registering with the immigration authorities. Travellers will have to cover the cost of this additional test themselves.
If the additional test is negative, travellers must still quarantine in their homes, or at a government approved observation facility, for three days. After the third day, travellers will be tested again. If the results of the day three test are negative, the quarantine measures can end. If the result of the additional test is positive, travellers need a PCR-RT by +ICGES test and must quarantine for 14 days at a government facility.
From 3 May, travellers can comply with the above-mentioned three-day quarantine at a pre-approved hotel facility at their own expense. The official list can be found at: https://www.visitpanama.com/.
