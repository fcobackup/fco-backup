The FCDO advises against all but essential travel to:
the whole of Cyprus based on the current assessment of COVID-19 risks.
Travel is subject to entry restrictions
The Republic of Cyprus (ROC) has adopted the evaluation system by the European Centre for Disease Prevention and Control (ECDC) separating countries into Green, Orange and Red categories
The UK entered the Amber category on 29 April. Visitors from ‘Amber’ category countries are required to undergo a PCR test within 72 hours prior to departure and provide proof of a negative result.
Legal residents of Cyprus, Cypriot ID holders and their family members can enter Cyprus without a PCR test result, but will be tested on arrival. They must then enter mandatory self-isolation for 72 hours from the time of arrival. At the end of this period they must undergo a further PCR test. If a negative result is produced isolation can be terminated
See Entry requirements for more information before you plan to travel.
Preparing for your return journey to the UK
If you’re returning to the UK from overseas, you will need to:
provide your journey and contact details before you travel
check if you need to self-isolate on your return
If your return journey to the UK transits another country, you should check whether it is subject to a travel ban or any other additional requirements. If so, contact your travel provider.

There have been reports of an increase in holidaymakers being encouraged to submit a claim for personal injury if they have experienced gastric illness during their stay. You can find more information about the action you can take if you have suffered a personal injury on the Citizens Advice website. You should only consider pursuing a complaint or claim if you have genuinely suffered from injury or illness; if you make a false or fraudulent claim, you may face legal proceedings in the UK or Cyprus.
If you need to contact the emergency services call 112.
If you’re abroad and you need emergency help from the UK government, contact the nearest British embassy, consulate or high commission.
