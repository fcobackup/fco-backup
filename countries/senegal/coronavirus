Cases of coronavirus (COVID-19) have been confirmed in Senegal. The Senegalese authorities have introduced a number of measures to limit the spread of the virus.
Entry and borders
A ban on all commercial air transport is in place until 31 May, with the exception of flights with ‘special authorisation’. You should check with your airline before travelling. Senegal’s borders with neighbouring countries are closed, except for goods vehicles in the case of Mali and Guinea.
The British Embassy Dakar is issuing regular updates on Twitter and Facebook with the latest available information on flight departure options for British nationals wishing to leave Senegal.

On 23 March a national state of emergency was extended for a further 30 days. A curfew is in place between 8 pm and 6 am.
Other measures include:
a ban on gatherings and demonstrations on public highways;.
prohibiting the movement of people, vehicles and goods in given locations or times.
banning public or private meeting spaces as well as all public or private gatherings that could lead to civil disturbance.
the compulsory use of face masks in government buildings, private sector workplaces, shops and markets as well as all forms of transport.
Travel between regions is prohibited without authorisation. If you are travelling between Senegal’s regions you will need to get authorisation from the Governor or Préfet.
Thirteen hotels in Dakar have been requisitioned as part of the emergency response to COVID-19. These are: Virage, Arc-En-Ciel, Étoile du Lac, Chez Salon, Pullman-Teranga, Ngor Diarama, Ibis-Novotel, Lagon, Savana, Ndiambour, Terrou-Bi, Calao and Fleur de Lys.
You should comply with any additional screening measures put in place by the authorities. Keep up to date with information from your tour operator, transport or accommodation provider on the impact on any existing travel plans.
Travelling to the airport
If you’re travelling to the airport, you should plan to arrive in time to respect the curfew and for your driver to also be able to return in time.
The British embassy understands that you should be able to travel to the airport for a flight that has ‘special authorisation’ but you should expect to show your travel documents (passport and plane ticket) to any officials that may stop you during your journey. You should ensure that your driver has photocopies of these documents to justify travel during their return journey.
Road travel
There are limits on the number of passengers per vehicle (for example, three - including driver- for a five seater car).
Further information
If you need further information about entry requirements, contact the local immigration authorities or the nearest Senegalese embassy. You should also check with your airline or travel company for the latest information.
Further information on coronavirus, including advice on preparing for foreign travel and helping reduce the spread of the virus, is available from Public Health England and on the TravelHealthPro website.
