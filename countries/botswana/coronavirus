Travel in Botswana
There is a nationwide curfew in place - with no movement of people, except those with a movement permit (for essential services), from 10pm to 4am.
Botswana is divided into nine COVID-19 zones. You will need to apply for an interzonal travel permit to travel between zones.
The Government of Botswana has restricted the movement of people over the Easter holidays, with issued interzonal travel permits invalidated. To travel between zones to return to your place of residence over the Easter holidays you will need to apply for a new one-off interzonal travel permit, valid for 24 hours from the date of issue.
Travel within one of the nine COVID-19 zones, outside of the curfew times, does not require any special permissions.
You should comply with these requirements wherever you are staying in Botswana, and continue to follow the advice of the government and local authorities.
Air Botswana has resumed domestic flights.
The government may impose further localised lockdowns. You should monitor Government of Botswana’s Facebook page for updates on this.
