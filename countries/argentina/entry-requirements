This page reflects the UK government’s understanding of current rules for people travelling on a full ‘British Citizen’ passport, for the most common types of travel.
The authorities in Argentina set and enforce entry rules. For further information contact the embassy, high commission or consulate of the country or territory you’re travelling to. You should also consider checking with your transport provider or travel company to make sure your passport and other travel documents meet their requirements.

Regular entry requirements
Visas
You don’t need a visa to enter Argentina as a tourist unless you’re travelling on an Emergency Travel Document. On presentation of a valid British passport you will normally be given an entry stamp permitting you to stay in the country for a period of up to 90 days.
If you wish to extend your stay for another 90-day period, seek advice from the Argentine Migrations Office.
If you’re travelling to Argentina for any purpose other than tourism, contact the Embassy of the Argentine Republic in London.
Passport validity
Your passport should be valid for the proposed duration of your stay. No additional period of validity beyond this is required.
Proof of onward travel
You may need to provide proof of onward or return travel. You should make all flight reservations before departing for Argentina. Airlines have sometimes refused to board passengers travelling to Argentina without proof of onward travel.
UK Emergency Travel Documents
UK Emergency Travel Documents (ETDs) are accepted for entry, airside transit and exit from Argentina. However, holders of an ETD must apply for the appropriate Argentine visa to enter the country.
For entry into Argentina, your ETD should be valid for the proposed duration of your stay. No additional period of validity beyond this is required.
