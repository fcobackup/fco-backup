The FCO strongly advises non-resident British nationals in Chile to consider leaving the country, to avoid difficulties while commercial flights remain available.
The team at the British Embassy in Santiago is in contact with the Chilean Government at a senior level, with local authorities, travel companies and cruise operators.
We are aware of reports that LATAM is cancelling some domestic flights. LATAM has assured us that they are currently running as “normal”. You should be aware that airport/flight tracking websites are often not updated in real time and so might not contain the most up-to-date information.
As of 21 March, British Airways has assured us that the Santiago-London flight will continue as normal for the coming days and some flights may have last minute availability.
If you plan to fly back to the UK please ensure you have not overstayed on your visa – this could affect your departure.
Although their switchboards and websites will be very busy we still encourage British nationals to contact their travel agents and airlines to confirm travel information.
Further information
The British Embassy Santiago is urgently working to get updated information from airlines regarding flights that will be leaving Chile to the UK, which will be communicated through Embassy Twitter and Facebook channels.
