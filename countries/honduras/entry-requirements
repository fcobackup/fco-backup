This page reflects the UK government’s understanding of current rules for people travelling on a full ‘British Citizen’ passport, for the most common types of travel.
The authorities in Honduras set and enforce entry rules. For further information contact the embassy, high commission or consulate of the country or territory you’re travelling to. You should also consider checking with your transport provider or travel company to make sure your passport and other travel documents meet their requirements.
Entry rules in response to coronavirus (COVID-19)
To be eligible for entry to Honduras you must present upon arrival:
a negative COVID-19 PCR or antigen test, dated no more than 72 hours before the date of your arrival at Honduras; or
evidence that you have received a COVID-19 vaccine (vaccination card) indicating you have received two doses (or one dose if vaccinated with a one dose vaccine). The last dose must have been administered more than 14 days prior to the date of travel.
All travellers entering or exiting Honduras must complete the immigration pre-check form at https://prechequeo.inm.gob.hn. You will receive a confirmation email, which you should print and carry with you.
You must follow the social distancing rules and wear a mask at all times in all public places, including the airport.
Local authorities will apply health protocols if a traveller presents symptoms of any infectious disease, including COVID-19. You may be asked to undertake a medical evaluation.
All travellers need to comply with the exit requirements from Honduras as well as the entry requirements of their country of destination.
You should not use the NHS testing service to get a test in order to facilitate your travel to another country. You should arrange to take a private test.
Keep up to date with information from your tour operator, transport or accommodation provider on the impact on any existing travel plans. If you need further information about entry requirements, contact the Honduran immigration authorities or the nearest Honduran Embassy/Consulate. You should also check with your airline or travel company for the latest information.
Demonstrating your COVID-19 status
Honduras will accept the UK’s proof of COVID-19 recovery and vaccination record. Your NHS appointment card from vaccination centres is not designed to be used as proof of vaccination and should not be used to demonstrate your vaccine status.
Testing/screening on arrival
You should comply with any additional screening or testing measures put in place by the authorities.
Quarantine requirements
Obligatory quarantine rules may be applied. You should visit the website of the Health Authority and official COVID-19 page for more information.
Data collection
Upon arrival in Honduras, you will be asked to complete an immigration form where you will be required to provide the address where you will be staying. Local authorities will provide further instructions on any other details you should provide upon arrival.
Testing on departure
There is currently no testing upon departure in Honduras. They will take your temperature upon arrival at the airport.
Regular entry requirements
Visas
British nationals do not need a visa to visit Honduras. You can get a 30 day visit entry stamp on arrival. You must ensure that you get your passport stamped on arrival to avoid complications on departure. If you wish to extend this you can do so up to a maximum of 90 days by applying at an Immigration Office.
If you overstay you should expect to pay a fine at the Immigration Office when you apply to extend your stay or before departure. For information on which office to go to and how to follow this process contact the National Institute of Migration.
For more information on entry requirements for other purposes, like voluntary work, contact the Honduran Embassy in London at hondurasembassyuk@gmail.com.
Children travelling with only one parent or without both parents or legal guardians must present a notarised letter of consent from the non-travelling parent(s) or legal guardian(s) to enter and exit Honduras. Contact the nearest Embassy or Consulate of Honduras, or if you’re in Honduras the nearest National Institute of Migration, for information about the process and language requirements for consent documents.
Passport validity
Your passport should be valid for a minimum period of 6 months from the date of entry into Honduras.
Central America Border Control Agreement
Honduras is party to the Central America Border Control Agreement (CA-4). Under the terms of this agreement, British tourists can travel within any of the CA-4 countries (El Salvador, Guatemala, Honduras, Nicaragua) for a period of up to 90 days which starts at the first point of entry of any of the CA-4 countries. They will be subject to immigration checks at the border (which does not interrupt or restart the 90 day count). Fines are applied for travellers who exceed this 90-day limit, although a request for an extension can be made for up to 30 days by paying a fee before the 90 day limit expires. If you are expelled from any of the four countries you are also excluded from the entire CA-4 region.
If you are planning on travelling to Nicaragua, prior to your trip you should check information on entry requirements with your travel company, the Nicaraguan Immigration authorities or by contacting your nearest Nicaraguan embassy. You should also check our travel advice for Nicaragua.
Land borders
If you arrive or depart at a land border, the immigration authorities may charge you a fee of US$3 at the border crossing. Keep the receipt until you leave the country and make sure your passport is stamped.
You may experience some disruptions at the land border crossings between Honduras and Guatemala, due to the passage of migrant caravans.
Yellow fever certificate requirements
Check whether you need a yellow fever certificate by visiting the National Travel Health Network and Centre’s TravelHealthPro website.
Departure tax
There is a US$48.44 (or Lempira equivalent) airport departure tax which should be included in the price of the ticket (if not, be prepared to pay this in cash or with a credit card). There is also an airport departure tax for domestic flights of 54.13 Lempiras (or the equivalent in US dollars).
UK Emergency Travel Documents
UK Emergency Travel Documents (ETDs) are valid for entry to and exit from Honduras. ETDs must also have a minimum period of six months validity from the date you enter Honduras.
If you are travelling via the United States of America on an ETD, you will need to get a US visa. For more information, please contact the US Embassy in Guatemala.
