Entering Egypt from Gaza
If you are a British national in Gaza, wanting to enter Egypt, check the status of the Rafah crossing between Egypt and Israel and the Occupied Palestinian Territories (OPTs) before you travel. Movement to the Rafah crossing and beyond is at your own risk. You should only travel if you judge it is safe to do so.
Read travel advice for Israel and The Occupied Palestinian Territories if you’re crossing the border.
The Egyptian authorities have said all aid going into Gaza from Egypt must be channelled through the Egyptian Red Crescent:
telephone: + 20 226 703 979, + 20 226 703 983
fax: + 20 226 703 967
They are unlikely to consider requests for humanitarian access made in Egypt at short notice.

If you are concerned about friends or family, or need consular assistance call:
