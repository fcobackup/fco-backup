Consular support is severely limited in parts of Eritrea. Constraints on travel within Eritrea means the British Embassy in Asmara is unable to offer consular assistance to British nationals outside the greater Asmara area. The British Embassy is unable to offer consular assistance to dual nationals in Eritrea. See Dual nationals.
Although there’s no recent history of terrorism in Eritrea, attacks can’t be ruled out. See Terrorism
There may be some shortages of drinking in more remote areas of Eritrea due to the closure by the Eritrean Government of many of the water purification and bottling plants, but imported water from Ethiopia and Sudan is available.
If you’re abroad and you need emergency help from the UK government, contact the nearest British embassy, consulate or high commission.
