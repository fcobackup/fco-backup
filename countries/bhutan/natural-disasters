Monsoons
Monsoon rains cause landslides that can cut off some roads for days. Check access routes before setting off and take extra care.
Earthquakes
Several parts of Bhutan lie on highly active fault zones. Limited emergency response vehicles, equipment, and medical facilities could increase the impact that an earthquake could have in these areas. The US Federal Emergency Management Agency has advice about what to do before, during and after an earthquake.
