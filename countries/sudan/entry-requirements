Warning
FCDO advises against all travel to parts of Sudan.

This information is for people travelling on a full ‘British citizen’ passport from the UK who choose to travel against FCDO advice. It is based on the UK government’s understanding of Sudan’s current rules for the most common types of travel.  
The authorities in Sudan set and enforce entry rules. If you’re not sure how these requirements apply to you, contact the Sudanese Embassy in the UK.  
COVID-19 rules 
There are no COVID-19 testing or vaccination requirements for travellers entering Sudan. 
Passport validity requirements 
To enter Sudan, your passport must have an ‘expiry date’ at least 6 months after the date you arrive.  
Check with your travel provider that your passport and other travel documents meet requirements. Renew your passport if you need to.  
You will be denied entry if you do not have a valid travel document or try to use a passport that has been reported lost or stolen. 
Visa requirements 
You must have a visa to enter Sudan.  
Applying for a visa 
You can apply for a visa through the Sudanese Embassy in the UK, or through the Sudanese embassy in the country you’re travelling from.  
Exit visas
If you enter Sudan on a single-entry visa, you’ll need an exit visa to leave the country, though this is not always enforced. You can get more information on exit visas from Port Sudan Airport Immigration. You may need to show proof of your sponsor and pay the exit visa fee.  
Travel permits
You will not be allowed to leave the Red Sea State without a travel permit. You need to apply for that once in country and pay a fee. The requirements for each state are different. You will have to pay different amounts and go through different processes depending on your destination.  
Previous travel to Israel 
If your passport has an Israeli visa, entry or exit stamp, you will not be allowed to enter Sudan. 
Vaccine requirements  
To enter Sudan, you must have a certificate to prove you’ve had a yellow fever vaccination. 
For full details about medical entry requirements and recommended vaccinations, see TravelHealthPro’s Sudan guide. 
Registering with the authorities 
You must register with the Aliens Department at the Ministry of Interior within 3 days of your arrival in Sudan. You will need 2 passport size photos and to pay a fee.  
If you do not register within 3 days of arrival, you may be fined. Some larger hotels will do this for you. Ask when you check-in. 
Children and young people 
As well as a visa, children aged 17 and under must have their father’s consent to enter and exit Sudan. Children travelling without their father need a letter giving consent for them to enter and exit Sudan, though this is not always enforced.  
You must get the letter stamped at the Sudanese Embassy in the UK before travel. 
If the father is absent, mothers or guardians must get a court order which shows they have sole custodial rights for the children.  
If the parents are divorced, you’ll need to show divorce documents. 
If the father has died, you’ll need to show the death certificate.  
Contact the Sudanese Embassy in the UK for more information. 
Customs rules 
There are strict rules about goods you can take into or out of Sudan. You must declare anything that may be prohibited or subject to tax or duty.
