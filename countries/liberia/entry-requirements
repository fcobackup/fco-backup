For exemptions, see Exemptions to testing on arrival below. Exempt travellers who do not provide a valid negative PCR test result will also be tested.

You must present proof of payment for your test before your sample is collected. Travellers arriving from ECOWAS countries must pay US$50. Travellers from countries outside the ECOWAS region must pay US$75. There are two payment options available.

Any travellers testing positive will be transported by health authorities to the government COVID-19 Treatment Unit, at Star Base. See Quarantine requirements for more information on the Star Base Treatment Unit and conditions for release from Star Base
Government of Liberia strongly recommends that all travellers self-isolate for 7 days and self-monitor symptoms via the Lib Travel app for 14 days, beginning the day after arrival in Liberia
For information on testing for travellers departing Liberia, see International Travel.
Exemptions to testing on arrival:
Children under the age of 5 years old are exempt from COVID-19 testing and do not require a test result certificate. However, you should check your airline’s requirements.
Cabin crew, captains, flight engineers and first officers with layovers less than 48 hours are exempt from testing if they complete pre-boarding testing as per their airline’s policy and comply with screening procedures while in Liberia. They must complete screening on arrival and proceed to their designated flight crew hotel. If layover is more than 48 hours, cabin crew, captains, flight engineers and first officers must undergo PCR testing before leaving Liberia (see Coronavirus testing for departing travellers)
Diplomats and their families, honorary consuls, duly accredited international organisations’ staff and Liberian diplomats must present a negative PCR COVID-19 test result certificate from an accredited lab within 96 hours before arrival in Liberia (i.e. your test sample must have been collected a maximum of 4 days before arrival in Liberia). Alternatively, voluntary testing at the airport is available free of charge. If you do not present a valid negative PCR COVID-19 test result certificate, NPHIL staff will seek to test you on arrival.
You should not use the NHS testing service to get a test in order to facilitate your travel to another country. You should arrange to take a private test.
You should be prepared for travel restrictions, and changes to screening and quarantine requirements with no advance notice.
Quarantine requirements
There is no quarantine requirement for travellers who test negative on arrival, however Government of Liberia strongly recommends that all travellers self-isolate for 7 days and self-monitor symptoms via the Lib Travel app for 14 days, beginning the day after arrival in Liberia.
Any travellers receiving a positive rapid test result on arrival at Roberts International Airport will be transported by health authorities to the government COVID-19 Treatment Unit, at Star Base. Travellers who have mild to moderate symptoms (or are asymptomatic) up to 7 days after arrival at Star Base will be clinically assessed and will be given a PCR test. Depending on clinical assessment they may be discharged to home-based care between 8-14 days after admission. Critical and severe cases will remain at Star Base. PCR test results usually take several days and at busy periods have taken two weeks due to laboratory backlogs. Liberian quarantine and COVID-19 treatment facilities are basic, and not guaranteed to meet Public Health England standards.
There is a risk for British nationals of being put into a government quarantine or medical facility, either on arrival or during your trip to Liberia. Liberian “Precautionary Observation Centers” (POCs) and treatment units are basic, and not guaranteed to meet Public Health England standards.
You are at risk of being put into quarantine or instructed to self-isolate even after completing your post-arrival self-isolation, if you develop symptoms (fever, cough or respiratory illness), or it is suspected you have been in contact with some who has tested positive for coronavirus. If you test positive for COVID-19, you may be transferred to a government quarantine facility or treatment centre. You are strongly advised to familiarise yourself with these risks before travelling.
If you are travelling on behalf of government, an international organisation/NGO or a company, you should check with your organisation whether they have pre-arranged a private POC, i.e. quarantine facility, authorised by NHPIL. The British Embassy cannot provide POC facilities. If you show symptoms, you may be transferred to a government POC or treatment centre.
Visitors arriving on a laissez-passer (except UN or EU), may also be taken to quarantine for secondary screening. Any suspicion of illegal attempts to circumvent the process will result in removal to quarantine.

If you are unable to leave Liberia and your visa is due to expire, you must apply for an extension. The maximum extension period is 60 days. It is only possible to extend your visa once.
