There remain limited commercial options to return to the UK from Zimbabwe. Commercial airlines have reduced or suspended flights in to and out of Zimbabwe.
If you live in the UK and are currently visiting Zimbabwe, you’re strongly advised to return now by commercial means. Don’t run the risk of getting stranded.
UK special charter flights will only operate for priority countries where commercial flights are not possible. You should not assume that these flights will become available in countries where commercial routes are operating. Please do not contact the contracted travel management company if no flight is advertised here.
Flight options
As of 4 April, Ethiopian Airlines have resumed flights from Harare to London, via Addis Ababa. You should check FCO travel advice for Ethiopia when planning a journey.
This travel advice will be updated with information on any further departure options that become available. Sign up for email alerts and follow the British Embassy Harare on Twitter and Facebook.
You will need to pay for your return travel to the UK. If departure options are available but you cannot afford the travel costs and have exhausted all other options for getting funds, you may be eligible to apply for an emergency loan from the government. This is a last resort option and you would need to repay the loan when you are back in the UK. For more information, contact Corporate Travel Management (CTM). CTM are a commercial partner of the FCO and are authorised to administer such loans on behalf of the FCO.
