As of November 2019, Australia has already battled several devastating bushfires across a number of regions. These fires have resulted in the loss of lives and property with many residents advised to evacuate their homes until it is safe to return.
Smoke generated by bushfires can result in poor air quality, which could provoke respiratory conditions. Smoke can often accumulate many kilometers from the fire, including in urban areas and major cities. Most state and territory governments provide detailed information on the monitoring of air quality and useful advice if you are unable to avoid being in a smoke affected area, these include: Australian Capital Territory; New South Wales; Northern Territory; Queensland; South Australia; Tasmania; Victoria; Western Australia.
A Fire Danger Rating system operates across Australia which provides an indication of the possible consequences of a fire, if one was to start. The highest rating of ‘Catastrophic’ has already been issued and it is likely this fire season could see many more areas see this rating applied.
If you’re in or near an affected area, stay safe and follow the advice of local authorities: Australian Capital Territory Fire and Rescue; New South Wales Rural Fire Service; Northern Territory Fire and Rescue Service; Queensland Fire & Emergency Services; South Australian Country Fire Service; Tasmania Fire Service; Victorian Country Fire Authority; Western Australia Department of Fire and Emergency Services.
In the event of emergency, always dial Triple Zero (000).
