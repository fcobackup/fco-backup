Terrorists are very likely to try to carry out attacks in Mozambique. Attacks could be indiscriminate, including in places visited by foreigners.
UK Counter Terrorism Policing has information and advice on staying safe abroad and what to do in the event of a terrorist attack. Find out more about the global threat from terrorism.
There has been an increasing intensity of attacks in Cabo Delgado since January 2019, with attacks reported in the districts of Palma, Mocimboa da Praia, Macomia, Nangade, Quissanga, Muidumbe, Meluco and Ibo. Militants have used explosives, machetes and firearms to conduct lethal attacks, including attacks on vehicles. There have been over 20 attacks in the first five months of 2019. In January 2019, militants attacked the village of Mussemuco, Ibo District, arriving by sea and burning homes. Ibo district is close to Quirimbas National Park and popular with tourists. On 28 May 2019, 16 people were killed when militants attacked a vehicle in Macomia, using explosives and firearms. This was the deadliest incident to date. In June 2019, Islamic State claimed responsibility for an attack.
There are reports of an increased security presence in the region, including road blocks, and there are regular clashes between insurgents, armed vigilante groups and Mozambican security forces. If you’re planning to travel to the area, you should check local and social media for updates before you travel to the area and follow the advice of the local authorities.
There’s a heightened threat of terrorist attack globally against UK interests and British nationals, from groups or individuals motivated by the conflict in Iraq and Syria. You should be vigilant at this time.
Kidnap
Due to the presence of groups with links to Islamic extremism, there is a threat of kidnap in Mozambique.
British nationals are viewed as legitimate targets, including those engaged in tourism, humanitarian aid work, journalism or business sectors. If you’re kidnapped, the reason for your presence is unlikely to serve as a protection or secure your safe release.
The long-standing policy of the British government is not to make substantive concessions to hostage takers. The British government considers that paying ransoms and releasing prisoners builds the capability of terrorist groups and finances their activities. This can, in turn, increase the risk of further hostage-taking. The Terrorism Act (2000) makes payments to terrorists illegal.
