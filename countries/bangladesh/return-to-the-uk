There are commercial options to return to the UK from Bangladesh.
If you live in the UK and are currently visiting Bangladesh, you are strongly advised to return now by commercial means. Don’t risk getting stranded.
UK special charter flights will only operate for priority countries where commercial flights are not possible. You should not assume these flights will become available in Bangladesh because commercial routes are operating. Please do not contact the contracted travel management company if no flight is advertised here.
Flights
Commercial passenger flights from the UK, together with flights from Malaysia, Turkey, the UAE, Qatar and Sri Lanka are now permitted to land in Bangladesh. You should check with airlines to confirm what flight options are available. Flight schedules are subject to change at short notice and you should monitor travel arrangements closely.
Some airlines may require passengers to carry a certificate confirming a negative test for COVID-19 on departure from Bangladesh. You should confirm any such requirement with your airline in advance of your departure.
The temporary suspension of international passenger flights from: Bahrain, Bhutan, Hong Kong, India, Kuwait, the Maldives, Nepal, Oman, Saudi Arabia, Singapore and Thailand remains in force.
You will need to pay for your return travel to the UK. If departure options are available but you cannot afford the travel costs and have exhausted all other options for getting funds, you may be eligible for an emergency loan from the government. This is a last resort option and you would need to repay the loan when you are back in the UK. For more information, you should contact Corporate Travel Management (CTM). CTM are a commercial partner of the FCO and are authorised to administer such loans on behalf of the FCO.
If you cannot leave Bangladesh at this time, see more about staying in Bangladesh during coronavirus.
