Terrorists are likely to try to carry out attacks in China. Although foreigners haven’t been specifically targeted, attacks may occur in places visited by foreigners. You should take particular care during national holidays or when transiting public transport hubs, and always follow the advice of the local authorities. Previous attacks have targeted public places including on one occasion at a railway station and an open air market in 2014. There have been no recent attacks in the main tourist areas. The risk is higher in the Xinjiang Uyghur Autonomous region. You should take particular care and remain vigilant when travelling to or within Xinjiang.
Most attacks take place in the Xinjiang Uyghur Autonomous region and, according to the Chinese government, are carried out by Uyghur separatists with possible links to the East Turkestan Islamic Movement (ETIM). On 28 December 2016, a car was driven into a government building in Xinjiang killing one person. The occupants of the car were shot dead by security forces.
In September 2015, at least 16 people were reported killed in an attack at a coal mine in Aksu Prefecture. In 2014, 31 people were stabbed to death at a railway station in the southern city of Kunming. In 2013, five people were killed in Beijing after a car drove into a crowd of tourists outside Tiananmen gate.
You should take particular care and remain vigilant when travelling to or within Xinjiang where the threat is higher.
There’s a heightened threat of terrorist attack globally against UK interests and British nationals, from groups or individuals motivated by the conflict in Iraq and Syria. You should be vigilant at this time.
