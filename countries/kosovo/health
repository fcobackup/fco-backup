FCDO advises against all but essential travel to parts of Kosovo.
Before you travel check that:
your destination can provide the healthcare you may need
you have appropriate travel insurance for local treatment or unexpected medical evacuation
This is particularly important if you have a health condition or are pregnant.
Emergency medical number
Dial 94 from a landline or 194 from a mobile and ask for an ambulance.
Contact your insurance or medical assistance company promptly if you’re referred to a medical facility for treatment.
Vaccinations and health risks
At least 8 weeks before your trip check:
the latest information on vaccinations and health risks in TravelHealthPro’s Kosovo guide
where to get vaccines and whether you have to pay on the NHS travel vaccinations page
Air quality
High levels of air pollution can occur in Kosovo, particularly in Pristina. You can find further information and advice on air quality on the World Health Organization (WHO) website and check air quality levels on the World Air Quality Index Website.
Other health risks
Crimean Congo Haemorrhagic Fever is endemic in Kosovo. Most cases occur in the region around Malisheva (central Kosovo), but during the summer months other rural areas of Kosovo can be affected. You should take precautions against tick-bites when in rural areas.
Mosquito-borne diseases are present, including West Nile virus.
Medication
The legal status and regulation of some medicines prescribed or bought in the UK can be different in other countries. Read best practice when travelling with medicines on TravelHealthPro.
The NHS has information on whether you can take your medicine abroad.
Healthcare facilities in Kosovo
The public health system in Kosovo is poorly funded. Hospitals lack specialist equipment and there is a widespread shortage of medicines and other essentials. Many doctors and nurses lack training in modern techniques and practices. Treatment is also available at private medical clinics, which are of better quality than the public health system and are relatively affordable. A small payment in cash is required for treatment in the public health system but you should make sure you have adequate travel health insurance and accessible funds to cover the cost of any medical treatment abroad and repatriation.
FCDO has a list of English speaking doctors in Kosovo.
