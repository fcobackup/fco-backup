Entry and borders
See Entry requirements to find out what you will need to do when you arrive in Malta.
Returning to the UK
You are responsible for organising your own COVID-19 test, in line with UK government testing requirements. Check when you book that the testing service can provide the appropriate COVID-19 test.
Check with the provider that results will be available in time for your flight. If you test positive, you will have to self-isolate for 14 days. Make sure your travel insurance covers this eventuality.
You can schedule a test at any private testing clinic in Malta. The Malta Tourism Authority has collated a list of some of the possible providers.
For departures, Malta International Airport advises travellers to use the airline check-in desk to have COVID-19 documentation checked, even if they have already checked online. Travellers found to be without correct documentation at the departure gate may be prevented from boarding their flight.
Be prepared for your plans to change
No travel is risk-free during COVID. Countries may further restrict travel or bring in new rules at short notice, for example due to a new COVID-19 variant. Check with your travel company or airline for any transport changes which may delay your journey home.
If you test positive for COVID-19, you may need to stay where you are until you test negative. You may also need to seek treatment there.
Plan ahead and make sure you:
can access money
understand what your insurance will cover
can make arrangements to extend your stay and be away for longer than planned
