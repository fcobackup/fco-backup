Entry rules in response to coronavirus (COVID-19)
Entry to Slovenia

Quarantine requirements
The Slovenian authorities have implemented a Red, Amber and Green rating system, to determine the requirements for people arriving into Slovenia from overseas. The rules around entry are detailed, and subject to regular change. You should regularly consult this Travel Advice and the Slovenian Government websites listed below to ensure you have the latest information. Full details can be found on this Slovenian Government website.
The general rules on entry for the rating system are as follows:
If you are arriving into Slovenia from a country on the Green List, you do not have to enter into quarantine.
If you are arriving into Slovenia from a country on the Amber List, you may have to quarantine for 10 days depending on your circumstances (see below).
If you arriving into Slovenia from a country on the Red List, you will have to quarantine for 10 days unless you meet one of the specific exemptions that are listed by the Slovenian Government.
There are two broad exemptions to be aware of:
From 29 September, the Slovenian authorities have confirmed that anyone arriving from a country on the Amber or Red List who has a negative Covid-19 test issued in an EU/Schengen country that is no more than 48 hours old will not be required to quarantine. The UK is covered by this exemption until 31 December 2020.
Also from 29 September, the Slovenian authorities have confirmed that anyone arriving from an EU/Schengen country or region that is on the Amber List will not be required to quarantine. The UK is covered by this exemption until 31 December 2020.
From 12 October, the Slovenian authorities have added the following areas to the Red List. This means that all arrivals to Slovenia from these locations must enter into 10 days of quarantine, unless they meet one of the exemptions stated below, or hold a negative Covid-19 test that is no more than 48 hours old:
Northern Ireland
Scotland
Wales
Northern England
North West England
Yorkshire & Humberside
Gibraltar
The remainder of the UK is on the Amber List. This means that all arrivals into Slovenia travelling from Amber areas of the UK must quarantine for a 10-day period unless you meet one of the following criteria:
You are entering Slovenia from Amber listed areas of the UK before 31 December 2020, in which case you will not be required to enter into quarantine;
You are travelling from the UK with a confirmed negative Covid-19 test from an EU country that was administered within 48 hours of arrival in Slovenia (until 31 December 2020, test results from the UK will fall within this criteria). ; or
You meet one of the specific exemptions that are listed by the Government of Slovenia.
You should not use the NHS testing service to get a test in order to facilitate your travel to another country. You should arrange to take a private test.
You should also be aware that, the Slovenian authorities have declared specific regions of neighbouring countries to be on the Red List. This includes regions in Austria, Croatia and Hungary. You can find the full details here.
Anyone required to enter into quarantine will need to provide an address (where they will be staying) to the Border authorities. Failure to do so may result in the Border authorities denying you entry. During self-isolation, you are required to stay in your accommodation and not socialise outside of your household. You can take short walks for exercise, but should maintain social distancing and not engage with people from outside your household. The local municipality can make arrangements for the delivery of essential supplies if friends or family cannot support you.
All arriving travellers will be given advice at the border, regarding the steps they may need to take.
There are restrictions in place at Slovenia’s border with Italy. Non-Slovene or non-Italian nationals must cross at one of three border crossings:
Vrtojba‒St. Andrea
Fernetiči‒Fernetti
Škofije‒Rabuese
Krvavi potok‒Pesse
There are restrictions in place at Slovenia’s border with Austria. Non-Slovene or non-Austrian nationals must cross at one of three border crossings:
Karavanke-Karawanken Tunnel
Ljublej-Loibtunnel
Šentilj-Spielfeld
If you enter Slovenia you are advised to carry with you evidence of your reason for travel (for example, onward travel bookings; proof of residency; a work permit).
Neighbouring countries have reduced restrictions on entry from Slovenia. See travel advice for Austria, Croatia, Hungary and Italy.
If you remain in Slovenia, you should be aware that for stays longer than 90 days, you will be required to register as a Temporary Resident. Contact the Uprava Enota (the department that handles these applications) at +386 1 306 3035 or at ue.ljubljana@gov.si. The department is open Monday to Thursday from 8am-6pm, and on Friday from 8am-2pm.
Regular entry requirements
Visas  
If you hold a British Citizen passport, you don’t need a visa to enter Slovenia. If you’re planning a stay of longer than 3 months, see our Living in Slovenia guide and contact the Slovene Embassy if you have further questions.
The rules on travel will stay the same until 31 December 2020.
Visas from 1 January 2021
The rules for travelling or working in Europe will change from 1 January 2021:
You will be able to travel to countries in the Schengen area for up to 90 days in any 180-day period without a visa for purposes such as tourism. This is a rolling 180-day period.
Therefore, if you’re travelling to Slovenia, previous visits to the Schengen area within the 180 days before your date of travel would count against the 90-day limit.
If you are travelling visa-free to Slovenia and to other countries in the Schengen area, make sure your whole visit is within the limit.
To stay for longer, to work or study, or for business travel you will need to meet the entry requirements set out by Slovenia. This could mean applying for a visa or work permit. You should check with the Slovene Embassy what type of visa, if any, you will need.
Periods of stay authorised under a visa or permit will not count against the 90-day limit.
The European Commission has not yet set out how the limit of 90 days in any 180-day period for visa-free travel will be implemented for those who are already travelling in the EU or Schengen Area on 31 December 2020.
If you are travelling to Slovenia before 31 December 2020 and will stay until 1 January 2021 or later, you should check with the Slovene Embassy for information on how the 90-day visa-free limit will apply to you. This also applies if your stay includes travel to other Schengen area countries.
At border control for Slovenia, you may need to:
show a return or onward ticket
show you have enough money for your stay
use separate lanes from EU, EEA and Swiss citizens when queueing
Your passport may be stamped on entry and exit.
Passport validity
The rules on travel will stay the same until 31 December 2020.
Your passport should be valid for the proposed duration of your stay; you do not need any additional period of validity on your passport beyond this.
Passport validity from 1 January 2021
From 1 January 2021, you must have at least 6 months left on an adult or child passport to travel to most countries in Europe (not including Ireland).
If you renewed your current passport before the previous one expired, extra months may have been added to its expiry date. Any extra months on your passport over 10 years may not count towards the 6 months needed.
Check your passport is valid for travel before you book your trip. You will need to renew your passport before travelling if you do not have enough time left on your passport.
UK Emergency Travel Documents
UK Emergency Travel Documents (ETDs) are accepted for entry, airside transit and exit from Slovenia.
