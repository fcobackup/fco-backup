The Foreign and Commonwealth Office (FCO) advise against all but essential travel to:
Oruru department
Potosi department, except Uyuni
Chuquisaca department
Cochabamba department
Road travel between cities is not advised, owing to several attacks that have occurred on inter-city buses and the limited capacity of emergency services to respond in these areas.
The current political situation in Bolivia is highly unpredictable, with increased risk to traveller safety. Following presidential elections on 20 October 2019, there have been large and wide-scale political demonstrations across the country, many resulting in violence. In La Paz, most demonstrations take place in the city centre with violent confrontations. Further protests and strikes are planned and there is a risk that these will turn violent without warning. You should avoid large crowds or public demonstrations and don’t attempt to cross blockades.
You should regularly check the viability of any existing travel plans around the country, seeking advice from your transport and accommodation providers and local authorities as needed. All travel within and between major cities is being intermittently blocked by protesters and many major roads have been closed. Transport options will be extremely limited, road journeys and land border crossings may take a lot longer than planned, and there may be disruption to supply of goods in parts of the country. Land borders are subject to closure at short notice.
If you’re travelling by air, be prepared for possible disruption to flights and access to airports. El Alto airport in La Paz is especially likely to see disruption, including protests near to the airport and limited ground transport to the city. If you’re arriving by air into El Alto airport, confirm with the authorities on arrival that ground transport is functioning normally before leaving the terminal. If arriving by road to El Alto airport, you should seek your travel company’s advice before you leave for the airport.
If you need urgent consular assistance, contact the British Embassy La Paz on (591 2) 2433424. The British Embassy’s ability to travel to deliver consular services is very limited at this time.
