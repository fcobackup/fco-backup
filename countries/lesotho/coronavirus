Travel restrictions and borders
Lesotho’s borders are closed for all but essential trade. SAA Airlink flights between Maseru and Johannesburg Airport have been suspended.
Moshoeshoe International Airport and the border crossing points at Maseru Bridge, Caledonspoort (Butha Buthe), Maputsoe Bridge, Qacha’s Nek Bridge and Vanrooyens Gate (Mafeteng) remain open, but with reduced operating hours, for conveyance of essential goods and services only.
Entry and exit to Lesotho is allowed with approval from the Ministry of Home Affairs to provide or receive emergency medical services for a life threatening conditions.
Travel via South Africa
The Ministry of Foreign Affairs have stated that foreign national visitors travelling home are allowed to leave Lesotho. However, visitors to Lesotho must travel through, or transit via, South Africa.
South Africa has put in place travel restrictions and visa requirements for individuals from countries affected by coronavirus, including the United Kingdom. See Return to the UK for further details on requesting special permission to enter South Africa to enable you to return to the UK.
We understand that the South African High Commission Maseru is temporarily closed but may still issue visas in emergency situations.
Health Screening
Prior to the closure of the borders, the Government announced that all travelers arriving in Lesotho would be screened for coronavirus. Anyone entering Lesotho should comply with any additional screening measures by the authorities if asked to go through extra checks. Anyone showing symptoms of coronavirus may be placed in an isolation facility in a government hospital.
All individuals who have been in coronavirus affected areas within the past 14 days, including the UK, are required to self-isolate for 14 days. The Prime Minister of Lesotho has announced that this self-isolation period will take place in a government-nominated hotel at the visitor’s expense.
If you need further information about entry requirements, contact the local immigration authorities or the nearest Lesotho High Commission.
Local measures
The Government of Lesotho announced restrictions on movement from midnight on 29 March until 5 May. These restrictions have now been partially lifted.
Businesses and offices are allowed to open from 6 May provided health regulations and social distancing are observed.
Schools are opening for certain year groups.
Further details on opening hours for supermarkets and food shops are expected shortly.
All gatherings are prohibited (except funeral services of no more than 50 people).
Where travel by vehicle is necessary to obtain essential goods and services, restrictions are in place to limit the number of passengers carried. Private vehicles are allowed to carry one person (in addition to the driver) seated behind the front passenger seat.
Public transport is only permitted to operate between 8am and 4pm.
Medical care
Medical care in Lesotho is limited. Most expatriates use medical facilities in South Africa. Access to these facilities is currently restricted due to the new South African visa requirements.
Entry/Exit to provide or receive emergency medical services for a life threatening condition is allowed, with approval from the Ministry of Home Affairs.
If you take regular medication, you should ensure you have sufficient supply for the full duration of the Lesotho and South Africa lockdowns. Pharmacies are classified as an essential service and will remain open, with reduced hours. Most medicines that require a prescription from a doctor in the UK will require one in Lesotho. If necessary, you should obtain an electronic subscription from your medical practitioner to enable a local doctor to write on. Ask your insurer or you accommodation provider, to help you find one.
