The FCDO advise against all travel to Ukraine.
If you are a British national still in Ukraine, you should register your presence in Ukraine. This will allow us to provide the latest information. You should also continue to read and follow FCDO Travel Advice.
The Russian invasion of Ukraine is ongoing, with attacks against a number of major cities. There is a real risk to life. We advise British nationals to leave Ukraine immediately if you judge it is safe to do so. Ukraine’s airspace is closed.
The British Embassy office in Kyiv has temporarily relocated. Embassy staff are operating from the British Embassy office in Lviv. The in-person consular services that British Embassy office in Lviv can provide are extremely limited and may be further affected by Russian military action. British Nationals should not expect increased consular support or help with evacuating in these circumstances. A full range of assistance is available in neighbouring countries. If you are in need of assistance to leave Ukraine, you should call +380 44 490 3660 or +44 (0)1908 516666 and select the option for “consular services for British nationals.” You can also send an enquiry via the web contact form. See our returning to the UK page for information on exiting Ukraine and onward travel to the UK. There are reports of long queues at the border crossing points. You should check scheduled train and bus services are operating before you travel.
Following the introduction of martial law on 24 February, you should follow the advice of the Ukrainian authorities while you remain in Ukraine and you should check the measures in place in your location as they will vary from region to region. It is likely that commercial routes out of Ukraine will be severely disrupted and roads across Ukraine could be closed.
If you decide to remain in Ukraine, you should remain vigilant throughout for any potential combat operations, keep your departure plans under constant review and ensure your travel documents are up to date. You should monitor the media and this travel advice regularly, subscribe to email alerts and read our advice on how to deal with a crisis overseas.
You should expect increased documentation checks on people and vehicles, transport restrictions and increased security measures for public buildings and infrastructure. Other measures could include additional border controls, restrictions on large public events, curfews, restrictions on telephones, internet and broadcasting, and evacuations of certain areas. You should follow the restrictions imposed by the local authorities.
Ukrainian males (including dual nationals) aged 18-60 are now prohibited from leaving the country. It is expected that this prohibition will remain in place for the duration of martial law.
