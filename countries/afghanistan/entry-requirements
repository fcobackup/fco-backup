This page has information on travelling to Afghanistan.
This page reflects the UK government’s understanding of current rules for people travelling on a full ‘British Citizen’ passport from the UK, for the most common types of travel.
The authorities in Afghanistan set and enforce entry rules. If you’re unsure how Afghanistan’s entry requirements apply to you, contact its UK embassy, high commission or consulate.
All travellers
The FCDO advises against all travel to Afghanistan. All travellers are strongly advised to check current entry requirements with their travel operator, airline or their local Afghan diplomatic mission before embarking on a visit.
COVID-19 entry requirements may change at short notice. The most recent advice from the IATA COVID-19 Information hub describes that all COVID-19 entry requirements for Afghanistan were lifted in May 2022. You are strongly advised to check with your travel operator or airline on requirements.
Proof of vaccination status
Many airlines require proof of vaccination to allow passengers to board and you are advised to check the requirements of your operator in advance.
If you’re transiting through the United Arab Emirates
Transiting is when you pass through one country on the way to your final destination. Transiting through the United Arab Emirates is normally permitted for travellers who subject to their requirements such as vaccination status.
Further information about transiting through the United Arab Emirate can be found on the Travel Advice pages for the UAE.
Check your passport and travel documents before you travel
If you are visiting Afghanistan, we advise that your passport should be valid for six months from the date you arrive. Check with your travel provider to make sure your passport and other travel documents meet their requirements.
