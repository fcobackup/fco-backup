Before you travel, check the ‘Entry requirements’ section for Sri Lanka’s current entry restrictions and requirements. These may change with little warning. Monitor this advice for the latest updates and stay in contact with your travel provider.
If you plan to pass through another country to return to the UK, check the travel advice for the country you’re transiting.
It is more important than ever to get travel insurance and check it provides sufficient cover. See the FCDO’s guidance on foreign travel insurance.
Around 90,000 British nationals visited Sri Lanka in 2022. Most visits are trouble-free.
Sri Lanka is experiencing shortages of some medical and food items and imported goods, due to the ongoing economic situation in country. However many hotels, restaurants, grocery stores, and private hospitals have supplies. There is a restricted/limited supply of fuel (diesel, petrol and cooking gas), which is being rationed. Shortages of fuel may affect transport and businesses. Hospitals and other medical services may also be affected by fuel shortages. There may be occasional power cuts to electricity supplies, but many tourist facilities have backup generators.
In 2022, protests about the economic situation led to violence against peaceful protesters, resulting in injuries and loss of life. In recent months, tear gas and water cannons have been used to disperse protesters. Protests, demonstrations, roadblocks and violent unrest could occur at short notice. Curfews and emergency regulations may also be imposed. You should be vigilant, avoid large gatherings and keep up to date with developments via this travel advice and local media.
See ‘Shortages’ and ‘Political Situation’ for more details.
