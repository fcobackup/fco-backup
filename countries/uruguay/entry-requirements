The information on this page covers the most common types of travel and reflects the UK government’s understanding of the rules currently in place. Unless otherwise stated, this information is for travellers using a full ‘British Citizen’ passport.
The authorities in the country or territory you’re travelling to are responsible for setting and enforcing the rules for entry. If you’re unclear about any aspect of the entry requirements, or you need further reassurance, you’ll need to contact the embassy, high commission or consulate of the country or territory you’re travelling to.
You should also consider checking with your transport provider or travel company to make sure your passport and other travel documents meet their requirements.
Restrictions in response to coronavirus
Entry to Uruguay
Only Uruguayan nationals and legal residents are allowed to enter Uruguay.
Some foreigners who need to enter the country under exceptional circumstances will require pre-authorisation from the National Immigration Department.
You will not be allowed to board your originating flight without a negative coronavirus test which should be done no more than 72 hours before boarding. The Uruguayan Embassy in London has suggested the following laboratories where you can order home tests:
CityDoc
Blue Horizon Blood Tests
The Independent General Practice
You should not use the NHS testing service to get a test in order to facilitate your travel to another country. You should arrange to take a private test.
If you have a justifiable reason for not having a coronavirus test done before your flight you should contact the Uruguayan Consulate in London. If you are authorised to board without the coronavirus test you will be tested at the point of entry and will have to pay USD 100.
You should also ensure you have valid health and travel insurance for the duration of your stay and complete the health declaration before your arrival.
The Uruguayan Government strongly recommend you download the Coronavirus App and activate the Bluetooth in order to be contacted using their track and trace approach.
Upon arrival you are legally obliged to go to a declared address to carry out a 7-day mandatory quarantine. On day 7 of the quarantine you will be required to have a second swab taken and wait for a negative result before being allowed to finish your quarantine period. Alternatively, you can quarantine for 14 days without having to take the second test.
Foreigners entering Uruguay must have proof of health insurance that covers suspected or actual coronavirus.
You will also have to fill out a health declaration form and present on arrival.

There is a ferry service between Uruguay and Argentina via Buquebus. You will be required to comply with the entry requirements.
If you need further information about entry requirements, contact the local immigration authorities or the nearest Uruguayan embassy. You should also check with your airline or travel company for the latest information.
Regular entry requirements
Visas   
British passport holders visiting for up to 90 days don’t need a visa. For information on how to extend your stay or take up residency in Uruguay visit Dirección Nacional de Migración (in Spanish). For other information on entry regulations and living in Uruguay contact the nearest Uruguayan Embassy.
Passport validity
Your passport should be valid for at least the proposed duration of your stay. No additional period of validity beyond this is required.
UK Emergency Travel Documents
UK Emergency Travel Documents are accepted for entry, airside transit and exit from Uruguay. The validity requirements are the same as for full validity British passports. If you plan to travel to Argentina or the US you will need a visa in your ETD. You must contact the nearest Embassies of those countries in order to apply.
Customs controls
Strict customs controls prohibit visitors from importing animal and dairy products, fruit and vegetables. All baggage is x-rayed on arrival and may be searched.
Travelling with children
There are various requirements for travelling out of Uruguay with British or dual national children under the age of 18 who live in Uruguay. The Ministry of Interior’s website has more information, or you can contact a law firm with expertise in this subject.
