COVID-19 vaccines if you live in Bahrain
We will update this page when the Government of Bahrain announces new information on the national vaccination programme. You can sign up to get email notifications when this page is updated.
The Bahrain national vaccination programme started in December 2020 and is using the AstraZeneca, Pfizer-BioNTech, Sinopharm and Sputnik vaccines. The Government of Bahrain has stated that British nationals resident in Bahrain are eligible for vaccination, if they choose to join the programme.
All residents over the age of 18 years (with a valid CPR card) can register online for an appointment to get the COVID-19 vaccine free of charge. Registration for the vaccination programme is also possible through the BeAware Bahrain smartphone application or by calling 444. You can select the type of vaccine you wish to receive. You will then be contacted to confirm the date and time of your vaccination appointment. Individuals over 50 years old are entitled to a walk-in vaccination service, without the need to register ahead. The Bahraini vaccination programme also permits residents aged 12-17 to register for a Pfizer-BioNTech vaccination. If you are considering a vaccination for somebody in this age group, you should seek medical advice from their local healthcare provider.
Mobile vaccination units are available for seniors and individuals with special needs.
Registration for the booster doses is available. Individuals can select either the Pfizer-BioNTech (recommended for people 50 years and above and vulnerable categories) or the SinoPharm vaccine.
Find out more, including about vaccines that are authorised in the UK or approved by the World Health Organisation, on the COVID-19 vaccines if you live abroad.
