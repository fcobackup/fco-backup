Be prepared for your plans to change
No travel is risk-free during COVID. Countries may further restrict travel or bring in new rules at short notice, for example due to a new COVID-19 variant. Check with your travel company or airline for any transport changes which may delay your journey home.
If you test positive for COVID-19, you may need to stay where you are until you test negative. You may also need to seek treatment there.
Plan ahead and make sure you:
can access money
understand what your insurance will cover
can make arrangements to extend your stay and be away for longer than planned

If you are aged 13 or over you may be required to prove you have received a complete course of a COVID-19 vaccine to enter certain venues and events.

COVID-19 vaccines if you live in Argentina
Wherever possible British nationals should aim to be vaccinated in the country where they live. We will update this page when the Government of Argentina announces new information on the national vaccination programme. You can sign up to get email notifications when this page is updated.
The Argentinian national vaccination programme started in December 2020 and is using the AstraZeneca, Convidecia, Moderna, Pfizer/BioNTech, Sinopharm and Sputnik V vaccines. British nationals resident in Argentina are eligible for vaccination if they choose to join the programme.
Vaccination is voluntary and free of charge. The Government of Argentina is currently rolling out boosters. Each province/jurisdiction is responsible for the distribution of the vaccines in their area. Most provinces require that you hold a DNI (national ID) to qualify for a vaccine. You should check with local health officials where you live whether you qualify for a vaccine if you do not have a DNI. Further information on Argentina’s national vaccination programme, including priority lists, the status of the rollout in each province and enrolment details are available on the Argentine Ministry of Health website (in Spanish).
