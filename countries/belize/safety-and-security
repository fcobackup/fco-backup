Crime
Belize has one of the highest per capita murder rates in the world. There have been increased incidents of violent crime (armed robberies, home incursions, murders and sexual assaults).
Armed criminal gangs have also been known to operate in the past in the densely forested areas of Belize, particularly around the border area with Guatemala, close to tourist sites. These incidents are uncommon and the areas are patrolled by the Belize Defence Force.
The majority of muggings occur in Belize City but are common in all districts, including tourist destinations such as San Pedro, Caye Caulker, Placencia and San Ignacio. Avoid dark alleys, do not hitchhike or accept lifts from strangers, keep valuables out of sight and be aware that wearing expensive jewellery could attract unwanted attention. If possible, travel in groups and use a qualified guide for trips off the beaten track.
Incidents of serious gang-related violence do occur in Belize City, most commonly in the area to the south of the Haulover Creek (known as Southside). While tourists are not normally the targets of gang violence, anyone in the vicinity of an incident could be affected. You should exercise particular caution and remain vigilant of your surroundings if in and around these areas, especially at night.
You should immediately report all incidents of crime, including assault, robbery and theft to the police by calling 911. They will take your statement and investigate the matter. This may take several weeks. You can pay a fee at any point during the process to receive a copy of the report when it is completed.
Local travel
Take particular care when travelling in the Belize/Guatemala border area because of the ongoing dispute between the two countries. Only use officially recognised border crossings.
There have been a number of injuries and fatalities resulting from adventure sports activities including snorkelling and diving. Severe weather and inadequate safety precautions are the main causes. Check local weather forecasts and only use registered and licensed operators.
You can find more information on local travel on the Belize Tourism Board’s website.
Road travel
You can drive using your UK Driving Licence or an International Driving Permit for up to 3 months. For longer stays, you will need to get a Belize driving permit from the Department of Traffic in the district you’re in.
Road traffic accidents are common and local driving standards are poor. Take great care when driving, particularly during rainy conditions when roads can become slippery. In southern parts of the country, particularly in Stann Creek and Toledo, temporary bridges and causeways in low-lying areas may flood during severe weather.
Political situation
Political demonstrations can occur occasionally in Belize City and Belmopan. Most are peaceful.
Follow local media and avoid large gatherings of people or demonstrations.
