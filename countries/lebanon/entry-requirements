This page has information on travelling to Lebanon. Check what you must do to return to the UK.
This page reflects the UK government’s understanding of current rules for people travelling on a full ‘British Citizen’ passport from the UK, for the most common types of travel.
The authorities in Lebanon set and enforce entry rules.
All travellers
British citizens can normally apply for a free single entry tourist or family visit visa on arrival.
British Overseas Citizens and British Protected Persons will need to get a visa before travelling to Lebanon.
Persons of Palestinian origin may also require a visa before travelling, or may be required to carry additional documentation with them when travelling.
If you’re fully vaccinated
Passengers are considered fully vaccinated if they have:
Received three doses of any COVID-19 vaccine, or:
They have received the second dose of any COVID-19 vaccine (or single dose for vaccinations comprising of one dose only) within the past six months.
All fully vaccinated passengers are exempt from pre-departure tests.
Proof of vaccination status
The Lebanese Directorate General of Civil Aviation have said that they will accept any official document that confirms vaccination status. You should check with your airline what proof is required.
Lebanon will accept the UK’s proof of COVID-19 vaccination record. Your NHS appointment card from vaccination centres is not designed to be used as proof of vaccination and should not be used to demonstrate your vaccine status.
Lebanon doesn’t accept proof of recovery records.
If you’re not fully vaccinated
If you’re not fully vaccinated, you’ll need to show proof of a negative PCR test taken no more than 48 hours before boarding your flight, or a Rapid Antigen (Lateral Flow) test taken no more than 24 hours before boarding. Any Lateral Flow test result must come with a QR code (NHS home tests are not permitted). See information on getting a test before entry.
Passengers who travelled out of Lebanon and returned within one week will be exempt.
Children and young people
Children aged 11 and under are exempt from registering on the Ministry of Public Health (MOPH) platform.
If you’re transiting through Lebanon
Transiting is when you pass through one country on the way to your final destination.
You should contact your airline for guidance on vaccination and testing requirements if you plan to transit through Lebanon.
Check your passport and travel documents before you travel
Passport validity
Your passport should be valid for a minimum period of 3 months from the date of entry into Lebanon.
If your passport is lost or stolen during your stay in Lebanon and you require an ETD to leave, you will need to visit the Public Prosecution in Adlieh building (central Beirut) to report the loss or theft. Once the police report is finalized, you will need to obtain an Exit visa prior to your departure in order to leave the country, either from the General Security’s Department of Passport and Immigration or from the General Security Office at the airport. You will need to show the police report and the ETD. You should factor the time this will take into any new travel plans.
If your passport contains an Israeli stamp you may be refused entry to Lebanon even if you hold a valid Lebanese visa.
Check with your travel provider to make sure your passport and other travel documents meet their requirements.
Visas
British citizens can normally apply for a free single entry tourist or family visit visa on arrival. British Overseas Citizens and British Protected Persons will need to get a visa before travelling to Lebanon. Persons of Palestinian origin may also require a visa before travelling, or may be required to carry additional documentation with them when travelling. Entry requirements are subject to change, so you should check with the Lebanese Embassy before you travel.
Overstaying without the proper authority is a serious matter. You may be refused permission to leave until a fine has been paid.
Previous travel to Israel
If your passport contains an Israeli stamp you may be refused entry to Lebanon even if you hold a valid Lebanese visa. If you are visiting Lebanon, your passport should be valid for a minimum of 3 months from the date you arrive.
UK Emergency Travel Documents
UK Emergency Travel Documents (ETDs) are accepted for entry, transit and exit from Lebanon. You can find more information on how to get an ETD on gov.uk.
Stop matches
Lebanese Immigration Authorities check all visitors’ names on arrival against a database of those wanted for, or convicted of, offences in Lebanon. If a name matches against an entry on the database the individual may be detained (or on occasion allowed entry upon surrender of their passport) until they can prove that the record does not relate to them. It’s often possible to do so by producing a copy of a birth certificate or other official documentation that allows parents’ names to be checked against the database. You should consider carrying this kind of supporting documentation.
