There are still commercial options to return to the UK from Uruguay.
If you live in the UK and are currently visiting Uruguay, you’re strongly advised to return now by commercial means. Don’t risk getting stranded.
UK special charter flights will only operate for priority countries where commercial flights are not possible. You should not assume that these flights will become available in Uruguay. Please do not contact the contracted travel management company if no special charter flight is advertised here.
Commercial flights
The remaining commercial option to leave Uruguay is with Amaszonas and they have flights scheduled to fly to Sao Paulo from Montevideo on 6, 13, 20 and 27 June, which may be subject to change. We do not know if there will be any more flights out of Uruguay after that date.
Travelling via Sao Paulo
From Sao Paulo there are flights to Europe with Lufthansa, KLM and Air France, and there are some connecting flights to the UK as well as a limited service on the Eurotunnel. Transit passengers cannot spend more than 24 hours in Sao Paulo. You should have your travel booked to final destination before starting any journey, as you may not be allowed to board your flight without proof.
How to book
To travel with Amaszonas contact a travel agent to include onward travel or call Amaszonas direct on +598 (0) 96 436 032 or +598 2710 2200 or e-mail cfuentes@amaszonas.com. If you have any problems booking your Amaszonas flights please email the Embassy on: consular.enquiriesmontevideo@fco.gov.uk.
You will need to pay for your return travel to the UK. If departure options are available but you cannot afford the travel costs and have exhausted all other options for getting funds, you may be eligible to apply for an emergency loan from the government. This is a last resort option and you would need to repay the loan when you are back in the UK. For more information, contact Corporate Travel Management (CTM). CTM are a commercial partner of the FCO and are authorised to administer such loans on behalf of the FCO.
Your journey home
The National Travel Health Network and Centre (NaTHNaC) provides advice on how to stay safe as you travel by air.
If you’re returning home before 8 June, follow the guidance for when you return to the UK on steps you should take to protect yourself and others. From 8 June there will be new rules for entering the UK.
