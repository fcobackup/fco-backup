See the TravelHealthPro website for further advice on travel abroad and reducing spread of respiratory viruses during the COVID-19 pandemic.
International travel
Commercial flights to and from Vietnam remain very limited. A number of airline websites allow online booking from Vietnam. However, check carefully in advance whether these flights are guaranteed to fly. Flights and transit arrangements are still prone to changes and cancellation with little notice.
On 5 January 2021 Vietnam’s Prime Minister issued a new directive in response to the increased instances of COVID-19 around the world. The directive includes instructions to suspend flights from countries that have been particularly adversely affected by the new variants of the virus, including from the UK. It is possible that further restrictions might follow. You should be alert to announcements from local authorities.
If you are returning to the UK, a transit stop in the journey may require you to self-quarantine on arrival. See guidance on entering or returning to the UK
There are some restrictions on airside transit which you should check in advance to ensure you can transit, particularly transit times, visa and transit visa requirements and whether your baggage can be transferred airside at transit points.
Entry and borders
See Entry requirements to find out what you will need to do when you arrive in Vietnam.
Public spaces and services
The measures to combat COVID-19 vary from province to province and can be expected to increase and change at short notice. You should be alert to local variations, take a precautionary approach and be ready to comply with local authorities.
Mask wearing is compulsory in public settings. Those not wearing masks may be liable to spot fines.

COVID-19 vaccines if you live in Vietnam
As information is available about the national vaccination programme, this page will be updated.
The Medicines and Healthcare Products Regulatory Agency (MHRA) is the UK authority responsible for assessing the safety, quality and efficacy of vaccines. It has authorised the Pfizer/BioNTech, Oxford/AstraZeneca and Moderna vaccines for temporary supply and use in the UK. Find out more about MHRA approval for these vaccines.
British nationals living overseas should seek medical advice from their local healthcare provider in the country where they reside. Information about vaccines used in other national programmes, including regulatory status, should be available from the local authorities. This list of Stringent Regulatory Authorities recognised by the World Health Organisation may also be a useful source of additional information. Find out more information about the COVID-19 vaccines on the World Health Organization COVID-19 vaccines page.
