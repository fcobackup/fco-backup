There are currently no scheduled commercial options available to return to the UK from Oman. Oman suspended all international flights on Sunday 29 March and land borders are closed.
Oman Air special flights
Subject to demand, Oman Air is operating ad hoc special flights to London Heathrow and occasionally other European destinations. Information about these flights, along with details of how to book, will appear in the English-language local media and on Oman Air’s social media sites (but not their website):
Facebook
Twitter
Instagram
We will no longer advertise these flights on our Travel Advice, but will flag them on our Embassy social media sites (Facebook, Twitter or Instagram) as and when such flights become available.
Future travel options
The UK government is working closely with the airlines, the Omani authorities and British companies exploring private repatriation for their staff, to make sure options are available for you to return to the UK as soon as possible.
This travel advice will be updated when scheduled commercial departure options become available.
You will need to pay for your return travel to the UK. If departure options are available but you cannot afford the travel costs and have exhausted all other options for getting funds, you may be eligible to apply for an emergency loan from the government. This is a last resort option and you would need to repay the loan when you are back in the UK.
For more information, you should contact Corporate Travel Management (CTM). CTM are a commercial partner of the FCO and are authorised to administer such loans on behalf of the FCO.
If you cannot leave Oman
If you cannot leave Oman at this time, see advice on staying in Oman during coronavirus.
Your journey home: re-entering the UK
When you return, you must follow the rules for entering the UK. You:
need to provide your journey and contact details up to 48 hours before you’re due to arrive in the UK
are not allowed to leave the place you’re staying for the first 14 days you’re in the UK except in very limited situations (known as ‘self-isolating’)
See also the list of people who are exempt from the border rules.
The National Travel Health Network and Centre (NaTHNaC) also provides advice on how to stay safe as you travel by air.
