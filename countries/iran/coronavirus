Travel in Iran
It is now mandatory to wear face masks in enclosed public places. While this is not a legal requirement, you may be denied service if you do not comply.
Some measures are still in place in parts of Iran, including temporary closure of high risk businesses and shrines, and cancellation of some public events. While restrictions for COVID-19 have been gradually lifted since April, each province is able to introduce restrictions to respond to localised peaks in infections. This may include lockdown and restriction of movement, and may be introduced with little warning.
There are reports of travel restrictions in several provinces, including to important tourism and pilgrimage areas.
Accommodation
Hotels are authorised to open in Iran but you should check in advance as restrictions can change at short notice, and in practice some may remain closed.
Public places and services
There are no country-wide restrictions in place on shops, restaurants, markets, beaches or most leisure activities. Large events such as concerts and sports matches remain either cancelled or held behind closed doors. In practice, some restaurants, markets and shops remain closed or may have restrictions in place on the number of shoppers they will admit.
Healthcare in Iran
If you think you have COVID-19 symptoms, you are advised to take a test and to self-isolate at home until you receive the results. If the symptoms are not serious you should continue to self-isolate at home but if the symptoms persist and/or worsen then you are advised to go to a hospital for treatment. If you are a mono-British national, you should contact your Travel Insurance provider for advice; if you test positive for COVID-19, you will be referred to a specialist Coronavirus hospital or unit.
