The information on this page covers the most common types of travel and reflects the UK government’s understanding of the rules currently in place. Unless otherwise stated, this information is for travellers using a full ‘British Citizen’ passport.
The authorities in the country or territory you’re travelling to are responsible for setting and enforcing the rules for entry. If you’re unclear about any aspect of the entry requirements, or you need further reassurance, you’ll need to contact the embassy, high commission or consulate of the country or territory you’re travelling to.
You should also consider checking with your transport provider or travel company to make sure your passport and other travel documents meet their requirements.
Restrictions in response to coronavirus
Only travellers who can prove that entry is for urgent family/work reasons will be allowed to enter, and they will be expected to fill in a travel certificate (available here) and provide proof.
All travellers over the age of 11 must undertake a test for COVID-19 within 72 hours before departure for their destination. The test is obligatory and the traveller must show proof of a negative result before embarking.
Travellers must also provide a self -certified document affirming that they have no COVID symptoms and that to their knowledge they have not been in contact with any person confirmed positive within the last 14 days.
Airlines will refuse boarding to anyone who does not produce both proof of a negative test result and the self-certified document.
All travellers will be required to complete 14 days of quarantine in a hotel requisitioned by the government. To note this does not apply to arrivals from Wallis and Fortuna.
Visas
New Caledonia is a dependent territory of France.
If your passport describes you as a British Citizen you do not need a visa to enter New Caledonia. Other British passport holders should check the current entry requirements with the French Foreign Ministry. If you wish to remain in New Caledonia for more than three months, you should apply at the local Haut Commissariat or French Consulate for the necessary residence and work permits.
If the UK leaves the EU without a deal, the current visa policy for British Citizens visiting New Caledonia may change. We are working with the relevant authorities to clarify entry requirements for British nationals and this page will be updated as soon as further information is available. If you would like more details in the meantime, or want to discuss a specific issue, you should consult the French Embassy in London.

Your passport should be valid for the proposed duration of your stay. No additional period of validity beyond this is required.
