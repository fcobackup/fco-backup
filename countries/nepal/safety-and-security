Trekking in Nepal
The Government of Nepal has announced that it will give foreign nationals permission to travel to Nepal for the purpose of mountaineering and trekking. You should liaise with your agency to establish documentation you will require, as this may change at short notice.
See Entry requirements for more information before you travel.
Never trek alone. Use a reputable agency, remain on established routes, and walk with at least one other person.
Always observe national park regulations and follow your guide’s instructions.
Altitude sickness is a risk, including on the Annapurna, Langtang and Everest Base Camp treks. Read the National Travel Health Network and Centre’s advice on altitude sickness.
Accidents happen due to insufficient information, inappropriate equipment or overestimation of your own capabilities. Follow the advice given by local authorities and guides. Ignoring such advice could put yourselves and other mountain users in danger.
The following hazards exist throughout the year, especially above 3,000m:
sudden weather changes
avalanches and snow drifts
landslides and flooding
glacial crevasses and hollows
rockfall
thunder storms and lightning
altitude sickness
sun exposure
You should:
take note of weather forecasts and conditions
make sure you’re physically fit and have the necessary experience
be in a team of at least 2
inform someone of your plans
take warm clothes and wet weather gear
use sun block (SPF20 or higher) and sun glasses
Make sure your insurance covers you for your intended activity, including travel above 3,000m, mountain rescue services and helicopter costs.
The Trekking Agencies Association of Nepal (TAAN) provides live updates on trekking conditions in Nepal. Online weather forecasts are available on the website of the government of Nepal Department Of Hydrology and Meteorology.
Treks can take longer than expected. Flights across Nepal, particularly in high mountain areas, can be delayed due to poor weather conditions. Keep your tour operator, guide and family informed of your situation and travel plans. In remote areas, including long stretches of the Annapurna Circuit trek, mobile phone coverage and internet services are extremely limited. Consider renting a satellite phone.
A valid permit and Trekkers’ Information Management System (TIMS) card are needed to enter Nepal’s main trekking regions. See the Naturally Nepal website
Volunteering and adventure travel
If you’re planning to volunteer or undertake adventure travel in Nepal you should research any organisation or company you’re planning to use thoroughly before committing yourself. Read these information and advice pages on gap year travel and safer adventure travel and volunteering overseas.
The Social Welfare Council of the government of Nepal maintains a list of registered volunteer organisations; you can ask for a copy by sending an email to: info@swc.org.np.
The British Embassy has received reports of volunteer opportunities at orphanages which are profit orientated organisations rather than charities. If you’re volunteering at this type of organisation, you could be contributing to child exploitation. Contact the Nepali Central Child Welfare Board for confirmation before signing up to volunteer for one of these organisations.
Crime
There’s a low rate of serious crime in Nepal. However, you should take sensible precautions.
Watch out for pick-pockets and bag-snatching, particularly in airports, on buses and in areas popular with foreign nationals like Thamel, Sanepa and Kupondol in Kathmandu.
Take care when walking around at night. Assaults and robberies are more likely to occur in the evening in poorly lit areas. Avoid walking on your own and don’t carry large sums of cash. Keep valuables in a hotel safe if possible.
Sexual assaults against foreign nationals, particularly women, have been reported in tourist areas, including Thamel and Sanepa in Kathmandu. Be wary of accepting drinks from strangers, don’t leave drinks unattended and exercise caution, especially when alone after dark. See our advice page for women travelling abroad.
There were reports of some incidents in parts of Nepal of some foreign tourists being threatened or intimidated by locals, allegedly in relation to coronavirus. Such incidents are rare. If you experience such problems, you should return immediately to your accommodation (if safe), or to the local law enforcement agencies (phone 100), or contact the Embassy at +977 (0)1 423 7100.
Victims of crime should call the Tourist Police in Kathmandu on 01 4700750 or the Tourist Police headquarters on 01 4247041.
Road travel
Road conditions are poor, especially during the monsoon season or in mountain areas. The 2015 earthquakes affected many roads and reconstruction work is still ongoing, making conditions worse.
If you’re travelling during monsoon season, see Natural disasters
Bus accidents are common in Nepal and there are a number of accidents resulting in fatalities every year. Buses are often overcrowded, poorly regulated, and poorly maintained. Avoid travel on overnight buses. Don’t travel on overloaded or overcrowded buses. Tourist buses usually offer a higher standard of comfort and safety.
General driving standards are poor. Many drivers are not properly licensed, trained or insured and vehicles, including taxis, are often poorly maintained. There are few pavements outside central Kathmandu and motorists don’t yield right of way to pedestrians.
Other road users often ignore motorbikes and bicycles. It’s the law to wear a helmet when driving a motorbike. You should also wear a suitable helmet when riding as a passenger, and when riding a bicycle.
If you’re planning to drive in Nepal, an International Driving Permit (IDP) is recommended. UK driving licence holders are not eligible to drive in Nepal without a Nepali driving licence or an IDP. There is no time limit for the use of IDPs in Nepal. You can get IDPs over the counter from many UK Post Offices. You will not be able to buy an IDP outside the UK, so get one before you travel. Carry your IDP with you at all times as well as any vehicle registration documents.
Air travel
Some major carriers fly to and from Nepal, connecting to major hubs. These flights may be oversubscribed, especially at peak times. You should liaise with your airline or travel provider for more information.
The Government of Nepal requires specific conditions of entry for all passengers originating from or transiting the UK. You can find more information in the Entry requirements section
Check weather conditions before travelling. Bad weather conditions in mountainous and hill regions could further increase the risk to your safety and cause lengthy delays. Airfields such as Lukla’s are among the most remote and difficult to land on in the world and are a challenge for even the most technically proficient pilots and well-maintained aircraft.
There have been a number of air accidents in Nepal over the last ten years including:
on 29 May 2022, a Tara Air flight from Pokhara to Jomsom with 22 people on board crashed shortly after take off, in bad weather. All sixteen passengers and six crew were killed
on 12 March 2018, a US Bangla Airlines flight from Bangladesh with 71 passengers on board crashed on landing at Kathmandu International Airport. Fifty one passengers were killed
on 26 February 2016, an Air Kasthamandap plane with 11 passengers on board crashed while flying between Nepalgunj and Jumla. Two members of the crew were killed
on 24 February 2016, a Tara Air plane with 20 passengers on board crashed while flying between Pokhara and Jomsom. Twenty-three passengers were killed
on 28 September 2012, a Sita Air Dornier aircraft flying from Kathmandu to Lukla crashed south-west of Kathmandu shortly after take-off. Nineteen people were killed, including 7 British nationals. The Air Accident Investigation Commission of Nepal issued a report of the accident and made a number of recommendations aimed at improving safety
A list of further incidents and accidents can be found on the website of the Aviation Safety network. 
All carriers from Nepal have been refused permission to operate air services to the EU due to safety concerns.
In 2017 an 2022, an International Civil Aviation Organisation audit of aviation safety oversight found that the level of implementation of certain elements of safety oversight in Nepal were below the global average.
The FCDO cannot offer advice on the safety of individual airlines, but the International Air Transport Association publishes a list of registered airlines that have been audited and found to meet a number of operational safety standards and recommended practices. This list is not exhaustive and the absence of an airline from this list doesn’t necessarily mean that it is unsafe.
A number of tour operators have decided to stop using certain airlines due to safety concerns. Specific safety concerns about Sita Air have led a number of tour operators to stop using them.
