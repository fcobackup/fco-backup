Crime
Crime levels are low, but street crime occurs, particularly in larger towns. Watch out for pick pockets in public places like tourist hot spots, beaches, airports and on public transport. Take sensible precautions to protect yourself and your belongings. You should report all incidents of crime to the local police station and get a report. If you lose your passport you should also contact the British Embassy.  
Local travel 
Information on local road closures is available on the Auto-Moto Association of Montenegro website or by telephoning 19807, +382 20 234 999 or +382 63 239 987. You can also use these numbers to ask for roadside assistance. The main emergency numbers are: 112 (general emergencies), 122 (police), 123 (fire department), and 124 (ambulance service).
Road travel
The standard of roads is fair to poor with conditions worsening in rural areas, especially in the winter and after bad weather. In particular the two-lane Moraca Canyon in Montenegro can be dangerous when conditions are poor and there’s overcrowding. Roads leading to Montenegro’s coastal areas are in better condition, but can be busy during the summer season.
The only toll in Montenegro is the Sozina tunnel between Lake Skadar and the sea.
To drive you must have a valid driving licence. If you’re taking your car, you must have vehicle registration/ownership documents and a locally valid insurance policy with you. You may be refused entry at the border, if you fail to carry the right documents. The FCO can’t assist you in confirming the validity of photocopied and/or emailed registration logbooks (V5C) nor obtain originals for you.
Check if your insurance provides European Green Card vehicle insurance valid in Montenegro. Drivers of cars registered on foreign plates and without a valid green card will be asked to buy temporary insurance valid for Montenegro, and available for purchase at all official border crossings (“granichno osiguranje” in Montenegrin).
You’re required by law to wear a seatbelt. You must drive with dipped headlights on during the day and must not use a mobile phone while driving.
If you’re involved in a small traffic accident, you can request a police investigation at a cost of 50 euros. This fee is reimbursable from the person found guilty for causing the accident after completion of the court proceedings. Drivers can opt to complete a European accident report and submit it to their insurance company without a police investigation.
In case of a smaller traffic accident, where material damages to a vehicle are up to a value of 1000 EUR, a police officer will conduct an investigation only if requested, and 50 EUR fee will be charged to the person requesting the police investigation.
Montenegrin traffic law defines intoxication as a blood alcohol level higher than 0.3 g/kg, or 0.1 g/kg for drivers younger than 24 or with less than 12 months of driving experience. Exceeding the speed limit by just 10kph will get you a fine in Montenegro, while excessive speeding (30kmh over the limit in towns and 50kmh on motorways) and overtaking under dangerous conditions will lead to automatic confiscation of your driving licence. Fines for traffic offences range from €20 to €6,000. Prison sentences can also be imposed.
Usually the police officer issuing a fine requests payment be made to a bank account within a reasonable time. In certain circumstances your passport may be seized. If you deny the charge you have the right to appear in court. All fine receipts have serial numbers and can be monitored in a central register for three years.
You must equip your car for winter conditions when the weather requires it.

Extreme and adventure sports
A wide range of outdoor activities are on offer for tourists. Take precautions to prevent injuries and use protective equipment. Before signing up with paragliding instructors, for example, ask to see their training licence for tandem flights. Take particular care when hiking in the Montenegrin mountains.
Political situation
Protests take place occasionally in Montenegro, and are usually peaceful. Keep up to date with local developments, check local media and avoid any demonstrations or large gatherings.
