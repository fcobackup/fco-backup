This section has safety advice for regions of Panama. It only covers regions where FCDO has specific advice.
You should also read FCDO’s overall travel advice and safety and security advice.  
Colombia border
There is a risk of violence near the Colombia border in an area east of a line drawn between:
Punta Carreto in the Comarca de Guna Yala on the Atlantic coast
Yaviza in the eastern Darien Province
Punta Piña on the Pacific coast
Political and criminal violence in Colombia can spill over into Panama. There is a threat from Colombian guerrillas and other armed groups. Foreign nationals and Panamanian citizens have been the victims of violent crimes, kidnapping and murder in this area.
Darien Province
Only travel to Darien Province in an organised group, and make sure local police and security authorities are aware of your visit. Follow local security advice and do not stray from your group.
