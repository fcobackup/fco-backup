This is particularly important if you have a health condition or are pregnant.

HIV and AIDS
In 2015 UNAIDS estimated that around 210,000 adults, aged 15 or over were living with HIV in Eswatini. This is around 28.8% of adults, compared to 0.2% of adults in the UK. Take the normal precautions to avoid exposure to HIV and AIDS. 
Medication
The legal status and regulation of some medicines prescribed or bought in the UK can be different in other countries.

Healthcare in Eswatini
Basic healthcare is available in Eswatini, but there are shortages of common medicines. For serious accidents and emergencies or specialised treatment, it’s likely you would need to go to South Africa. Local private hospitals can arrange evacuation if you are fully insured or you can produce funds in advance.
Make sure you have adequate travel health insurance and accessible funds to cover the cost of medical evacuation to South Africa and repatriation.
