The information on this page covers the most common types of travel and reflects the UK government’s understanding of the rules currently in place. Unless otherwise stated, this information is for travellers using a full ‘British Citizen’ passport.
The authorities in the country or territory you’re travelling to are responsible for setting and enforcing the rules for entry. If you’re unclear about any aspect of the entry requirements, or you need further reassurance, you’ll need to contact the embassy, high commission or consulate of the country or territory you’re travelling to.
You should also consider checking with your transport provider or travel company to make sure your passport and other travel documents meet their requirements.
As of 15 March, the Foreign and Commonwealth Office (FCO) advise against all but essential travel to Myanmar due to the risk of quarantine for British nationals arriving in country. If you are in Myanmar and able to leave, you should do so.
There is an ongoing outbreak of coronavirus (COVID-19) around the world. Travel restrictions can be imposed at short notice.
From 21 March, all incoming visitors arriving from or having visited in the past 14 days the UK, USA, Switzerland, the Netherlands, Austria, Belgium, Norway, Sweden and/or Denmark, Italy, Iran, France, Spain, and Germany shall be subject to a 14-day quarantine in a Government facility upon their arrival in Myanmar. All are required to present a medical certificate issued by a recognised health authority before being allowed to board their flights. It needs to say they have no symptoms of acute respiratory illness. Travellers who have visited high risk areas in China (such as Hubei Province) or the South Korea (such as Daegu and Gyeongbuk Regions) in the past 14 days will not be permitted entry. This may also apply to passport holders from these countries even if they are travelling from elsewhere. This list of countries, and the nature of the restrictions, could change without warning.
Visas
You will need to get a visa before you travel. You all should apply at the nearest Myanmar Embassy or Consulate well in advance of travelling. E-visas have been suspended for all countries until 30 April 2020. For more information about entry requirements, contact the Myanmar Embassy.
Passport validity
Your passport should be valid for a minimum period of 6 months from the date of entry into Myanmar.
Restrictions on entering and exiting Myanmar at the same border crossing
Restrictions on exiting Myanmar at the same border crossing from which you entered have been partially relaxed. If you enter the country through the Tachilek (Myanmar Shan State), KawThoung (Myanmar Tanintharyi), Myawaddy (Myanmar Karen State) or Htee Khee-Sunaron (Myanmar Dawei District) border crossings you are able to depart via Yangon or Mandalay International Airport. However, if you enter via the Muse (Myanmar Shan State) or Tamu (Myanmar Chin State) border crossings you must exit at the crossing from which you entered.
Yellow fever
Check whether you need a yellow fever certificate by visiting the National Travel Health Network and Centre’s TravelHealthPro website.
UK Emergency Travel Documents
UK Emergency Travel Documents (ETDs) are not valid for entry into Myanmar. However, ETDs are accepted for exit from Myanmar.
