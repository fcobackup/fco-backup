Read what you can and cannot do

The information on this page covers the most common types of travel and reflects the UK government’s understanding of the rules currently in place. Unless otherwise stated, this information is for travellers using a full ‘British Citizen’ passport.
The authorities in the country or territory you’re travelling to are responsible for setting and enforcing the rules for entry. If you’re unclear about any aspect of the entry requirements, or you need further reassurance, you’ll need to contact the embassy, high commission or consulate of the country or territory you’re travelling to.
You should also consider checking with your transport provider or travel company to make sure your passport and other travel documents meet their requirements.
Restrictions in response to coronavirus
The Georgian authorities have introduced new measures in relation to coronavirus.
Foreign citizens are not currently allowed to enter Georgia. The ban also applies to foreigners with Georgian residence permits. Anyone arriving in Georgia from 20 March will face compulsory 14-day quarantine. You should carry additional supplies of necessary medication in carry-on luggage. The Government has announced that domestic tourism will re-open on 15 June.
From 1 July Georgia’s land and air borders should re-open in line with the principle of safe corridors and there will be a gradual resumption of flights and international tourism on the principles of safe corridors. The first corridor has been announced with Israel from 1 July but further details and modalities are not yet specified.
The Georgian authorities recognise that some non-Georgian residents may be unable to renew their entry permits in due time due to border closures. They have informed the British Embassy that they plan to amend the relevant legislation to allow for these exceptional circumstances and that those who cannot renew their permits for coronavirus reasons will not be penalised. The British Embassy in Tbilisi will publish the revised rules on Facebook and Twitter, once confirmed by the Georgian Government
Regular entry requirements
Visas
British nationals don’t need a visa to enter Georgia for visits of up to one year. If you wish to stay for longer, you’ll need to apply for a long term visa. Contact the Embassy of Georgia in London or visit the Georgian Ministry of Foreign Affairs website for more details on entry requirements.
If you’re living in Georgia you should contact the Justice House or Ministry of Foreign Affairs of Georgia for advice.
Passport validity
Your passport should be valid for the proposed duration of your stay. No additional period of validity beyond this is required.
Travel insurance
Make sure you have a valid travel insurance policy as you may be asked to provide evidence of this by your airline at check-in or by the immigration authorities upon arrival in Georgia. You may face difficulties if you cannot provide evidence of valid travel insurance.
Travelling with medicines
Georgia has a very strict anti-drugs policy, which can also cover prescription and non-prescription drugs or medicines, otherwise commonly available in the UK and the European Union. For example, non-prescription medicines containing codeine are illegal in Georgia. This can cause serious problems for travellers and in some cases lead to administrative and criminal proceedings. Before travelling, check Georgia’s medication importation regulations on the Ministry of Health website
If you intend to travel with prescription medicine, you must carry a doctor’s prescription and ideally the original packaging. See Health
UK Emergency Travel Documents
UK Emergency Travel Documents are accepted for entry, airside transit and exit from Georgia.
