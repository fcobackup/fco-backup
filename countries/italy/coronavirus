Entry and borders
Travel to Italy is possible only in case of absolute necessity. All travellers arriving in Italy from abroad are obliged to:
self-isolate for 14 days
carry a form self-certifying their reason for travel to Italy (“the Self-Declaration Form for Travel”) stating the purpose of their trip to Italy
report promptly to local health authorities
More information on all these requirements is available from the Ministry of Foreign Affairs.
The Italian authorities have advised against travel for tourism purposes throughout Italy, and that tourists already on holiday in Italy should limit their movements to those necessary to return to the place where they live.
Transport
If intending to travel to Italy via an Alitalia flight, passengers should bring two completed copies of the “Self-Declaration Form for Travel” to the airport.
Only one airport per region will remain open. Rome Ciampino closed for commercial flights on 13 March. Terminal 1 (only) of Rome Fiumicino airport closed on 17 March.
All travellers entering Italy must avoid using public transport and must arrange to be collected, take a taxi or hire a car.
Train companies have reduced domestic services and suspended international travel. Some cross-border bus companies are also cancelling their services. Ports remain open for Italian-flagged ships to disembark passengers for transfer to the airport. Passenger ferry schedules remain subject to change and cancellations. Travellers disembarking from ferries are permitted to transit Italy in their own vehicles, but must complete the journey within 24 hours. Speak to your tour operator or transport provider for the latest information.
Local measures
On 11 March, the Italian government announced new measures. Under the measures:
all non-essential business across Italy are closed
all shops are closed, except pharmacies and those selling food and other basic necessities
essential public services, transport, utilities, banks and postal services remain active
all public gatherings, including religious ceremonies, funerals and sporting events are suspended
ski resorts, restaurants, bars, museums, cultural institutions, childcare facilities, schools and universities are closed
Residents of Italy (including British nationals) must remain at home. Movement is limited to urgent business, shopping or health requirements only. If leaving home for these purposes, you must carry a Self-Declaration Form for Internal movement stating this. If you are a British national resident in Italy, it is also recommended to carry proof of your residence in Italy when transiting through airports or other transport hubs.
If you’re travelling through Italy as a visitor, you must carry your passport and an onward ticket at all times, as well as a completed self-declaration form. Additionally, it is recommended to carry proof of residence when transiting thorough airports or other transport hubs.
On 26 April, the Italian government announced that some of these measures will change as they move into “phase 2” of their coronavirus response:
From 4 May, the use of masks in public will be mandatory in enclosed public places.
Parks will reopen and outdoor exercise will be permitted, subject to social distancing.
Funerals will recommence with limited attendance.
Bars and restaurants will reopen for takeaway services only.
Travel between the Italian regions will be permitted only in exceptional circumstances.
On 18 May, shops, museums and libraries will reopen.
From 1 June, restaurants, hairdressers and salons are expected to reopen.
Schools will remain closed until September.
Healthcare
If you need medical advice or believe you have symptoms of coronavirus you should contact your local GP, your local ASL (Azienda Sanitaria Locale) or one of the regional numbers listed on the Italian Ministry of Health website before visiting a health centre.
In the case of an emergency you should call Italy’s 112 emergency number. English speaking operators are available.
