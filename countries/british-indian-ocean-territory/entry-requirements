This advice reflects the UK government’s understanding of current rules for people travelling on a full ‘British citizen’ passport from the UK, for the most common types of travel. The authorities in British Indian Ocean Territory set and enforce entry rules. If you’re not sure how these requirements apply to you, contact the British Indian Ocean Territory administration.
Restricted access
The British Indian Ocean Territory is not a tourist destination. There are no commercial flights, access is restricted and you need a permit before you travel.
COVID-19 rules
Double COVID-19 vaccination is no longer required as a condition for entry to British Indian Ocean Territory. However, there remains a small risk that individuals can have more serious complications of COVID-19.
The health facilities on the Island cannot support individuals with serious complications of COVID-19.
Be aware of this risk and have appropriate insurance coverage, including medical evacuations if needed. If you have long-term health conditions that can predispose you to the more serious complications of COVID-19, carefully consider if this is right for you.
Passport validity requirements
To enter the British Indian Ocean Territory, your passport must have an ‘expiry date’ at least 6 months after the date you arrive and have at least 2 blank pages.
Check with your travel provider that your passport and other travel documents meet requirements. Renew your passport if you need to.
You will be denied entry if you do not have a valid travel document or try to use a passport that has been reported lost or stolen.
Yachting permit requirements
Yacht crews must have a mooring permit to enter the British Indian Ocean Territory and make safe passage through the Indian Ocean (outer islands only).
Applying for a mooring permit
You must apply for a mooring permit at least 6 weeks in advance and have proof of appropriate travel insurance. Read guidance on applying for a mooring permit.
