The Foreign and Commonwealth Office (FCO) advise against all travel to Libya, and for British nationals still in Libya to leave immediately by any practical means. This advice has been in place consistently since 2014. Local security situations are fragile and can quickly deteriorate into intense fighting and clashes without warning.
Consular support is not available from the British government from within Libya, as consular operations remain suspended. If you need to speak to a consular officer in the UK, call the FCO in London on +44 (0)20 7008 1500.
Since 3 April 2019 there has been a significant build-up of militarised forces in the west of Libya. Sporadic armed clashes have taken place to the south and west of Tripoli. Forces opposed to the recognised government have reportedly gained control over a number of towns, including Gharyan (75-80km from the capital). Prime Minister Serraj has announced a state of emergency and full mobilisation of military and security units loyal to the government. On 8 April 2019, Mitiga airport closed temporarily following an air strike. See Political situation
Inter-militia fighting has periodically caused the temporary suspension or closure of airports, closed roads and led to the closure of some border crossings. All airports are vulnerable to attack. Tripoli International Airport has been closed since 13 July 2014. On 15 January 2018, there were at least 20 fatalities and 60 wounded after clashes around Mitiga airport in Tripoli, temporarily closing the airport. Heavy clashes between militia groups in late August and September 2018 resulted in over 120 deaths and nearly 450 wounded. During this period, Mitiga airport was closed for 4 weeks as a result.
Terrorists are very likely to try to carry out attacks in Libya. On 25 December 2018, Daesh claimed responsibility for an attack on the Ministry of Foreign Affairs in Tripoli which killed at least two people. On 10 September 2018, a terrorist attack on the National Oil Corporation in central Tripoli killed 2 people and wounded many more. At least 13 people were killed and many injured following a terrorist attack on the High National Election Commission in Tripoli on 2 May 2018.
There remains a high threat throughout the country of terrorist attacks and kidnap against foreigners, including from Daesh-affiliated extremists (formerly referred to as ISIL) and Al Qaida, as well as armed militias. Daesh and Al Qaeda have attacked a number of oil and gas installations and killed or kidnapped workers, including foreign nationals. See Safety and security and Terrorism
