This page gives you guidance on how to stay safely in Poland as a visitor, if you are unable to return to the UK.
Everyone should comply with the measures put in place in Poland to limit the spread of coronavirus (COVID-19).
Moving around in Poland
For information on entering Poland, see Entry requirements.
Masks are no longer compulsory in open public spaces if you are able to maintain 2m distance from others and children under 4 are not required to wear masks. When outside, you should keep a 2 metre distance from others, unless you are a parent with a child under 13 or the carer of a disabled person.
There are no longer restrictions on the number of people attending religious services and funerals. The government has announced that from 6 June you are allowed to organise wedding receptions and other family celebrations for up to 150 people.
Public transport use is limited to reduced capacity seating to maintain appropriate distance between passengers. Masks must be worn. You can still use taxis.
There are fines between £1000 to £6000 (5000 to 30000 PLN) if you are found breaking these rules.
Hotels and short term accommodation establishments are open subject to strict sanitary rules and some facilities may be closed (for example swimming pools). The government has announced that hotels will be able to reopen swimming pools, gyms and saunas on 6 June, with strict hygiene measures in place.
Some sporting facilities are open with limits on visitor numbers. If you plan to visit a cultural or sports venue we recommend first consulting their website for information about opening. Many have information in English as well as Polish. National Forests, parks and beaches are open.
There are no limits on customer numbers in shops, but you still have to cover your nose and mouth and wear single-use gloves. Restaurants and pubs are permitted to open but you must wear a mask when not seated at the table. Hairdressers may also open by appointment only. Some museums, libraries and cultural venues are open. The government has announced that from 6 June cinemas, theatres and concert halls may open at 50% capacity and masks must be worn. Swimming pools, gyms, indoor play centres and theme parks, saunas, tanning salons, massage salons and tattoo parlours are also allowed to open from 6 June, with strict hygiene rules in place. Masks must be worn at massage salons and tattoo parlours.
Some nurseries and kindergartens are open subject to strict sanitary procedures. A staged relaxation of the rules for students began on 18 May, including allowing classes and childcare for Grades 1-3 of primary schools (6 to 9 year olds). Higher Education Institutions may be open for some classes. If you are a student or parent you should consult your education provider for more information.
The above measures may be extended further, in scope and time, at short notice.
The Office for Foreigners allows in-person appointments but you must adhere to strict social distancing guidelines and wear a mask.

Finance
There is a range of financial support from the government that you can access while you are unable to return due to coronavirus restrictions.
If you’re in Poland, and have exhausted all other options to cover essential living costs while you wait to return home, you could apply for an emergency loan for your living costs from the UK government. You can only apply if you normally live in the UK and you cannot return home. This last-resort option is for those most in need, and you would need to repay the loan when you are back in the UK. Apply for an emergency loan.

If you need urgent consular assistance, contact your nearest British embassy, high commission or consulate. All telephone numbers are available 24/7.
