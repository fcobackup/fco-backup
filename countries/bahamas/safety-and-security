Local travel
Travel within the islands of The Bahamas is normally undertaken by commercial flight or ferry, but many charter options are also available. Some smaller airlines have mixed safety records; only travel with reputable companies. A list of reputable companies are available on The Bahamas tourism website.
Travel can be disrupted at short notice due to changeable weather – ensure you have sufficient insurance before you travel.
Crime
There have been incidents of violent crime including robbery, which is often armed and sometimes fatal, in residential and tourist areas of New Providence and Grand Bahama. The number of break-ins and robbery incidents reported to the British High Commission has increased. There are police patrols in the main tourist areas.
Be vigilant at all times and don’t walk alone away from the main hotels, tourist areas, beaches and downtown Nassau, particularly after dark. Take care if travelling on local bus services after dusk on routes away from the main tourist areas. Don’t carry large amounts of cash or jewellery. Robbers may be armed. Don’t resist in the event of an attempted robbery. If you need the police in an emergency, call 911 or 919.
The outlying islands of The Bahamas (known as the Family or Out Islands) have lower crime rates, however the risk of crime typically increases during regattas and festivals.
Excursions and activities
Before booking any excursion or activity make sure that health and safety precautions are evident and that the operator has adequate insurance cover.
The water sports industry in The Bahamas is poorly regulated. Be careful when renting jet skis and other water sports equipment as many companies and individuals offering water sports activities are unregistered. People have been killed or seriously injured using jet skis and other watercraft carelessly, or by the reckless behaviour of others. There have been reports of sexual assaults on foreign nationals by jet ski operators in Nassau.
There have reports that some organisers of day excursions are using bait to attract marine life, including sharks, leading to increased shark attacks in the immediate vicinity. Some have proven fatal. Never swim in water where the water has been baited.
Regattas and Festivals
Regattas and festivals are common across all islands in The Bahamas; they do see an increase in street crime including risk of sexual assaults and robbery, though most tourists participate safely and securely. You should take sensible precautions and be vigilant of your surroundings at all times. Avoid displaying jewellery or items that may attract criminals. Do not leave your drinks unattended, practice caution at crowded events and have a clear plan to return home safely after attending any events. Overnight visitors should also make sensible extra checks when booking properties, such as asking about local security provision and surrounding street lighting. The local tourist office or police station are also good sources of local advice.
Water safety
Fatal shark attacks do occur in The Bahamas. While this is not a common occurrence, the Bahamian authorities issued advice urging the public to exercise extreme caution in and around the waters of New Providence, adjacent islands and cays. Several incidences have been reported of non-fatal attacks occurring within wider Bahamian waters where tour operators have shark encounters, fish cleaning, and snorkelling activities in close proximity. Fatal shark attacks can happen without warning; avoid swimming from dusk until dawn even in shallow waters.
Road travel
You can drive in The Bahamas with a valid UK driving licence for up to 3 months. If you’re staying longer or living in The Bahamas, you’ll need to get a Bahamian driving licence.
Although traffic drives on the left-hand side of the road, most vehicles are imported from the United States and are left hand drive.
Drink driving is illegal, but this law is not always enforced – you may experience an increased risk of accident in the evening and on rural roads.
Consular assistance
There is no permanent consular representation at the British High Commission in Nassau. However, the British High Commission in Kingston, Jamaica, can provide consular support to British nationals. In the event of a genuine consular emergency in the Bahamas, telephone +1 242 225 6033 (select ‘2’) or +1 876 936 0700. This number should not be used for passport or visa queries.
