The information on this page covers the most common types of travel and reflects the UK government’s understanding of the rules currently in place. Unless otherwise stated, this information is for travellers using a full ‘British Citizen’ passport.
The authorities in the country or territory you’re travelling to are responsible for setting and enforcing the rules for entry. If you’re unclear about any aspect of the entry requirements, or you need further reassurance, you should contact the embassy, high commission or consulate of the country or territory you’re travelling to.
You should also consider checking with your transport provider or travel company to make sure your passport and other travel documents meet their requirements.
Visas
You can obtain a free 90-day visa-waiver on arrival in Qatar. If you hold one of the other types of British passport, you must get a visa before you travel.
Passport validity
Your passport should be valid for a minimum period of 6 months from the date of entry into Qatar.
UK Emergency Travel Documents
UK Emergency Travel Documents (ETDs) are not valid for entry into Qatar. However, ETDs are accepted for airside transit and exit from Qatar.
Living and working in Qatar
Under Qatar sponsorship laws, an employee wishing to change from one sponsor to another must get a No Objection Certificate (NOC). A sponsor is not obliged to give an NOC to an employee. Without an NOC, an employee must leave Qatar at the end of their employment, and may not return to work in Qatar for 2 years.
If you are applying for a residence permit, you will have to undergo a medical test including blood tests and a chest X-ray. The tests screen for diseases including, but not restricted to, HIV/AIDS, Tuberculosis, Hepatitis B and C. Testing positive may lead to further tests and possible deportation.
Medication
Some prescribed and over the counter medicines that are available in the UK may be considered controlled substances in Qatar. If you need to bring in controlled/prescription medication into Qatar, make sure you carry it in its original packaging, accompanied by your prescription and an official letter signed and stamped by your doctor stating the type of medication and why it’s required.
For further information you can check our foreign travel checklist contact the Embassy of Qatar or the Qatar Ministry of Public Health.
