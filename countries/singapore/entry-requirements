This page has information on travelling to Singapore. Check what you must do to return to the UK.
This page reflects the UK government’s understanding of current rules for people travelling on a full ‘British Citizen’ passport from the UK, for the most common types of travel.
The authorities in Singapore set and enforce entry rules.
All travellers
In general, British citizens do not need a visa to transit or enter Singapore. It’s up to Immigration and Checkpoints Authority to decide who can enter Singapore.
All arrivals in Singapore must complete an electronic SG Arrival Card up to three days before entry into Singapore. This online form requires travel details and a health declaration. It is illegal to submit a false declaration.
If you’re arriving from certain countries in Africa and Latin America, you may need to show a yellow fever certificate to enter Singapore.
There are other measures in place for foreign crew working on ships, small vessels, or pleasure crafts at one of Singapore’s marinas. See guidelines for air/sea crew and pleasure craft owners. Check with your employer or agent for any specific COVID-19 rules at the marina.
Singapore has strict rules on:
wearing masks on public transport and in healthcare settings
being fully vaccinated to dine out, attend an event with over 500 people and enter some nightlife venues
testing, self-isolation and quarantine, whenever these are required
If you test positive for COVID-19 you are required to defer your travel to Singapore until at least 72 hours after you test negative, or, for those who continue to test positive, for at least 7 days for vaccinated people and at least 14 days for unvaccinated people.
Breaking these rules can lead to a lengthy investigation, fines, or a prison sentence. See Coronavirus section.
If you’re fully vaccinated
To enter Singapore you must be fully vaccinated and have digital or physical copies of your vaccination status. If you are not vaccinated, see the entry requirements for unvaccinated people below.
Children aged 12 years and under who are unvaccinated but travelling with fully-vaccinated parents or guardians can enter Singapore. This includes children turning 12 years old in 2022.
If you’re fully vaccinated and you’ve recovered from COVID-19 in the past three months, you may be exempt from taking COVID-19 tests.
See the ICA website for complete information.
What happens if you test positive for COVID-19
You’ll need to self-isolate at the hotel or home you’re staying in. What happens next will depend on whether you’re well or unwell. See Ask MOH. Breaking self-isolation or quarantine orders is an offence. See Coronavirus section.
Proof of vaccination status
You must show proof that you have been fully vaccinated to enter Singapore.
Singapore will accept the UK’s proof of COVID-19 vaccination record. Your NHS appointment card from vaccination centres is not designed to be used as proof of vaccination and should not be used to demonstrate your vaccine status.
If you’re on a short-term pass in Singapore, you are asked to download the TraceTogether app or buy a TraceTogether token to scan in and out of public venues.
If you’re not fully vaccinated
Until 29 August if you are not fully vaccinated you cannot enter Singapore unless you are a Singapore Citizen or Permanent Resident. From 29 August unvaccinated people will be able to enter Singapore for short-term visits but must show a negative pre-departure COVID-19 test result that was conducted or supervised by healthcare professionals, and that was completed within two days before travel. COVID-19 travel insurance of a minimum cover of S$30,000 is also compulsory and proof of insurance must be shown. For details, visit the ICA website.
Children and young people
Children born on or after 1 January 2010 (i.e. aged 12 and below by year of birth) are exempted from COVID-19 border measures. See Singapore’s ICA website for full guidelines.
If you’re transiting through Singapore
Transiting is when you pass through one country on the way to your final destination.
Check with your airline if it has approval to transit through Singapore.
Passengers transiting Changi Airport for less than 24 hours and not entering Singapore are not required to have proof of vaccination or tests, and are also not required to complete any entry approval measures.
You do not need a visa for an airside transit in Singapore.
More information about transiting through Singapore can be found on the Transiting through Singapore page of the ICA website.
Arriving by car
If you are arriving in a car that is not registered in Singapore, visit the OneMotoring website to apply for a Vehicle Entry Permit.
Check your passport and travel documents before you travel
Passports
If you’re visiting Singapore, your passport should be valid for six months from the date you arrive.
If you’re a resident in Singapore there’s no minimum validity required, but you should apply for a replacement before your passport expires.
Check with your travel provider to make sure your passport and other travel documents meet their requirements.
UK Emergency Travel Documents
UK Emergency Travel Documents (ETDs) are accepted for entry, airside transit, and exit from Singapore. Your ETD should be valid for at least 6 months. You don’t need a visa on your ETD when entering or transiting Singapore.
Items banned for import into Singapore
It’s a criminal offence to import controlled drugs into Singapore. If convicted, you could be imprisoned, caned or executed.
These items are also considered prohibited – you cannot bring them into Singapore:
vaporisers and e-cigarette products, and tobacco products that involve chewing, inhaling and injecting
chewing gum - unless you have an exemption from the Health Sciences Authority for medical reasons
weapons and ammunition (including empty cartridge cases and air guns)
replica guns, including lighters shaped like a pistol or revolver
radio communications equipment
See this complete list of prohibited items. Check the Singapore Customs website for full guidelines.
