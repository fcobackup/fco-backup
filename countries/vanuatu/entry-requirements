This page reflects the UK government’s understanding of current rules for people travelling on a full ‘British Citizen’ passport, for the most common types of travel.
The authorities in Vanuatu set and enforce entry rules. For further information contact the embassy, high commission or consulate of the country or territory you’re travelling to. You should also consider checking with your transport provider or travel company to make sure your passport and other travel documents meet their requirements.
Entry rules in response to coronavirus (COVID-19)
Entry to Vanuatu
Borders are closed to non-residents. Air Vanuatu run occasional scheduled repatriation flights from Auckland, Brisbane and Noumea for Vanuatu citizens and permanent residents. Places on these flights need to be pre-approved by the Vanuatu authorities. Eligible travellers from countries apart from Australia, New Zealand, New Caledonia and Fiji must quarantine at a government-approved location at their own expense for 7 days and are required to return a negative rapid antigen test (RAT) result on Day 6 of their quarantine stay before they may be released. Travellers from Australia, New Zealand, New Caledonia and Fiji are required to quarantine for 3 days, with a rapid antigen test (RAT) on Day 3 of quarantine. Travellers from any country who record a positive RAT result are required to spend a further seven days in quarantine.
The Government of Vanuatu has also issued specific instructions to crew on aircraft and foreign going sea vessels. Given the fast moving situation, you should familiarise yourself with controls in place and to check with your airline before you travel.

Most passengers departing Vanuatu for the UK will need to transit Australia or New Zealand. For measures in place for travel and transit via Australia, see the Travel Advice pages for Australia.
For information on entry and transit requirements for New Zealand, see the Travel Advice pages for New Zealand. More information is also available from Immigration New Zealand.
