This page has information on travelling to Malawi.
This page reflects the UK government’s understanding of current rules for people travelling on a full ‘British Citizen’ passport from the UK, for the most common types of travel.
The authorities in Malawi set and enforce entry rules. If you’re unsure how Malawi’s entry requirements apply to you, contact its UK embassy, high commission or consulate.
All travellers
You need a visa to enter Malawi as a visitor. See Visas for more information.
Lifting of mandatory COVID-19 requirements
With effect from 5 June 2023, The Presidential Task Force have confirmed that a COVID-19 vaccination certificate or a negative COVID-19 PCR test result will no longer be a mandatory requirement for entry/exit into and out of Malawi for all travellers.
All outgoing travellers will be responsible for checking and complying with entry requirements in the countries of their destination and or transit.
Passport validity
Your passport should be valid for minimum period of 6 months on arrival in Malawi.
Visas
British passport holders need a tourist or business visa to enter Malawi. Malawi has introduced an ‘e-visas’ system through which applications can be submitted and approved online in advance of travel. You can find details of the application process on the Malawi High Commission website. The Malawi authorities strongly advise you to get a visa before travel. If you can’t get a visa before travel, you may be able to get a single entry tourist or business visa on arrival at main ports of entry to Malawi, subject to the fulfilment of all immigration requirements. You should check with the Malawi High Commission in London for more information.
