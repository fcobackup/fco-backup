Local measures
Chilean President Sebastian Piñera announced a 90-day ‘National State of Catastrophe’ on Wednesday 18 March 2020.
Measures announced on Sunday 22 March include a nationwide curfew between the hours of 2200 and 0500, a quarantine around the town of Puerto Williams, ‘sanitary cordon’ around the town of Chillan and tightening of sanitary regulations for the whole of Chiloe Island. A further quarantine was announced around Easter Island on 23 March.
On March 25, the government of Chile announced a 7-day quarantine beginning at 2200 hrs on Thursday, March 26. This will affect the Santiago neighborhoods (comunas) of Santiago Centro, Independencia, Providencia, Ñuñoa, Las Condes, Vitacura, and Lo Barnechea. People will be allowed to leave their residences only under certain circumstances, including for medical reasons, basic services, public services. We have been assured that British Nationals can travel to the airport as long as they have their passport and boarding pass. If you need to leave your residence for other reasons, food supplies or medical reasons, you can apply on line to the Comisaria Virtual. Foreigners may use their passport number to access the system. The pages are only in Spanish.
Given that these restrictions cover tourist areas, we recommend that travellers avoid staying in those areas. The airport is not covered by the new restrictions.
Checkpoints for health inspections will be placed at all principal points of entry and exit to the city of Santiago. In addition to checking the health of persons entering and leaving the city, these checkpoints will be used to confirm that specific individuals who have been ordered to quarantine by medical authorities are not violating their quarantine.
