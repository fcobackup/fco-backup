This travel advice covers Israel and the Occupied Palestinian Territories
The FCDO advises against all travel to:
Gaza
the Sheba’a Farms and Ghajjar
within 500m of the border with Lebanon (the ‘Blue Line’) east of Metula, including the northern edge of the town and and within 500m of the border with Syria (the ‘Alpha Line’).
The FCDO advises against all but essential travel to:
areas north of and including Jenin city, Burqin and Arranah in the north of the West Bank. This includes Jenin refugee camp and all areas north of this until the Jalamah checkpoint for access to Israel
the city of Nablus, Joseph’s Tomb, and the Balata and New Askar refugee camps near Nablus
Before you travel, check the ‘Entry requirements’ section for Israel’s current entry restrictions and requirements. These may change with little warning. Monitor this advice for the latest updates and stay in contact with your travel provider.
If you plan to pass through another country to return to the UK, check the travel advice for the country you’re transiting.
It is more important than ever to get travel insurance and check it provides sufficient cover. See the FCDO’s guidance on foreign travel insurance.
Make sure you are aware of Israeli immigration policies before you travel. Allow extra time for increased security measures and checks at airports during Israeli holidays and during the summer tourist season. See Entry requirements.
The security situation in Israel and the Occupied Palestinian Territories can be fast moving, tense and unpredictable. You should be vigilant at all times and keep up to date with local media and travel reports.
Terrorists are very likely to try to carry out attacks in Israel and the Occupied Palestinian Territories. Attacks could be indiscriminate, including places visited by foreigners including the Old City in Jerusalem, on public transport, and in busy public spaces. See Terrorism
There have been repeated instances of rocket fire from Gaza, which may occur well beyond the Gaza border area; Israel has often responded with air strikes into Gaza. Make sure you know the safety actions that you should take if an Israeli warning siren sounds, follow advice from local authorities and stay informed of the security situation through the media and this travel advice. No warning sirens will sound inside Gaza. See Gaza
You should also exercise extreme caution when considering visiting Palestinian refugee camps which have previously been the site of violent clashes (we advise against all but essential travel to the camps in Jenin and Nablus).
In Israel and the West Bank, there is a risk of violent incidents, including stabbings, shootings, arson, vehicle rammings and stone throwing attacks on people and vehicles. These incidents have involved protestors (both Israelis and Palestinians), Israeli security forces, and civilians (including Israeli settlers). There is a risk that tourists or bystanders could be caught up in any of these types of incident. You should check the local news before travelling to see if there have been recent clashes, be vigilant, avoid any large gatherings or demonstrations, avoid areas which have been the site of recent violence and follow the instructions of the local authorities. If you are in a location where an Israeli security operation or armed clashes are ongoing, you should stay inside and wait for the local authorities to confirm that the situation is calm before moving to a different location.
Incidents have previously occurred in Tel Aviv, Be’er Sheva, Hadera, Jerusalem and the Old City (particularly at and around Damascus Gate, Herod’s gate, Lion’s Gate and the Chain Gate), Nablus, Jenin, Hebron, at Israeli checkpoints, near settlement outposts, and around Palestinian refugee camps. You should exercise particular caution when considering visiting Hebron or Palestinian refugee camps which have previously been the site of violent clashes (we advise against all but essential travel to the camps in Jenin and Nablus) settlements and settlement outposts which have been the site of recent violent incidents (e.g near Beit El, Homesh, Shilo, Evyatar, etc) and avoid such locations after dark. You should check the local news before travelling to these areas to see if there have been recent clashes and avoid areas which have been the site of recent violence.
These incidents have also occurred along Route 60 (especially junctions near Nablus), Route 443 and other West Bank arterial roads used by both Palestinians and Israelis. You should exercise extreme caution on these routes, particularly at night, and turn around if you see any signs of a disturbance.
There is a risk of increased tension around Jewish high holidays (Passover, Rosh Hashana, Yom Kippur and Succoth), during Ramadan, in particular Laylat Al Qadr (dates vary), Thursday evenings, after Friday prayers, Saturday evenings and on other religious holidays and anniversaries. This is heightened when different religious or national holidays overlap. Independence Day (14 May, Hebrew calendar dates vary), Jerusalem Day (date varies), Land Day (30 March) and Nakba Day (15 May) may be tense. Demonstrations and other forms of civil unrest can occur at short notice and often turn violent. You should exercise extreme caution: follow local media and this travel advice and avoid any demonstrations or large gatherings. See Safety and security
There are significant tensions between Israel, and the Assad regime and Iranian military forces in Syria. The situation remains fragile, with attempted and actual military exchanges either side of the border. If travelling in the area remain vigilant, follow advice from local authorities and stay informed of the security situation through the media and this travel advice.
There are also continued tensions between Israel and Lebanon. The situation on the ground could change quickly. See Border with Lebanon
If you’re abroad and you need emergency help from the UK government, contact the nearest British embassy, consulate or high commission. Consular support is severely limited in parts of the Occupied Palestinian Territories and Occupied Golan Heights where the FCDO has existing advice against all travel (see above).
The Overseas Business Risk service offers information and advice for British companies operating overseas on how to manage political, economic, and business security-related risks.
