Cases of coronavirus (COVID-19) have been reported in Oman. The authorities have introduced a number of measures to limit the spread of the virus.
International flights stopped at 12:00 local time on Sunday 29 March.
The Omani government announced that from 18 March, the following places would be closed across Oman: mosques and other places of worship; events and conferences; all tourist sites (including wadis and picnic areas); all shops in shopping malls (except supermarkets, clinics, pharmacies and opticians); souqs and other traditional markets; restaurants and cafes (including in hotels) except for takeaway/delivery; gyms, spas and hairdressers. The government has stated that no public gatherings, including on beaches, should take place.
You should comply with any additional screening measures put in place by the local authorities. If you have any questions about these measures or the quarantine instructions, you can call the Ministry of Health in Oman on +968 2444 1999. Failure to follow the instructions of the local authorities could result in prosecution.
Restrictions on road travel within Oman, including police checkpoints, might be introduced at short notice. You should monitor local news sources or official social media accounts (including the Oman VS COVID19 twitter account) for the latest information. Always follow the instructions of the local authorities.
