This page gives you guidance on how to stay safely in Uzbekistan as a visitor, if you are unable to return to the UK.
Everyone should comply with the measures put in place in Uzbekistan to limit the spread of coronavirus (COVID-19).
Up-to-date statistics on coronavirus cases in Uzbekistan are available from a dedicated Uzbekistan Government website - coronavirus.uz (in Uzbek and Russian only).
Moving around in Uzbekistan
Under measures introduced by the Uzbek authorities, anyone subject to quarantine or self-isolation who breaches such controls is liable to a minimum fine of 11 Million UZS (approximately £900) or up to 10 years imprisonment.
From 23 March, you must wear a facemask while outside – you may be fined (up to approximately £100) if you do not comply with this regulation.
Further restrictive measures introduced by the Uzbekistan authorities include:
prohibiting entry and exit from Tashkent by any mode of transport, with the exception of goods transportation and foreign nationals wishing to depart Uzbekistan (other cities, including Samarkand, are subject to similar restrictions)
closure of restaurants, cafes, bars, fitness centres, entertainment venues, shopping malls and non-essential shops (supermarkets excluded)
ban on holding of public events and some private events, including weddings and other family celebrations
all public transport is suspended
all domestic flights are suspended
severe penalties (fine, community service and prison terms) for people found to be spreading false information about coronavirus.
Restrictions on use of personal vehicles were relaxed slightly with effect from 30 April. Personal vehicles can now be used between 7am and 10am, and between 5pm and 8pm, to travel to and from workplaces, to visit hospitals and to buy medicines. British nationals should continue to follow social distancing practices, and not travel in a car with more than 2 people.
These measures may be subject to change. Entry requirements may vary and further restrictions could be applied at short notice by the Uzbek authorities. See Entry requirements.
