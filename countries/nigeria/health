Warning
FCDO advises against all travel to parts of Nigeria.

Before you travel check that:
your destination can provide the healthcare you may need
you have appropriate travel insurance for local treatment or unexpected medical evacuation
This is particularly important if you have a health condition or are pregnant.
Emergency medical number
Call 112 to report an emergency.
There is no national ambulance service and hospital-owned services are extremely limited. You may need to get local advice or arrange local transport.
Contact your insurance company promptly if you’re referred to a medical facility for treatment.
Vaccinations and health risks
At least 8 weeks before your trip check:
the latest information on vaccinations and health risks in TravelHealthPro’s Nigeria guide
where to get vaccines and whether you have to pay on the NHS travel vaccinations page
There are ongoing outbreaks of diphtheria in Nigeria in 2023. You can find more information from TravelHealthPro.
Medication
Pharmacies are widely available in Nigeria. They will accept prescriptions from the UK.
Most medicines that require a prescription from a doctor in the UK will require one in Nigeria. If possible, bring a prescription from your GP for a local doctor to copy.
Read best practice when travelling with medicines on TravelHealthPro.
The NHS has information on whether you can take your medicine abroad.
Healthcare facilities in Nigeria
FCDO has a list of doctors in Nigeria. 
Medical standards differ from the UK and you will have to pay for any medical treatment that you receive at public hospitals. Private hospitals are more expensive. Local hospitals may be crowded and there can be shortages in medical supplies and equipment.
