This page has information on travelling to Japan. Check what you must do to return to the UK.
This page reflects the UK government’s understanding of current rules for people travelling on a full ‘British Citizen’ passport from the UK, for the most common types of travel.
The authorities in Japan set and enforce entry rules.
All travellers
The Japanese Ministry of Health, Labour and Welfare, and Ministry of Foreign Affairs websites have further details on the entry requirements for all travellers to Japan (including on ‘Fast Track’ procedures). Rules may be subject to change at short notice.
Foreign nationals (including British nationals) with Status of Residence who have a valid re-entry permit, are in principle allowed to re-enter the country. If you do not have these you may apply for a visa to enter Japan for business, study or purposes other than tourism. You should note that the visa waiver system has been suspended and all travellers must have a valid visa or re-entry permit Bookings on some flight routes have been restricted or suspended. Flight length and routing may also be impacted by the current situation in Ukraine.
Bookings on some flight routes have been restricted or suspended. Flight length and routing may also be impacted by the current situation in Ukraine.
From 10 June, tourists will be allowed to enter from the UK and other ‘blue list’ countries (see below) provided they are sponsored and registered on the Entrants, Returnees Follow-up System (ERFS) by an approved Japanese travel agency.
As part of travelling to Japan, you must:
Take an approved COVID-19 test within 72 hours before your flight departure time, and obtain proof of a negative result in an approved format
(Before disembarkation) Sign a written pledge that commits you to abiding by the quarantine and self-isolation rules and to a number of other requirements.
(Before disembarkation) Complete an online health questionnaire and obtain a QR code
Some airlines may require these documents to be shown before boarding as part of their internal rules.
At immigration, you will be asked to submit the above documentation to take another COVID-19 test (and await the results at the airport), and to install a COVID-19 tracing app on your smartphone. From 1 June, Japan will introduce a red, yellow and blue ‘traffic light’ system and the test on arrival will no longer be required for travellers on the ‘blue list’. Travellers from the UK will be on the blue list.
Quarantine and other requirements may vary. Further details can be found in the section on vaccination status below, in the Ministry of Health, Labour and Welfare Q&A and on the Ministry of Foreign Affairs website. Until 31 May, arrivals from the UK who are not triple-vaccinated must self-isolate. From 1 June, travellers from the UK will not be required to self-isolate, regardless of vaccination status.
Failure to comply with the regulations could lead to detention under the Quarantine Act, the publication of your name and information related to reducing the spread of infection, and possible revocation of your Status of Residence or deportation.
Due to the COVID-19 pandemic Japan has suspended its visa waiver system and all British Citizen and British National (Overseas) passport holders must apply to the Japanese Consulate-General for a visa in advance. The visa application process must be initiated by the sponsor in Japan using the ERFS online system. Anyone arriving in the country without a valid visa will not be able to enter.
It is illegal to work in Japan without the correct visa, however informal or temporary the work. You shouldn’t overstay your permission to remain in the country, as you risk arrest, detention and a heavy fine.
If you’re fully vaccinated
If you can prove you have received two doses of AstraZeneca, Pfizer or Moderna vaccines (or one of Johnson & Johnson) and an additional booster shot from Pfizer or Moderna , then you will be considered fully vaccinated and are exempt from quarantine and self-isolation. AstraZeneca is not accepted as a valid booster. If you are identified as a close contact of someone who tests positive on arrival, you will be required to quarantine or self-isolate for 7 days.
From 1 June, you will not be required either to take a test on arrival or to self-isolate.
Proof of vaccination status
You can use the UK COVID Pass to demonstrate your vaccination record to the Japanese authorities. Your NHS appointment card from vaccination centres is not designed to be used as proof of vaccination and should not be used to demonstrate your vaccination status.
If you’re not fully vaccinated
If you’re not fully vaccinated, travellers who arrive from the UK before 31 May will be required to spend 3 full days after the day of arrival in self-isolation in your place of residence or accommodation. You will need to take a COVID-19 test on Day 3 (the day of arrival counts as Day 0). If the test is negative, you will be permitted to end self-isolation.
Alternatively, if you do not wish to take a Day 3 COVID-19 test, you may opt to spend 7 full days in self-isolation.
You must have received two doses of the vaccine (or one of Johnson & Johnson) plus a booster shot of an approved vaccine in order to be considered fully vaccinated. See ‘if you’re fully vaccinated’ for further detail.
From 1 June, travellers arriving from the UK will not be required to self-isolate, regardless of vaccination status.
If you’ve had COVID-19 in the past year
Proof of prior infection does not afford exemptions. You must follow the rules and regulations outlined above.
Children and young people
Minors are not exempt from the testing requirements on age grounds. There may be some flexibility on pre-flight testing requirements for children aged 5 and under, but this cannot be guaranteed. All travellers must take the test on arrival in Japan.
For children under 18, provided they are accompanied by a fully-vaccinated parent (who has received their booster shot) who supervises their activities, they may follow the same rules as their parent even if the child is not fully-vaccinated.
If you’re transiting through Japan
Transiting is when you pass through one country on the way to your final destination.
The COVID-19 regulations and requirements outlined above do not apply to passengers who are transiting through one Japanese airport and do not go through immigration. However, transit may be precluded by airport closures, movement between terminals and delays between arriving and departing flights. Check with your airline whether your connection is feasible before boarding a flight to Japan.
When transiting through Japan, you should comply with any additional screening measures put in place by the authorities. You should also check the latest entry requirements for your final destination.
Exemptions
You should contact your nearest Japanese Embassy for more information on exemptions.
Check your passport and travel documents before you travel
If you are visiting Japan, your passport should be valid for the duration of your stay. No additional period of validity beyond this is required.
UK Emergency Travel Documents are accepted for entry, airside transit and exit from Japan.
Check with your travel provider to make sure your passport and other travel documents meet their requirements.
Medication
The use or possession of some common prescription and over-the-counter medicines is banned under Japan’s strictly enforced anti-stimulant drugs law. This includes Vicks inhalers, medicines for allergies and sinus problems, cold and flu medication containing Pseudoephedrine and even some over-the-counter painkillers like those containing codeine. Foreign nationals have been detained and deported for offences. You should check the status of your medication with the nearest Japanese Embassy or Consulate before you travel.
If you are travelling with prescription medication that is permitted under Japanese law, you are normally allowed to bring in up to one month’s supply. You are advised to bring a copy of your prescription and a letter from your doctor stating the medical condition that the medication has been prescribed to treat. For more guidance on travelling with medication, check information pages from NHS Choices and the National Travel Health Network and Centre (NaTHNaC) in our foreign travel checklist.
If you need prescription medicine for long-term use, you may need to provide extra paperwork, such as an import licence. The Japanese Ministry of Health, Labour and Welfare website provides information about bringing medication for personal use.
