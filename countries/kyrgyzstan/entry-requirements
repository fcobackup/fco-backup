The information on this page covers the most common types of travel and reflects the UK government’s understanding of the rules currently in place. Unless otherwise stated, this information is for travellers using a full ‘British Citizen’ passport.
The authorities in the country or territory you’re travelling to are responsible for setting and enforcing the rules for entry. If you’re unclear about any aspect of the entry requirements, or you need further reassurance, you’ll need to contact the embassy, high commission or consulate of the country or territory you’re travelling to.
You should also consider checking with your transport provider or travel company to make sure your passport and other travel documents meet their requirements.
Restrictions in response to coronavirus
Entry to Kyrgyzstan
British Passport holders are able to enter Kyrgyzstan. A negative PCR test from no more than 72 hours before your arrival by air, or 120 hours by land, is now required for foreign citizens to enter Kyrgyzstan. If your journey is delayed and your results are outside the 72 hour period you will need to have a further PCR test on arrival. Requirements could change at short notice. Check with your airline before travel. For any questions on entry or exit requirements you should contact the relevant Kyrgyz authorities on +996 312 881 618.
You should not use the NHS testing service to get a test in order to facilitate your travel to another country. You should arrange to take a private test.
Passengers will have their temperature tested on arrival. However if you are showing symptoms of Coronavirus you may be taken to state medical facilities. You are likely to be subject to temperature checks, and other medical observation on arrival, and could be asked to self-isolate at home. You may also be asked to download a smartphone application at the airport.
For any questions on visa and registration requirements, you can contact the Kyrgyz visa service for information on your individual circumstances at e-visa@mfa.gov.kg or +996 312 66 30 70 and +996 702 42 88 65 (WhatsApp).
There is no registration requirement for British nationals entering Kyrgyzstan under the visa free regime intending to stay less than 60 days. Foreign citizens can currently stay in Kyrgyzstan indefinitely without a visa, even if registration has expired.
Visas
The Kyrgyz government has announced that foreign citizens and stateless persons can currently stay in Kyrgyzstan indefinitely without a visa, even if registration has expired. If you need to extend your period of stay on the basis of obtaining a visa (work permit, family ties, or other grounds) the visa centre is willing to consider the possibility of obtaining visas without leaving the Kyrgyz republic.
Under the current circumstances visa processing is likely to face significant delays. If you are outside Kyrgyzstan and have an application waiting for consideration please email the Kyrgyz Visa Centre at e-visa@mfa.gov.kg.
If you need further information about entry requirements or visa issues, visit the MFA visa website or contact the local immigration authorities.
Although visa centre offices are closed to the public, you can contact the Kyrgyz visa service at e-visa@mfa.gov.kg or +996 312 66 30 70 and +996 702 42 88 65 (WhatsApp), the phone line is open on weekends and during public holidays during the current emergency situation.
For the latest information on new measures introduced by the Kyrgyz government, see the Kyrgyz government official website, and the Coronavirus response team telegram channel (Russian and Kyrgyz only).
You should also be aware that neighbouring Kazakhstan has now introduced visa requirements for foreign nationals. See more information on the Kazakhstan Travel Advice Page
Regular entry requirements
Passport validity
Your passport should be valid for a minimum period of 6 months from the date of entry into Kyrgyzstan and must have at least 1 full blank page if you’re applying for a visa. This rule is not applicable when entering Kyrgyzstan under the 60 day visa-free regime.
UK Emergency Travel Documents
UK Emergency Travel Documents are accepted for entry, airside transit and exit from Kyrgyzstan. If using one to leave Kyrgyzstan, you must obtain an exit visa from OVIR (the Department for Visa and Registration under the Ministry of Internal Affairs). This takes at least 5 working days.
Yellow fever certificate requirements
Check whether you need a yellow fever certificate by visiting the National Travel Health Network and Centre’s TravelHealthPro website.
Registration
On 19 December 2016, the government of Kyrgyzstan approved a decree removing the requirement for British nationals staying in Kyrgyzstan for longer than 5 days to register with the local authorities. You now only need to register your stay with the State Registration Service if you’re visiting for more than 60 calendar days. If you’re staying for more than 60 calendar days you must register within 5 days of entry into Kyrgyzstan and you must register for the period of validity of your visa.
In April 2019, Kyrgyzstan simplified the process of registration for foreigners. Foreigners can now register through the electronic services portal (available in Russian and Kyrgyz only) instead of at the counter at the State Registration Service office. Under the new amendments, foreign citizens can act as a host and register visitors staying in their homes. The registration coupon with QR-code on the forms can be obtained online and printed on a regular printer. Mobile applications will be developed for reading the information.
