Travel in South Africa
Travel to and from the airports or other ports of arrival is restricted at this time. If you have a repatriation flight booked, linked to an Embassy or High Commission, you will generally not be allowed to go straight to the airport, and will be expected to meet at a pre-determined ‘assembly point’. The flight organisers are responsible for providing instructions for where to meet.
Only essential travel is permitted between provinces.
Some internal flights are operating, although air travel for recreational, leisure or tourism purposes is prohibited. You will need to obtain a permit from the South African authorities to be allowed to travel on internal flights. In this case, you can travel straight to the airport, but parking at the airport is not permitted.
You must wear a mask if using public transport, which will operate with strict hygiene requirements and reduced passenger numbers.
Everyone is required to wear a cloth face mask when in public.
Failure to comply with South African government regulations could result in a fine or arrest.
Accommodation
Hotels and guest houses are allowed to open subject to government regulations. Private rental accommodation is not permitted. You should contact your accommodation provide for more information.
Public spaces and services
The South African authorities have published COVID-19 guidelines and advice and have introduced a number of measures to limit the spread of the virus. Failure to comply could result in a fine or arrest.
South Africa have introduced a risk based, five-level approach to lockdown restrictions. On 1 June, South Africa moved to level 3 (from level 4).
The level of restriction in place may differ by province and district. You should follow advice from the local authorities about what restrictions apply where you are.
The South African government has implemented a countrywide curfew between 9pm to 4am. Everyone must wear a cloth face mask when in public.
Walking, running and cycling are permitted between 6am and 6pm, but not in groups. Beaches remain closed to the public; however, the promenades are open for exercise purposes. There are strict rules regarding gatherings of people.
You should comply with any regulations set out by the South African government during the lockdown. See details on guidelines and relief.
Healthcare in South Africa
If you take regular medication, make sure you know how you can access a repeat prescription during the lockdown. Pharmacies are an essential service, and will generally be open, although temporary (2-3 day) closures are possible if a customer or staff member tests positive for COVID-19. Most medicines that require a prescription from a doctor in the UK will require one in South Africa. If necessary, you should obtain an electronic prescription from your medical practitioner to enable a local doctor to write one. Ask your insurer, or your accommodation provider to help you find one.
Private hospitals in South Africa are prepared to treat COVID-19, and the standard of care may be higher than in government hospitals. Our experience suggests that only people who are showing symptoms of COVID-19 are able to get a test, at both private and public healthcare facilities.

If you think you have COVID-19 symptoms, you should contact your health insurer for advice, and can call the South African government local emergency hotline (0800029 999) or consult the online advice.
