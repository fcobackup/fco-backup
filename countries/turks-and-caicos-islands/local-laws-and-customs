The Turks and Caicos Islands is a separate legal jurisdiction to the United Kingdom and has its own laws.
Don’t become involved with drugs of any kind. There are severe penalties for possession of even a small quantity. Importation of Firearms, Ammunition, and other weapons are strictly prohibited and penalties can include a minimum custodial sentence of twelve (12) years. Declaring a weapon in your luggage with an airline carrier does not grant permission to bring the weapon into the Turks and Caicos Islands. Check the Firearms Ordinance for more information.
Homosexuality is legal under Turks and Caicos Islands’ law. However, there’s no provision for marriage or civil partnerships between same-sex couples. Attitudes in the main tourist destination of Providenciales are tolerant. Throughout Turks and Caicos, hotels and resorts are generally welcoming regardless of sexual orientation. Outside the tourist areas local attitudes can be conservative and some people may not approve of public displays of affection between same-sex couples. See our information and advice page for the LGBT community before you travel.
