Entry and borders
Norwegian borders have been partially closed since Monday 16 March. Non-residents are not allowed to enter the country. The website of the Norwegian Ministry of Foreign Affairs has details of the limited number of exemptions to these restrictions.
Non-residents are still able to transit via Norwegian airports as long as the final destination is not within Norway, but please check with your airline before departing.
All British nationals legally resident in Norway will be allowed to enter the country, but are required to enter self-quarantine for 14 days. Exemptions for workers crossing the Swedish and Finnish borders will apply; please see the Ministry of Foreign Affairs website for the details. Those with symptoms will be isolated. You should travel with evidence of residency. For more information, contact the Norwegian Embassy in London. Detailed guidance is available on the UDI website.
Rules on how long you need to remain in quarantine have been clarified to allow those not showing symptoms to leave the country without needing to complete the full 14 days.
Visas
The Norwegian authorities have confirmed that if your visa has expired or is at risk of expiring, you will be not punished if you overstay. You are not required to notify UDI or the police, but are asked to try to leave as quickly as possible.
