A national strike has been ongoing since Monday 10 September 2018, which the organisers have described as “indefinite”. Participation so far has been limited to some unions and workers groups. There have been roadblocks in a number of locations across the country, causing significant delays and, for a short while, affecting access to the airport. The disruption caused a cruise ship to cancel a stopover in Puntarenas on the Pacific coast. Some confrontations between police and protestors have occurred, as well as instances of vandalism. You should avoid large gatherings and be aware of possible road obstructions and delays, particularly in and around cities. If travelling within the more populated areas, you should check local travel information and allow plenty of time to reach your destination.
