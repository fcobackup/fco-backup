From 1 June 2020 it became a requirement for passengers aged 13 and over to wear a non-medical face mask on trams, buses, water buses, metros and trains. Passengers who do not wear a face mask on public transport after 1 June can be fined €95. In stations, on platforms and at bus and tram stops face masks are not required, but people must stay 1.5 metres away from others.
