This page has information on travelling to Slovakia.
This page reflects the UK government’s understanding of current rules for people travelling on a full ‘British Citizen’ passport from the UK, for the most common types of travel.
The authorities in Slovakia set and enforce entry rules. If you’re unsure how Slovakia’s entry requirements apply to you, contact its UK embassy, high commission or consulate.
All travellers
All travellers should familiarise themselves with the entry rules for Slovakia before travel.
All COVID-19 related entry requirements have been lifted and there are no longer any COVID-19 related restrictions on foreigners entering the territory of the Slovak Republic. Please see the Ministry of Interior website for further information - Slovak Ministry of Interior Advice
If you’re transiting through Slovakia
There is no airside transit allowed at any Slovak airport. All passengers must go through immigration control on arrival at an airport in Slovakia.
There are no specific requirements for those transiting through Slovakia.
You should also check the entry requirements for the relevant neighbouring countries on your route on the FCDO Travel Advice pages.
Transport
Slovakia’s international airports at Bratislava, Kosice and Poprad are operational with flights to certain permitted destinations.
Border crossings
Most major routes between Slovakia and Austria, Hungary, Poland and the Czech Republic are open with spot checks at the borders.
Neighbouring countries can change their entry requirements at short notice. You should check the FCDO Travel Advice for all countries on your route.
Entry into Slovakia from Ukraine
The FCDO advises against all travel to Ukraine. British nationals in Ukraine should leave immediately if they judge it is safe to do so. You should not attempt to cross into Ukraine from Slovakia and you should abide by the instructions of the authorities at all times.
Border checks remain in place with Ukraine. For more information on entering Slovakia from Ukraine, and assistance for those arriving, see the Slovak Interior Ministry website and this Slovak government website (also in English).
The Slovak government has simplified entry requirements for people arriving under immediate threat of armed conflict. This includes the option to show other identity documents if your passport is not available. For more information, see the Slovak Ministry of Interior website.
Check your passport and travel documents before you travel
Passport validity
If you are planning to travel to an EU country (except Ireland), or Switzerland, Norway, Iceland, Liechtenstein, Andorra, Monaco, San Marino or Vatican City, you must follow the Schengen area passport requirements.
Your passport must be:
Issued less than 10 years before the date you enter the country (check the ‘date of issue’)
valid for at least 3 months after the day you plan to leave (check the ‘expiry date’)
You must check your passport meets these requirements before you travel. If your passport was issued before 1 October 2018, extra months may have been added to its expiry date.
Contact the embassy of the country you are visiting if you think that your passport does not meet both these requirements. Renew your passport if you need to.
Visas
The rules for travelling or working in European countries changed on 1 January 2021:
you can travel to countries in the Schengen area for up to 90 days in any 180-day period without a visa. This applies if you travel as a tourist, to visit family or friends, to attend business meetings, cultural or sports events, or for short-term studies or training.
if you are travelling to Slovakia and other Schengen countries without a visa, make sure your whole visit is within the 90 day limit. Visits to Schengen countries within the previous 180 days before you travel count towards your 90 days.
to stay longer, to work or study, for business travel or for other reasons, you will need to meet the Slovak government’s entry requirements. Check with the Slovak Embassy what type of visa and/or work permit you may need
if you stay in Slovakia with a residence permit or long-stay visa, this does not count towards your 90-day visa-free limit
Any time you spent in Slovakia or other Schengen countries before 1 January 2021 does not count towards your 90-day visa-free limit.
At Slovak border control, you may need to queue in separate lanes from EU, EEA and Swiss citizens.
Check your passport is stamped if you enter or exit the Schengen area through Slovakia as a visitor. Border guards will use passport stamps to check you’re complying with the 90-day visa-free limit for short stays in the Schengen area. If relevant entry or exit stamps are not in your passport, border guards will presume that you have overstayed your visa-free limit.
You can show evidence of when and where you entered or exited the Schengen area, and ask the border guards to add this date and location in your passport. Examples of acceptable evidence include boarding passes and tickets.
You may also need to:
show a return or onward ticket
show you have enough money for your stay
If you are resident in Slovakia your passport should not be stamped. You should proactively show your proof of residence as well as your valid passport at Slovak border control. For further information, see our Living in Slovakia guide.
Registering with the Slovak authorities
If you plan to stay in Slovakia for a longer period of time, you should register with the police within 3 days of arrival. You’ll need your passport, 2 photographs and proof of accommodation. You’ll have an option to apply for a Slovak ‘green card’, which can be used as proof of your ID, while your passport is kept in a safe place. Visit the website of Ministry of Interior of the Slovak Republic for further information.
Registering your stay with the Slovak authorities
Foreign nationals must report the place of their stay in Slovakia at their nearest Foreigners Police Department. If you are staying at a hotel, the hotel will do this for you. If you are in private accommodation, you must notify the Foreigners Police by letter, email or in person within 3 working days from the date of your entry into Slovakia.
UK Emergency Travel Documents
UK Emergency Travel Documents (ETDs) are accepted for entry, airside transit and exit from Slovakia. They are also accepted for a return to Slovakia if you normally live there.
Travelling with pets
You cannot use the existing pet passport scheme. Instead, you’ll need an animal health certificate (AHC) for your pet. Allow at least 1 month to arrange this and relevant vaccinations.
Follow the guidance for taking your pet dog, cat or ferret abroad.
If your pet passport was issued in an EU Member State, it remains valid for travel to Slovakia.
See the Slovak Financial Administration guidance on travelling from the UK to Slovakia with pets (in Slovak only).
