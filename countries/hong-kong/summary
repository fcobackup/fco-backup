In recent weeks several large-scale political demonstrations have taken place on Hong Kong Island, in Kowloon and various suburbs in the New Territories. Clashes have taken place between police and protesters following otherwise peaceful protest activities. These have involved significant violence.
Reports indicate demonstrations are likely to continue to take place in Hong Kong. These protests usually happen on weekends, with the more violent clashes happening at night, though protests may take place with little or no notice. You should be prepared that the situation around protests and public gatherings could change quickly.
Activities related to protests have spilled over into large public spaces, including shopping centres, housing estates and metro (“MTR”) stations, on the margins of recent protest routes. Protests can deviate from planned routes and there is the possibility of injuries among those accidentally caught up in events. Demonstrations may lead to sections of the city being closed off and public transport being significantly affected.
On the evening of 21 July, protesters and bystanders were attacked by a group of masked people around the Yuen Long metro station. Media have reported that there are planned protests in the Yuen Long area on Saturday 27 July, which may continue on Sunday and which have not been sanctioned by the police.
If you are in and around areas where demonstrations are taking place, you should remain vigilant, follow the advice of local authorities and move away quickly to a safe place if there are signs of disorder.
On 20 July, Hong Kong police announced that they had seized a quantity of explosives and offensive weapons in the New Territories and that they were still investigating the motive.
