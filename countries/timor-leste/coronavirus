A State of Emergency is in place in Timor-Leste until 28 November 2021. The government of Timor-Leste has lifted the lockdown in the capital city, Dili. Public transport services have resumed operation in Dili and to other municipalities. A proof of full vaccination must be presented to authorities when using public transport. Passengers must observe health protocols when using transport services. Some restriction rules are relaxed under the current state of emergency. Religious, political, social, cultural, sports events, funeral ceremonies with participation of more than 10 people and other large gatherings are allowed with strict observation of health protocols.
During the State of Emergency, if you are in Dili and want to travel outside to other municipalities, you will need a negative COVID-19 test and authorisation from the integrated Crisis Management Centre.
It is mandatory for all individuals to practice COVID-19 safety measures, including wearing a mask, washing hands frequently, and maintaining social distance of at least two metres.
