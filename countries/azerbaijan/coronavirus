Government measures
Restrictive measures are in place until 4 May to combat the spread of COVID-19, with some restrictions being relaxed from 27 April. A list of additional services which can accessed from 27 April can be found here.
People should only leave their residence to access one of the listed services, to obtain food or medicine, to work in an identified key sector, to seek medical treatment, or if in danger. Use of private cars should be only be for a serious necessity in order to limit movement.
If you work in a government identified key sector your employer will register your details with the authorities so that you can travel freely on working days. If you work in a key sector ID cards or other identification documents, service cards or an official certificate should be carried when you need to leave your place of residence. This permission to travel freely is only valid on weekdays. Those not working in key sectors must gain prior permission to leave their residence through the SMS permission system. Those working in key sectors must also use this system during weekends and on non-working days. A list of key sectors identified by the authorities and how instructions how to use the SMS permission system can be found in English here.
