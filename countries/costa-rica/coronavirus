If you plan to pass through another country to return to the UK, check the travel advice for the country you’re transiting.
Be prepared for your plans to change
No travel is risk-free during COVID. Countries may further restrict travel or bring in new rules at short notice, for example due to a new COVID-19 variant. Check with your travel company or airline for any transport changes which may delay your journey home.
If you test positive for COVID-19, you may need to stay where you are until you test negative. You may also need to seek treatment there.
Plan ahead and make sure you:
can access money
understand what your insurance will cover
can make arrangements to extend your stay and be away for longer than planned
Travel in Costa Rica
There are no COVID-related travel restrictions in place in Costa Rica. Private cars are only allowed to enter the capital of San Jose on certain week days (Monday to Friday) depending on restrictions based on the last digit of the licence plate number. There are certain exceptions to this rule.
The use of face masks is only mandatory for front line health workers (in Spanish only) in the private and public sectors and for people entering a health establishment. Nevertheless, many business places still require that face masks be used while in their establishments and will usually carry signage to this effect.
Public transport and taxis are operating normally.

Healthcare in Costa Rica
If you have questions about COVID-19, please go to the nearest health centre or consult the Ministry of Health’s website (in Spanish only).
British-issued prescriptions cannot be used locally. To find a pharmacy (“farmacia”) look for one of the big national chains such as Farmacia Fischel, Farmacia Sucre, FarmaValue, Farmacia Saba, or Farmacia Santa Lucia, among others; a quick search online should help you to identify the nearest one open.

Wherever possible British nationals should aim to be vaccinated in the country where they live. We will update this page when the Government of Costa Rica announces new information on the national vaccination programme. You can sign up to get email notifications when this page is updated.
The Costa Rican national vaccination programme started in December 2020 and is using the Pfizer-BioNTech, AstraZeneca, and Moderna vaccines. The Janssen (Johnson & Johnson) vaccine has been approved but is not currently being used. British nationals resident in Costa Rica are eligible for vaccination. If you are a legal resident and are registered for healthcare, you will be eligible to be part of the programme. You should make sure that you have your current contact details registered with your local public clinic.
