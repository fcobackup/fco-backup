Debit cards are sometimes rejected by ATMs. Credit cards and travellers’ cheques are more reliable. It is safer to change money in hotels, at banks or at foreign exchanges offices. Credit and debit cards have been cloned after being used in ATMs. Check ATMs for evidence of tampering, although affected machines may not be easy to spot.
If credit cards are lost or stolen there may be difficulties obtaining a replacement as the UK Royal Mail is refusing to accept deliveries to Guatemala. You should use international courier companies to ensure delivery. Check with courier companies about any restrictions and their policy.
You can’t exchange sterling in Guatemala.
