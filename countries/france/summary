There is an ongoing outbreak of coronavirus (COVID-19) in France. The French Government outlined new measures on 16 March to stem the spread of coronavirus. This includes limiting travel to journeys that are absolutely necessary, effective from midday 17 March for an initial period of 15 days. Necessary journeys include to purchase food, to seek medical care, urgent family reasons including childcare or assisting vulnerable people, journeys to work where working from home is not possible, or to exercise.
Anyone making such a journey will need to download and complete an “attestation” or declaration certifying their reason for travel. Please note you are able to handwrite and sign a similar declaration if you are unable to access printing facilities. See Health
On 16 March, the French Government announced that the EU would suspend travel between the EU and non-European countries for an initial period of 30 days from midday 17 March. The French Government confirmed that these restrictions will not apply to UK nationals.
The availability of transport from France to the UK is subject to change. Cross-Channel train and ferry services continue to operate but with reduced service. Flights to the UK continue, however some airlines are cancelling flights. The availability of transport may reduce further. We advise British travellers who are currently in France and who wish to return to the UK to make travel plans to do so as soon as possible. Travellers wishing to return should contact their travel operator, checking the website of their airlines or ferry companies for further advice.
From midday 17 March flights departing from French airports may be cancelled or rescheduled. You should check with your airline for the latest information. See Health

Food shops, pharmacies, petrol stations, and banks will stay open. On 15 March, the French Government also announced that public transport will be progressively reduced over the course of the next week.
