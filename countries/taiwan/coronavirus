Entry and borders
The list below covers the main restrictions but is not exhaustive and entry procedures are being regularly reviewed so may change at short notice:
there is currently a ban on air travellers transiting Taiwan, you should adjust your travel plans accordingly
foreign nationals are no longer permitted to enter Taiwan with the exception of holders of a valid Alien Resident Certificate (ARC) or Alien Permanent Resident Certificate(APRC). These measures apply to those eligible for visa-free treatment, landing visas, and e-visas, as well as those carrying valid visas
there are a very small number of exemptions where you can apply for special permission to enter. This can be done at the Taipei Representative Office in the country from which you plan to travel. If you are unsure if you are permitted to enter Taiwan, you should contact your local Taipei Representative Office or airline before you attempt to travel
if you do meet the criteria for entry into Taiwan you will be required to self-isolate for 14 days on arrival. Local authorities monitor those self-isolating, and there are legal penalties for anyone breaching the conditions
the Taiwanese authorities announced in March that travellers already in Taiwan who arrived under a visa waiver, visitor visa or landing visa before 21 March, and who have not overstayed their entry conditions, were to be granted an automatic 30-day extension of their stay. This has now been extended by a further 30 days. The extension will be applied automatically, no application is required. Your total period of stay, including extensions, cannot exceed 180 days.
British nationals who entered on visa free entry can still apply to extend their stay by a further 90 days in the usual way. You must apply before your visa free entry expires and before any automatic extensions are granted. You should make sure you understand the rules and procedures around extension of stay
all airline passengers entering Taiwan are now required to fill in a health declaration which includes travel history for the preceding 14 days
if you are granted permission to enter Taiwan, you may find it difficult to find a hotel that will accept travellers required to self-isolate. You should confirm with your hotel provider that they are able to offer accommodation to someone required to self-isolate for 14 days before you travel
If you’re travelling to or via other countries from Taiwan, check the travel advice for these destinations. If you need further information, contact the local immigration authorities or the embassy, high commission or consulate of the country you’re travelling to.
Healthcare
You should comply with any additional screening measures put in place by the Taiwanese authorities. Monitor the Taiwan Centers for Disease Control website for measures that Taiwan is taking to combat coronavirus.
If you are in Taiwan and believe, you may have been exposed to or may have contracted coronavirus, your first point of contact should be the Taiwan Centers for Disease Control (CDC) helpline which is 1922. If you are unable to speak to anyone at the CDC you can telephone the British Office, Taipei for support.
