On 1 March, the government of San Marino introduced extraordinary civil protection measures in response to coronavirus (COVID-19). These include measures to restrict large numbers of people gathering, including the suspension of public sporting events, theatre performances, film showings, special religious events and other large scale public events. Schools and higher education institutions were and continue to be closed. Museums and cultural institutions were permitted to open, but with restrictions on numbers to ensure that individual visitors remain at least a metre apart. The requirement for at least a metre of space between customers also applied to bars and restaurants.
These measures were expanded on 8 March, with the suspension of all public gatherings, including sporting events, religious ceremonies, museums and cultural institutions, and the introduction of a ban on leaving the home except for essential reasons which may include work, healthcare or returning home. Entry and exit into San Marino is currently prohibited except for reasons of healthcare, cross-border working or essential need. Foreign Nationals are permitted to cross the border into Italy in order to return home but need a valid passport and onward ticket.
