Terrorism
There is a high threat of terrorist attack globally affecting UK interests and British nationals, including from groups and individuals who view the UK and British nationals as targets. You should remain vigilant at all times.
UK Counter Terrorism Policing has information and advice on staying safe abroad and what to do in the event of a terrorist attack. Find out how to reduce your risk from terrorism while abroad.
Terrorism in Turkmenistan
Although there’s no recent history of terrorism in Turkmenistan, attacks cannot be ruled out.
You should be aware of the global risk of indiscriminate terrorist attacks, which could be in public places, including those visited by foreigners.
Restricted zones
Turkmen land border crossings can be subject to occasional and unannounced closures. The borders with Afghanistan and Iran are particularly sensitive.
The Caspian port of Turkmenbashi, and the ancient Silk Road city of Merv (Mary) are not in restricted areas. Check with your local tour guide before travelling outside the capital.
Laws and cultural differences
Personal ID
Police sometimes carry out checks of identity documents. Carry a copy of the photo page of your passport at all times and keep your passport separately in a safe place.
Ramadan
Ramadan is a holy month for Muslims. Get more advice from your tour guide, hotel or business contacts. During this time, do not:
eat, drink, smoke or chew gum in public in the daytime, including in a car or taxi
play loud music or dance
wear revealing clothes
swear in public
You should also:
check opening hours of shops and restaurants
be aware that if hotels and restaurants are providing food or drink in fasting hours, they may separate you from Islamic guests, for example with screens
be aware that driving may be erratic, particularly when people are trying to get home at dusk
be patient and show tolerance
Alcohol laws and bans
It is illegal to drink alcohol in:
parks or public squares
forests or beaches
train stations, airports or sea ports
underpasses
government offices
Smoking and e-cigarette bans
It is illegal to smoke outside or in any communal spaces unless they contain a designated smoking area.
Illegal drugs and prison sentences
If you’re found guilty of possession or use of illegal drugs, you could face a lengthy prison sentence in very basic conditions.
Using cameras in secure areas
Check before taking photographs of or near airports, military barracks, police stations, government buildings or embassies. The guards at the presidential palace may tell you not to take pictures of it. The Turkmen can be sensitive about having their picture taken without their consent.
Internet and mobile network
Internet connections outside the larger hotels can be unreliable. Many social media apps and websites, including YouTube, Twitter, Facebook and WhatsApp are blocked. Access to Yahoo, Gmail and Hotmail is often difficult. VPNs are illegal in Turkmenistan and are usually blocked as soon as the authorities identify them.
There is a single state-owned mobile telephone provider, Altyn Asyr, which uses the TM CELL brand. Altyn Asyr does not provide a roaming service and the quality of the network is low.
Relationships with Turkmens
The Turkmen authorities sometimes prosecute Turkmen women if they start a sexual relationship with a foreign man. They could give the foreign man a fine and deport him.
LGBT+ travellers
Male same-sex activity is illegal, punishable by a prison sentence. Same-sex relationships generally meet with disapproval in Turkmen society. Avoid showing affection in public.

Transport risks
Road travel
If you are planning to drive a hire car or a UK vehicle, see information on driving abroad. The guide lists driving regulations and other legal requirements you need to be aware of.
You’ll need to have both the correct version of the international driving permit (IDP) and your UK driving licence with you in the car. You cannot buy an IDP outside the UK, so get one before you travel.
Driving standards are poor. Road travel at night outside cities is particularly dangerous because of the condition of the roads. There is a 60km/h speed limit in much of Ashgabat, enforced by both static speed cameras and police with mobile speed cameras. There are no signs warning of speed cameras.
Taxis
Licensed taxis are clearly identified and are white or yellow. Avoid unlicensed taxis.
Although taxis have meters, drivers will usually ask foreign nationals for a fee of around 20 manat. They might also ask for payment in US dollars, but this is illegal. Most taxi drivers do not speak much English.
Extreme weather and natural disasters
Earthquakes
There is a risk of earthquakes – usually tremors, but stronger earthquakes happen regularly. Ashgabat was largely destroyed by an earthquake in 1948, when up to 100,000 people were killed.
The US Federal Emergency Management Agency has advice about what to do before, during and after an earthquake.
