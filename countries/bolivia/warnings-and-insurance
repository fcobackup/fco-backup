The Foreign, Commonwealth & Development Office (FCDO) provides advice about risks of travel to help British nationals make informed decisions. Find out more about FCDO travel advice.
Security situation
There have been reports of heightened military activity by a faction of the Bolivian Armed Forces in La Paz. If in La Paz, you should stay in your accommodation or remain in a safe place. Avoid the Plaza Murillo in La Paz and surrounding areas.
The security situation could change quickly without warning. Remain alert to developments and pay attention to instructions from local authorities if in any other part of Bolivia.
