The Foreign & Commonwealth Office (FCO) has advised against all non-essential international travel. This advice takes effect immediately.
This change in travel advice reflects the pace at which other countries are either closing their borders or implementing restrictive measures in response to the global coronavirus pandemic.
While there are currently no restrictions on flights to and from Cambodia, British nationals in country should keep in mind that flights may be cancelled at short notice or other travel restrictions may be put in place by foreign governments.
If you wish to leave the country, you should make arrangements to do so as soon as possible by commercial means. Contact your airline or travel company and your insurance provider as soon as you are able, and keep up to date with the latest developments.
If you choose to remain, you must follow the advice of local authorities.
