Northern Sri Lanka
There is a visible military presence across the north. Follow local advice and instructions from the security forces and take seriously warning signs about landmines.
Jaffna Peninsula
Operations to clear mines continue, particularly in the heavily mined area towards Elephant Pass. However, apart from High Security Zones, there is free movement with fewer checkpoints.
Kilinochchi, Mullaitivu, Mannar and Vavuniya
There is a visible military presence. There was severe war damage to property throughout the northern region so accommodation options and infrastructure are limited. Follow any local advice about signs warning of mined areas.
Eastern Sri Lanka
De-mining and clearance operations are ongoing in parts of east Sri Lanka. There are several areas, primarily former military and police locations, that continue to be marked as minefields. Follow the instructions of the local security forces and look out for signs warning of landmines. Do not leave the roads or cleared footpaths and, if in any doubt, contact the local security authorities for advice.
