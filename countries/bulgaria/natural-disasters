Earthquakes
Earthquakes and small tremors are recorded throughout the year, usually without consequences. The last significant series of earthquakes was in 1928.
To learn more about what to do before, during and after an earthquake, see this advice from the US Federal Emergency Management Agency.
Flooding
Many parts of Bulgaria are subject to flooding following heavy rains. Flooding is usually localised but can occasionally be widespread and has resulted in fatalities. Follow the weather forecast on the National Institute of Meteorology and Hydrology website which provides detailed information and severe weather warnings for Bulgaria.
Wildfires
Throughout the summer and early autumn period, Bulgaria is on a regular alert for wildfires. There is a danger of large-scale and quickly spreading fires in forests and fields. Follow media reports and the advice of the local authorities if wildfires occur in your area.
