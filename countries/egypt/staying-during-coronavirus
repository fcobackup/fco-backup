This page gives you guidance on how to stay safely in Egypt as a visitor, if you are unable to return to the UK.
Everyone should comply with the measures put in place in Egypt to limit the spread of coronavirus (COVID-19).
The Egyptian authorities’ response to the coronavirus is evolving, and local measures may change and new restrictions be introduced at short notice and without warning. There is currently a curfew from 8pm to 5am (from 14 June this changes to 8pm to 4am) as well as restrictions on public gatherings. There are also restrictions on schools, universities, cafes, bars, clubs, hotels and tourist locations. You should follow the guidance of the local authorities. The wearing of face masks is mandatory in closed public spaces, including government buildings, private offices, malls, retail outlets and public transport including private taxis. Legal penalties could be applied for non-compliance.

Finance
There is a range of financial support from the government that you can access while you are unable to return due to coronavirus restrictions.
If you’re in Egypt, and have exhausted all other options to cover essential living costs while you wait to return home, you could apply for an emergency loan for your living costs from the UK government. You can only apply if you normally live in the UK and you cannot return home. This last-resort option is for those most in need, and you would need to repay the loan when you are back in the UK. Apply for an emergency loan.
