There are currently no commercial options available to return to the UK from Trinidad and Tobago. The Trinidad and Tobago government has indefinitely closed its borders to all international flights from midnight 22 March. Sea borders are also closed indefinitely to all vessels including yachts.
We know this is concerning for British people trying to leave Trinidad and Tobago. The UK government is working closely with airlines, the Trinidad and Tobago authorities and other governments to make sure options are available for you to return to the UK as soon as possible.
What to do
If you cannot leave Trinidad and Tobago at this time, you should:
follow the advice of local authorities, including local measures to help minimise your risk of exposure to coronavirus.
find accommodation that’s suitable for your needs.

Future travel options
The UK government is working closely with airlines, the Trinidad and Tobago authorities and other governments to make sure options are available for you to return to the UK as soon as possible.
You will need to pay for your return travel to the UK. If departure options are available but you cannot afford the travel costs and have exhausted all other options for getting funds, you may be eligible to apply for an emergency loan from the government. This is a last resort option and you would need to repay the loan when you are back in the UK. For more information, you should contact Corporate Travel Management (CTM). CTM are a commercial partner of the FCO and are authorised to administer such loans on behalf of the FCO.
