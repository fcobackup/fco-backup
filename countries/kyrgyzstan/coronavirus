Anyone found breaking curfew will be held until the end of the curfew period, and may be held for a further 3 days if they do not have the correct id documents.
Between 07:00 and 20:00 movement should be limited to your local area and only to buy food and access pharmacies and doctors as required. If you are going out for any of these reasons you will need to carry id and a written copy of the following information:
Full name

Additional restrictions will be placed on those entering and exiting the city and foreign nationals are advised to remain in the areas where they are registered as resident. Individuals under observation or treatment are prohibited from leaving their homes. Anyone found to be disturbing public order can be expelled and returned to their permanent place of residence. For foreign nationals this is likely to be at your own expense. There are also restrictions on vehicle movements, and vehicles, including foreign vehicles, may be subject to inspections.
Restrictions on moving between villages, towns and cities across the rest of Kyrgyzstan remain in place. The authorities have ordered most shops and places of entertainment to close, with only grocery stores, banks and pharmacies remaining open.
Large events have been suspended including family, cultural, sporting, scientific and other commemorative events. Citizens are being encouraged to remain at home as far as possible and limit contact with other people.
You should consider making arrangements for provisions if you are unable or unwilling to leave your home for an extended period of time. You should also consider any medical arrangements that you will need to have in place including access to medicines. Medical facilities in Kyrgyzstan are not as developed as those in the UK.
If you are unwell and suspect you have symptoms of Coronavirus you can call Kyrgyzstan’s medical hotline (112, 103, 118), or the hotlines of local medical services. If you are required to enter a state quarantine center facilities are likely to be basic. There are centers in hospitals, including surgery centers for those with additional medical needs, and a specialist area for pregnant women. However some people are also reportedly being held for observation in a former US airbase.
The process of issuing entry visas for the Kyrgyz republic has temporarily been suspended, however the government continues to offer services to extend visas for foreigners already in country. If you entered the Kyrgyz Republic under the 60 day visa free regime and need to extend your period of stay on the basis of obtaining a visa (work permit, family ties, or other grounds) the visa center is willing to consider the possibility of obtaining visas without leaving the Kyrgyz republic. You can apply for a visa through the “Electronic Visa Portal”
