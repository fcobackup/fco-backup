This page gives you guidance on how to stay safely in Paraguay as a visitor, if you are unable to return to the UK.
Everyone should comply with the measures put in place in Paraguay to limit the spread of coronavirus (COVID-19).
Moving around in Paraguay
For information on entering Paraguay, see Entry Requirements.
Paraguayan authorities have declared a nationwide health-related State of Emergency. Measures include:
a ban on all non-essential movement nationwide until at least 3 May. There are exceptions to buy food, go to the pharmacy or hospital, and for key workers. Stay in your accommodation unless absolutely necessary to go out
the temporary closure of schools, universities and public parks
the cancellation of mass events and gatherings (public and private) such as at cinemas, concerts and conventions, as well as religious, sports, leisure and political activities
a requirement to wear a face mask in public, including on public transport, throughout Paraguay
Restrictions for private vehicles apply nationwide:
vehicles with plates ending in 0, 2, 4, 6, 8 can only use the road on Tuesdays, Thursdays and Saturdays
vehicles with plates ending in 1, 3, 5, 7, 9 can only use the road on Mondays, Wednesdays, Fridays and Sundays
If you’re in Paraguay, follow the advice of the Paraguayan authorities.
Easing of restrictions
From 4 May onwards, “smart quarantine” measures will be introduced to relax nationwide measures in 4 phases. Phase 1 starts on 4 May, phase 2 on 25 May, phase 3 on 15 June and phase 4 is to be confirmed.
Phase 1 consists of the reopening of industries, small businesses with up to 3 people inside, and all delivery services. This is to be carried out in compliance with strict health and safety measures, including the washing of hands coming in and out of venues/sites, mandatory physical distancing and the wearing of face masks at all times.
Visas
Due to travel restrictions, the Paraguayan immigration authorities have automatically extended the 90-day permission for tourists and non-residents to stay in Paraguay from 13 March onwards, for the duration of the emergency.
You can find more information on the Paraguayan Dirección General de Migraciones website (in Spanish).
Health
If you present symptoms, you should contact the Paraguayan Ministry of Health at 154 / 911 or INERAM hospital at (021) 290 838.
People who have tested positive for COVID-19 and do not need to be admitted to hospital, will stay in specialised shelters. This includes the following:
those who would like to do so voluntarily
those in vulnerable situations whose accommodation is not suitable for self-isolation (because it is crowded and/or small)
those who have broken self-isolation
those who have come from abroad and tested positive during their quarantine period
Further information is also available on the Paraguayan Ministry of Health website or official Twitter channel (both in Spanish).
