Warning
FCDO advises against all but essential travel to parts of Uganda.

This page has information on travelling to Uganda.
This page reflects the UK government’s understanding of current rules for people travelling on a full ‘British Citizen’ passport from the UK, for the most common types of travel.
The authorities in Uganda set and enforce entry rules. If you’re unsure how Uganda’s entry requirements apply to you, contact its UK embassy, high commission or consulate.
All travellers
You’ll need a visa to enter Uganda. Following an announcement by the Ugandan Ministry of Internal Affairs on October 14 2021, you are required to have a visa before your trip. Visas will not be issued on arrival.
See the Visas section for more information.
As of 7 March, you are no longer required to show proof of vaccination status or provide a negative COVID-19 PCR test certificate on arrival. If transiting or departing, you should be aware of entry requirements at your final destination.
Arriving passengers may be subject to temperature checks and will be screened for infectious diseases by the Port Health authorities. If your temperature is above normal or you display COVID-19 symptoms you may be required to take a COVID-19 test. If a foreign national tests positive for COVID-19 and wishes to be repatriated for treatment outside of Uganda, they will be expected to cover the costs themselves.
Only passengers with valid tickets and airport officials will be allowed into the terminal building.
For more information about entry requirements, visit the Ugandan Directorate of Citizenship and Immigration Control website.
