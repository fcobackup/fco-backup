The Foreign, Commonwealth & Development Office (FCDO) advises against all but essential travel to Sri Lanka, due to ongoing political and economic instability. This advice does not apply to airside transit through Sri Lanka’s international airport.
There are reports of a large scale protest due to take place on Saturday 28 May, between the areas of Colpetty, Galle Face and Fort in Colombo.
Several incidents took place on 9 May involving violence against peaceful protesters, including in the Galle Face area in Colombo, where the security authorities used tear gas and water cannons. Incidents have also taken place in the Fort area, Beira Lake in Colombo, Kandy, and in other parts of the country, some resulting in injuries and loss of life. Further incidents could take place.
If you are in Sri Lanka at this time, or considering travel, you should avoid all protests and follow the advice of local authorities.
The economic situation is deteriorating in Sri Lanka with shortages of basic necessities including medicines, cooking gas, fuel and food because of a shortage of hard currency to pay for imports. There may be long queues at shops and supermarkets, fuel stations, and pharmacies. There may be difficulties or delays obtaining taxis and other public transport. There are ongoing daily power cuts due to electricity rationing.
There have been a number of protests since 31 March 2022. Further protests are likely to take place across the island. The Government of Sri Lanka may impose local restrictions including curfews at short notice. You should be vigilant, avoid any demonstrations or large gatherings, and follow the advice of the local authorities. Find out more in the Political situation section.
A State of Emergency in Sri Lanka has been lifted, however some military presence remains on the streets. Curfews may be imposed at short notice.
