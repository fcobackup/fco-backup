Travel in Spain
You should follow the advice of the local authorities on how best to protect yourself and others, including any measures that they bring in to control the virus.
On 25 October 2020, the Spanish government declared a nationwide State of Emergency which includes a national obligatory overnight curfew (specific curfew times vary, starting between 10pm and midnight and lasting until 6am). It also provides regional governments with legal powers to impose further mobility restrictions in their region if deemed necessary (e.g. entry and exit restrictions to and from specific areas).
The situation is evolving and restrictive measures to control the virus may be introduced across the country at short notice. You will need to meet the requirements and be prepared to demonstrate with documentary evidence an essential need to enter Spain. You should consult the Spanish Ministry of Health map for details of local outbreaks and the specific measures in place in your destination. You should also check the advice of local authorities in your destination prior to travel.
There are some exemptions to entering and exiting confined areas or travelling during the hours of curfew such as travel to your place of employment, attendance at medical appointments or transiting the area to return to your place of residence. Entry for tourism purposes is not currently permitted and should be avoided. See Road travel
Many municipal and regional authorities have introduced other types of measures such as limiting the opening hours and capacity of bars and restaurants, and in some places these remain closed until further notice. See Public spaces and services for further information.
The use of face coverings is mandatory for anyone over the age of 6 years old on all forms of public transport in Spain and in many other indoor and outdoor public spaces. Rules on the use of face masks may vary by region. See Use of face masks for further details.
