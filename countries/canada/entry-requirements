This page reflects the UK government’s understanding of current rules for people travelling on a full ‘British Citizen’ passport, for the most common types of travel.
The authorities in Canada set and enforce entry rules. For further information contact the embassy, high commission or consulate of the country or territory you’re travelling to. You should also consider checking with your transport provider or travel company to make sure your passport and other travel documents meet their requirements.
Entry rules in response to coronavirus (COVID-19)
Entry to Canada
From 7 September 2021, fully vaccinated foreign nationals are eligible to enter Canada for discretionary (non-essential) reasons, such as tourism; however, these individuals must:
be fully vaccinated: a traveller must have received, and show proof of, the full series of a vaccine — or combination of vaccines — accepted by the Government of Canada at least 14 days prior to entering Canada. Currently, those vaccines are manufactured by Pfizer-BioNTech, Moderna, AstraZeneca/COVISHIELD, and Janssen (Johnson & Johnson).
have a valid pre-arrival COVID-19 molecular test result taken no more than 72 hours before their scheduled flight or their arrival at the land border crossing, or a previous positive test result taken between 14 and 180 days before departure to Canada. Antigen tests, often called “rapid tests” are not accepted;
be asymptomatic;
submit their mandatory information via ArriveCAN (App or website), including proof of vaccination in English or French and a quarantine plan in case it is determined at the border that you do not meet the necessary requirements;
be admissible under the Immigration and Refugee Protection Act; and,
take a test on arrival, if selected.
There are no changes to testing and quarantine requirements for travellers who are not fully vaccinated but eligible to enter Canada by right, including Canadian citizens, permanent residents and their immediate and extended family, temporary foreign workers and most international students. They are still subject to quarantine, all testing requirements (pre-arrival, upon arrival/day 1 and on day 8) and the mandatory submission of travel, contact and quarantine information via ArriveCAN.
Further details are available on Transport Canada’s website, and Public Health Canada’s website.
Individuals can use the online tool, “Find out if you can travel to Canada” on the Government of Canada website to find out if they may be eligible to enter Canada. Further details are available on the Immigration, Refugees and Citizenship Canada website or call the Canada Border Service Agency helpline: 1 800 461 9999.
Passengers without a valid test result will be denied boarding or entry. If you are travelling from a country where molecular testing is unavailable you will be required to quarantine for 14 days quarantine. Delays in obtaining test results does not apply.
Further details are available on Public Health Canada’s website.
At point of departure, air operators must complete a basic health assessment of every passenger. No passengers (regardless of citizenship) who are showing symptoms of coronavirus will be allowed to board. Non-medical face masks or face coverings are required for all flights to and from Canadian airports, and within airport terminals. Anyone who cannot wear a face mask for medical reasons must be in possession of a medical certificate.
All travellers whose final destination is Canada are required to submit their information digitally through Canada’s ArriveCAN (App or website), within 72 hours before your arrival in Canada. This includes travel and contact information, quarantine plan, COVID-19 symptom self-assessment and vaccine information. You must be ready to show your ArriveCAN receipt when seeking entry into Canada, as well as evidence that you have submitted your details digitally. Further information is available on the Public Health Agency of Canada’s website.
If you have any questions, contact the nearest Canadian High Commission, Embassy or Consulate.
Toronto Pearson (YYZ), Montreal Pierre Elliott Trudeau (YUL), Calgary International Airport (YYC) and Vancouver International Airport (YVR) are operating international flights. International flights will be permitted to land at four additional airports (Halifax, Quebec City, Ottawa and Winnipeg) in the coming weeks.

Transiting Canada
If you’re planning to transit via Canada to reach the UK, you should be aware that exceptions apply. You must:
plan your travel so you arrive and depart from the same airport within 24 hours (Domestic transfers are not permitted)
must check their baggage through to a destination outside Canada
connections must occur on the same day at all Canadian airports except Toronto Pearson (YYZ)
Overnight connections are not possible at:
Montréal-Trudeau (YUL)
Calgary International (YYC)
Vancouver International (YVR)
Canadian authorities require passengers to wear a face covering on flights to and from Canada, and within airport terminals in Canada. Passengers arriving at or departing from Canadian airports must demonstrate that they have the necessary face mask or face covering during the boarding process, otherwise they will be stopped from continuing their journey. Anyone who cannot wear a face mask for medical reasons must be in possession of a medical certificate. Further information is available on Transport Canada’s website.
The Canadian authorities require visitors transiting through Canada to obtain an Electronic Travel Authorisation (eTA) see Entry requirements, unless you are otherwise exempted (for example, if you have a valid Canadian visa or a permanent resident card).
If you have any further questions, you should contact your airline, Transport Canada, or your nearest Canadian high commission, embassy or consulate.
Testing / screening on arrival
All air passengers must wear a non-medical mask or face covering during travel, within airport terminals and to their place of self-isolation.
In addition to the mandatory pre-departure tests, travellers arriving in Canada by land and air are required to take an additional test on arrival and a further test on Day 8 of their 14 day self-isolation period.
If you qualify for the fully vaccinated traveller exemption you are exempt from the Day 8 test. Most fully vaccinated travellers won’t need to take an arrival test. However, you may be randomly selected for the border testing surveillance programme upon arrival in Canada. If you are selected for testing, complete your on-arrival test. You do not need to quarantine while awaiting test results. If selected, you must take the test or you will be subject to quarantine and penalties/fines. Further information is available on Public Health Canada’s website. You should comply with any additional screening measures put in place by the authorities.
For questions about travel during the coronavirus pandemic, check the Health Canada website.
Quarantine requirements
Air travellers are no longer required to reserve, prior to departure to Canada, a 3 night stay in a government-authorised hotel. Further details are available on Public Health Canada’s website.
Fully vaccinated travellers who are eligible to enter Canada are no longer required to quarantine on arrival. You must have received the full series of a vaccine — or a combination of vaccines — accepted by the Government of Canada at least 14 days prior to entering Canada.
Fully vaccinated travellers will still be required to produce a valid pre-departure test, take a test on arrival, and produce a quarantine plan, as well as be prepared to quarantine in case it is determined at the border that they do not meet the necessary requirements. You will also be required upload relevant information and documentation to the ArriveCAN (App or website) prior to arrival in Canada. Further details are available on Public Health Canada’s website.
If you are not exempt you are legally required to self-isolate for 14 days. Heavy penalties apply if fail to comply. You must also produce a credible self-isolation plan. An inadequate plan would include scenarios such as planning to stay with elderly relatives or failing to have a set destination. If you have symptoms or an unsuitable quarantine plan, follow the directions provided by the government representative.
Further details are available on Public Health Canada’s website.
Regular entry requirements
Visas
British Citizens don’t usually need a visa to visit Canada for short periods, but you’ll need to get an Electronic Travel Authorisation before you travel (see below).
If you have a different type of British nationality or intend to travel for a longer period, such as for work or study, check entry requirements with the Canadian High Commission. Effective from 31 July 2018, you may need to give your fingerprints and photos (biometrics) at a visa application centre when applying for a study or work permit, or permanent residence. When you arrive in Canada, you will need to be able to show that you have enough funds available to support yourself during your stay, even if you’re staying with family and friends.
If you have any doubts about whether you’re eligible to enter Canada (eg if you have a criminal record or have been arrested even if it did not result in a conviction), or about visa matters generally, contact the Canadian High Commission before you travel.
Some unauthorised websites charge for submitting visa applications. These websites are not endorsed by or associated with the Canadian government. Be wary of such sites and businesses, particularly those that seek additional fees.
Passport validity
Your passport should be valid for the proposed duration of your stay. No additional period of validity beyond this is required.
Electronic Travel Authorisation (eTA)
Visitors travelling to Canada by air are now expected to get an electronic travel authorisation (eTA) to enter Canada.
If you’re visiting Canada you’ll need an eTA to board your flight unless you’re otherwise exempted (for example, if you have a valid Canadian visa or a permanent resident card). If you have British-Canadian dual nationality you won’t be able to apply for an eTA and you’ll need to present a valid Canadian passport to board your flight to Canada.
If you’re travelling by land or sea, you won’t need an eTA when you enter Canada. However, you must travel with acceptable travel documents and identification.
For more information about the eTA system, and to apply online, visit the official Canadian government website.
UK Emergency Travel Documents
UK Emergency Travel Documents (ETDs) are accepted for entry, airside transit and exit from Canada. You can apply for an Electronic Travel Authorisation using an ETD.
Travelling with children
If you’re travelling with children and only one parent is present, you should carry a letter of consent from the non-travelling parent. Immigration officers have the right to question children using simple and appropriate language to establish whether there are any concerns about child abduction. A letter of consent may help to dispel potential concerns.
For further information check with the Canadian High Commission or the Canada Border Services Agency.
Travelling to the USA
The Canada-US border is closed to non-essential travel.
