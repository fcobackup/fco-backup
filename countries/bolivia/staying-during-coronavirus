This page gives you guidance on how to stay safely in Bolivia as a visitor, if you are unable to return to the UK.
Everyone should comply with the measures put in place in Bolivia to limit the spread of coronavirus (COVID-19).
Registering with the British Embassy
If you are stuck in Bolivia, send your contact details to the Consular Section at the British Embassy, by email to lapaz.escalations@fco.gov.uk. Note that, owing to travel restrictions, there is limited consular assistance that the Embassy can provide, particularly outside La Paz.
Moving around in Bolivia
Movement continues to be restricted nationwide, with quarantine measures extended to 10 May.
One person per household (between the ages of 18 and 65) is allowed to go outside to buy food, once per week between the hours of 7am and 12 midday. The day you can go outside is determined by the final number of your ID card or passport, as follows:
Monday: 1 and 2
Tuesday: 3 and 4
Wednesday: 5 and 6
Thursday: 7 and 8
Friday: 9 and 0
Nobody may go outside on Saturday or Sunday.
No private or public vehicles may circulate, except those related to security and health.
Penalties for breaching these conditions include fines and imprisonment.
Visas
If you are stuck in Bolivia and your entry stamp is about to expire, inform the British Embassy’s consular section by sending your details to lapaz.escalations@fco.gov.uk.

If you’re in Bolivia, you should find secure accommodation until the state of emergency ends, flights resume and borders open.

Finance
There is a range of financial support from the government that you can access while you are unable to return due to coronavirus restrictions.
If you’re in Bolivia and have exhausted all other options to cover essential living costs while you wait to return home, you could apply for an emergency loan for your living costs from the UK government. This is a last resort option for those most in need and you would need to repay the loan when you are back in the UK. Apply for an emergency loan.

Help and support
If you need urgent consular assistance, contact the British Embassy. All telephone numbers are available 24/7.
