This page has information on travelling to Sudan. Check what you must do to return to the UK.
This page reflects the UK government’s understanding of current rules for people travelling on a full ‘British Citizen’ passport from the UK, for the most common types of travel.
The authorities in Sudan set and enforce entry rules.
All travellers
All travellers should familiarise themselves with the entry rules for Sudan before travel.
British nationals will need a visa to enter or travel through Sudan as a visitor and will need to apply for this before you travel via the Sudanese Embassy in London
Entry to Sudan
Passengers of Sudanese origin may be subject to testing for coronavirus (COVID-19) on arrival. All other passengers, over 8 years old must either hold a polymerase chain reaction (PCR) certificate confirming a negative test result, taken less than 96 hour before arrival; or a COVID-19 vaccination certificate showing the passenger was fully vaccinated at least 14 days before arrival.
Data collection
All arrivals must provide details of their original place of travel, transit and final destination, their address and their contact details in case the authorities need to contact them in the event of another passenger testing positive.
Testing on departure
Some airlines require evidence of a negative PCR test and have strict rules on face coverings and gloves. You should check the conditions set out by your airline and the authorities in your country of destination.
If you’re fully vaccinated
Entry requirements for Sudan are the same for all travellers, regardless of COVID-19 vaccination status.
Proof of vaccination status
Passengers may either provide a COVID-19 vaccination certificate showing that they were fully vaccinated for entry to Sudan or a PCR certificate confirming a negative test result, taken less than 96 hours before arrival.
If you’re not fully vaccinated
Entry requirements for Sudan are the same for all travellers, regardless of COVID-19 vaccination status.
If you’ve had COVID-19 in the past year
Entry requirements for Sudan are the same for all travellers, regardless of whether you have tested positive for COVID-19 in the past year.
Children and young people
The rules on children aged 17 and under travelling without being accompanied by their father changed in July 2020. Children no longer need to obtain their father or male relative’s consent to enter and exit Sudan.
Check your passport and travel documents before you travel
Passport validity
Your passport should be valid for a minimum period of 6 months from the date of entry into Sudan.
Visas
British nationals need a visa to visit Sudan. Apply before you travel via the Sudanese Embassy in London.
You should register with the Aliens Department at the Ministry of Interior within 3 days of your arrival in the country. You will need 2 passport size photos. The fee is the Sudanese Pound equivalent of around £35. If you don’t register within 3 days of arrival, you may be fined. Some of the larger hotels will do this for you but you should ask when you check-in.
Visitors to Sudan on a single entry visa need to get an exit visa to leave the country, though this is not always enforced. Exit visas can be processed at the airport. If requested, you should be ready to show proof of your sponsor and pay the exit visa fee of 50 US dollars.
Most foreign residents, including British nationals, also need an exit permit. You should check the details with your sponsor, ideally before your arrival, and to ensure that you understand and are happy with the process. You should also be aware that this requirement could make it difficult for you to leave the country at short notice, should the need arise.
Previous travel to Israel
If your passport has an Israeli visa or Israeli entry/exit stamps you will not be allowed to enter Sudan.
Yellow fever certificate requirements
Check whether you need a yellow fever certificate by visiting the National Travel Health Network and Centre’s TravelHealthPro website.
UK Emergency Travel Documents
UK Emergency Travel Documents (ETDs) are not valid for entry into or transit through the Republic of Sudan. However, ETDs are accepted for exit from the country.
