Restrictions in response to coronavirus

Addis Ababa Bole International Airport (and other international ports of arrival) have put in place additional measures to screen passengers arriving, departing or transiting through Ethiopia. Screening may include temperature measurements and checks on recent travel to affected areas.
Those people displaying symptoms linked to coronavirus may be transferred to a nearby isolation facility for up to 24 hours while further tests are carried out. The Ethiopian Public Health Institute advises that anyone who tests positive for the virus but displays only mild symptoms will be required to remain at the isolation facility for a further 14 days, in line with WHO guidance.
Anyone with a pre-existing condition that requires regular medicines should bring sufficient amounts to cover a potential unplanned additional 2 week stay. More serious cases will be transferred to hospital.
Quarantine
All passengers arriving into the country will be subject to mandatory 14 day quarantine in hotels designated by the local authorities. You may choose from a range of hotels at different prices, but cannot change hotel once your quarantine has started. Passengers are responsible for the full cost of their stay in quarantine. You may need to demonstrate that you can afford the cost before boarding your flight.
Contact your airline for more details. Those in quarantine will be monitored by the Ethiopian health authorities and may be tested for coronavirus . You may be moved to an isolation facility if you develop symptoms.
