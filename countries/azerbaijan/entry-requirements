This page has information on travelling to Azerbaijan.
This page reflects the UK government’s understanding of current rules for people travelling on a full ‘British Citizen’ passport from the UK, for the most common types of travel.
The authorities in Azerbaijan set and enforce entry rules. If you’re unsure how Azerbaijan’s entry requirements apply to you, contact its UK embassy, high commission or consulate.
All travellers
All travellers should familiarise themselves with the entry rules for Azerbaijan before travel.
From 28 March 2023, COVID-19 travel restrictions for travellers to Azerbaijan were lifted. The rules that previously applied to travellers coming to Azerbaijan no longer apply: you are no longer required to present proof of vaccination.

If you’re transiting through Azerbaijan
Transiting is when you pass through one country on the way to your final destination.
Check with your airline before departing.
Check your passport and travel documents before you travel
Check with your travel provider to make sure your passport and other travel documents meet their requirements.
Passport validity
If you are visiting Azerbaijan, your passport should be valid for a minimum of 3 months from the date your visa expires.
If you are a resident in Azerbaijan, your passport must be valid for a minimum of 3 months from the expiry date of your temporary or permanent residence permit.
Visas
British nationals travelling to Azerbaijan need to get a visa in advance.
The ASAN Visa (e-Visa) service is now open to all British nationals. E-Visas normally take 72 hours to process. An urgent service is available for an additional fee. E-Visas are normally valid for 30 days and are single entry. If you apply for an e-Visa check the ‘Screening’ requirements for entry above.
You can also apply for a visa through the Azerbaijan Embassy-affiliated Visa Service Centre in the UK. When applying for a visa through the Azerbaijan Embassy-affiliated Visa Service Centre you should apply for a visa at least one month ahead of your intended travel date. Check the ‘Screening’ section above before applying for a visa.
Make sure you check the duration of your visa immediately to avoid overstaying unintentionally. Your visa should be valid when departing Azerbaijan.

If you overstay (excluding those with permission to stay through the indefinitely extended e-visa process) you can obtain an ‘Exit Permit’ letter (an official letter giving permission to leave Azerbaijan within 48 hours) from the State Migration Service before you depart. You will be liable to a fine of between AZN300 to AZN400. You should get a receipt.
Registration
If you’re staying in Azerbaijan for longer than 15 days you must register with the State Migration Service within 15 days of arrival by either visiting the State Migration Service in person or online. Hotels may provide this service for their guests, but visitors staying in apartments or private residences will have to register by themselves. Each traveller is responsible for ensuring that the registration has been completed.
If you’re staying longer than 30 days, you will need to obtain a temporary residence card unless applying to extend your visa on compassionate grounds. For more information refer to the State Migration Service.
Dual nationals
Azerbaijan doesn’t allow adults (18 years or older) to hold dual nationality. You may be refused entry, denied departure or even face criminal liability if you’re 18 years or older and are found to be holding both an Azerbaijani passport and a passport of a different nationality. If you’re a British passport holder with links to Azerbaijan (through birth or otherwise) and wish to check your nationality status contact the State Migration Service before you travel. Children under 18 years old holding a second nationality shouldn’t face any difficulties.
