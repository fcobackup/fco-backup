Most visits to Maldives are trouble free. The most common problems faced by visiting British nationals are lost and stolen passports, and swimming and diving related accidents. See Safety and security
Terrorists are likely to try to carry out attacks in the Maldives. See Terrorism
An improvised explosive device (IED) was detonated in central Male’ on the evening of 6 May, injuring a high-profile politician and a number of bystanders. You should follow the instructions of local authorities whilst investigations are underway.
The Maldivian authorities have designated a March 2020 arson attack on a police speedboat in Laamu Gan as a terrorist incident and charged two individuals with terrorism offences in relation to the attack. This follows knife attacks against three foreigners (two resident employees and one tourist) in Hulhumale’ in February, which were claimed by Daesh (also known as ISIL, Islamic State, or ISIS) supporters. The Maldives police made a number of arrests in relation to the knife attacks. You should remain vigilant.
Political protests in the capital Male’ take place occasionally. You should exercise caution and avoid any protests or rallies. Outlying islands, resorts or Male’ International Airport are not usually affected by protests or rallies. See Political situation
UK health authorities have classified Maldives as having a risk of Zika virus transmission. For more information and advice visit the National Travel Health Network and Centre website
