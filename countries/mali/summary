For security reasons, the FCDO advises against all but essential travel to:
25km around the capital of Bamako
The FCDO advises against all travel to:
the rest of Mali
Before you travel, check the ‘Entry requirements’ section for Mali’s current entry restrictions and requirements. These may change with little warning. Monitor this advice for the latest updates and stay in contact with your travel provider.
If you plan to pass through another country to return to the UK, check the travel advice for the country you’re transiting.
There is disruption to air travel to and from Bamako, and a risk of protests due to the military takeover in neighbouring Niger in July 2023. Check with your travel provider ahead of your travel. See Entry requirements and Safety and security pages.
It is more important than ever to get travel insurance and check it provides sufficient cover. See the FCDO’s guidance on foreign travel insurance.
Terrorists are very likely to try to carry out attacks in Mali, including kidnaps. There is a risk of kidnap in all parts of the country. The kidnap threat is most significant in northern and central Mali, and increasingly in the south. There is a heightened threat of terrorist attacks and kidnaps targeting Westerners in Bamako and across southern Mali. We advise you take extra care, especially if travelling at night and in places frequented by westerners. In July 2022, the AQ-affiliated Islamist terrorist group, Jamaat Nusrat al-Islam wal Muslimeen (JNIM) made public statements setting out their intention to conduct attacks in Bamako. A series of recent attacks in central and southern Mali demonstrate a deteriorating security situation and heightened risk of attacks in the capital. In July 2022, terrorists targeted the Kati military camp, just 15km from the centre of Bamako.
Attacks could be indiscriminate and occur without warning. You should be especially vigilant and where possible avoid national or local government facilities, including those belonging to the defence and security forces, as these are likely to be targets. Places frequented by foreigners, including diplomatic premises, hotels, restaurants, bars, nightclubs, stadiums, concert halls, shopping areas, markets, national infrastructure, airports and other transport hubs, places of worship, businesses with western interests and non-governmental organisations are also likely to be targets of attack.
You should be vigilant, be alert to announcements, monitor local media and follow the advice of the local authorities. Avoid all large gatherings, including music festivals, shows, concerts, sporting events and any public marches or demonstrations. You should exercise extra caution during election periods and during festivities, and religious and public holiday periods.
At times when the risk is heightened, you should expect a robust security presence, particularly in Bamako. This can include police patrols, police security checks in restaurants and hotels and vehicle and personal security checks. Foreigners are not exempt. See Terrorism
Political unrest is an ongoing risk. Public demonstrations in and around Bamako have encountered a strong police and security force presence. The military takeover in neighbouring Niger in July 2023 may lead to unrest or protests in Bamako. You should stay away from all political demonstrations and any blockades set up by the police and security forces. Maintain several days’ stock of food and water in case disturbances take place. You can monitor daily developments in English through the BBC World Service (88.9 FM in Bamako). See Safety and Security.
Consular support is severely limited, especially outside Bamako. If you are in Mali and need emergency help from the UK government, contact the British Embassy in Bamako. In the event of deterioration in the political or security situation, the British Embassy may be increasingly limited in the assistance that it can provide. Do not rely on the FCDO being able to evacuate you in an emergency. If you need urgent help because something has happened to a friend or relative abroad, contact the Foreign, Commonwealth & Development Office (FCDO) in London on 020 7008 5000 (24 hours).
