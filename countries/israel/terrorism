This travel advice covers Israel and the Occupied Palestinian Territories
Terrorists are very likely to try to carry out attacks in Israel and the Occupied Palestinian Territories.
UK Counter Terrorism Policing has information and advice on staying safe abroad and what to do in the event of a terrorist attack. Find out more about the global threat from terrorism.
Attacks could be indiscriminate, including in crowded areas, government, military and police installations and against personnel, transportation networks, businesses with Western interests. Areas where foreign nationals and tourists are known to gather may be at higher risk of attack. You should be particularly vigilant in these areas and follow any specific advice of the local security authorities.
Be vigilant, monitor media reports and keep up to date with this travel advice. Make sure you are familiar with contact details for the emergency services (in Israel - dial 100; in the West Bank and Gaza - dial 101).
Heightened tensions, brought about by rocket attacks from Gaza into Israel and Israeli airstrikes on Gaza, have greatly increased the risk of retaliatory terrorist attacks in Israel. You should remain vigilant at all times

Kidnap
There is a risk of kidnap in Gaza and along the border with Egypt. The long-standing policy of the British government is not to make substantive concessions to hostage takers. The British government considers that paying ransoms and releasing prisoners increases the risk of further hostage taking.
