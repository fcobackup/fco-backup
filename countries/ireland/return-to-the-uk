If you live in Great Britain and are currently visiting Ireland, you’re strongly advised to return now by commercial means. Check the latest travel advice and the most recent updates from your travel operator before travelling.
UK special charter flights will only operate for priority countries where commercial flights are not possible. You should not assume that these flights will become available in countries where commercial routes are operating.
This advice does not affect travel from Northern Ireland to Ireland or intra-UK travel. If you need to undertake essential travel, you should follow the Irish and UK public health guidance respectively.
Travel options
The availability of transport from Ireland to Great Britain is subject to change. Flights and ferry services continue to operate between Ireland and Great Britain. Some flight operators have already announced that service will reduce in the coming days. If you’re visiting Ireland, you should closely monitor public announcements on flight and ferry services, and be prepared to adjust your travel plans accordingly.
You will need to pay for your return travel to the UK. If departure options are available but you cannot afford the travel costs and have exhausted all other options for getting funds, you may be eligible to apply for an emergency loan from the government. This is a last resort option and you would need to repay the loan when you are back in the UK. For more information, contact Corporate Travel Management (CTM).

Arrival in the UK
