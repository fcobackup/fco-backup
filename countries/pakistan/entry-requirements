The information on this page covers the most common types of travel and reflects the UK government’s understanding of the rules currently in place. Unless otherwise stated, this information is for travellers using a full ‘British Citizen’ passport.
The authorities in the country or territory you’re travelling to are responsible for setting and enforcing the rules for entry. If you’re unclear about any aspect of the entry requirements, or you need further reassurance, you’ll need to contact the embassy, high commission or consulate of the country or territory you’re travelling to.
Restrictions in response to coronavirus
Entry and travel restrictions
The Pakistani authorities have closed land borders with Afghanistan, India and Iran. Despite this, there have been limited border openings for repatriation. Those crossing into Pakistan may have to comply with coronavirus testing and quarantine measures.
Screening and quarantine measures for international air arrivals
International air passengers travelling to Pakistan will be subject to thermal screening on arrival. The current Pakistan Civil Aviation Authority (CAA) guidelines include measures to quarantine all passengers on arrival, either in a free facility arranged by the Government of Pakistan, or in a facility which the passenger will pay for. Airlines are responsible for recording which facility passengers prefer. No meet and greet will be permitted at the airport.
Passengers will be tested for COVID-19 as soon as possible on arrival at a quarantine facility. Those testing positive will likely remain in quarantine or be moved to a hospital isolation facility, while those testing negative will be released with instructions to self-isolate for 14 days. Please call the British High Commission on 051 201 2000 in the event that you are moved to a quarantine facility. Before travelling, make sure you have a form of payment for food and water during this quarantine and testing period.
You may also be required to follow special measures before boarding flights to Pakistan and while on board the aircraft, including the wearing of a surgical mask. Reinforcement of screening and administrative measures at all sea ports has been announced.
