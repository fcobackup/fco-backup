Restrictions in response to coronavirus
Slovakia has closed its international airports at Bratislava, Kosice and Poprad to scheduled passenger flights.
As of 13 March, entry to Slovakia is permitted only for Slovak citizens foreigners with proof of residency in Slovakia, and other foreign nationals under certain conditions.
As of 6 April, it is mandatory to pre-register with the Slovak authorities 72 hours in advance of travel to Slovakia and then on arrival enter mandatory quarantine in a government facility for 14 days. Once tested negative for COVID-19, the remainder of the 14 days can be spent in self-isolation at home.
If you qualify under one of the exceptions for mandatory quarantine in a government facility, you must still self-isolate at home for 14 days or risk incurring a fine of up to €1,650. For a list of exceptions and requirements, check the website of the Slovak government.
As of 21 May, if you have permanent/temporary residence in Slovakia and are travelling to the Czech Republic, Poland, Hungary, Austria, Croatia, Slovenia, Switzerland or Germany and return within 24 hours, you will not need to show a negative Covid-19 test or enter mandatory quarantine.

You should check the entry requirements for the county you plan to travel to on the relevant FCO Travel Advice.
