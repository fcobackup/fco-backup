Entry rules in response to coronavirus
Entry to Kenya
Effective from 11 June, all flight restrictions between Kenya and the United Kingdom have been lifted.
The Kenyan Civil Aviation Authority announced that the following conditions will now apply to travellers:
All passengers/crew, irrespective of nationality and residency status, coming to Kenya from the UK via any route of travel must be in possession of a valid COVID-19 negative PCR test certificate conducted within 96 hours before travel. Children under the age of five are exempt from this requirement.
All passengers/crew irrespective of nationality and residency status coming to Kenya from the UK via any route of travel shall be required to self-isolate for seven days upon arrival and must take a PCR test four days after arrival. Passengers shall submit daily health information, including the results of their day four PCR test, on the Jitenge Platform / App for 14 consecutive days. For more information, please see the ‘Data Collection’ section below.
All negative COVID-19 test results must prove that they have been taken no more than 96 hours before travel to Kenya and be verified digitally through the Trusted Travel Initiative.
If you travel to Kenya you will also need to complete a COVID-19 Travellers Health Surveillance Form.
Full details of the Government of Kenya Protocols which can be found on the Kenya Civil Aviation Authority website.
Data collection
All travellers arriving in Kenya must complete a COVID-19 Travellers Health Surveillance Form before their arrival, even if only transiting. The online registration form can be found on the “Jitenge” platform, accessible via the following link or the “Jitenge” App (available on the Google Play Store). After submitting the form, travellers will receive a QR code which must be presented to port health officials for them to be allowed to proceed to arrival immigration. Arrivals will then be expected to self-monitor and report daily to the same platform for their first 14 days in Kenya.
Regular entry requirements
Visas
You need a visa to enter Kenya. Kenyan entry visas are exclusively issued electronically, with passengers required to obtain their e-visas before departure. You can apply for single entry and transit visas on the e-visas website
For more information, see the website of the Kenyan High Commission in London.
Passport validity
Your passport should be valid for a minimum period of 6 months from the date of entry into Kenya. Make sure you have two blank pages in your passport on arrival.
UK Emergency Travel Documents
UK Emergency Travel Documents (ETDs) are accepted for entry, airside transit and exit from Kenya. ETDs must be valid for 6 months.
All ETD applicants are required to obtain an exit stamp from Kenyan Immigration prior to departure.
Yellow fever certificate requirements
You may need a yellow fever certificate when entering Kenya from certain destinations. Check whether you need a yellow fever certificate by visiting the National Travel Health Network and Centre’s TravelHealthPro website.
Work permits
If you’re coming to live and work in Kenya, you must have a work permit before starting employment. It’s illegal to work without one. This needs to be applied for before coming to Kenya to work. This also applies to voluntary work and the self-employed. You can apply for a work permit at the Department of Immigration Services website. The government of Kenya has recently reiterated the need for all foreign workers in Kenya to have (and carry with them) the necessary work permits and documentation, and has promised swift action against those who do not comply; this includes deportation. Work permits are not always granted; the Government of Kenya is prioritising the availability of high quality jobs for Kenyan nationals, and may not grant a work permit to a British national if the job in question could be done by a Kenyan national.
If you’re already in Kenya, and your application for a work permit is successful, you will be required to hand in your passport to immigration for a permit stamp to be inserted. During this period, you should always carry a certified copy of your passport for identification purposes. A local lawyer can provide this. On 20 April 2018, the government of Kenya announced a shift to e-permits replacing all existing and future work permits. Anyone holding or needing a work permit was required to register for an e-permit at Nyayo House before 21 July 2018. If you’ve missed this deadline, you should seek advice from Nyayo House.
