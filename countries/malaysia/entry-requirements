This page reflects the UK government’s understanding of current rules for people travelling on a full ‘British Citizen’ passport, for the most common types of travel.
The authorities in Malaysia set and enforce entry rules. For further information contact the embassy, high commission or consulate of the country or territory you’re travelling to. You should also consider checking with your transport provider or travel company to make sure your passport and other travel documents meet their requirements.
Entry rules in response to coronavirus
Entry to Malaysia
Entry to Malaysia for most British nationals is prohibited. Some exemptions may apply, including: British nationals with permanent resident status, resident pass, My Second Home Programme (MM2H) pass, expatriates of all categories, including professional visit passes as well as dependants pass, spouse to Malaysian nationals (spouse visa) and students and temporary employment passes.
You are not permitted to enter Malaysia as a tourist, except for travel to Langkawi Island under the international tourism bubble. Strict requirements are in place to travel to Langkawi. Further information is available from the Ministry of Tourism (MOTAC).
The situation is changing regularly, and any British national who wishes to enter Malaysia will need to seek permission from the local Malaysian Embassy/High Commission or the Immigration Directorate before travelling.
If you normally reside in Malaysia and wish to seek further guidance, contact the Malaysian High Commission or Embassy in the country you currently stay for further guidance and your airline and keep up to date with developments, including this travel advice. You may need to complete an application on the MYTravelPass online platform. You should speak to the local Malaysian authorities for further guidance.
If you are permitted to travel to Malaysia, you must follow the testing and quarantine requirements outlined below.
Transiting Malaysia
You can transit (up to 24 hours only) via Kuala Lumpur International Airport (KLIA) as long as you remain airside.
Transit that requires passage through immigration (to collect bags, or to move between the two Kuala Lumpur terminals - KLIA and KLIA2) is not possible, unless you meet the general immigration requirements above.
Testing/screen on arrival
When arriving in Malaysia you must provide a negative lateral flow/RTK antigen test result up to 48 hours before departure.
All arrivals are required to take a COVID-19 PCR test and undergo additional medical screening on arrival (even if you have a negative test from your country of origin). All arrivals must also take a PCR test at the end of the quarantine period.
Arrivals from the UK must also undertake a daily lateral flow/RTK-Ag self-test during quarantining.
Quarantine requirements
Most arrivals into Malaysia are required to undertake a period of quarantine at designated quarantine centres, or at home in some circumstances, subject to approval. You will need to meet all costs associated with your quarantine. You will need to download the MySejahtera app.
From 13 January 2022, if you are fully vaccinated and have recently been infected with COVID-19 (11-60 days before departure), you may be exempted from mandatory quarantine. A printed or digital copy of the laboratory test results will be required as evidence of infection. A COVID-19 test 2 days before departure is still required.
If you are arriving from a high-risk country with high COVID-19 Omicron variant cases reported, including the UK, you will be required to wear a digital tracker throughout your quarantine. In addition, if you are arriving from the UK you must undertake a daily lateral flow/RTK-Ag self-test during quarantine.
If you are unvaccinated/not fully vaccinated you must observe a 10 day quarantine upon entry to Malaysia.
If you are fully vaccinated with a WHO approved vaccine, but have not recently been infected with COVID-19, you must observe a 7 day quarantine upon entry to Malaysia.
If you were hospitalised due to COVID-19 within 11-60 days before departure, you are also required to submit a fit to travel letter from the hospital.
If you are fully vaccinated and have a residence in Malaysia you may be allowed to quarantine at home under a digital home surveillance order, rather than in a quarantine centre. Follow the instructions in any forms required to return to Malaysia to ascertain if you meet the requirements to do home quarantine.
If you have an onward domestic flight in peninsular Malaysia, you will undergo quarantine in Kuala Lumpur. Any onward flight to a regional airport will need to be booked at a later date.
If you’re travelling to East Malaysia (Sabah or Sarawak) please consult the Malaysian High Commission/Embassy and your airline as regards quarantine procedures and onward travel from Kuala Lumpur to these states. Sabah and Sarawak have additional immigration rules in place. You will only be permitted to enter if you have permanent residence or an employment pass in the relevant state.
If you are required to quarantine, the British High Commission is unable to assist you with not having to do it, regardless of your circumstances.
Demonstrating your COVID-19 vaccination status
Although we understand that the UK’s proof of COVID-19 vaccination status is being accepted in practice, Malaysia has not yet officially confirmed this. We therefore recommend that you contact your nearest Malaysia embassy for advice on entry requirements. Your NHS appointment card from vaccination centres is not designed to be used as proof of vaccination.

Regular entry requirements
Visas
British nationals do not need a visa to visit Malaysia. You will normally be given permission to stay for 3 months on arrival. Visas for longer stays or for non-tourist purposes must be obtained from the nearest Malaysian diplomatic mission before you travel.
The Malaysian authorities are running a vigorous campaign against illegal immigration. Do not overstay your visa, or violate the terms of entry. Even if you overstay for just a few days, you can be fined, detained, deported to the UK and blacklisted. Flight costs will be the responsibility of the individual.
If you’re travelling between Peninsular Malaysia and East Malaysia (sometimes known as Malaysian Borneo and comprising the states of Sabah and Sarawak) you will need to carry your passport. You must get an entry stamp in East Malaysia at your initial port of entry.
Regional travel
UK citizens who wish to travel in the region should consult the appropriate travel advice page.
Passport validity
Your passport should be valid for a minimum period of 6 months from the date of entry into Malaysia. You might be refused entry if its validity is less than 6 months.
Yellow fever certificate requirements
Check whether you need a yellow fever certificate by visiting the National Travel Health Network and Centre’s TravelHealthPro website.
UK Emergency Travel Documents
UK Emergency Travel Documents (ETDs) are accepted for exit from Malaysia. You’re likely to need to get a special exit pass from Malaysian Immigration before leaving and there will be a cost for this. If travelling to another country, other than the UK, you will need to check with the relevant Embassy if a visa is needed in the ETD. If you plan to use an ETD to enter or transit through Malaysia, check entry requirements with the nearest Malaysian Embassy or High Commission before you travel.
Dual nationals
Malaysia doesn’t recognise dual nationality. You can be refused entry if you’re found to be holding a Malaysian passport and one of a different nationality. For those people with dual nationality (not including Malaysian), we advise entering and exiting with the same passport.
Exchange control rules
You can import or export up to 10,000 Malaysian Ringgit without prior approval. There are no limits on the amount of foreign currency you can import or export, but you must declare any amount in excess of US$ 10,000. Penalties include a fine of up to RM 1 million and up to 3 years’ imprisonment. Further information can be found on the Royal Malaysian Customs Department website.
