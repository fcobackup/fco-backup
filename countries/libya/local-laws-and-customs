Local laws reflect that Libya is an Islamic country. You should respect local traditions, customs, laws and religious customs at all times, especially during the holy month of Ramadan.
Religion
Local laws in Libya strictly prohibit proselytising, evangelising and any attempts to convert Muslims to another religion.
LGBT+
Homosexual acts (applying to both sexes) are illegal in Libya. Be sensitive to local laws and customs and avoid public displays of affection. See our information and advice page for the LGBT+ community before you travel.
Alcohol laws and bans
Drug and alcohol offences, including consumption, possession and trafficking, are treated seriously in Libya and are punishable by law.
There are often complex bureaucratic procedures needed to travel for work in Libya. It is important you ensure you have followed all relevant protocols and procedures if you intend to travel for work or business. You are likely to be at risk of intimidation, harassment and detention if you fail to comply with local customs.
Using cameras near military facilities
