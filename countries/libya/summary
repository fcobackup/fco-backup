Military clashes and inter-militia fighting pose significant risks to air travel in Libya. It has periodically caused the temporary suspension or closure of airports. All airports are vulnerable to attack. Mitiga Airport, Tripoli’s only functioning civilian airport, has been regularly shelled by artillery, most recently on 9 May 2020. See Air travel
Since April 2019, there has been a significant build-up of militarised forces across western and central Libya. There is an increased risk of localised inter-militia clashes throughout Libya amid tensions about the postponed 24 December 2021 presidential elections and the wider political process. See Safety and security
Terrorists are very likely to try to carry out attacks in Libya. There remains a high threat throughout the country of terrorist attacks and kidnap against foreigners, including from Daesh-affiliated extremists (formerly referred to as ISIL) and Al Qaida, as well as armed militias. Daesh and Al Qaeda have attacked a number of oil and gas installations and killed or kidnapped workers, including foreign nationals. See Terrorism
In August and September 2020 both Tripoli and Benghazi saw demonstrations against deteriorating living conditions and corruption. Pockets of violence were seen, with reports of civilians being shot and wounded.
