Warning
FCDO advises against all but essential travel to parts of Kosovo.

This advice reflects the UK government’s understanding of current rules for people travelling on a full ‘British citizen’ passport from the UK, for the most common types of travel.
The authorities in Kosovo set and enforce entry rules. If you’re not sure how these requirements apply to you, contact the Embassy of the Republic of Kosovo in the UK.
COVID-19 rules
There are no COVID-19 testing or vaccination requirements for travellers entering Kosovo.
Passport validity requirements
Check with your travel provider to make sure your passport and other travel documents meet requirements.
Your passport must be undamaged and valid for the duration of your stay. You do not need an additional period of validity beyond this.
Checks at border control
Make sure you get your passport stamped.
Kosovo-Serbia border
The authorities in Serbia do not consider the designated crossing points with Kosovo to be official international border crossing points.
However, it is possible to travel from Serbia to Kosovo, and back again.
You cannot travel from Kosovo to Serbia without a Serbian entry stamp from Belgrade, Niš or Kraljevo airports, or one of Serbia’s other border crossings with:
Bosnia and Herzegovina
Bulgaria
Croatia
Hungary
Montenegro
North Macedonia
Romania
You are likely to be refused entry without a valid Serbian entry stamp. You should take a route through a third country.
Border guards have denied foreign nationals entry to Serbia if they have Republic of Kosovo stamps in their passports.
We are also aware of isolated incidents where Serbian authorities have cancelled Kosovo stamps in passports of foreign nationals.
Tensions between Serbia and Kosovo can cause difficulties at border crossings with Kosovo.
Visa requirements
You do not need a visa to enter or travel through Kosovo as a visitor.
You may be asked to provide documentary evidence giving a reason for your stay or showing you have sufficient finances. Officials will issue 90-day entry stamp, which is renewable for longer stays. Citizens of EU member states can enter Kosovo on a photo ID card.
If you plan to stay in Kosovo for longer than 90 days, you will need to register with the Ministry of Internal Affairs for a residence permit.
Vaccination requirements
At least 8 weeks before your trip, check the vaccinations and certificates you need in TravelHealthPro Kosovo guide.
Customs rules
There are strict rules about goods you can take into or out of Kosovo. You must declare anything that may be prohibited or subject to tax or duty.
