The FCO strongly encourage British nationals in Nicaragua to consider leaving to avoid difficulties they will face if flights out of the country and the region are further restricted and they are unable to get home.
Resident and non-resident British nationals in Nicaragua who wish to leave should contact their airline or tour operator.
