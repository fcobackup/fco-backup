The information on this page covers the most common types of travel and reflects the UK government’s understanding of the rules currently in place. Unless otherwise stated, this information is for travellers using a full ‘British Citizen’ passport.
The authorities in the country or territory you’re travelling to are responsible for setting and enforcing the rules for entry. If you’re unclear about any aspect of the entry requirements, or you need further reassurance, you’ll need to contact the embassy, high commission or consulate of the country or territory you’re travelling to.
You should also consider checking with your transport provider or travel company to make sure your passport and other travel documents meet their requirements.
Entry rules in response to coronavirus (COVID-19)
Entry to Iceland
From 1 January all non-essential travel by British citizens from the UK/other non EU/EEA country to Iceland is not permitted, unless you are resident in Iceland or fall under their exempt category of traveller.
Essential travel is still permitted and a list of exemptions for entering Iceland can be found here.
These restrictions do not apply to UK nationals who are legally resident in Iceland. You will be allowed to re-enter the country, but may need to show proof of residence.
All passengers arriving in Iceland can choose to self-isolate for 14 days upon arrival or take two COVID-19 tests, one on arrival and another 5-6 days later. The test can be booked in advance . Children born in 2005 or later will be exempt from both testing and self-isolation. You should not use the NHS testing service to get a test in order to facilitate your travel to another country. You should arrange to take a private test.
Those opting to test instead of the 14 day self-isolation period must now follow quarantine measures until the result of the second test is known. This will significantly affect what you can and cannot do on arrival. If you have booked a trip to Iceland you should contact your tour operator and travel insurer about what this means for you and your plans.
The Icelandic Authorities are now accepting certain certificates regarding previous COVID-19 infection at the border. If you hold one of these you will be exempted from testing or quarantine requirements. However, Border control will evaluate whether the certificate is valid and correct. If you present a document that is deemed invalid then you must choose between 14 days quarantine, or double testing with shorter quarantine.
You must also fill in a pre-registration form before departure. You can find further information, including exemptions, and a video walk through of the process from the Icelandic authorities at Covid.is (available in English).
Data collection
Upon arrival you will be encouraged to sign up to the contact tracing app Rakning C-19. Further information, including how to download it, data usage, privacy and scope is available on the Rakning C-19 website.
Testing / screening on arrival
If you test positive on arrival you will be required to enter self-isolation (at your hotel or government-provided accommodation) unless further tests determine the infection is inactive.
You may also need to be tested again or enter self-isolation if you are exposed to a possible infection during your trip eg during the flight to Iceland.
Regular entry requirements
Visas
If you hold a British Citizen passport, you don’t need a visa to enter Iceland. If you’re planning to stay longer than 3 months, see our Living in Iceland guide and contact the Icelandic Directorate of Immigration, Útlendingastofnun, Skogarhlid 6, 105 Reykjavík (tel: 510-5400) if you have further questions.
The rules on travel will stay the same until 31 December 2020.
Visas from 1 January 2021
The rules for travelling or working in Europe will change from 1 January 2021:
you will be able to travel to countries in the Schengen area for up to 90 days in any 180-day period without a visa as a tourist, to visit family or friends, to attend business meetings, cultural or sports events, or for short-term studies or training.
if you are travelling to Iceland and other Schengen countries without a visa, make sure your whole visit is within the limit. Visits to Schengen countries within the previous 180 days before you travel would count towards the 90-day limit
to stay for longer, to work or study, for business travel or for other reasons, you will need to meet the entry requirements set out by Iceland*. This could mean applying for a visa and/or work permit. You should check with the Icelandic Directorate of Immigration what type of visa and/or work permit, if any, you will need
if you are in Iceland with a visa or permit, your stay will not count towards the 90-day limit
The 90-day limit for visa-free travel will begin on 1 January 2021. Any days you stay in Iceland or other Schengen countries before 1 January 2021 will not count towards the 90-day limit.
At border control for Iceland, you may need to:
show a return or onward ticket
show you have enough money for your stay, and
use separate lanes from EU, EEA and Swiss citizens when queueing
Your passport may be stamped on entry and exit.
If you are a British resident in Iceland, you are advised to obtain a letter confirming your status from Registers Iceland if you intend to return to Iceland from abroad after 1 January 2021. Our Living in Guide contains more information.
Passport validity
The rules on travel will stay the same until 31 December 2020.
Your passport should be valid for the proposed duration of your stay; you don’t need any additional period of validity on your passport beyond this.
Passport validity from 1 January 2021
From 1 January 2021, you must have at least 6 months left on an adult or child passport to travel to most countries in Europe (not including Ireland).
If you renewed your current passport before the previous one expired, extra months may have been added to its expiry date. Any extra months on your passport over 10 years may not count towards the 6 months needed.
Check your passport is valid for travel before you book your trip. You will need to renew your passport before travelling if you do not have enough time left on your passport.
UK Emergency Travel Documents
UK Emergency Travel Documents are accepted for entry, airside transit and exit from Iceland.
