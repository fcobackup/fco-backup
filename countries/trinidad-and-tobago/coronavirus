Be prepared for your plans to change
No travel is risk-free during COVID. Countries may further restrict travel or bring in new rules at short notice, for example due to a new COVID-19 variant. Check with your travel company or airline for any transport changes which may delay your journey home.
If you test positive for COVID-19, you may need to stay where you are until you test negative. You may also need to seek treatment there. If you are staying in hotel accommodation and you test positive you may be moved to a government supervised quarantine facility (e.g. an approved hotel), with guidance and assistance from the Ministry of Health.
Plan ahead and make sure you:
can access money
understand what your insurance will cover
can make arrangements to extend your stay and be away for longer than planned

Under the public health regulations of 31 August 2020, it is a legal requirement for all individuals aged 8 years and over to wear a mask in public spaces. Failure to do so attracts a fine.

The government previously introduced a range of restrictions to curtail the increase in COVID-19 cases. Outdoor sports and exercise in public places is now permitted, including team sports. Places of worship are fully open with no restrictions on the length of service or numerical capacity, though mask wearing in public spaces and on public transportation remains mandatory. Effective 4 April there are no limits on public gatherings.

Effective 4 April, all restrictions placed at safe zones in Trinidad and Tobago were removed. Beaches are fully open. Rivers, ponds, and other bodies of water are also now open. There are no restrictions at beaches or rivers.
