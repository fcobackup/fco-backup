If you test positive for COVID-19, you may need to stay where you are until you test negative. You may also need to seek treatment there.
Plan ahead and make sure you:
can access money
understand what your insurance will cover
can make arrangements to extend your stay and be away for longer than planned
Travel in Tonga
Tonga is currently subject to two States of Emergency and National COVID-19 Lockdown Restrictions.
A State of Emergency for Public Health was renewed by the government of the Kingdom of Tonga until 8pm on 6 June. A second State of Emergency, following the Hunga-Tonga Hunga-Ha’apai volcanic eruption, has also been renewed until 8am on 5 June2022. The latter lists several Tongan islands, plus locations on Tongatapu and Ha’apai, that members of the public are prohibited from entering during this period.
Under the National COVID-19 Lockdown Restrictions, Tonga operates a Traffic Light Framework which sets the baseline restrictions and any differing timings of the overnight curfew on each island.
