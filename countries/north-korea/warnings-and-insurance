Warning
FCDO advises against all but essential travel to North Korea.

Your travel insurance could be invalidated if you travel against advice from the Foreign, Commonwealth & Development Office (FCDO). 
FCDO advises against all but essential travel to North Korea
The level of tension on the Korean Peninsula remains high. While daily life in the capital city, Pyongyang, may appear calm, the security situation in North Korea can change quickly with no advance warning about possible actions by the authorities. This poses significant risks to British visitors and residents. See Safety and security.
Border restrictions
North Korea’s borders have been closed to general entry since the government imposed COVID-19 border restrictions in 2020.
The government has recently started to relax the COVID restrictions. As a result, some embassies have resumed normal operations and some limited tourism has restarted.
However, the North Korean government has not resumed all passenger routes into and out of North Korea. Many embassies – including the British Embassy in Pyongyang – remain closed. 
Support from the UK government
The North Korean authorities have previously detained foreign nationals for allegedly violating local laws and have denied them access to support from their governments. 
The few British people who visit North Korea are usually part of an organised tour. If you decide to visit North Korea against FCDO advice, follow the guidance of your tour operator and the local authorities. Failure to do so could put your personal safety at risk. 
Support from FCDO is severely limited, especially while there is no British Embassy presence. Remote support is available if you’re able to contact us online or by phone. However, the routine lack of access to internet and mobile networks makes it almost impossible to communicate outside of North Korea. See Getting help.
