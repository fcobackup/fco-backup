Risks of regional escalation 
Following Israeli strikes against targets in Iran, Iran has launched multiple rounds of missile and drone attacks against Israel. Iran aligned militia groups are also likely to continue to conduct attacks. On 13 June a nationwide state of emergency was declared in Israel. Israeli airspace remains closed and Ben Gurion Airport is currently closed. 
This is a fast-moving situation that poses significant risks. The situation has the potential to deteriorate further, quickly and without warning. The current situation has disrupted air links out of the country and may disrupt road links and border crossings. We encourage you to read the FCDO’s advice on if you’re affected by a crisis abroad
Family members of staff at the British Embassy in Tel Aviv and the British Consulate in Jerusalem have been temporarily withdrawn as a precautionary measure.
The Embassy and Consulate continues with essential work including services to British nationals.
Any attacks could be indiscriminate, including places visited by foreign nationals such as: 
The Old City in Jerusalem 
Government, military and police installations 
Security personnel including military and police
Transport networks

Crowded places
