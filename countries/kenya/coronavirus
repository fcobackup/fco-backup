Plan ahead and make sure you:
can access money
understand what your insurance will cover
can make arrangements to extend your stay and be away for longer than planned
Renewal of visas
The Kenyan Immigration Department has lifted a COVID-19-related amnesty on visitors who have overstayed their stipulated visiting period. You should ensure that your stay in Kenya complies with Kenyan immigration requirements.
Travel in Kenya
A curfew is in effect across Kenya from 10pm to 4am (local time). During curfew hours, everyone must stay at home or indoors, except for essential service workers.
The Government of Kenya has asked individuals to avoid unnecessary movement and gatherings.
The Government of Kenya has advised that passengers departing the airport during curfew must retain their boarding pass as proof of their arrival time, which will allow for movement to their accommodation. Similarly, evidence of air passengers arriving during curfew will enable access for drivers coming to collect passengers during curfew hours.
You do not need a COVID-19 negative test to board domestic flights within Kenya. However, the Government have introduced a digital domestic travel locator card system, which will generate a QR code to present to Port Health Officials at domestic arrivals.
Travellers can access the digital passenger locator form here or via the “Jitenge” app, downloadable from Google Playstore (Android users only). iPhone users should make sure to use Chrome or Firefox when accessing the form via the URL. Upon submission of the digital locator form, a QR code will be sent to your email address.
For Android users, if you are unable to access the QR code via email, log-in to your Jitenge account and input the phone number used to register, as well as your passport or ID number. Your name will appear, then click on your name and select “Show QR code”. Screenshot the QR code and present this at the Health Desk upon arrival.
For iPhone users unable to access their QR code via email, check your downloads folder or present your phone number and passport number at the Health Desk at arrivals to allow officials to retrieve your QR code.
