The Republic of Congo authorities have introduced a number of measures in response to the coronavirus (COVID-19) pandemic.
Entry and borders
On 21 March, the Republic of Congo closed all land, air and maritime borders until further notice with the exception of cargo flight and vessels. You should urgently contact your airline if you are due to travel to or from Republic of Congo.
All persons coming from countries designated as high-risk by the Government of Republic of Congo will be subject to mandatory quarantine. These countries are China, Italy, France, South Korea and Iran though this list is subject to change at short notice. Visitors who have travelled from/to these countries will now be quarantined for two weeks on arrival in Congo.
You should comply with any additional screening measures put in place by the authorities and keep up to date with information from your tour operator, transport or accommodation provider on the impact on any existing travel plans.
Further information
If you need further information about entry requirements, contact the local immigration authorities of the nearest Republic of Congo embassy. You should also check with your airline or travel company for the latest information.
Further information on coronavirus, including advice on preparing for foreign travel and helping reduce the spread of the virus, is available from Public Health England and on the TravelHealthPro website.
