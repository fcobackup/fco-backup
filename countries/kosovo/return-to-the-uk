Following measures taken by the authorities in Kosovo, there are very limited commercial options for returning to the UK from Kosovo.
The only commercial means of leaving Kosovo to return to the UK currently available is an Air Albania flight scheduled to depart from Tirana to London at 12:00 (noon) on Monday 18 May.
To purchase a ticket, you must first call Air Albania (contact number +355 4 2246000) to secure a purchasing code. Once you have obtained a code, proceed to the Air Albania booking website: www.airalbania.com.al/en/
If you are currently in Kosovo, and you book a seat on this flight from Tirana, you should email the British Embassy in Pristina (Pristina.Consular@fco.gov.uk) by 16:00 on Thursday 14 May, so we can facilitate your border crossing into Albania to board the flight. You will need to include your full name, passport number and date of birth in your email. There may be a charge for crossing the border, depending on the number of travellers.
This is a commercial flight, which means the ticket price will have to be paid by the traveller. There are currently no plans for repatriation flights from Kosovo

You will need to pay for your return travel to the UK. If departure options are available but you cannot afford the travel costs and have exhausted all other options for getting funds, you may be eligible to apply for an emergency loan from the government. This is a last resort option and you would need to repay the loan when you are back in the UK.
