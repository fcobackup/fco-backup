Before you travel check that:
your destination can provide the healthcare you may need
you have appropriate travel insurance for local treatment or unexpected medical evacuation
This is particularly important if you have a health condition or are pregnant.
Emergency medical number
Call 131 and ask for an ambulance.
Contact your insurance company quickly if you’re referred to a medical facility for treatment.
