There are currently no commercial options available to return to the UK from Jordan.
Flights in and out of the country have been suspended, and land and sea borders are closed. The Government of Jordan has confirmed that these measures will remain in place until 27 April, and there are strong indications that the flight suspension and border closures will continue beyond this date.
We know this is concerning for British people trying to leave Jordan. Where commercial operators are able, in exceptional cases, to negotiate flights out of Jordan, the British Embassy will do all it can to facilitate access to flights for British nationals and provide appropriate support in arranging your departure. British nationals will need to ensure that onward travel to the UK from the flight’s destination is possible.
This travel advice will be updated if and when departure options become available. Sign up for travel advice email alerts.
If you cannot leave Jordan at this time, you should:
follow the advice of local authorities, including local measures to help minimise your risk of exposure to coronavirus
find accommodation suitable for your needs.
keep in regular contact with family and friends at home, so they know you are safe and well *consult your insurance provider, tour operator, and transport or accommodation provider about the impact of the situation n your plans.
