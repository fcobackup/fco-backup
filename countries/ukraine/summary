The FCDO advise against all travel to Ukraine.
British nationals in Ukraine should leave now while commercial means are still available.
If you are a British national still in Ukraine, you should register your presence in Ukraine. This will allow us to provide the latest information. You should also continue to read and follow FCDO Travel Advice.
Since January 2022, the build-up of Russian forces on Ukraine’s borders has increased the threat of military action.
The British Embassy office in Kyiv is temporarily relocating. Embassy staff are operating from the British Embassy office in Lviv.
British nationals should leave while commercial options remain. If you are in need of assistance to leave Ukraine, you should call +380 44 490 3660 or +44 (0)1908 516666 and select the option for “consular services for British nationals.” You can also send an enquiry via the web contact form.
The British Embassy is operating an office in Lviv which can issue documentation and provide some consular assistance. Access to the office in Lviv will be by appointment only.
Any Russian military action in Ukraine would severely affect the British Government’s ability to provide consular assistance in Ukraine. British Nationals should not expect increased consular support or help with evacuating in these circumstances.

*‘Immediate family member’ is defined as spouse/unmarried partner/ child under the age of 18/ parent if British National is child under 18/ adult dependant who normally resides with you due to a medical condition.
If you decide to remain in Ukraine, you should remain vigilant throughout due to potential combat operations, keep your departure plans under constant review and ensure your travel documents are up to date. You should monitor the media and this travel advice regularly, subscribe to email alerts and read our advice on how to deal with a crisis overseas.
Public demonstrations regularly take place. Policing of these events may include road closures. You should avoid all demonstrations and take extra care at public gatherings.
