Crime
There is a moderate level of crime in Zimbabwe. People travelling alone may be more vulnerable. Mugging, pick-pocketing and jewellery theft are common in city centres, especially after dark. Street lighting can be poor. Remain vigilant when leaving banks and cash points. Don’t carry or display large amounts of cash in public places.
There have been occasional armed robberies targeting foreign residents. Make sure your accommodation is secure at all times.
There have been thefts and smash-and-grab robberies from vehicles, including at the main intersections along the route to Robert Gabriel Mugabe International Airport, along Liberation Legacy Way (Borrowdale Road) and Churchill Road in Harare, and on the Masvingo-Beitbridge road. You should be particularly vigilant when using these routes. Keep vehicle doors locked and windows closed. Be careful at night and at filling stations. Don’t leave your vehicle unattended in unguarded areas in towns.
Carry your Zimbabwean resident ID or a photocopy of your passport at all times. You are advised to leave your original passport somewhere safe. If you lose your British passport, you will need to get a police report and apply online for an Emergency Travel Document.
Local travel
Zimbabwe has many safari lodges and game reserves. Safety standards vary and you should check whether operators are trained and licensed. There have been a number of incidents in which animals have attacked visitors, resulting in injuries and, in some cases, death. You should treat wild animals with caution and respect and keep a safe distance from them at all times. Some activities, such as walking or canoe safaris, could pose risks to personal safety. You should ensure your Travel Insurance covers all the activities you plan on doing while in Zimbabwe.
Zimbabwe is currently experiencing some electricity shortages resulting in extended periods without power. During blackouts, you should exercise a high degree of caution when driving as traffic lights may not be operational. Water rationing is being experienced in certain parts of the country. Contact your tour operator or hotel for latest updates.
The Zimbabwean mobile phone network and land lines are unreliable.
Rural areas
There continue to be invasions of commercial farms, sometimes accompanied by violence and threats. Take care when visiting farming areas that you are not familiar with.
The diamond mining area in Marange is a restricted area. If you are stopped and told that you may not access a particular area, you should turn back.
Road travel
You can drive in Zimbabwe using a full UK driving licence for up to 12 months. If you’re a resident in Zimbabwe, you may wish to get a Zimbabwean licence to minimise the potential for problems at road blocks. Make sure you have your personal documents such as your passport and visa (we recommend photocopies) at all times. You’ll also require a police vehicle clearance certificate (temporary import permit) if you’re bringing in a non-Zimbabwe registered vehicle.
You must obey police signals, stop at roadblocks and toll-gates and produce identification if asked to do so. You should insist on a receipt for any fine you’re asked to pay.
It’s an offence to continue driving when the President’s motorcade goes past, no matter which side of the road you’re on. If you see the motorcade, pull off the road or onto the side of the road if this isn’t possible. There have been a number of incidents where people have been assaulted by the security forces for stopping in the wrong place or for not stopping soon enough.
Traffic accidents are a common cause of death and injury in Zimbabwe. There are often deep potholes in the roads. Traffic lights are often out of action. Vehicles and roads are often poorly lit and roads badly marked. Abandoned unlit heavy goods vehicles, cyclists without lights, pedestrians and stray livestock are particular hazards. The standard of driving is generally poor. Emergency services may provide very limited help in the event of an accident and ambulances are often delayed.
You should avoid driving outside the main towns at night and travel carefully on inter-city roads. Always wear seatbelts, lock car doors and carry a comprehensive medical kit. Be careful about stopping at lay-bys, particularly in the Beitbridge area, as there have been incidents of cars being robbed and occupants attacked.
Plan carefully before setting out on long distance journeys. Availability of fuel can be sporadic and queues are not unusual, so either carry extra fuel or top up your tank whenever possible. You are advised to check in advance if you can make payment with an international payment card. Seek up-to-date local advice about any places that you plan to visit.
Public transport
Public transport and services are unreliable. Commuter omnibuses or “combis” are often overcrowded, inadequately maintained, uninsured and recklessly driven. You should avoid them if possible. Larger intercity buses may also be poorly driven. There have been a number of serious road accidents involving long distance buses travelling at night.
Major hotels usually have their own taxis which can be used safely for local city travel. Taxis recommended by hotels are usually reliable and in good condition.
Rail travel
The rail system is underdeveloped and very poorly maintained. Level crossings are poorly marked, resulting in numerous accidents. Passenger services are currently suspended, you should check with National Railways of Zimbabwe for updates.
Air travel
There are indirect commercial flights between the UK and Zimbabwe. Please check carefully with your travel provider which routes are available along with any additional requirements for your transit countries. You should also check the FCDO Travel Advice when planning a journey.
The UK Air Safety List (ASL) lists all known airlines in Zimbabwe that do not meet international safety standards and are banned from operating commercial air services to, from, and within the UK. Check the UK Air Safety List when considering which airlines to fly with. The list is maintained by the Department for Transport, based on advice from the UK Civil Aviation Authority. British government employees travelling to and within Zimbabwe have been advised to use carriers that are not on the UK ASL.
Political situation
The Zimbabwe Electoral Commission announced the results of Zimbabwe’s general election on 26 August. Avoid any political gatherings or demonstrations.
Demonstrations and rallies can be unpredictable and may turn violent. Authorities have in the past used force to suppress them. Avoid political activity, or activities which could be considered political, including political discussions in public places or online. You should exercise a high degree of caution and monitor local media for developments.
It is an offence to make derogatory or insulting comments about the President or to carry material considered to be offensive to the President’s office.
