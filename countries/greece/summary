The Foreign, Commonwealth & Development Office (FCDO) advises against all but essential travel to:
Greece based on the current assessment of COVID-19 risks. The FCDO is not advising against travel to the islands of Rhodes, Kos, Zakynthos, Corfu and Crete.
If you are returning to the UK from Greece (apart from the islands of Rhodes, Kos, Zakynthos, Corfu and Crete), you will need to self-isolate on your return (unless you are exempt). Check the latest guidance for England, Northern Ireland, Scotland and Wales.
The FCDO is not advising those already travelling in Greece to leave at this time. Travellers should follow the advice of the local authorities on how best to protect themselves and others, including any measures that they bring in to control the virus. You should contact your tour operator or airline if you have any questions about your return journey.
Travel is subject to entry restrictions
If you travel to Greece, you will need to complete a Passenger Locator Form (PLF) at least 24 hours before travel. Failure to do so in advance may result in your carrier not allowing you to travel, a 500 Euro fine on arrival or the Greek authorities not allowing you to enter the country. If you are a permanent resident of Greece, or a Greek citizen, you are also required to complete a PLF form before travelling outside of Greece. See Entry requirements for full details
All arrivals need to provide proof of a negative COVID-19 PCR test, undertaken within the 72 hour period before your time of arrival into Greece.
Anyone entering Greece will also be asked to undergo a rapid test for COVID-19 on arrival. Arrivals from the UK before 6am local time on 25 December will be required to self-isolate for 7 days in the event of a negative test result. Arrivals from the UK between 6am local time on 25 December and midnight on 7 January will be required to self-isolate for 10 days in the event of a negative test result. In both cases, travellers will need to undertake a further PCR test at the end of their period of self-isolation.
See Entry requirements for further details.

A fire at the Moria camp for migrants on Lesvos caused significant damage to its facilities in the night of 8-9 September 2020, and its inhabitants were dispersed over the island.

In recent years there have been occasional incidents of unrest and violence on the Eastern Aegean islands of Lesvos, Chios and Samos, most recently in response to an increase in arrivals of migrants from Turkey in March. It is possible that further incidents may arise. If you’re on these islands, you should remain vigilant, avoid any demonstrations or related large gatherings, keep up to date with developments and follow the advice of the local authorities.
