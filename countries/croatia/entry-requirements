The information on this page covers the most common types of travel and reflects the UK government’s understanding of the rules currently in place. Unless otherwise stated, this information is for travellers using a full ‘British Citizen’ passport.
The authorities in the country or territory you’re travelling to are responsible for setting and enforcing the rules for entry. If you’re unclear about any aspect of the entry requirements, or you need further reassurance, you’ll need to contact the embassy, high commission or consulate of the country or territory you’re travelling to.
You should also consider checking with your transport provider or travel company to make sure your passport and other travel documents meet their requirements.
Restrictions in response to coronavirus
Entry and borders
On 11 May border crossings on major routes were reopened for limited traffic, including foreign nationals who have real estate in the country, who own a boat in Croatia, have close family members in Croatia (spouse or children), are attending funerals or have been invited by a Croatian entity for business purposes. If unsure, you can write to the Croatian Ministry of Interior uzg.covid@mup.hr to ask whether you will be permitted entry.
Restrictions remain in place to prevent all other foreign nationals who do not have a valid residence permit, or a long term visa, from entering Croatia. Croatians and their family members are allowed to return to the country. Exemptions are in place to permit the travel of healthcare professionals, EU (and UK nationals until December 2020) returning to their place of residence, goods carriers, cross border workers, diplomatic and military personnel, and passengers in transit.
British citizens are permitted to leave Croatia and it remains possible to return to the UK by air and road. Further information about these restrictions can be found on the Croatian government website
Entry rules have been eased to remove the need for a 14 day period of self-isolation but visitors are advised to follow local advice. Check out the government website for more information. Restrictions on travel may change at any time. You are advised to check the latest regulations before travelling.
The Croatian Government has warned that failure to comply with public health decisions may result in fines or criminal charges being brought.
