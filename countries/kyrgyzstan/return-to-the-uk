We are currently working to secure places on a Turkish Airlines flight to Frankfurt via Istanbul and Ankara on 16 May and a Fly Dubai flight to Frankfurt via Dubai on 17 May.
The flight via Turkey has been confirmed for 10:30 on Saturday 16 May but prices are still unknown. This flight is only open to UK, Swiss and EU passport holders. Turkish airlines will contact passengers directly with further details after you have registered your interest.
At present the flight via Dubai is not confirmed, and may not go ahead. Based on current plans tickets would cost around $1270 (USD) but final costs may be higher.
If you are interested in registering for either of these potential flight, please e-mail us at Consular.Bishkek@fco.gov.uk as soon as possible, with the following information:
a copy of your passport information page, showing clearly your full name, passport number and passport expiration date
if you are not a European national, you will also need to send a copy of your current visa or residence permit for a European country
a contact email address
information on whether you wish to register for the flight via Turkey, the flight via Dubai, or both flights
permission for us to share this information with the German Embassy to the Kyrgyz Republic; the Turkish Embassy to the Kyrgyz Republic; the Turkish border police and Immigration authorities; United Arab Emirates border police and immigration authorities; German border police and immigration authorities; Turkish Airlines; FlyDubai and Emirates airlines
Registering your interest is not a commitment to travel, and does not constitute purchase of a ticket. You will be responsible for buying and paying for tickets when flights are confirmed.
You will also need to secure onwards tickets from Frankfurt before travel. Information on returning to the UK from Germany can be found on the Return to the UK page of Travel Advice for Germany
We know the lack of commercial flights is concerning for British people trying to leave Kyrgyzstan. The UK government is working closely with airlines, the Kyrgyz authorities and other governments to make sure options are available for you to return to the UK as soon as possible.

You will need to pay for your return travel to the UK. If departure options become available but you cannot afford the travel costs and have exhausted all other options for getting funds, you may be eligible to apply for an emergency loan from the government. This is a last resort option and you would need to repay the loan when you are back in the UK.
For more information, you should contact Corporate Travel Management (CTM). CTM is a commercial partner of the FCO and authorised to administer such loans on behalf of the FCO.
