Transport risks
Road travel
You can drive in Estonia with a UK driving licence. You must have the original V5C vehicle registration document with you. Check for more details on the Estonian state portal. If you are planning to drive in Estonia, see information on driving abroad and read the RAC guide for Estonia.
Do not drink and drive. If you are tested and found to have more than a quarter of England’s legal limit of alcohol in your body, you may get a fine and possible imprisonment.
Taxis
Do not hail unmarked taxis - they’re illegal.
Make sure the taxi has:
a price list on the back window
the driver’s licence in a visible place
a working meter
You can also use apps like Bolt, Taxigo and Uber.
