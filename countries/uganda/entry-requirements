Warning
FCDO advises against all but essential travel to parts of Uganda.

This information is for people travelling on a full ‘British citizen’ passport from the UK. It is based on the UK government’s understanding of Uganda’s current rules for the most common types of travel.
The authorities in Uganda set and enforce entry rules. If you’re not sure how these requirements apply to you, contact the Ugandan High Commission in the UK.
Passport validity requirements
To enter Uganda, your passport must have an ‘expiry date’ at least 6 months after the date you arrive.
Check with your travel provider that your passport and other travel documents meet requirements. Renew your passport if you need to.
You will be denied entry if you do not have a valid travel document or try to use a passport that has been reported lost or stolen. 
Visa requirements
You must have a visa to enter Uganda. Check which visa best fits your needs.
Applying for a visa
You must apply for a Uganda visa online. You will have to attach the required  documents and certificates. In most cases, you must submit a yellow fever vaccination certificate.
The immigration authorities will email you a letter of authorisation including a barcode. Print out the letter to show on arrival. Border officials will issue your visa.
Alternatively, you can take the letter to a Ugandan embassy and they will issue the visa.  
You can also apply for an East African tourist visa online. This costs 100 US dollars and allows multiple entries into Kenya, Rwanda and Uganda over 90 days.
Airport entry restrictions
If someone is coming to meet you at Entebbe International Airport, you will have to meet them outside the terminal building. Only passengers with tickets are allowed in the building.
Vaccine requirements
To enter Uganda, you must have a certificate to prove you’ve had a yellow fever vaccination. You must bring the certificate you used to get your visa.
For full details about medical entry requirements and recommended vaccinations, see TravelHealthPro’s Uganda guide.
Customs rules
There are strict rules about goods that can be taken into and out of Uganda. You must declare anything that may be prohibited or subject to tax or duty.
