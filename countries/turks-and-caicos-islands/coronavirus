Be prepared for your plans to change
No travel is risk-free during COVID-19. Countries may further restrict travel or bring in new rules at short notice, for example due to a new COVID-19 variant. Check with your travel company or airline for any transport changes which may delay your journey home.
From 1 September 2021, any fully vaccinated tourist testing positive whilst in TCI must self-isolate at their own expense. The length of quarantine, minimum five (5) days, will be determined by the specific conditions of the individual and will be set out in a quarantine order issued at that time by Public Health. Close contacts of an individual who has tested positive for COVID-19 may also be required to quarantine. Further guidance on quarantine requirements for individuals who test positive to COVID-19, and their contacts, is available on the TCI Government website.
Plan ahead and make sure you:
can access money
understand what your insurance will cover
can make arrangements to extend your stay and be away for longer than planned
