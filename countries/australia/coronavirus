Cases of coronavirus (COVID-19) have been confirmed in Australia. The Australian authorities have introduced a number of measures to limit the spread of the virus. Further information about the measures introduced can be found on the Australian government website.
British nationals in Australia looking to return to the UK are advised to register their details on the British High Commission’s registration site. This will help us in our work with airlines to keep commercial routes open and to alert you as flight options become available. You may add additional details including on your location and if you are an NHS doctor or critical worker.
Flight options from Australia to the UK are becoming increasingly limited following the tightening of entry restrictions for Australia and for countries through which flights transit. For more information, see Return to the UK
Entry restrictions and borders
Only Australian citizens and returning permanent residents and their immediate family members are permitted to enter Australia until further notice. Similar restrictions apply to those seeking to transit through Australia.
Travellers who have a compassionate or compelling reason to enter or transit through Australia can apply to the Australian authorities for an exemption via an online form. To transit, you will need to have connecting flights booked in advance within a strict timeframe. You will also need a valid visa.. See the Department of Home Affairs website for further details on entering or transiting Australia, including criteria for exemptions.
The Department of Home Affairs is experiencing high levels of demand for exemptions and there is no guarantee of either the timing of a decision or the outcome. Given the fast changing situation, those seeking to travel or transit on from Australia, should check the the latest entry restrictions for your destination and keep in touch with your airline, cruise line or tour operator before you travel.
The government announced a ban on international cruise ships, effective midnight on 15 March for an initial 30 day period. Australian cruise ships continue to be able to dock in Australia. Cruise operators are responsible for putting in place arrangements for all passengers on Australian cruise ships who are not Australians or permanent residents and their immediate families to transit to airports for onward travel. All passengers are required to self-isolate before transit and those remaining in Australia are required to self-isolate for 14 days minus the number of days the cruise ship has been at sea since its previous port.
Departure restrictions for citizens and residents
All Australian citizens (including dual nationals) and British nationals who are permanent residents are restricted from travelling overseas from Australia. If you are dual national or a permanent resident in Australia and have a compelling or compassionate reason to travel overseas, you need to apply for an exemption in advance from the Commissioner of the Australian Border Force. Further details and the exemption application form can be found on the Department of Home Affairs website.
Quarantine requirements
All travellers arriving in Australia are required to undertake a mandatory 14-day quarantine at a designated facility (eg a hotel) at their port of arrival. This is provided by the Australian government and is free of charge, except in the Northern Territory. You may face a range of penalties for non-compliance.
Domestic travel
Travel between most states and territories within Australia is now restricted to essential travel only. Many states and territories are either closing their borders or require anybody moving across internal borders to self-isolate for 14 days.
Individual states and territories websites include information on current interstate travel restrictions. You will need to apply for exemptions to cross Western Australia and Queensland borders which are currently temporarily closed. All arrivals into the Northern Territory (domestic and international) are expected to pay for designated accommodation during their 14 day mandatory quarantine at an estimated cost of $2,500 - $5000.
Visas
If you’re unable to leave Australia and your visa is nearing expiry, you should contact the Australian authorities as soon as possible. You cannot extend visas in Australia so you will need to apply for a new one.

You may also want to note the Australian Government’s announcement on 4 April of changes to arrangements for some visa categories.
