This page has information on travelling to Bangladesh. Check what you must do to return to the UK.
This page reflects the UK government’s understanding of current rules for people travelling on a full ‘British Citizen’ passport from the UK, for the most common types of travel.
The authorities in Bangladesh set and enforce entry rules.
All travellers
You will need a visa to enter Bangladesh (see below for information on visas).
If you’re fully vaccinated
If you’re fully vaccinated and travelling from the UK you can enter Bangladesh without needing to quarantine, provided your vaccination course was completed no less than 14 days prior to arrival.
Note that a pre-departure negative RT-PCR test result for COVID-19 is no longer required in such circumstances.
Proof of vaccination status
You can use the UK’s proof of COVID-19 vaccination record to demonstrate your vaccination status when entering Bangladesh.
If you’re not fully vaccinated
Arrivals from the UK who are unable to provide proof of vaccination, or proof that their vaccination course was completed at least 14 days prior to arrival, are required to present evidence of a negative RT PCR based COVID-19 test taken no more than 72 hours prior to departure for Bangladesh. See information on getting a test before entry.
You should not use the NHS testing service to get a test in order to facilitate your travel to another country. You should arrange to take a private test.
All passengers, regardless of vaccination status, may be subjected to additional health screening measures on arrival. Passengers with COVID-19 symptoms may be required to take a PCR test. Those testing positive will be required to isolate at a government authorised facility for at least seven days and until they test negative in a subsequent PCR test.
In all circumstances, people staying in a government approved hotel, government facility or hospital will need to cover the costs of those stays and any necessary COVID-19 tests.
The Bangladesh authorities may retain passports of any passengers in quarantine and will re-turn them at the end of the quarantine period.
Passengers with a No Visa Required certificate (an arrangement for foreign nationals of Bangladeshi heritage) arriving in Bangladesh without a medical certificate indicating they are COVID-19 negative, or such passengers who display symptoms, will be transferred to a government facility where their quarantine period will be assessed and determined.
Exemptions
Exemptions to quarantine arrangements are issued on an exceptional and case by case basis. Travellers should contact the Bangladesh High Commission or Bangladesh authorities in advance of travel to discuss any possible exemptions.
Children and young people
There is no requirement for children under 12 to present a negative RT PCR COVID-19 test result. Children under 12 should follow the same regime that applies to those family members they are travelling with, regardless of their vaccination status.
If you’re transiting through Bangladesh
Transiting is when you pass through one country on the way to your final destination.
For those planning to transit through Bangladesh on your way to another country, visas for Bangladesh are not required for those remaining airside at the airport. However, we have been unable to confirm that COVID-19 measures do not apply, and we would recommend meeting the Government of Bangladesh’s COVID-19 requirements. For example, unvaccinated travellers may wish to ensure that they have a negative PCR test result, taken no more than 72 hours of their departure, and familiarise themselves with any airline requirements, together with those of the final destination.
Check your passport and travel documents before you travel
If you are visiting Bangladesh, your passport should be valid for 6 months when applying for a visa to visit Bangladesh.
Check with your travel provider to make sure your passport and other travel documents meet their requirements.
Foreign nationals working in Bangladesh must get an Income Tax Clearance Certificate or an Income Tax Exemption Certificate before each departure from Bangladesh. Full details are available on the Bangladesh Board of Revenue website.
Visas
You will need a visa to enter Bangladesh. You can get a visa from the Bangladesh High Commission in London. In some limited circumstances visas may be available on arrival, which includes categories of foreign investors and those of Bangladeshi heritage. We strongly recommend that you confirm the availability of such visa arrangements, including documentation requirements, with the Bangladeshi authorities in advance of travel.
Foreign nationals currently in Bangladesh whose visas have expired have the option to extend their visa. There is a visa extension fee for this service, in addition to a penalty fee for overstaying. Visa extensions are available at the Department of Immigration and Passport of Bangladesh.
If you intend to use Bangladesh as a hub to visit other countries in the region, make sure you get a multiple entry visa. If you’re intending to work in Bangladesh make sure you get the correct visa before you travel.
If you have had your passport renewed in Bangladesh, you will need a new visa. The Bangladesh Immigration & Passport Department (telephone: 880 2 8159878 / 8123788 / 8123323) is able to issue an ‘exit visa’ or a ‘no visa required’ stamp. Officers there are unlikely to speak English, so you may need an interpreter.
Make sure you have an entry stamp placed in your passport on entry into Bangladesh otherwise you may have problems on departure.
UK Emergency Travel Documents
UK Emergency Travel Documents (ETDs) are accepted for entry, airside transit and exit from Bangladesh. Holders of an ETD must apply for the appropriate Bangladesh visa to enter Bangladesh.
Yellow fever certificate requirements
Check whether you need a yellow fever certificate by visiting the National Travel Health Network and Centre’s TravelHealthPro website.
