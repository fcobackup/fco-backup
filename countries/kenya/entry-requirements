Warning
FCDO advises against all but essential travel to parts of Kenya.

This information is for people travelling on a full ‘British citizen’ passport from the UK. It is based on the UK government’s understanding of the current rules for the most common types of travel.
The authorities in Kenya set and enforce entry rules. If you’re not sure how these requirements apply to you, contact the Kenyan High Commission in the UK.
COVID-19 rules
You do not need a negative COVID-19 test or proof of vaccination to enter Kenya.
If you have flu-like symptoms when you arrive, you must take one or more COVID-19 tests at your own expense. If tests show you have COVID-19, you must isolate. For more information see COVID-19 travel requirements from the Kenya Civil Aviation Authority.
Passport validity requirements
To enter Kenya, your passport must have an ‘expiry date’ at least 6 months after the date you arrive and at least 2 blank pages.
Check with your travel provider that your passport and other travel documents meet requirements. Renew your passport if you need to.
You will be denied entry if you do not have a valid travel document or try to use a passport that has been reported lost or stolen.
Visa requirements
You must apply online for electronic travel authorisation in advance of travel. The local authorities recommend applying at least 2 weeks before your departure.
Travellers who currently hold a visa can continue to travel using their visa until it expires.
For information on work permits and residency, check the Kenyan Department of Immigration requirements.
Vaccine requirements
To enter Kenya, you must have a certificate to prove you’ve had a yellow fever vaccination if you’re coming from a country listed as a transmission risk.
For full details about medical entry requirements and recommended vaccinations, see TravelHealthPro’s Kenya guide.
Customs rules
There are strict rules about goods you can take into or out of Kenya. You must declare anything that may be prohibited or subject to tax or duty.
Taking drones into Kenya
It is illegal to import or export drones without prior approval from the Kenya Civil Aviation Authority (KCAA). Contact the KCAA well in advance of travel if you wish to bring a drone to Kenya.
