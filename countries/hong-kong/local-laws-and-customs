Hong Kong law is based mainly on UK law. There are on the spot fines for littering and spitting. There is zero tolerance for ticketless travel on the Mass Transit Railway (MTR).
On 4 October 2019, the Hong Kong Government announced that in certain circumstances it may not be permitted for individuals to wear a “facial covering” which might prevent identification. The issue is now being heard by the courts, but police could still implement the law for now.
The import and re-export of all elephant ivory and its products, including tourist souvenirs, is banned. Offenders could face a fine and/or imprisonment.
Don’t become involved with illegal drugs of any kind. Possession of these drugs can lead to imprisonment.
Don’t take photographs of military installations. Since the 1997 handover, the defence of Hong Kong has been the responsibility of the People’s Liberation Army (PLA). All previous British military barracks now belong to the PLA.
The Hong Kong SAR Government has restrictions in place on the quantity of powdered baby formula allowed for persons departing the territory. Penalties for non compliance are severe. See: Hong Kong Customs and Excise Department website
