Due to a prevalence of COVID-19 cases in the community, there is a high risk of changes to flights and airport operations at short notice. If you wish to travel, you should consult your travel operator.
The government of Sri Lanka announced the opening of Katunayake and Mattala airports for a special tourism route from 23 January 2021. Further guidance from the Sri Lankan authorities for foreign tourists visiting Sri Lanka is available from Sri Lanka Tourism.

Travel in Sri Lanka
On 12 May, the Government of Sri Lanka announced a series of travel and movement restrictions, which will be in place until 31 May.
Lockdowns are being imposed in areas affected by COVID-19, and further travel and movement restrictions may also be imposed at short notice. Those not adhering to restrictions and local guidelines risk arrest. The local authorities are conducting random COVID-19 tests in some parts of the country, including borders of the Western Province. You should follow the advice of local authorities.
The Ministry of Health has categorised Sri Lanka under Covid-19 Risk Alert Level 3. Revised Ministry of Health guidelines have been published on the Ministry of Health’s Epidemiology Unit website.
Public gatherings such as exhibitions, conferences, parties, indoor and outdoor events, carnivals, musical shows and processions have been banned.
Regulations are in place to enforce social distancing and the wearing of a face mask in public areas.
Further restrictions and guidelines are being imposed at short notice. Public guidelines and circulars are sometimes published on government websites, such as the Epidemiology Unit website. However this is not always up to date. You should follow the media for updates, or speak to your hotel or travel agent for the latest information, and follow the instructions of the local authorities at all times.
COVID-19 vaccines if you live in Sri Lanka
Wherever possible British nationals should aim to be vaccinated in the country where they live. As further information is available about the national vaccination programme, this page will be updated. Sign up to get email notifications.
If you are able to demonstrate proof of residency on a permanent or temporary basis, then you will be included in the Sri Lankan government’s national vaccination programme. This will be delivered by local authorities. The vaccination programme has started its rollout in Colombo, but has not yet started in other regions.
The Medicines and Healthcare Products Regulatory Agency (MHRA) is the UK authority responsible for assessing the safety, quality and efficacy of vaccines. It has authorised the Pfizer/BioNTech, Oxford/AstraZeneca and Moderna vaccines for temporary supply and use in the UK. Find out more about MHRA approval for these vaccines.
British nationals living overseas should seek medical advice from their local healthcare provider in the country where they reside. Information about vaccines used in other national programmes, including regulatory status, should be available from the local authorities. This list of Stringent Regulatory Authorities recognised by the World Health Organisation may also be a useful source of additional information. Find out more about COVID-19 vaccines on the World Health Organisation COVID-19 vaccines page.
Accommodation
Some hotels and guesthouses are open to foreign nationals. But there have been reports of late-notice cancelations of room bookings, so you should check with your travel agent or accommodation provider. Social distancing and other public health measures (such as temperature checks) may be in place. Some hotels may require evidence of a negative PCR test on arrival.
Public places and services
Restaurants and cafés remain open in areas which are not under quarantine curfew, but this could change at short notice. You should expect some reduced services and social distancing measures to be in place.
Public gatherings such as exhibitions, conferences, parties, indoor and outdoor events, carnivals, musical shows and processions have been banned.
Healthcare in Sri Lanka
The Sri Lankan healthcare system is under strain due to the impact of the pandemic. Access to routine and emergency healthcare may be limited. If you are tested positive for coronavirus, you may be transferred to a specific hospital or quarantine centre for treatment. The Health Promotion Bureau has set up a trilingual health hotline for those who have queries relating to coronavirus: 1999.
