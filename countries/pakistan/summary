Following a terrorist attack in Pulwama on 14 February 2019, there are heightened tensions between India and Pakistan, particularly across the Line of Control. Pakistan announced the closure of its airspace on 27 February, but on 1 March the Pakistani Civil Aviation Authority (CAA) issued a notice advising that Pakistani airspace would partially reopen. Some flights have now resumed from Islamabad, Karachi, Quetta, Peshawar, Lahore and Faisalabad airports, but other airports in Gilgit Baltistan, Punjab and Interior Sindh regions remain closed. You should check with your airline for the latest information on the status of your flight before travelling to the airport for any flight to and from Pakistan.
Pakistan Super League cricket matches will take place in Karachi from 6 to 17 March 2019. You should expect additional security forces presence in the city and possible travel disruption.
Protests can take place with little warning and turn violent quickly. You should avoid demonstrations, large crowds of people and public events throughout Pakistan.
Terrorists are very likely to try to carry out attacks in Pakistan. There’s a high threat of terrorism, kidnap and sectarian violence throughout the country, including the cities of Islamabad, Rawalpindi, Lahore and Karachi. You should be vigilant, avoid all crowds, public events, political gatherings, religious processions and sporting events, and take appropriate security precautions.
Foreigners, in particular westerners, may be directly targeted. Densely populated unsecured areas, such as markets, shopping malls, restaurants and places where westerners and the Pakistani elite are known to congregate, are potential focal points for attacks. You should be extra vigilant at all times and minimize your exposure to areas that pose a higher risk.
Security forces in Pakistan remain on high alert following previous attacks. Alert levels in major cities can fluctuate, and travellers should monitor local media. There may be increases in security force presence and restrictions on movement may be put in place at short notice. See Terrorism
During holy periods/religious holidays, there’s an increased risk of targeted attacks, including on western interests and religious minorities. On 17 December 2017, an attack at the Bethel Memorial Methodist church in Quetta killed nine and injured over 50 people. It’s possible that further Christian gatherings will be targeted in this way.
In August 2018, militants attacked a number of schools, including over a dozen schools in the Chilas, Darel and Tangir areas of Daimer District, Gilgit Baltistan. In security operations that followed, 2 militants were killed and over 30 arrested. Further attacks on schools and security operations in response are possible. You should seek and follow the advice of the local authorities.
There have been a number of recent terrorist attacks in Lahore. At the present time, you should exercise caution travelling to and around Lahore. Busy public places and events are often targeted, including public transport, major international hotels, the airport, parks, shopping malls and religious sites. Government, military and law enforcement facilities are also targeted. See Terrorism for more information.
On 14 March 2018, an explosion at the Nisar police check post near Raiwand on the southern outskirts of Lahore, close to the Tableeghi (Jamait e Islami) religious centre, caused numerous fatalities and multiple injuries.
Pakistan is in a major earthquake zone and remains at risk from further earthquakes, aftershocks, landslides and flooding. You should familiarise yourself with safety procedures in the event of an earthquake. See Natural disasters
