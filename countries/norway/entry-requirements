The information on this page covers the most common types of travel and reflects the UK government’s understanding of the rules currently in place. Unless otherwise stated, this information is for travellers using a full ‘British Citizen’ passport.
The authorities in the country or territory you’re travelling to are responsible for setting and enforcing the rules for entry. If you’re unclear about any aspect of the entry requirements, or you need further reassurance, you’ll need to contact the embassy, high commission or consulate of the country or territory you’re travelling to.
You should also consider checking with your transport provider or travel company to make sure your passport and other travel documents meet their requirements.
Entry rules in response to coronavirus
Entry to Norway
Norway has reintroduced restrictions for travellers form the UK. From midnight on Friday 21 August, all travellers from the UK will be required to quarantine for 10 days on arrival.
From 15 July, Norway is allowing entry for those resident in some Schengen or EU/EEA countries (which until the end of the year includes the UK) that have a sufficiently low level of coronavirus transmission.
UK nationals resident in a Schengen or EU/EEA country with a high risk of infection may enter but are required to self-quarantine for 10 days. Arrivals from these counties are required to travel directly to an appropriate place of quarantine, preferably using private transportation. Those who must use public transport should use a facemask during the journey. For countries outside the Nordics, Schengen or EU/EEA, restrictions continue to apply.
For more details on which countries and regions are exempt, see the Norwegian Institute of Public Health website. The list of countries is being reviewed at least every 14 days with amendments made as the transmission situation changes.
A free Coronavirus testing service is available at many international airports in Norway. Taking a test is not mandatory and a negative result does not exempt you from quarantine.
You can travel to Norway to begin work, provided that the work is imminent. In order to gain entry you will need to bring a copy of your work contract. If you are coming to Norway to work on a temporary assignment you should also bring evidence of this. Those who come to Norway to work are required to follow the quarantine regulations.
From 1 July, students who have been accepted on courses for the 2020/2021 academic year can enter Norway.
For more information, contact the Norwegian Embassy in London. Detailed guidance is available on the UDI website.
Transiting Norway
Non-residents are still able to transit via Norwegian airports as long as the final destination is not within Norway, but please check with your airline before departing.
Cruises
The Foreign, Commonwealth & Development Office (FCDO) advises against cruise ship travel at this time. This is due to the ongoing pandemic and is based on medical advice from Public Health England.
A number of Norwegian ports are restricting passenger embarkation and disembarkation. The situation can change rapidly so check with your cruise provider for the latest information.
Visas
The Norwegian authorities have confirmed that if your visa has expired or is at risk of expiring, you will be not punished if you overstay. You are not required to notify UDI or the police, but are asked to try to leave as quickly as possible.
