Terrorism
There is a high threat of terrorist attack globally affecting UK interests and British nationals, including from groups and individuals who view the UK and British nationals as targets. You should remain vigilant at all times.
UK Counter Terrorism Policing has information and advice on staying safe abroad and what to do in the event of a terrorist attack. Find out how to reduce your risk from terrorism while abroad.
Terrorism in Austria
Terrorists are likely to try and carry out attacks in Austria.
Political demonstrations
Demonstrations may occur with little or no warning in cities. Avoid any protests, political gatherings or marches. Follow the advice of local authorities.
Crime
Crime levels are generally low. However, there are higher levels of petty crime, particularly pickpocketing, in the big city centres and city parks after dark. Thieves use a variety of methods to distract people.
Protecting your belongings
Take care on public transport and in crowded areas in city centres including main stations. Be particularly careful with your belongings on international trains to and from Austria, and when taking your baggage from trains and coaches.
Drink and food spiking
Drinks served in bars overseas are often stronger than those in the UK. Be careful about taking drinks from strangers or leaving your drinks unattended. Victims of spiked drinks have been robbed and sometimes assaulted.
Laws and cultural differences
Personal ID
By law, you must have your passport easily accessible at all times. If you do not carry your passport, it must be in the same district as you and accessible within a short time. A photocopy of the data page of your passport can be helpful. A UK driving licence is not recognised as official ID.
Drugs
Drug laws are similar to the UK. Possessing or trafficking drugs is dealt with severely.
Dress
It’s generally illegal to wear any clothing or object in public that covers your face. You could be fined up to 150 euro. See the See the Austrian government website information on the law and a list of exemptions.
Public transport
Tickets on public transport must be validated in a ticket machine before you start a journey. Failure to do so can result in an on the spot fine of 100 to 500 euro.
Outdoor activities and adventure tourism
Hiking, mountaineering and other adventure sports can be risky.
Check that the company is well- established in the industry and that you’ve arranged for your insurance to cover this specific activity.
For sports activities like skiing, potholing and mountaineering, and for sports classed as particularly dangerous (for example off-piste skiing, mountain biking, climbing, paragliding or BASE jumping), your insurance should include:
mountain rescue services
helicopter costs
repatriation to your country of residence or possible transfer to neighbouring countries for treatment
Check weather forecasts and conditions. Make sure you’re properly equipped for the worst-case scenario with items such as a map, compass, GPS and telecommunication equipment.
Risks are greater if you undertake any activity alone. You may want to hire a guide for expert advice. Always leave copies of your itinerary with someone.
Skiing
Read FCDO advice about staying safe while skiing and preparing for winter sports abroad.
Take advice on weather and avalanche conditions before you travel and familiarise yourself with local skiing laws and regulations.
Off-piste skiing is very dangerous. There are dangers of avalanches in some areas. Follow all safety instructions meticulously and go with a qualified guide. For more information about the avalanche risk, visit the European Avalanche Warning Service or the Austrian Avalanche Warning Service.
