Flights are still leaving the Philippines, with connections to the UK. However, there is widespread disruption to International travel routes, and domestic flights are currently suspended.
You will need to pay for your return travel to the UK. If departure options are available but you cannot afford the travel costs and have exhausted all other options for getting funds, you may be eligible to apply for an emergency loan from the government. This is a last resort option and you would need to repay the loan when you are back in the UK. For more information, you should contact Corporate Travel Management (CTM). CTM are a commercial partner of the FCO and are authorised to administer such loans on behalf of the FCO.
The British Embassy Manila is in contact with airlines, the Philippine authorities and other governments to make sure commercial options for returning to the UK continue to remain open as long as possible.
Sign up for travel advice email alerts and follow the British Embassy on Twitter and Facebook.
