Coronavirus (COVID-19)
Check the latest information on risk from COVID-19 for Turks and Caicos Islands on the TravelHealthPro website
See the healthcare information in the Coronavirus section for information on what to do if you think you have coronavirus while in Turks and Caicos Islands.
At least 8 weeks before your trip, check the latest health advice from the National Travel Health Network and Centre (NaTHNaC) on the TravelHealthPro website. Each overseas territory page has information on vaccine recommendations, any current health risks or outbreaks, and factsheets with information on staying healthy abroad. Guidance is also available from NHS (Scotland) on the FitForTravel website.
General information on travel vaccinations and a travel health checklist is available on the NHS website. You may then wish to contact your health adviser or pharmacy for advice on other preventive measures and managing any pre-existing medical conditions while you are abroad.
The legal status and regulation of some medicines prescribed or purchased in the UK can be different in overseas territories. If you are travelling with prescription or over-the-counter medicine, read this guidance from NaTHNaC on best practice when travelling with medicines. For further information on the legal status of a specific medicine, youâ€™ll need to contact the local territory government.
While travel can be enjoyable, it can sometimes be challenging. There are clear links between mental and physical health, so looking after yourself during travel and when abroad is important. Information on travelling with mental health conditions is available in our guidance page. Further information is also available from the National Travel Health Network and Centre (NaTHNaC).
Health risks
UK health authorities have classified Turks and Caicos Islands as having a moderate risk of Zika virus transmission. No cases of Zika infection have been reported in Turks and Caicos Islands since January 2017. For information and advice about the risks associated with Zika virus, visit the National Travel Health Network and Centre website.
Cases of dengue fever and chikungunya virus have been confirmed in the Turks and Caicos Islands. You should take steps to avoid being bitten by mosquitoes. For more details about this outbreak, see the website of the National Health Network and Centre.
Medical treatment
There are hospital facilities on Providenciales and Grand Turk, both operated by Interhealth Canada. They provide a range of services including diagnostic services, primary care and outpatient specialty clinics, emergency services and inpatient care. Serious cases are still referred overseas, usually to Miami or Nassau. Make sure you have adequate travel health insurance and accessible funds to cover the cost of any medical treatment abroad and repatriation.
If you need emergency medical assistance during your trip, dial 911 and ask for an ambulance. You should contact your insurance/medical assistance company promptly if you are referred to a medical facility for treatment.
If you need to obtain further supplies of your prescribed medicine whilst you are in the Turks and Caicos Islands, you will firstly need to visit a registered physician, who will either countersign your UK prescription or issue a new one. It is likely that you will have to pay for your medical appointment and the full costs of your medicine up front then submit a claim for reimbursement through your travel insurance.
Pharmacies on all islands are usually well stocked, however less common medication may only be available in the hospital or pharmacies on Providenciales.
