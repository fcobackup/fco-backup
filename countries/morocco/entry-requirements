If you’re unclear about any aspect of the entry requirements, or you need further reassurance, you’ll need to contact the embassy, high commission or consulate of the country or territory you’re travelling to.
You should also consider checking with your transport provider or travel company to make sure your passport and other travel documents meet their requirements.
Restrictions in response to coronavirus
Entry and borders
From 15 July, British Nationals resident in Morocco, as well as their families, will be allowed to enter Morocco, but the borders will not be open for tourism. Entry to Morocco will be under the following conditions:
Passengers must complete a passenger health form online at www.onda.ma/form.php, then print and sign the form, to be presented on arrival in Morocco
Passengers will be required to present (negative) results of a PCR as well as an antibody test for COVID-19 before being permitted to travel to Morocco, with the results dated no earlier than 48 hours prior to departure. Upon arrival in Morocco, passengers will be required to self-isolate at home for 14 days, and download the tracking app ‘Wiqaytna’. British Nationals resident in Morocco will need to present proof of their residency in the form of a ‘carte de séjour’ (residency card).
Ferries carrying passengers will come exclusively from Sete (France) and Genoa (Italy). The same PCR and antibody test requirements, as well as additional sanitary measures, will apply to ferry passengers.
All passengers will be required to make their own arrangements, including for tests, using private clinics as necessary.
Family members (defined as “first degree” relatives: children, spouse, parents) accompanying an eligible traveller require a “livret de famille” (family register) to travel. You should consult your nearest Moroccan Consulate before travelling.
Visas
The Moroccan authorities have advised foreigners on visit visas to return home by 10 August. British nationals are able to book tickets on the special commercial flights operated by Royal Air Maroc (RAM) and Air Arabia.
British citizens with expired visas who are unable to return home before 10 August should seek to regularise their status with the Moroccan authorities as soon as they can.
You can regularise your stay by applying for residency in Morocco.Visit servicepublic.ma (http://service-public.ma/en/web/guest/home) for further information.
Regular entry requirements
Visas
British nationals don’t need a visa to enter Morocco for the purpose of tourism for up to 3 months.

Your passport should be valid for the proposed duration of your stay in Morocco. However, the Moroccan Consulate General in London advise that your passport should be valid for at least 3 months on your date of entry to Morocco. If your passport does not meet this requirement you may face difficulties and you should check with the Moroccan authorities and your travel provider before travelling.
Before travelling, make sure your passport isn’t damaged. Some travellers have been refused entry when travelling on damaged passports.
