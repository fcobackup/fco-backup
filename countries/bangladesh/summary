Although British nationals are eligible for visa on arrival for a period of 1 month for the purpose of official duty, business, investment and tourism, we recommend obtaining a visa before travelling. We have received some reports that British nationals have been issued shorter Visas or refused entry into Bangladesh when applying for a visa on arrival. Contact the Bangladesh High Commission London for information on visas. You should also be aware that overstaying your visa could risk the imposition of penalty fines for overstaying. See Visas

As a result of ongoing violence in Burma since August 2017, hundreds of thousands of Rohingya refugees have arrived in the south-east of Bangladesh, close to the border with Burma. They’re concentrated in the sub-districts of Ukhia and Teknaf in the southern part of Cox’s Bazar district. The Bangladeshi authorities regulate access to the areas where the Rohingya are accommodated.
There have been reports of insecurity in these areas. A reported incident on 21 February involved an attack with the use of some violence by residents of Kutupalong camp against a party including European journalists.
You should exercise caution and consult the local authorities about the latest situation before visiting Ukhia and Teknaf. You may need to meet access requirements. We encourage all humanitarian assistance to be coordinated through recognised humanitarian agencies registered with the Bangladeshi authorities.
Terrorists are very likely to try to carry out attacks in Bangladesh. The threat extends across the country. The last terrorist attack was the murder of Shahzahan Bachchu on 11 June 2018 when he was attacked and killed in the Munshiganj area of Dhaka Division but there is a risk that future attacks could target public gatherings. There is also the risk that foreign nationals could be directly targeted in future attacks. See Terrorism
The Bangladeshi authorities have successfully disrupted a number of planned attacks and remain at high alert; there may be increases in security force presence and restrictions on movement may be put in place at short notice. Crowded areas and places where foreign nationals are known to gather may be at higher risk of attack. You should minimise your exposure to these areas, consider your movements carefully and follow any specific advice of the local security authorities. See Terrorism
