Royal Brunei Airlines have suspended their direct flight from Brunei to London. At present, Royal Brunei Airlines is the only carrier flying from Brunei International Airport with twice-weekly flights to Hong Kong, Manila, Melbourne, and Singapore, but travelers should check entry restrictions at these airports, including for any onward flights.
Details can be found on the Royal Brunei Airlines website.
Brunei has introduced an exit travel ban, including for permanent residents, and expatriate workers (green identity card holders), and their dependents. Exceptions will be considered by the Prime Minister’s Office on a case by case basis, through email applications to travelapplication@jpm.gov.bn giving 14 days’ notice of the intention to travel, and setting out reasons why they need to leave the country. Full details are available on the Prime Minister’s Office website.
