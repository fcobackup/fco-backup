Returning to the UK
When you return, you must follow the rules for entering the UK.
You are responsible for organising your own COVID-19 test, in line with UK government testing requirements. You should contact local authorities for information on testing facilities. See information above in the ‘When you’re abroad’ section.
Be prepared for your plans to change
No travel is risk-free during COVID. Countries may further restrict travel or bring in new rules at short notice, for example due to a new COVID-19 variant. Check with your travel company or airline for any transport changes which may delay your journey home.
If you test positive for COVID-19, you may need to stay where you are until you test negative. You may also need to seek treatment there.
Plan ahead and make sure you:
can access money
understand what your insurance will cover
can make arrangements to extend your stay and be away for longer than planned
When you’re abroad
You should liaise closely with your travel company or airline to ensure you are aware of any changes to schedules. Plan for the risks of disruption and local domestic measures affecting your travel when arranging your return to the UK.
If you will be returning to the UK, prepare for your return journey by pre-booking your arrival tests where required and completing the passenger locator form.
If you require a pre-departure test for travel to the UK you can request a booking online for an asymptomatic C-19 PCR test. The process differs if you are within or outside the greater Reykjavik area.
Payment is taken at the time of booking. You should request the certificate to be in English. You can have it sent electronically or printed for pick up at the health centre. You will be sent a bar code on your mobile phone which you will need to present on day of test. Tests will take place at Sudurlandsbraut 34, Reykjavik if applying in the greater Reykjavik area. You should receive you results within 24hrs of taking the test. The total cost is approx ISK 14,000 (£80) for those registered in the Icelandic health system or approx ISK 24,000 (£138) for those not registered in the Icelandic health system. This includes cost of clinic, test and certificate.
