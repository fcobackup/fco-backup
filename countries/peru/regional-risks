This section has safety advice for regions of Peru. It only covers regions where the Foreign, Commonwealth & Development Office (FCDO) has specific advice. 
You should also read FCDO’s overall travel advice and safety and security advice. 
States of emergency
States of emergency have been declared in some parts of Peru. You can read a list of the areas with a state of emergency in El Peruano official newspaper (in Spanish). For more information on your destination you can contact Iperu. 
In these areas you may notice an increased security presence. You should:
comply with the instructions of local authorities
avoid crowds
monitor the situation closely
Border areas
Peru-Colombia border
The Putumayo River forms most of Peru’s border with Colombia. It is an area known for intensive cocaine and marijuana production. Drug trafficking and other organised crime takes place in the area around the river. There is a high risk to your safety here and in the border areas with Ecuador, Colombia and Brazil. You should:
seek local advice about dangerous areas
report any suspicious activity or items to the police
follow any official warnings
If there is an attack, leave the area as soon as it is safe and stay away in case of secondary attacks.
Peru-Ecuador border
The Peruvian Government has taken preventive measures in Northern Peru in response to the security situation in Ecuador. You may notice an increased security presence.
If you are travelling to Northern Peru or you plan to cross land border checkpoints, ensure you follow the advice of local authorities.
If you wish to enter Ecuador via a land border from Peru, you are required by the Ecuadorean authorities to provide certain documentation. Read the travel advice for Ecuador.
Only cross the Peru-Ecuador land border at official checkpoints. Other parts of the border may still have unexploded landmines. Some tourists have been robbed by fake taxi drivers. Be extremely vigilant in these areas.
The British Embassy may have difficulty in providing in-person emergency or consular support in these areas. While we will work with local authorities to request help, their ability to respond may also be very limited.
Inca trail
There is a government fee and restrictions on numbers of guided groups to protect the Inca trail. During the high season from June to August, make reservations with a travel agency well in advance. 
Only basic medical services are available at Machu Picchu. Several climbers have died or suffered serious injuries after falling while climbing Huayna Picchu, a peak near Machu Picchu. 
You should:
always register when entering national parks
be particularly careful in steep and slippery areas, or those that are unfenced or unmarked
The ‘Inca Jungle Trail’ can be difficult for vehicles due to poor road conditions. There have been fatal road accidents.
Lake Titicaca
Armed robbers have attacked travellers walking on their own. You should:
always take care
contact the local tourist information centre for advice about known safe zones
travel with a group at the southern end of Lake Titicaca, if walking at night
Nazca Lines
If you are planning to fly over the Nazca Lines, check the airline company is licensed and has a good safety record before you book. There have been several fatal accidents in recent years.
You can ask the iPeru information service for advice about booking flights.
Valley of the Apurímac, Ene and Mantaro rivers (VRAEM)
Remnants of the Shining Path terrorist group in the VRAEM continue to conduct occasional ambushes and attacks, mainly targeting the police, military forces and local authorities. You should:
seek local advice about dangerous areas
be alert to possible threats
take official warnings seriously
follow the advice of local authorities
report any suspicious activity or items to the police
If there is an attack, leave the area as soon as it is safe. Avoid areas affected in case of secondary attacks.
The British Embassy may have difficulty in providing in-person emergency or consular support in these areas. While we will work with local authorities to request help, their ability to respond may also be very limited.
