Entry and borders
To enter the French Overseas Territories, you will need to complete a travel certificate. There are different certificates for travel from mainland France to French overseas territories or international travel from abroad to French overseas territories.
Make sure you complete the travel certificate before you travel, so you can show it to French border authorities on entry and, where appropriate, travel companies prior to boarding. You must carry a physical copy of the declaration; electronic versions will not be accepted. You are able to produce a handwritten copy of the text if you do not have access to a printed form.
Local travel
To travel within or to transit through French Overseas Territories, you should complete an Attestation de déplacement dérogatoire to certify your reason for travel. You can carry a physical copy or an electronic version of this “attestation” (declaration). This declaration should be completed before starting your journey.
For French Overseas Territories, this declaration does not replace the requirement for an travel certificate, detailed above. Further information is available on the Ministry of Interior webpage.
Local measures
The French Government outlined new measures on 16 March to stem the spread of coronavirus, which also apply to the French Overseas Territories. This included confining people to their homes except for outings for specific purposes effective from midday 17 March 2020. The local Prefecture website will have details of any further local restriction.
