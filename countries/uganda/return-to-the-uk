There are currently no commercial options to return to the UK from Uganda. Since 22 March, all international flights to and from Uganda have been suspended. Cargo flights are permitted, but crew must observe strict guidelines. Land borders and lake ports are also closed, except for truck drivers.
We continue to work with the Government of Uganda, other embassies and airlines on options for helping British nationals who wish to return home.
The UK government has facilitated a special flight from Entebbe to the UK departing on 21 May for British tourists, short term visitors and their direct dependents. This flight is now full and the booking portal is closed. Tickets will not be on sale at the airport. Please do not travel to the airport without a confirmed ticket.
The British High Commission will continue to work to determine further options for helping British nationals who wish to return home. However, no further UK Government-backed special charter flights are currently planned from Uganda.
If you have registered for the special flight on 21 May 2020
If you have registered for the flight on 21 May you will receive an email confirming whether you have been allocated a seat or not at least 24 hours before the flight. If you are allocated a seat our booking partner CTM will send you an email with all the details you need including what time to be at the airport. You must print and take your confirmed itinerary from CTM with you to the airport. A copy on a smart phone or similar is also sufficient.
You will be notified if you have not been allocated a seat, and will need to request a refund from CTM, which you should receive within 14 days.
Travel to the airport
Given the current restrictions on personal travel within Uganda, the British High Commission in Kampala are also considering how to get people to the airport. The British High Commission will email those registered for the special flight on 21 May to discuss transport arrangements.

Future travel options
If you wish to leave Uganda, you should also register your interest to leave by email to Returnfrom.Uganda@fco.gov.uk.
You will need to pay for your return travel to the UK. If departure options are available but you cannot afford the travel costs and have exhausted all other options for getting funds, you may be eligible to apply for an emergency loan from the government. This is a last resort option and you would need to repay the loan when you are back in the UK.
If you cannot leave Uganda at this time, see advice on staying in Uganda during coronavirus.
We are issuing regular updates on our Twitter and Facebook pages with the latest available information on possible flights.
