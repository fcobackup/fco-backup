A number of cases of coronavirus (COVID-19) have been confirmed in Serbia. The Serbian Government has announced a State of Emergency to limit the spread of the virus.
The Serbian Ministry of Health website gives up to date information on the number of cases confirmed and tests carried out in Serbia. This website also includes helpline telephone numbers. A State of Emergency is currently in place in response to the global pandemic of coronavirus (COVID-19).
Entry and borders
All airports in Serbia are currently closed to international passenger flights until further notice as are all borders, except for freight traffic. These measures, and those taken by neighbouring countries, mean there are now no commercial means of arriving in Serbia, or leaving Serbia to return to the UK.
Serbian passport holders (including dual nationals) who enter on occasional special repatriation flights arranged by the Serbian government are subject to mandatory testing for COVID-19, medical quarantine until well if tested positive, and mandatory quarantine at home for 28 days if negative.
Countries neighbouring Serbia have also introduced restrictions. Please check country-specific FCO Travel Advice for details. Some exemptions have been identified, including international cargo transport by road or river (time limits apply when in transit).
Local measures
A nationwide curfew is in place: 5pm-5am Monday – Friday and continuously from 5pm on Friday 17 April until 5am on Tuesday 21 April. A ban on public gatherings of more than 2 people is in force. People aged over 65 in urban areas, and people over 70 in rural areas, may not leave their homes at any time until further notice except to shop for groceries in designated shops from 4-7am on Fridays.
There is no public transport. All schools, kindergartens, universities, cafes, shopping malls and restaurants are closed, except for delivery. Sporting facilities, parks, playgrounds and public spaces are also closed. There may be further restrictions to limit the spread of coronavirus. Infringements of these procedures may result in fines and/or a prison sentence. If you are currently in Serbia, check news outlets regularly for up to date information.
If you need further information about entry requirements, contact the local immigration authorities or the nearest Serbian Embassy or Consulate. You should also check with your airline or travel company for the latest information.
