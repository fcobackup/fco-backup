Be prepared for your plans to change
No travel is risk-free during COVID-19. Countries may further restrict travel or bring in new rules at short notice, for example due to a new COVID-19 variant. Check with your travel company or airline for any transport changes which may delay your journey home.
If you test positive for COVID-19, you may need to stay where you are until you test negative. You may also need to seek treatment there.
Plan ahead and make sure you:
can access money
understand what your insurance will cover
can make arrangements to extend your stay and be away for longer than planned
Travel in Pitcairn Island
There are only two metalled roads on Pitcairn. Other roads are dirt tracks. Transport around the island is by quad bike or on foot. All quad bikes are privately owned and therefore most visitors travel on foot. Longer-term visitors who propose using a quad bike need to pass a short quad bike driving test before a licence will be issued by the island Police Officer.
Accommodation
There are no hotels but self-catering and homestay accommodation with local families is available.
Healthcare
Pitcairn Island has a modern and well-equipped medical clinic and a resident doctor, but you should note that the nearest hospital facilities are in French Polynesia or New Zealand, at least 2 days’ sail away. There are no airport facilities on Pitcairn, meaning that evacuation in a medical emergency is not always possible.
Your emotional and mental wellbeing is important. Read guidance on how to look after your mental wellbeing and mental health.
