The information on this page covers the most common types of travel and reflects the UK government’s understanding of the rules currently in place. Unless otherwise stated, this information is for travellers using a full ‘British Citizen’ passport.
The authorities in the country or territory you’re travelling to are responsible for setting and enforcing the rules for entry. If you’re unclear about any aspect of the entry requirements, or you need further reassurance, you’ll need to contact the embassy, high commission or consulate of the country or territory you’re travelling to.
You should also consider checking with your transport provider or travel company to make sure your passport and other travel documents meet their requirements.
Entry rules in response to coronavirus
Entry to Rwanda
The Government of Rwanda has published guidance for passengers arriving into and departing from Rwanda. This is mandatory for all incoming passengers, including those who have received the COVID-19 vaccine.
All travellers arriving in Rwanda must have a negative COVID-19 certificate. The only accepted test is a SARS-CoV 2 Real Time Polymerase Chain Reaction (RT-PCR) performed within 72 hours prior to departure (meaning travellers must be tested and get results within 3 days of their first flight). Other tests, such as Rapid Diagnostics Tests (RDTs), are not accepted. A COVID-19 test is not mandatory for accompanied children under 5 years. You should not use the NHS testing service to get a test in order to facilitate your travel to another country. You should arrange to take a private test.
All travellers arriving in Rwanda must complete the passenger locator form and upload the COVID-19 test certificate before heading to the airport. Please see passenger locator form and list of designated transit hotels on the Government of Rwanda website.
All travellers arriving or transiting for more than 12 hours through Rwanda will be screened upon entry and take a RT-PCR test on arrival. All travellers are required to wait 24 hours for the results of their COVID-19 test taken upon arrival, in a designated transit hotel.
You should be aware that all passengers arriving from India and Uganda are required to complete 7 days in mandatory quarantine upon arrival at a designated hotel at their own cost.
Further information about testing on arrival and waiting for results in designated hotels, and additional advice for passengers transiting through Rwanda, is available in the Government of Rwanda’s guidance.
Entry at land borders remains restricted.
Screening on arrival
Screening procedures are in place for coronavirus at all entry points.
Testing on departure
All travellers departing from Rwanda must test negative for COVID-19. The only accepted test is a SARS-CoV 2 Real Time Polymerase Chain Reaction (RT-PCR) performed within 72 hours before departure performed by the Rwanda Biomedical Center/National Reference Laboratory, Provincial or District Hospitals. Other tests, such as Rapid Diagnostics Tests (RDTs), are not accepted. A COVID-19 Test is not mandatory for accompanied children under 5 years. Passengers are encouraged to book and pay for their tests at least 2 days prior to departure through the online platform available on the Government of Rwanda website.
Further information about testing on departure is available in the Government of Rwanda’s guidance.
Regular entry requirements
Visas
You need a visa to enter Rwanda. Thirty-day tourist visas are free and available on arrival for citizens of member states of the Commonwealth (including the UK), as well as for those of the African Union and the Francophonie.
You can also choose to get a visa in advance at any Rwandan diplomatic mission or online. Further information about visa requirements is available from the Rwandan High Commission.
If you’re planning to apply for resident/business or missionary multiple entry visas on entry to Rwanda you will need to get UK police clearance before you travel. You can find details of how to do this on the ACRO Criminal Records Office website. This usually takes a minimum of 10 working days to process.
Passport validity
Your passport should be valid for at least 6 months from the date of entry into Rwanda. You’ll need one blank page on your passport for entry stamps.
If your UK passport has expired since 1 January 2020, or is due to expire before October 2020, the Government of Rwanda have agreed that such passports will be treated as valid for travel until December 2021. However, you still need to ensure you have a valid visa to remain in Rwanda. You should renew your visa if required at the Rwanda Directorate-General of Immigration and Emigration
UK Emergency Travel Documents
UK Emergency Travel Documents (ETDs) are accepted for entry, airside transit and exit from Rwanda. If you’re travelling into Rwanda on an ETD, you’ll be expected to provide Rwandan Immigration with a reason for the use of an ETD, eg proof of residency. If you’re seeking to use a two-way ETD, should clear this with Rwandan Immigration before you travel.
