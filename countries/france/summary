There is an ongoing outbreak of coronavirus (COVID-19) in France. The French Government outlined new measures on 16 March to stem the spread of coronavirus, including restricting the movement of people from midday 17 March for 15 days to journeys that are absolutely necessary, such as food shopping, seeking medical care, journeys to work where working from home is not possible, or exercising. The French Government has said it will enforce these measures and fine those who are not compliant. The French Government will provide further guidance on how these measures will be enforced. Travellers should follow instructions of the French authorities.
On 16 March, the French Government announced that the EU would suspend travel between the EU and non-European countries for an initial period of 30 days from midday 17 March. The French Government confirmed that these restrictions will not apply to UK nationals. We will update our advice with details of any EU measures when confirmed.
These measures are in addition to those already announced by the French Government, including the closure of all non-essential establishments open to the public from midnight, 14 March, until further notice (i.e. restaurants, cafes, cinemas). Food shops, pharmacies, petrol stations, and banks will stay open. On 15 March, the French Government also announced that public transport will be progressively reduced over the course of the next week. See Health
