This page gives you guidance on how to stay safely in New Zealand as a visitor, if you are unable to Return to the UK.
Everyone should comply with the measures put in place in New Zealand to limit the spread of coronavirus (COVID-19).
Moving around in New Zealand
There are local travel restrictions in place in New Zealand. For information on entering or transiting through New Zealand, see Entry requirements
The New Zealand Government has introduced a four-level national COVID-19 alert system. At 2359 local time on Wednesday 13 May 2020, New Zealand moved to Alert Level 2.
At Alert Level 2, public health measures remain unchanged (wash hands and high-touch surfaces regularly, stay home if sick, and get tested if symptomatic). But there is a loosening of restrictions in some areas. People are free to leave their homes to see friends and family, meaning that household “bubbles” can end.
New Zealand’s border restrictions remain in place but domestic travel is permitted. People are able to travel outside their home region, but must maintain social distancing, including on public transport and at airports. Sport and recreation activity has resumed, with restrictions in place to ensure contact tracing and hygiene requirements
Temporary limits on gathering numbers are in place under Alert Level 2.
The New Zealand Cabinet will review the Alert Level settings on 8 June. It will make a decision on whether to move to Level 1 no later than June 22.
Full details on the New Zealand Government’s coronavirus national response alert system and the requirements for each level can be found on the New Zealand Government COVID-19 website.
The State of National Emergency has now been lifted.

Finance
There is a range of financial support from the government that you can access while you are unable to return due to coronavirus restrictions.
If you’re in New Zealand and have exhausted all other options to cover essential living costs while you wait to return home, you could apply for an emergency loan for your living costs from the UK government. You can only apply if you normally live in the UK and you cannot return home. This is a last resort option for those most in need and you would need to repay the loan when you are back in the UK. Apply for an emergency loan.
