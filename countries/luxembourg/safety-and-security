Terrorism
There is a high threat of terrorist attack globally affecting UK interests and British nationals, including from groups and individuals who view the UK and British nationals as targets. You should remain vigilant at all times.
UK Counter Terrorism Policing has information and advice on staying safe abroad and what to do in the event of a terrorist attack. Find out how to reduce your risk from terrorism while abroad.
Terrorism in Luxembourg
Terrorist attacks in Luxembourg cannot be ruled out.
Crime
Violent crime is not common in Luxembourg cities. However, robberies with violence occur.
Report any thefts in person to the nearest police station within 24 hours and get a police report crime number.
Protecting your belongings
Pickpockets operate on buses and in train stations, particularly in the main train station of Luxembourg Gare. Hotel lobbies in the Findel area are reported to be hotspots for thefts and pickpocketing.
Scams
Foreign visitors and residents can be targeted by scam artists. Be cautious and make sure you have all the information you need before providing any personal or bank details.
Laws and cultural differences
Alcohol laws
The minimum legal drinking age is 16, but being drunk and disorderly in public is a criminal offence that can result in arrest for a night and a heavy fine.
Transport risks
Road travel
If you are planning to drive in Luxembourg, see information on driving abroad and read the RAC Luxembourg guide.
You may be fined if you cannot produce the following documents if they are requested:
driving licence
vehicle registration document
car insurance certificate
road tax
MOT certificate
Carry a passport, because it’s easy to cross into neighbouring countries without realising it. Beware that road traffic laws are strict and you can be fined for minor traffic infringements.
The minimum age for driving a car is 18.
You can use your UK licence for a period of one year before having to exchange it for a Luxembourgish licence.
Drink-drive laws are strictly enforced. You can be arrested for having a blood alcohol content of 0.5% or above.
Winter tyres
It is compulsory for all motor vehicles driving on public roads in winter conditions (black ice, packed snow, slush, ice sheets or frost) to have regulation winter tyres (winter tyres or all-weather tyres marked “M.S.”, “M+S”, “M&S” or the alpine symbol) mounted on all wheels of the vehicle.
This regulation applies to all drivers, regardless of the country of registration of the vehicle. You will be fined if you do not have the correct tyres. However, this does not apply to vehicles parked on public roads. For more information see Luxembourg government advice on winter driving.
Taxis
It is safer to use official taxis at clearly marked taxi stands. A price list is displayed on official taxis. Check the rate per kilometre before getting into the taxi. Beware that some taxis may charge highly inflated prices. Taxi drivers are allowed to charge extra in the evenings and on Sunday.
