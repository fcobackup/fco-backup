Credit and debit cards are not generally accepted in Liberia, except for a few of the main hotels and some larger supermarkets. They may be unable to process card payments when internet connections are weak. Very few outlets will accept travellers’ cheques. Most health care providers only accept cash payments. Several cash machines/ATMs accepting only Visa cards now operate in Monrovia, including in the two main hotels frequented by international visitors, but ATMs frequently run out of cash. Foreign exchange and banking facilities are limited. Western Union and Moneygram have a number of agents in Liberia who are able to transfer money from the UK, although there are very few outside Monrovia. Liberia’s banking sector is currently experiencing cash shortages (of both US dollars and Liberian dollars). Banks and foreign exchange facilities may be unable to pay out transferred funds or fulfil ATM withdrawals. Bring sufficient funds, in US dollars cash, to cover all expenses. If you bring more than US$10,000, you must report this upon entry to Liberia. You may exit with no more than US$7,500 in cash.
