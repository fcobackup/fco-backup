Travel in France
There has been a sharp rise in the number of COVID-19 cases in France during recent weeks. France has put measures in place to limit the spread of the virus.
The French Government has introduced a tiered alert system to indicate where COVID-19 is circulating actively. These are i) alert zones; ii) high alert zones; and iii) critical alert zones. Many of Franceâ€™s largest cities fall into one of these categories. Restrictions include the partial or total closure of bars, and a limit on the number of people allowed to gather in public. To find out more about local restrictions, please refer to the French government website as well as local guidance.
Public spaces and services
Wearing face masks in enclosed public spaces has been compulsory since 20 July. This applies to those aged 11 and over. Local authorities in an increasing number of cities and regions (including Paris), have extended this to also include outdoor public spaces. Failure to comply with these restrictions may result in a fine. Please refer to local guidance for more information.
Since 11 May, wearing masks on public transport has been compulsory for all users aged 11 and over, with fines for those who are not compliant. Masks are also compulsory in taxis and private hire vehicles without a plexiglass screen.
Some travel operators such as airlines may specify types of masks to be worn on board e.g. surgical masks, and may encourage you to take spares for long journeys. Please check with your travel operator before travelling.
