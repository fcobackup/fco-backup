This page reflects the UK government’s understanding of current rules for people travelling on a full ‘British Citizen’ passport, for the most common types of travel.
The authorities in South Korea set and enforce entry rules. For further information contact the embassy, high commission or consulate of the country or territory you’re travelling to. You should also consider checking with your transport provider or travel company to make sure your passport and other travel documents meet their requirements.
Entry rules in response to coronavirus (COVID-19)
Visas
South Korean diplomatic missions in the UK are now issuing most types of long-term visas, including working visas. Visa on arrival for British passport holders remains in place, though you should be aware of the quarantine requirements set out below. You should check visa requirements with the Embassy of the Republic of Korea in London. Travellers need to obtain a Korea Electronic Travel Authorization (K-ETA) to enter South Korea visa-free, see ‘Regular Entry Requirements’.
Transiting in South Korea
All transit passengers receive a temperature check on arrival in Korea. Symptomatic individuals will be subject to a COVID-19 test and hospitalisation if found positive. Passengers who do not show symptoms and/or test negative may continue their journey. Transit passengers at Seoul Incheon Airport require a ticket/boarding pass for their onward flight to their final destination. They should confirm with the airline(s) before departure that their bags have been checked through to their final destination (as transit passengers are not able to collect and re-check in baggage on arrival in Incheon Airport).
Transit hotels are available in both Terminals 1 and 2 at Incheon Airport.
Testing on arrival
All foreign nationals arriving in South Korea (except children under the age of six and individuals with quarantine exemptions for “humanitarian reasons” – i.e. to attend a funeral – or official business reasons) are required to provide a negative PCR test certificate. LAMP tests are accepted. The test must have been taken within the 48 hours prior to departure. You should review the detailed information on the Embassy of the Republic of Korea in London website.
All arrivals – including children under the age of six, and regardless of nationality and length of stay – are also required to be tested for coronavirus (COVID-19) within 24 hours after entering South Korea. If you are not resident in South Korea, you will be taken for testing and must remain at the testing facility until a negative result has been secured.
If you have recently recovered from COVID-19, you will still need to receive a negative PCR test result as described above before you are able to fly to South Korea. You should bring with you an official note from your doctor detailing when you tested positive, what treatment you received and/or what isolation you observed. If you test positive or inconclusive on arrival, Korean officials will consider this information when deciding how to proceed. Some British Nationals have tested negative in the UK and then tested positive on arrival in South Korea. Korean health officials have broad discretion in deciding what precautions are required and you may be required to quarantine even if you are no longer testing positive.
Quarantine and quarantine exemptions
The default requirement when entering South Korea is to quarantine for seven days at home (if you are resident in South Korea) or in a government quarantine facility (if you are visiting). You can avoid quarantine entirely if you have a ‘quarantine exemption’. If you’re visiting, you can quarantine with relatives if you can prove your relationship to them and if their accommodation meets certain standards.
You can apply for a quarantine exemption if you have been fully vaccinated against COVID-19. The process of applying for a quarantine exemption varies depending on where you were vaccinated and the purpose of your travel.
Most quarantine exemptions are currently suspended to control the spread of the omicron variant, regardless of your nationality or vaccination status. If you arrive in South Korea without a valid quarantine exemption you will need to quarantine for seven days.
Quarantine exemptions will continue to be issued only if you are resident outside of South Korea, only for a visit lasting 14 days or less, and only for business and academic travellers, government officials, or if you are travelling to Korea for the funeral of a close family member. You can apply for a quarantine exemption via the Korean Embassy in the country where you were vaccinated. “Family member” is defined as your spouse, a sibling of you or your spouse, or a “lineal” family member (parents/grandparents or children/grandchildren) of you or your spouse. Guidance is available from the Embassy of the Republic of Korea in London. Any UK family relationship certificates (i.e. marriage or birth certificates) that you submit as part of your application need to be legalised (or “apostilled”) by the Foreign, Commonwealth & Development Office before you submit them. Find out how to get a document legalised. South Korea does not accept marriage certificates or civil partnership documents between same-sex partners for the purposes of applying for a quarantine exemption. If you are travelling for business or academic purposes, you need to obtain special approval from the relevant Korean ministries; if you are travelling for business, your employer can apply through the Business Support Centre (in Korean).
Even if you have a quarantine exemption, on arrival in Korea you will need to submit a negative PCR test taken within the 48 hours prior to your departure (with some exceptions, see ‘Testing on arrival’ above). You will be taken to an airport testing centre for your PCR test on arrival and will not be able to leave until the result has been received. You will need to do antigen tests on days three and five and a PCR test on day seven, and comply with active health monitoring through the Korean government app.
Quarantine is mandatory if you do not have a quarantine exemption. Korean nationals and long-term foreign visitors with an Alien Registration Card and Korean residence may self-quarantine at home for seven days.
Foreign short-term travellers may be able to quarantine with family members under specific circumstances. Your family member must be your spouse or a direct ascendent or descendent (a parent/grandparent or a child/grandchild, not a sibling) and must be resident in Korea (i.e. a Korean national or a foreigner with a long-term stay visa). You must be able to prove your family relationship, for example by showing your ID, a copy of your family member’s Korean ID, and a marriage or birth certificate, which must be legalised (or “apostilled”). (UK-issued documents can be legalised by the Foreign, Commonwealth & Development Office - find out how to get a document legalised. Certified translations are required for documents not in English.) Your family’s accommodation must meet certain basic standards (typically, they must have a separate bedroom and a separate bathroom for you). Your family must also be available to pick you up from the airport or the quarantine facility. These rules may change at short notice – your family member in Korea should double-check the rules before you travel by calling the Korea Disease Control and Prevention Agency on 1339 (support is available in English).
All other foreign short-term travellers must quarantine at a government-designated facility for seven days. Individuals are required to pay a daily charge of around 120,000KRW (approximately £75) while in government quarantine facilities.
If you test positive for COVID-19 on arrival, you must comply with self-quarantine and treatment instructions issued by the Korean authorities. See Testing positive for COVID-19.
For more information contact the Korea Disease Control and Prevention Agency on 1339 from inside South Korea (support is available in English).
Onward travel from the airport
If you are required to quarantine at a government-designated facility, transport to the facility (usually a bus) will be provided. You will be guided to the transport by airport officials as part of your arrivals process.
If you are a short-term visitor quarantining with family members, your family members must pick you up from the airport or from a quarantine facility later. (You will likely not be able to choose which facility you are sent to, so will not be able to pick one that is convenient for pickup.)
If you are a short-term visitor with a quarantine exemption, you will need to proceed from the airport to the location where you will be staying using quarantine transport (see below).
If you are resident in Korea and able to quarantine at home, you will be expected to make your way home using either your own car or quarantine transport options (see below).
Quarantine transport options are available from the airport. Quarantine taxis can take you door-to-door. Quarantine buses run from the airport to locations around Seoul, from which you can take a quarantine taxi to your final destination. There are also quarantine KTX (bullet train) options if you live outside of Seoul; a quarantine bus will take you from the airport to Gwangmyeong KTX station. Once you reach your destination KTX station, you will be assisted to take a quarantine taxi to your final destination. Guidance is available at the airport on how best to proceed to your destination.
Demonstrating your COVID-19 status
For the purposes of applying for an exemption from quarantine, the Embassy of the Republic of Korea in London will accept the UK’s proof of COVID-19 recovery and vaccination record. Your NHS appointment card from vaccination centres is not designed to be used as proof of vaccination and should not be used to demonstrate your vaccine status.
Data collection
Individuals from the UK will be tested for COVID-19 on arrival, and will need to participate with an active monitoring system via regular calls with a health expert and a specialised mobile app.
Make sure you have with you a mobile telephone with the roaming function enabled, and/or the telephone number of a friend, relative or contact who can update the authorities daily on your state of health. A hotel telephone number will not be accepted. Immigration authorities will undertake a test call before travellers leave the airport, and any individual unable to verify their contact details may be denied entry to South Korea.
During your quarantine period, the location of your mobile phone will be tracked, and you will be contacted if you leave the place where you are quarantining.
Regular entry requirements
Visas and K-ETA
If you have a British Citizen passport you can enter South Korea as a tourist for up to 90 days without a visa, though you should remain aware of the quarantine requirements. You must also have an onward or return ticket. It’s illegal to work on a tourist visa, whether as a teacher or in any other capacity.
You must be in possession of a Korea Electronic Travel Authorization (K-ETA) to enter Korea visa-free. You can complete your K-ETA application up to 24 hours before boarding your flight and it will be valid for two years from the date of approval. There is a small, non-refundable charge. Visit the official K-ETA website for more information and to apply.
If you have a different type of British nationality, or are travelling for any purpose other than tourism, you should check visa requirements with the Embassy of the Republic of Korea in London.
Long-term visa holders
Foreign nationals residing in South Korea on most types of long-term visa need to apply for a re-entry permit via the HiKorea website before undertaking any travel out of South Korea. (Re-entry permits can also be applied for at ports and airports prior to departure, but only in urgent circumstances such as a family emergency. The Korean authorities discourage in-person applications at Immigration Offices to prevent the spread of COVID-19.) If you are fully vaccinated against COVID-19, you can apply for a 1-year multiple re-entry permit which will be issued free of charge. You should engage early with the Immigration Authorities and apply for a re-entry permit in good time – at least four working days – ahead of any planned travel.
Long-term visa holders leaving South Korea without a re-entry permit will have their visa and Alien Registration Card cancelled and will need to obtain a new long-term visa before they can re-enter South Korea. There is no longer a requirement for re-entry permit holders to obtain a medical certificate before returning to South Korea, but all travellers require a negative COVID test certificate as detailed above.
Exceptions to the re-entry permit requirement include holders of A-1, A-2, A-3 and F-4 visas.
For further information, call the Korean Immigration Contact Centre (Tel: 1345) or see the list of official announcements here.
Passport validity
Your passport should be valid for a minimum period of 3 months from the date of entry into South Korea.
All foreigners living in South Korea are required to report any changes in their passport information (such as when receiving a new passport) either online using the Korean Immigration Office website or by visiting a local immigration office in South Korea. For further information, call the Korean Immigration Contact Centre (Tel: +82 1345).
UK Emergency Travel Documents
UK Emergency Travel Documents are accepted for entry, airside transit and exit from South Korea.
Customs declarations
Check the website of the Korea Customs Service for information on restricted or prohibited items that may not be brought into the country. If you are in any doubt about the legality of any items - including medications - you should declare them on entry.
South Korean customs authorities allow you to bring small amounts of medication for your personal use, provided that it is kept in carry-on baggage. It is advised to take an English language prescription from your doctor at home for both your prescription drugs and non-prescription medicines. It is also a good idea to consult the website of the South Korean Ministry of Food and Drug Safety before you travel to South Korea.
British males of Korean origin
If you are a British male of Korean origin whose name appears on the Korean family register, you may be liable for military service even if you are travelling on your British passport.
Employment
To get a visa to teach English in South Korea, you must have a 3-year university degree. A TEFL qualification alone is not sufficient. If you are found to have obtained a teaching visa by deception, you will be detained and deported.
British nationals teaching English in South Korea have sometimes found living and working conditions to be below expectations, and have encountered difficulties getting the correct visas and residence permits. There have also been complaints of breach of contract, confiscation of passports, payment being withheld and inadequate or no medical insurance. Check all terms and conditions of your employment carefully and if possible speak to other teachers from the place where you plan to work before accepting any offer. If you are in South Korea and in need of assistance, you should contact British Embassy Seoul.
For those in possession of a work visa, all employment changes must be authorised by Korean Immigration.
