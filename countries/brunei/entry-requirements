The information on this page covers the most common types of travel and reflects the UK government’s understanding of the rules currently in place. Unless otherwise stated, this information is for travellers using a full ‘British Citizen’ passport.
The authorities in the country or territory you’re travelling to are responsible for setting and enforcing the rules for entry. If you’re unclear about any aspect of the entry requirements, or you need further reassurance, you’ll need to contact the embassy, high commission or consulate of the country or territory you’re travelling to.
You should also consider checking with your transport provider or travel company to make sure your passport and other travel documents meet their requirements.
Entry rules in response to coronavirus (COVID-19)
Entry to Brunei
Entry to Brunei is severely restricted. Anyone seeking to enter or exit Brunei must apply for a permit from the Prime Minister’s Office at least 8 working days before the intended date of travel. See the Brunei Prime Minister’s Office website for further information, or contact the Brunei High Commission.
Brunei has announced that travellers to Brunei will need to provide a negative COVID-19 RT PCR test on arrival, obtained within 72 hours of travel. You should not use the NHS testing service to get a test in order to facilitate your travel to another country. You should arrange to take a private test.
Brunei continues to enforce an exit travel ban, including for permanent residents, and expatriate workers (green identity card holders), and their dependants. Exceptions will be considered by the Prime Minister’s Office on a case-by-case basis. Applicants must apply online, giving 3 working days’ notice of the intention to travel. Full details are available on the Prime Minister’s Office website.
As of 6 April 2021, Brunei has banned any cross-border entry of travellers via land and sea ports, including transits through Brunei except for entry and transit travels that have been granted approval by the government. You should refer to the Prime Minister’s Office website for the latest information.
Quarantine requirements
If the government of Brunei permits you entry, you will need to go into quarantine on arrival at a government designated facility (usually a local hotel). Travellers are responsible for booking directly with hoteliers and must secure your accommodation before arrival and have proof of their stay to show the airline at check-in. Currently quarantine is between 2 and 14 days. Travellers will be informed of the duration of quarantine on arrival and will need to cover the cost of their stay in their designated quarantine facility.
Testing/screening on arrival
Brunei has announced that travellers to Brunei will need to provide a negative COVID-19 RT PCR test on arrival, obtained within 72 hours of travel.
All foreigners must pay $350 BND for a COVID-19 test before they depart on their journey to Brunei. Travellers should carry proof of payment with them when checking in for their flight to Brunei.
You should ensure that you have the means to pay for your hotel in Brunei for the duration of your quarantine period.
Immigration Control Posts at Brunei’s land borders are operating shortened hours from 6am and last call at 4pm. There are health and temperature screening measures at borders. You should comply with any additional screening measures put in place by the local authorities.
Data collection
On arrival in Brunei, you will be encouraged to download the BruHealth app. Failure to use the app may result in you not being able to access a number of day-to-day facilities.
Regular entry requirements
Visas
British Citizen passport holders may enter Brunei for up to 90 days without a visa. If you have another type of British nationality, check with Brunei immigration authorities about visa requirements.
Make sure the entry stamp in your passport indicates the validity of your stay. There are strict penalties for overstaying.
If you’re staying longer than 90 days and/or visiting for non-tourist purposes, you will need to get a visa from the nearest Brunei diplomatic mission before you travel.
Passport validity  
Your passport should be valid for a minimum period of 6 months from the date of entry into Brunei. 
Dual nationality
Brunei does not recognise dual nationality. You can be refused entry if you’re found to be holding two passports of different nationality. If you’re a dual national, it’s advisable to enter Brunei on the passport on which you exited your last country of departure. While in Brunei your nationality will be deemed to be that shown on the passport which you used to enter the country. This may affect the consular assistance that you receive in Brunei.
Yellow fever certificate requirements
Check whether you need a yellow fever certificate by visiting the National Travel Health Network and Centre’s TravelHealthPro website.
UK Emergency Travel Documents
UK Emergency travel documents are accepted for entry, airside transit and exit from Brunei. They should have at least 6 months validity. You’ll have to obtain an exit and entry visa from Brunei Immigration before you travel.
