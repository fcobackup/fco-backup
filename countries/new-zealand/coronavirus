Travel in New Zealand
After confirmation of new cases of Covid-19 outside of Managed Isolation or Quarantine facilities, the New Zealand Government announced the re-introduction of some lockdown measures.
Since 7 October, Auckland has been at Alert Level 1, bringing it into line with the rest of the country. You can find detailed information on the alert levels and the measures introduced from the New Zealand Government.
While not mandatory at Alert Level 1, government advice encourages the use of face coverings on public transport and where it is not possible to maintain physical distance from people who you do not know, for example in supermarkets. The government also encourages people to keep track of their movements and who they have seen to help with contact tracing, if required. A NZ COVID Tracer app is available to download for this purpose. Detailed information on face coverings is available from the New Zealand government.
Travellers may continue to undertake domestic travel by plane or road in order to connect with international flight departures from Auckland or Christchurch.
New Zealand’s border restrictions remain in place and public health measures remain unchanged (wash hands and high-touch surfaces regularly, stay home if sick, and get tested if symptomatic).
