New Zealand is currently at Level 2 of its Covid-19 Alert Level System. You can find detailed information on the alert levels and the measures introduced from the New Zealand Government.
Travellers on public transport in New Zealand or taking flights are required to wear a face covering. This does not include taxi or rideshare passengers, school buses, chartered tours, inter-island ferries and private flights. The requirement applies only to people over the age of 12. People with a disability or a physical or mental condition that makes covering their face difficult are not required to wear one. Detailed information on face coverings is available from the New Zealand government.
Travellers may continue to undertake domestic travel by plane or road in order to connect with international flight departures from Auckland. If arriving in Auckland by plane from another destination in New Zealand to connect with an international flight, you must stay in the airport, and cannot remain for more than 12 hours. International transits through Auckland airport are not affected.
New Zealand’s border restrictions remain in place and public health measures remain unchanged (wash hands and high-touch surfaces regularly, stay home if sick, and get tested if symptomatic).
