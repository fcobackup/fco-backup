The official currency is the Macedonian Denar (MKD). Credit cards are accepted in most hotels and shops, and ATMs increasingly accept international bank cards. British banks do not exchange Denars so you may wish to exchange any unwanted Denars before you leave North Macedonia. You should only change money through banks or official exchange offices and not through street dealers. You will be unable to exchange Scottish and Northern Irish bank notes.
You must declare any cash amount of foreign currency greater than EUR 10,000 on entry into North Macedonia. Failure to do so may result in detention and forfeiture of funds when attempting to leave North Macedonia.
ATMs are widely available in North Macedonia.
