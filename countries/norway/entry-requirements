Coronavirus guidance is being updated.
Read the Prime Minister’s statement for the latest information.

The information on this page covers the most common types of travel and reflects the UK government’s understanding of the rules currently in place. Unless otherwise stated, this information is for travellers using a full ‘British Citizen’ passport.
The authorities in the country or territory you’re travelling to are responsible for setting and enforcing the rules for entry. If you’re unclear about any aspect of the entry requirements, or you need further reassurance, you’ll need to contact the embassy, high commission or consulate of the country or territory you’re travelling to.
You should also consider checking with your transport provider or travel company to make sure your passport and other travel documents meet their requirements.
Restrictions in response to coronavirus
Entry
Norwegian borders have been partially closed since 16 March. If you’re legally resident in Norway, you will be allowed to enter the country but must self-quarantine for 10 days. You should travel with evidence of residency in Norway. Those with symptoms will be isolated. For details on quarantine and isolation rules, see the [Norwegian Institute of Public Health website].
On 12 May, restrictions on EEA citizens, which currently includes British nationals, visiting immediate family members were eased. The Norwegian Directorate of Immigration (UDI) website has lists of those allowed to visit Norwegian family members and those allowed to visit non-Norwegian family members resident in Norway.
You can travel to Norway to begin work, provided that the work is imminent. In order to gain entry you will need to bring a copy of your work contract. If you are coming to Norway to work on a temporary assignment you should also bring evidence of this. Those who come to Norway to work are required to follow the quarantine regulations.
For more information, contact the Norwegian Embassy in London. Detailed guidance is available on the UDI website.
Transit
Non-residents are still able to transit via Norwegian airports as long as the final destination is not within Norway, but please check with your airline before departing.

A number of Norwegian ports are restricting passenger embarkation and disembarkation. The situation can change rapidly so check with your cruise provider before travelling.
