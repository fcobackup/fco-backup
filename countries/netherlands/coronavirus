Travelling from and returning to the UK
Check what you must do to travel abroad and return to England, Scotland, Wales or Northern Ireland.
If you plan to pass through another country to return to the UK, check the travel advice for the country you’re transiting. If you will pass through a red list country, book your hotel quarantine package before travelling to the UK.
You are responsible for organising your own COVID-19 test, in line with UK government testing requirements. The Dutch Municipal Health Service (GGD) can only be used for testing if you have COVID-19 symptoms. See the Dutch Government’s website for more details of how and where to get tested for travel purposes. Always check that the type of test and the test result certificate meets the full testing requirements (e.g. name of the test provider and their contact details, if appropriate) for entry into either England, Scotland, Wales and Northern Ireland.
Be prepared for your plans to change
No travel is risk-free during COVID. Countries may further restrict travel or bring in new rules at short notice, for example due to a new COVID-19 variant. Check with your travel company or airline for any transport changes which may delay your journey home.
If you test positive for COVID-19, you may need to stay where you are until you test negative. You may also need to seek treatment there.
Plan ahead and make sure you:
can access money
understand what your insurance will cover
can make arrangements to extend your stay and be away for longer than planned
Travel in the Netherlands
The latest information on Dutch domestic coronavirus measures can be found on the Dutch government website (in English).
Where possible, the Dutch government advises to avoid crowds and to travel outside peak hours if taking public transport.
Face masks must be worn on public transport, in stations and on platforms by those aged 13 and over. If you do not wear a face mask as directed, you may be fined €95.
For other shared forms of transport, such as taxis, passenger vans and coaches, you must wear a face mask, unless you are the only passenger. If you’re travelling in a car or other private vehicle, you are advised to wear face masks if there are two or more people in the vehicle who belong to different households.
Children under the age of 13 are not required to wear a face mask.
Schiphol, Eindhoven and Rotterdam Airports
All passengers and staff aged 13+ must wear face masks in all areas of these airports. The terminals are only open for passengers and staff. You must not be accompanied into the airport, unless absolutely necessary for a traveller with reduced mobility.
Ferries
DFDS
All travellers must wear face coverings at check-in, whilst boarding, and during disembarkation. This applies for both foot- and car passengers, as well as freight drivers. On the Amsterdam - Newcastle route, passengers must wear face coverings whilst moving around the ship. Face coverings do not need to be worn when travellers are in their cabins, seated in a socially distanced manner or whilst social distancing on outside decks.
P&O
All travellers must wear a face mask during their journey.
Eurostar
All passengers aged 13+ must wear a face mask on board trains, in stations and on platforms. If you don’t have a mask you may be refused travel on Eurostar services.
Public spaces and services
The Dutch Government have extended further measures in response to the coronavirus pandemic, until at least 14 January 2022. A full overview of measures is available on the Dutch Government’s website.
You must show evidence of full vaccination or of a negative PCR or rapid antigen test, taken within the last 24 hours, in order to access public venues such as restaurants, museums, theatres and cinemas. The UK’s proof of COVID-19 vaccination record and proof of COVID-19 vaccination issued in the Crown Dependencies is accepted. If you are travelling with a printed PDF proof of vaccination status, it must date from 1 November 2021 to ensure that it can be scanned successfully. The Dutch Government refers to this proof as the ‘Corona entry pass’.
Your NHS appointment card from vaccination centres is not designed to be used as proof of vaccination and should not be used to demonstrate your vaccine status. The Dutch government continues to advise people to avoid busy places. If a gathering poses a safety or public health risk, enforcement officers can take action.
You must keep 1.5 metres away from other people in public areas. You may be fined if you do not keep the 1.5 metre social distance. This applies to adults aged 18 years and over. This rule does not apply to people from the same household or to children. There are exemptions, for example on public transport, for contact professions such as hairdressers and for those providing care, such as pushing a wheelchair. See the Dutch Government’s website for further information about social distancing rules and exemptions (currently only available in Dutch).
Face masks are mandatory for people aged 13 and over in all publicly accessible indoor spaces, including public transport, shops, and museums. In indoor enclosed public spaces with assigned seating, such as restaurants and theatres, you must wear a face mask when moving around the venue. Face masks must be worn as well when visiting contact-based professions, such as the hairdresser. If you do not wear a face mask as directed, you may be fined. For further information visit the Dutch Government’s website.
Non-essential services such as clothing shops, hairdressers, amusement parks and wellness centres must close at 5pm. This also applies to restaurants, cafes, bars, theatres, concert halls, casinos and sports facilities. Essential services such as supermarkets and chemists must close at 8pm. In addition, amateur and professional sports events are currently not open for public. For more information, see the Dutch Government’s website.

COVID-19 vaccines if you live in the Netherlands
Wherever possible British nationals should aim to be vaccinated in the country where they live. We will update this page when the Government of The Netherlands announces new information on the national vaccination programme. You can sign up to get email notifications when this page is updated.
The Netherlands’ national vaccination programme started in January 2021 and is currently using Pfizer-BioNTech and Moderna vaccines. Janssen (Johnson and Johnson) may also be available. British nationals resident in The Netherlands are eligible for vaccination including children over the age of 12. If you are considering a vaccination for somebody in this age group, you should seek medical advice from their local healthcare provider. British Nationals aged 18-65 without a Citizen Services Number (BSN) can also be vaccinated. The Dutch government has issued information on the vaccination programme. If you are resident in the Netherlands, you should receive an invitation by letter or email when it is your turn to get the vaccination.
Find out more, including about vaccines that are authorised in the UK or approved by the World Health Organisation, on the COVID-19 vaccines if you live abroad.
If you’re a British national living in The Netherlands, you should seek medical advice from your local healthcare provider. Information about COVID-19 vaccines used in the national programme where you live, including regulatory status, should be available from local authorities.
If you receive your COVID-19 vaccination in the Netherlands, you can get an EU Digital COVID Certificate from the national authorities. The Certificate proves that you have been vaccinated against COVID-19, received a negative test result, or recovered from COVID-19. It will help facilitate your travel within the EU and, in some countries, you can use it to demonstrate your COVID-19 status to businesses and other organisations. For further information visit the European Commission’s EU Digital COVID Certificate page.
