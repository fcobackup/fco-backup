Lebanon is experiencing a prolonged and severe economic crisis, which has significantly increased the risk of instability in the country. The situation is unpredictable and could deteriorate without warning.
Violent clashes between protesters and security forces, and supporters of political groups, have occurred across the country, resulting in fatalities and injuries.
Basic commodities (fuel, medicines, food) have become increasingly scarce. Electricity in Lebanon is also very limited. The availability and quality of medical treatment is affected by the economic crisis and fuel shortages. See ‘Shortages’ and ‘Local medical care’ for further information and how to prepare yourself.
Consular support is severely limited in parts of Lebanon where we advise against all travel and limited where we advise against all but essential travel. In the event of deterioration in the political or security situation, the British Embassy may be limited in the assistance that it can provide. Do not rely on the FCDO being able to evacuate you in an emergency.
COVID-19 entry restrictions for Lebanon

Crime, including bag theft, property crime and sexual harassment in public spaces, has increased as a result of the economic decline in Lebanon. This includes in Beirut. See Safety and security.
A conflict with Israel could spark with little warning and lead to a rapid escalation in violence. There have been exchanges with the Israeli Defence Forces across the Blue Line in the South of Lebanon. This has included cross-border shelling, rocket fire and air strikes on Lebanon. See Security situation
Terrorists are very likely to try to carry out attacks in Lebanon. You should be vigilant at all times, avoid crowds and crowded places and follow the advice of the Lebanese authorities. Previous attacks have targeted the security forces, as well as locations where Western visitors may congregate. You should follow the advice of the local authorities, and check local news and this travel advice regularly. See Terrorism
There’s a heightened risk of terrorism against aviation. Additional security measures have been in place on flights departing from Lebanon to the UK since March 2017. You should co-operate fully with security officials.
Groups within Lebanon, including Hizballah, are proscribed under the Terrorism Act 2000 and the Counter Terrorism (Sanctions) (EU Exit) Regulations 2019. Offences committed under the act – including funding and supporting proscribed organisations – may be liable to prosecution in the UK.
On 4 August 2020 a large explosion occurred in the port area of Beirut causing widespread damage to buildings and infrastructure in the city and surrounding areas. Many of the buildings have not been repaired yet. You should exercise caution in affected areas as buildings may not be safe, though most are cordoned off.
There are unexploded ordnance and land mines in many places. You should avoid travelling away from established paths, especially when hiking. This is particularly a concern in southern Lebanon. See Local travel
You can contact the emergency services by calling 112.
