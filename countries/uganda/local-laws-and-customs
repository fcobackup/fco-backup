Homosexual activity is illegal and not tolerated in Uganda’s conservative society. Public displays of homosexuality like kissing in public places could lead to arrest and imprisonment. Members of the LGBT+ community may face discrimination, including becoming victims of physical violence and psychological abuse. Anti-LGBT+ rhetoric by religious leaders, politicians, government officials and the local media can incite homophobia against the LGBT+ community. See our information and advice page for the LGBT community before you travel.
