There are currently extremely limited commercial options available to return to the UK from Turkey.
The Turkish Government has implemented a ban on international flights until 1 June. Normal, scheduled international flights will not resume until the ban is lifted. At present there is no information about how soon airlines will resume their operations after it is lifted. Occasional ad hoc flights are still operating.
If you have a future reservation for a flight from Turkey to the UK other than those listed below and on our social media @UKinTurkey, there is no guarantee that the flight will operate. Contact your airline for the latest information.
If you live in the UK and are currently visiting Turkey, you are strongly advised to return now by commercial means. Don’t risk getting stranded.
