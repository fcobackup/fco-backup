This page has information on travelling to Indonesia. Check what you must do to return to the UK.
This page reflects the UK government’s understanding of current rules for people travelling on a full ‘British Citizen’ passport from the UK, for the most common types of travel.
The authorities in Indonesia set and enforce entry rules.
All travellers
You will need permission from the Indonesian authorities to enter Indonesia. In normal circumstances, if you’re travelling on a British Citizen passport you do not need a visa to enter Indonesia for visits of up to 30 days. This service is currently suspended.
With effect from 7 March 2022, British Citizens who are entering Indonesia via Bali for tourism purposes can apply for a visa on arrival at a cost of IDR 500,000. This visa is valid for 30 days, and can be extended once (for a maximum of 30 days) by making an application to an immigration office within Indonesia. Ensure that you extend your visa within the initial 30 days to avoid an overstay fine.
Foreigners can also apply for a visitor or limited stay visa, including visas on compassionate grounds. The application should be made by a local sponsor to the Director General of Immigration.
The Indonesian embassy has introduced a new e-visa system. You or your sponsor should submit your visa application online.
A full list of visas is available on the Indonesian Immigration website.

If the final test is positive, you will be referred to hospital at your own expense.
Fully vaccinated travellers do not need to have antigen/PCR test to travel domestically.
Proof of vaccination status
You must present proof that you have been fully vaccinated to enter Indonesia.
You can use the NHS COVID Pass to demonstrate your vaccination record when entering Indonesia. You will need to present both soft and hard copies of your NHS vaccination certificates at various stages of your journey. Your NHS appointment card from vaccination centres is not designed to be used as proof of vaccination and should not be used to demonstrate your vaccine status.
If you’re not fully vaccinated
If you’re not fully vaccinated, you’ll need to show proof of a negative PCR test (taken no more than 48 hours before entry) when entering Indonesia. The certificate must be in English. See information on getting a test before entry.
If you are unvaccinated you are not allowed to enter Indonesia unless you can produce a doctor’s letter with a statement showing why you cannot be vaccinated. This letter will also be assessed by the Indonesian health authorities before entry is permitted. Contact the Indonesian Embassy in London for further advice.
Quarantine Regulation
If you are fully vaccinated, you can enter Indonesia directly from Batam, Bintan, or Bali. You will need to take a PCR test upon arrival and need to quarantine in a COVID-19 approved hotel until you get the test result. It takes approximately 1 day. If the test result is positive, you will be referred to a quarantine facility. If the test result is negative, you can continue your journey. You will be required to self-arrange another PCR test on day 3 after your arrival and report the result to the previously used quarantine hotel. For travellers arriving in Bali who wish to continue their journey to other parts of Indonesia, you need to stay at least 4 days in Bali before continuing the journey.
If you are not fully vaccinated, you can enter Indonesia through other entry points but have to be quarantined for 7 x 24 hours.
If you’ve had COVID-19 in the past year
If you’re not fully vaccinated but have tested positive for COVID-19 in the last year you can still enter Indonesia. You’ll need to show proof of a negative PCR test within 48 hours of arrival and follow the same 7 day quarantine rules and testing requirements that apply to those who are not fully vaccinated and have never had COVID-19.
You can use the NHS COVID Pass to demonstrate proof of COVID-19 recovery when entering Indonesia.

Visa scams
Beware of visa scams by fraudulent visa agents who, having taken your money, may fail to provide a visa or supply the wrong kind. This could result in your overstaying and a fine of IDR 1million/day, detention, deportation and possible re-entry ban. You should use the Indonesian Immigration self-service portal.
Visa scams are on the rise in Indonesia. The British Embassy is aware of numerous foreign nationals in Bali who have been the victim of visa scams at this time. Many have lost significant sums of money, some have been deported despite paying large fees to their agent to secure the correct visa or extension to stay.
If you wish to use to use an agent, do thorough due diligence and check for reviews and recommendations.
Dual nationality
Indonesian law doesn’t allow dual nationality for adults over 18 years of age. If you’re a British national who has retained Indonesian nationality, you may experience immigration difficulties in Indonesia.
UK Emergency Travel Documents
UK Emergency Travel Documents (ETDs) are accepted for airside transit and exit from Indonesia. ETDs may also be accepted for entry into Indonesia. If you’re entering Indonesia using an ETD you must apply for a visit visa before travelling. You won’t be able to get a visa on arrival. The processing time for an Indonesian visa can vary depending on where you apply. Some Indonesian embassies do not issue Indonesian visas in ETDs. Contact your nearest Indonesian Embassy to check before you apply.
Entry requirements may differ if you live in Indonesia. Contact your nearest Indonesian Embassy to confirm whether you need to apply for a visit visa before you travel to Indonesia using an ETD.
If you apply for an ETD whilst in Indonesia, you may need to get an exit permit from Immigration to leave the country. We will advise you to contact the nearest Immigration office to check before travelling.
Proof of onward travel
