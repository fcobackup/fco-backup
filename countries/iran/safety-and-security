The FCDO advises against all travel to Iran.
British and British-Iranian dual nationals are at very/significantly high risk of arbitrary arrest, questioning or detention. Holding a British passport can be reason enough for the authorities to target you. If you are detained in Iran, you could face months or years of imprisonment. Our ability to provide consular assistance is extremely limited. In an emergency – such as serious deterioration in the security situation – it is extremely unlikely the British government will be able to evacuate you or provide assistance on the ground in Iran. In these situations, it may become more difficult to leave safely.
You should assume that the British government will not be able to help you if you get into difficulty in Iran. Given these risks, we advise against all travel to Iran. If you are a British national already resident in Iran, you should carefully consider your presence there and the risks you are taking by remaining.
A number of British-Iranian dual nationals have been arbitrarily detained in Iran and made to serve long prison sentences. In January 2023 a British national was executed after receiving the death penalty. Iran has also recently arrested and detained non-Iranian European nationals travelling on tourist visas. The criminal justice process followed in such cases falls below international standards. If you are detained in Iran your case will be in the hands of the Iranian authorities, who have shown a pattern of hostility towards the UK and its citizens. Our consular assistance to British nationals in Iran is therefore extremely limited.
The Iranian authorities have accused people with links to the UK of inciting protests. If you are in or near a protest, you are at serious risk of arrest. Mass arrests, including of bystanders, is a frequent occurrence. It is difficult to predict where protests will take place, and they may turn violent. Anyone who is arrested in connection with protests and holds British nationality may come under added suspicion of espionage or working to undermine the Iranian government, increasing the risk of lengthy detention, criminal charges and/or receiving the death penalty. You may also come under suspicion if you are near sensitive sites, have contact with Iranians who are of interest to the authorities for any reason, or are taking photographs.
The Iranian authorities can restrict internet access and in some cases there are internet shutdowns. Mobile data, non-Iranian mobile apps and international calls may not work and should not be relied on for personal safety.
Even if you avoid protests, crowds and sensitive sites, there is still a very/significantly high risk that British nationals and British-Iranian dual nationals are arbitrarily arrested, questioned or detained in Iran. In all cases of detention in Iran, the FCDO has serious concerns that the judicial process falls below international standards.
Although having British connections can be reason enough for the authorities to be suspicious of your activities, you are at even greater risk if you are involved in civil societies (including labour unions, human rights groups or political activist groups), journalism or academia, or have links to any organisation perceived as being anti-Iranian, either within Iran or elsewhere. These could include individuals with links to institutions based in the UK, or which receive public funds from, or which have perceived links to, the British government.
You are more at risk during times of national unrest, terrorist incident or when there is an increase in tensions between Iran and the international community.
In the event of an emergency, for example if there is serious violence or unrest within Iran, it is extremely unlikely that the British government will able to evacuate you safely. Air, sea and land routes are under the control of the Iranian authorities. You should assume that no consular assistance will be possible in an emergency situation. If you are a British national already resident in Iran, you should carefully consider your presence there and the risks you are taking by remaining.
Dual nationals
The Iranian authorities do not recognise dual nationality, so if you are a British-Iranian dual national and are detained, the FCDO will not be informed of your detention by the authorities and will not be granted access to see you. For British nationals without Iranian dual-nationality, the FCDO may not be informed for some time of your detention and the FCDO may be denied consular welfare visits for long periods of time. Even if you don’t consider yourself to be Iranian, you may be regarded as an Iranian national by the Iranian authorities.
Satellite phones and drones
On no account should you import or use drones or satellite phones/equipment in Iran. Doing so without the permission of the Iranian authorities is illegal and may lead to your arrest. British nationals already residing in Iran should keep a low profile and remain culturally sensitive at all times. See Local laws and customs.
Mobile telephones and communications
The Iranian authorities have blocked or significantly slowed landline and mobile internet services without warning on a number of occasions. Such restrictions can be localised or nationwide, and can affect communication and location services on smartphones and other devices. Mobile data, non-Iranian mobile apps and international calls may not work and should not be relied on for personal safety. You should keep an alternative means of communication and navigation with you at all times, and ensure that friends and family know your whereabouts.
Local travel
Border areas
Border areas are particularly sensitive. The FCDO advises all British nationals already residing in Iran against all travel within 100km of the Iran/Afghanistan border; within 10km of the entire Iran/Iraq border; to the province of Sistan-Baluchistan; to the area to the east of Bam and Jask, including Bam.
The area east of Bam and Jask and Sistan-Baluchistan are notorious for banditry and the main route for drug-traffickers from Afghanistan and Pakistan. The towns of Zahedan, Zabol and Mirjaveh are particularly insecure.
Some Iranian officials and media reports have falsely alleged a UK connection to anti-government groups in Khuzestan, Kurdish-majority regions and Sistan-Baluchistan. If you travel to these areas against our advice, stick to the main routes to avoid accidentally entering the numerous restricted or military zones.
Crime
There have been some attacks and robberies against foreigners, for example attempted robberies by bogus policemen, usually in civilian clothing. If you are approached by anyone who claims to be a policeman, ask to see their ID and request the presence of a uniformed officer or marked patrol car. Don’t hand over any documents or cash, or get in to any vehicle.
There have been incidents of motorcycle taxis taking tourists to quiet locations where they are then robbed.
Take sensible precautions to protect yourself from street crime and petty theft. Avoid carrying large amounts of money and keep your passport safe. Pre-booked taxis are safer than those hailed from the street.
Road travel
Visitors can drive in Iran on a foreign driving licence for up to 6 months, but it is advised to also carry an International Driving Permit (IDP). UK licence holders driving in Iran will need the 1968 version of the IDP. 1926 IDPs previously issued by the UK may no longer be accepted for use in Iran. You can get IDPs over the counter from most UK Post Offices. You will not be able to buy an IDP outside the UK, so get one before you travel.
Iran has a high rate of road accidents. Take great care when travelling by road, including by public transport and when crossing streets. If you’re involved in an accident, no matter how minor, don’t leave the scene. Wait until the police arrive to make their report.
The Iranian authorities sometimes set up informal roadblocks both in cities and on main highways. They are often staffed by young and inexperienced officers. You should always carry your identification with you and avoid getting into disputes.
Women aren’t allowed to drive a motorcycle on public roads.
Air travel
Commercial airlines still operate flights to and from Iran, but flight schedules may be subject to changes or cancellation at short notice. A number of airlines have suspended flights to and from Iran. Some commercial airlines, such as Qatar Airways, Lufthansa, Turkish Airlines, Emirates and Iran Air, are operating, but services are limited. If you decide to travel by air, contact your airline or travel company for the latest information before travelling. If you are a British national residing in Iran and you’re transiting through a third country while travelling to or from Iran, you may wish to check their latest entry requirements.
In January 2020, Iranian air defence systems mistakenly shot down Ukrainian International Airlines flight PS752 shortly after take-off from Imam Khomeini International Airport in Tehran.
In 2018, the International Civil Aviation Organisation carried out an audit of the level of implementation of the critical elements of safety oversight in Iran. You can find a list of recent incidents and accidents on the website of the Aviation Safety network.
The FCDO can’t offer advice on the safety of individual airlines. However, the International Air Transport Association publishes a list of registered airlines that have been audited and found to meet a number of operational safety standards and recommended practices. This list is not exhaustive and the absence of an airline from this list doesn’t necessarily mean that it’s unsafe.
All aircraft operated by Iran Aseman Airlines and some aircraft operated by Iran Air have been refused permission to operate services to the EU.
Sea travel
Many areas of the Caspian Sea and Persian Gulf are highly sensitive politically. The waters around the islands of Abu Musa and the Tunbs in the southern Persian Gulf are particularly sensitive and are militarised. In 2005, a British couple who anchored at Abu Musa were detained and French and German nationals were imprisoned for entering the waters near the island. In November 2009, a group of British sailors were detained for a week, along with their yacht, after accidentally sailing into Iranian waters in this area.
British national mariners should not attempt to dock at all or sail into waters around these islands.
You should maintain a high state of awareness and be alert to local and regional tensions which may affect your route. Vessels operating in the Gulf of Oman, Northern Arabian Sea, Gulf of Aden and Bab El Mandeb regions may be at increased risk of maritime attack.
Several commercial vessels have been attacked and seized in and around the Gulf of Oman and the Strait of Hormuz in recent years. In July 2021 a container ship with an international crew was attacked by unmanned aerial vehicles off of Oman, killing a British, and a Romanian national. During vessel seizures, both ships and crew have previously been detained for extended periods.
Consular assistance services
Consular support is extremely limited in Iran. If you need consular assistance you should contact the British Embassy on telephone: +98 (0)21 6405 2000.
In an emergency, including if you need an Emergency Travel Document, you should contact the FCDO in London on telephone: +44 20 7008 5000 (24 hours).
In the event of a sudden deterioration in the overall situation, it is extremely unlikely that the British government will be able to evacuate you safely. You should assume that no consular assistance will be possible in an emergency situation, and that the FCDO will be unable to provide assistance to leave the country.
At present, you can’t apply for a British passport from Iran.
If you’re in Iran and need to apply for a British passport, you should apply in a neighbouring country of your choice. You can find details of the application process on the GOV.UK website. If you need further information and advice, you should contact HM Passport Office.
