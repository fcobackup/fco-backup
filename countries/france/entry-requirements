Travel between the UK and France
France announced they would be restricting travel from the UK from 20 December. Travel restrictions apply to all air, car, ferry and train passengers. Only the following categories of people are authorised to travel to France from the UK:
French nationals and nationals of the European Area and their spouses and children
British and/or third country nationals who are either habitually resident in France, the European Union or the European Area, or who must travel for certain essential reasons (as specified by the French government)
British or third country nationals travelling for certain exceptional reasons, for details, see the French Embassy London’s list
All travellers from the UK, including children aged 11 and above, will need to present a negative COVID-19 test result, carried out less than 72 hours before departure. Both PCR and other antigen tests are accepted for entry into France; a full list can be found on the website of the French Embassy. You should not use the NHS testing service to get a test in order to facilitate your travel to another country. You should arrange to take a private test. A list of private providers of coronavirus testing is available here
If you were due to travel to France, contact your travel operator. Further updates will be published when they are available. Check our COVID-19 advice on things to consider, and be prepared to stay overseas longer than planned.
Further updates will be published when they are available.
Transiting via Geneva Airport (Switzerland) to France
For travellers coming from the UK, it is not currently possible to transit Geneva Airport (Switzerland) to enter France unless you hold a residence or cross-border permit for Switzerland. A French residence permit will not allow travellers to enter Switzerland for onward travel to France. Please see Switzerland Travel Advice for further information.
Travel between the EU and non-European countries
The French government has put in place COVID-19 travel restrictions on international arrivals in order to enter France. UK travellers/non-EU and EEA nationals resident in the UK will not be permitted entry to France for non-essential purposes due to EU-wide COVID-19 restrictions on arrivals from the UK. Essential travel is still permitted and a list of exemption for entering France can be found on the French government’s advice for foreign nationals in France page. These restrictions do not apply to UK nationals who are legally resident in France. You will be allowed to re-enter the country, but may need to show proof of residence.
Certain countries are exempt from these travel restrictions, including arrivals from the European Area (which the French Ministry of the Interior considers as EU Member States, Andorra, Holy See, Iceland, Liechtenstein, Monaco, Norway, San Marino, and Switzerland) and certain non-European countries.
Further information on French COVID-19 travel restrictions, including a list of exempted countries, can be found on the French government’s website.
If you are travelling from a country which is not exempt from French COVID-19 travel restrictions you may only enter France if your journey is essential and meets the criteria for exceptions. You will also need to complete both an exempted international movement certificate and a sworn declaration that you do not have COVID-19 symptoms, which can be found on the French government’s website. You may also be required to present a negative test result, carried out less than 72 hours before departure, upon your arrival in France. If you do not have this result, you could be asked to take this test at your airport of arrival in France. Further information is available from the French Government’s advice for foreign nationals in France.
No travel restrictions are in place for leaving France but travellers should equip themselves with the necessary attestation whilst travelling to their point of international departure if travel takes place during the daily curfew. Some countries are imposing a compulsory period of quarantine for travellers from France. If you are travelling from or through France, check the situation at your destination before you travel.
Travel to French overseas territories
Regular flights between metropolitan France and its overseas territories resumed in late June. Travellers need to provide a negative RT-PCR test taken in the 72 hours preceding arrival, and complete a self-declaration of absence of COVID-19 symptoms and contact with confirmed cases in the 14 days preceding arrival for entry into all French overseas territories. This is available in English on the French Embassy London’s travel and quarantine page.
For travel to Réunion, French Polynesia, Mayotte, New Caledonia and Wallis and Futuna you must present an international travel certificate confirming that your journey is essential and that you have not been suffering from a set of listed symptoms associated with COVID-19 or in contact with confirmed cases in the 14 days prior to travel. It is available on the French Ministry of Interior website. The certificate is to be presented to transportation companies before boarding, as well as to border control authorities.
International travel certificates are not required for travel to other French overseas territories.
See travel advice pages for the French overseas territory you are visiting.
Regular entry requirements
Visas
The rules for travelling or working in European countries changed on 1 January 2021:
you can travel to countries in the Schengen area for up to 90 days in any 180-day period without a visa. This applies if you travel as a tourist, to visit family or friends, to attend business meetings, cultural or sports events, or for short-term studies or training
if you are travelling to France and other Schengen countries without a visa, make sure your whole visit is within the 90-day limit. Visits to Schengen countries within the previous 180 days before you travel count towards your 90 days
to stay longer, to work or study, for business travel or for other reasons, you will need to meet the French government’s entry requirements. Check with the French Embassy what type of visa and/or work permit you may need
if you stay in France with a visa or permit, this does not count towards the 90-day limit
Any time you spent in France or other Schengen countries before 1 January 2021 does not count towards your 90-day visa-free limit.
The French government has published further information on requirements for British nationals travelling to France, you should consult this before travelling.
At French border control your passport may be stamped on entry and exit. You should also be prepared to:
queue in separate lanes from EU, EEA or Swiss citizens

For further information on these requirements, see the French government’s website for British citizens and our Living in France guide.
Passport validity
Check your passport is valid for travel before you book your trip, and renew your passport if you do not have enough time left on it.
You must have at least 6 months left on an adult or child passport to travel to most countries in Europe (not including Ireland).
If you renewed your current passport before the previous one expired, extra months may have been added to its expiry date. Any extra months on your passport over 10 years may not count towards the 6 months needed.
Travelling with children
From 15 January 2017, any child (under the age of 18) who is (a) living in France and (b) leaving France unaccompanied by a parent or guardian, must present the following documents on departure at the French border: (i) the child’s own ID card or passport, (ii) a completed AST authorisation form signed by a parent/guardian (Authorisation de Sortie du Territoire) and (iii) a copy of the ID card or passport of the parent or guardian who has signed the AST form.

UK Emergency Travel Documents
UK Emergency Travel Documents (ETDs) are accepted for entry, airside transit and exit from France.
Travelling with pets
If you wish to travel with a pet to the EU, please read our guidance.
On arrival in France, pet owners travelling with pets will need to enter through a designated travelers’ point of entry (TPE).
If your pet passport was issued in an EU Member State it remains valid for travel to France.
Customs checks upon entry into France
There are limits on the volume and value amounts for certain goods that you can bring into France as a traveler. You should check the French Directorate General of Customs and Excise website to confirm the latest allowances per traveler.
