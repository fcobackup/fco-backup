There are still commercial options to return to the UK from Saudi Arabia.
If you live in the UK and are currently visiting Saudi Arabia, you’re strongly advised to return now by commercial means. Don’t risk getting stranded.
Flights and getting to the airport
There is no longer any need to register your details with the Embassy for flights to the UK. Saudia is now advertising UK flights on its website. These can be booked online at www.saudia.com. Remember to select ‘One Way’.
If you need to travel to the airport during curfew hours, show your boarding pass or booking confirmation at checkpoints. Iqama holders can also request permission via the Tawakkalna app, though this is not essential.
If you are a British national or resident located in Makkah and cannot secure permissions via the app, you can request an Embassy letter to support your transport to Jeddah airport by emailing KSA.Info@fco.gov.uk.
You will need to pay for your return travel to the UK. If departure options are available but you cannot afford the travel costs and have exhausted all other options for getting funds, you may be eligible to apply for an emergency loan from the British Government. This should be a last resort option and you would need to repay the loan when you are back in the UK. Contact the British Embassy Riyadh for information on how to apply.
Future travel options
We are working hard to ensure that there are more opportunities to buy tickets for flights in the coming months. However, it is not possible to say when flights will depart. Depending on demand, it may not be possible for all Britons to buy tickets when they wish to travel. If you need to return to the UK, you should travel as soon as possible.
Your journey home
The National Travel Health Network and Centre (NaTHNaC) provides advice on how to stay safe as you travel by air.
If you’re returning home before 8 June, follow the guidance for when you return to the UK on steps you should take to protect yourself and others. From 8 June there will be new rules for entering the UK.
