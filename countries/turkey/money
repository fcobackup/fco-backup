The currency in Turkey is the Turkish Lira. ATMs are widely available in major cities and tourist areas. You can get local currency from banks and exchange bureaus, known as DOVIZ in Turkish.
As of 13 October 2022, Turkish banks will no longer accept the old style £20 and £50 sterling banknotes. Some exchange booths may still accept these banknotes, but there is no guarantee and you may be charged an extra commission.
