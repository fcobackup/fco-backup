Coronavirus travel health
Check the latest information on risk from COVID-19 for Afghanistan on the TravelHealthPro website.
See the TravelHealthPro website for further advice on travel abroad and reducing spread of respiratory viruses during the COVID-19 pandemic.
International travel
We understand that commercial flights are no longer operating to and from Kabul. If you are safely able to leave Afghanistan by other means, you should do so immediately.
Be aware travel disruption is highly likely and flights that become available can be postponed or cancelled at short notice. Keep checking local media and with local travel agents and airlines for the most up to date information on flight operations and to find out about any screening requirements that might affect you. You can also sign up for alerts to change on this page to get the latest information.
Entry and borders
See Entry requirements to find out what you will need to do when you arrive in Afghanistan.
Returning to the UK
When you return, you must follow the rules for entering the UK.
Be prepared for your plans to change
No travel is risk-free during COVID. Countries may further restrict travel or bring in new rules at short notice, for example due to a new COVID-19 variant. Check with your travel company or airline for any transport changes which may delay your journey home.
If you test positive for COVID-19, you may need to stay where you are until you test negative. You may also need to seek treatment there.
If you travel to Afghanistan against FCDO advice, plan ahead and make sure you:
can access money
understand what your insurance will cover
can make arrangements to extend your stay and be away for longer than planned
Travel in Afghanistan
Travel in Afghanistan is dangerous. We advise all British nationals to leave Afghanistan now. If you are still in Afghanistan against advice, including in Kabul, you should seek professional security advice and continually reassess your personal security.
There are only minor COVID-19 related restrictions on internal travel. Specific measures vary between provinces and domestic flights are operating on a limited basis.
Accommodation
Most hotels and restaurants are open and have been instructed to follow COVID-19 guidelines, including asking customers to wear masks.
Public places and services
Sports and music events, along with bars, cinemas, museums and gyms are all closed. Restaurants and some shops have opened.
Healthcare in Afghanistan
Healthcare in Afghanistan is very limited. Medical facilities, including those in Kabul, do not have the capacity or capability to effectively deal with the COVID-19 outbreak. The supply of ICU beds and ventilators is low. There are areas which have no medical facilities with ICU beds and ventilators. Make sure you have adequate travel health insurance and accessible funds to cover the cost of any medical treatment abroad, evacuation by air ambulance and repatriation.
Whilst an estimated 30 per cent of the population had been exposed to COVID-19 by June 2020, WHO warns that widespread complacency and failure to follow public health advice is creating grave risks in the community with people generally not observing physical distancing or mask-wearing protocols.
If you’re still in Afghanistan against FCDO advice and displaying symptoms of coronavirus, you should seek medical advice while self-isolating. The advice from the Afghan Ministry of Public Health is that if you’re displaying symptoms, call 166 and they will guide you on what to do next. The advisors only speak Dari (press option 1) or Pashto (option 2). You should also contact your insurance or medical assistance company.
