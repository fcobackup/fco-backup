Travel in Gibraltar
A social lockdown came into effect in Gibraltar on Tuesday 24 March 2020 to slow the spread of COVID-19. However the lockdown restrictions are now in the process of being relaxed by the Government of Gibraltar, via a 6-phased process named ‘Unlock the Rock’ which started on 2 May 2020. Full details of the plans to lift lockdown restrictions can be found in this Government of Gibraltar press release.
Public places and services
On 22 May, the regulations affecting the freedom of movement of all citizens came to an end, and people are now permitted to leave their home without restriction. However restrictions on freedom of association (gatherings) imposed by the Government of Gibraltar as part of the social lockdown remain in place. Visiting friends and relatives in their homes or public places is permitted, up to a maximum of sixteen people in one gathering, with certain specified exceptions.
The Government of Gibraltar announced on 23 October that bars and restaurants in Gibraltar have reduced opening hours. Last orders for alcoholic drinks is at 11pm, and restaurants must shut by 1am. Bars and pubs that do not have their own kitchen must stop serving drinks at 9pm and close by 10pm.
Restaurants in the popular Chatham Counterguard area close earlier – last orders are at 10pm and premises must shut by midnight. It is also unlawful for a person to loiter, frequent or remain in this specific area between the hours of 11pm and 1am on a Thursday, Friday or Saturday.
Additionally, the drinking of alcohol in unlicensed public places after 11pm is prohibited, and those who do so can be subject to a fixed penalty notice of £100.
From 28 August the Government of Gibraltar announced that it is a legal requirement to wear masks in all enclosed indoor spaces which are open to the public – this includes retail shops, takeaways and hair and beauty salons. On 25 September the Government of Gibraltar further tightened up requirements regarding the wearing of masks. You must wear a mask in bars, cafes and restaurants except when seated at a table eating or drinking, and masks must be worn in gyms except when exercising. See the Government of Gibraltar’s Press Release which includes a guidance note on the wearing of masks for more details.

Those failing to wear a mask are subject to a fixed penalty notice of £100.
