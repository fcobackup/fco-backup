The Foreign and Commonwealth Office (FCO) is advising British nationals against all non-essential international travel at this time. Existing advice for Indonesia remains in place:
The FCO advise against all travel to:
within 4 km of the Mount Agung crater in east Bali
within 7 km of the Mount Sinabung crater in Kalo Regency, North Sumatra
These are exclusion zones put in place by the local authorities due to ongoing volcanic activity. If you’re in either exclusion zone, you should leave immediately. See Mount Agung and Mount Sinabung
On 31 March 2020, the Indonesian authorities announced a series of new measures in response to the COVID-19 pandemic. Large-scale social restrictions (PSBB) in Jakarta have been extended until 22 May. Other measures include the suspension of the visa exemption scheme for visitors from the UK (and other countries) and an entry and transit ban for those who have visited the UK in the last 14 days. See Coronavirus
Following these restrictions, we strongly advise all non-resident British nationals in Indonesia who wish to leave, to make immediate arrangements to do so, whilst commercial flights routes are still available. The availability of flights may change at very short notice. See Return to the UK
Since 19 March, some staff and all dependents in the British Embassy have been withdrawn from Indonesia. Core staff remain to continue critical work, including consular assistance.

Violent protests have taken place in Manokwari, West Papua Province and in Jayapura and Wamena, Papua Province during August and September 2019.

Forest fires continue to burn in Indonesia’s forest and peatlands, mostly on Sumatra and Borneo, generating widespread haze that can affect air quality. You should monitor air quality during your visit and follow medical advice where appropriate. See Health
There are many active volcanoes in Indonesia, any of which can erupt with little or no warning. This often results in the evacuation of villages within a 3 to 7 km radius and disruption to air travel in the wider region. In the past, repeated eruptions have caused destruction and fatalities. Check media reports before travelling to areas that are prone to volcanic activity. The local alert level may change at short notice. Take extra care and follow the advice of local authorities, including respecting any exclusion zones. See Natural disasters
