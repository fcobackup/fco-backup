Cases of Coronavirus (COVID-19) have been confirmed in Togo. The Togolese authorities have introduced a number of measures to limit the spread of the virus.
Entry and borders
Land borders have been closed since 20 March and there are now no options for entering the country on flights although there are limited commercial options for departures. Those who already arrived in in Togo from countries with a significant number of coronavirus cases will self-isolate for two weeks under medical supervision, and then for a further week after testing for coronavirus. Those with confirmed cases of coronavirus are being hospitalised in CHR Lome Commune hospital.
Local measures
A state of emergency was declared on 2 April for 3 months and there is a curfew from 8 pm to 6am. An anti-pandemic special force has been put in place to police the curfew.
