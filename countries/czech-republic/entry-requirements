This page has information on travelling to the Czech Republic. Check what you must do to return to the UK.
This page reflects the UK government’s understanding of current rules for people travelling on a full ‘British Citizen’ passport from the UK, for the most common types of travel.
The authorities in the Czech Republic set and enforce entry rules.
All travellers
There are no COVID-19 entry requirements for people arriving from other countries. Travellers are not required to fill in arrival forms or provide proof of vaccination.
All UK visitors who don’t have a residence permit in the Czech Republic are required to register the address of their accommodation with the nearest Foreign Police Department, or through their hotel or other accommodation service, within the first 3 days after arrival. If you have not been registered through your hotel or accommodation service, registration must be done in person. Failure to comply could result in a fine of up to 3,000 CZK. See details of Czech Foreign Police offices.
If you’re fully vaccinated
Entry requirements for the Czech Republic are the same for all travellers, regardless of COVID-19 vaccination status.
Proof of vaccination status
You don’t need to provide proof of your vaccination status for entry to the Czech Republic.
If you’re not fully vaccinated
Entry requirements for the Czech Republic are the same for all travellers, regardless of COVID-19 vaccination status.
If you’ve had COVID-19 in the past year
Entry requirements for the Czech Republic are the same for all travellers, regardless of whether you have tested positive for COVID-19 in the past year.
Children and young people
There are no specific requirements for children and young people.
If you’re transiting through the Czech Republic
Transiting is when you pass through one country on the way to your destination.
Check with your airline before departing.
If you are transiting through the Czech Republic on your way to another country and staying in the airport (airside) you need to ensure that you comply with the entry requirements of your country of destination.
If you are transiting through the Czech Republic on your way to another country and will be passing through immigration (sometimes known as a layover), for example to stay in a hotel for a flight the next day, you need to ensure you have three months validity on your passport.
Further information about transiting through the Czech Republic can be found on the Brexit info website.
Exemptions
There are no exemptions to the Czech Republic’s entry requirements.
Check your passport and travel documents before you travel
Check with your travel provider to make sure your passport and other travel documents meet their requirements.
Passport validity
If you are planning to travel to an EU country (except Ireland), or Switzerland, Norway, Iceland, Liechtenstein, Andorra, Monaco, San Marino or Vatican City, you must follow the Schengen area passport requirements.
Your passport must be:
Issued less than 10 years before the date you enter the country (check the ‘date of issue’)
valid for at least 3 months after the day you plan to leave (check the ‘expiry date’)
You must check your passport meets these requirements before you travel. If your passport was issued before 1 October 2018, extra months may have been added to its expiry date.
Contact the embassy of the country you are visiting if you think that your passport does not meet both these requirements. Renew your passport if you need to.
Visas
You can travel to countries in the Schengen area for up to 90 days in any 180-day period without a visa. This applies if you travel as a tourist, to visit family or friends, to attend business meetings, cultural or sports events, or for short-term studies or training.
If you are travelling to the Czech Republic and other Schengen countries without a visa, make sure your whole visit is within the 90-day limit. Visits to Schengen countries within the previous 180 days before you travel count towards your 90 days.
To stay longer, to work or study, for business or for other reasons, you will need to meet the Czech government’s entry requirements. Check with the Embassy of the Czech Republic what type of visa and/or work permit you may need.
If you are travelling to the Czech Republic for work, read the guidance on visas and permits.
If you stay in Czech Republic with a residence permit or long-stay visa, this does not count towards your 90-day visa-free limit.
Passport stamping
Check your passport is stamped if you enter or exit the Schengen area through the Czech Republic as a visitor. Border guards will use passport stamps to check you’re complying with the 90-day visa-free limit for short stays in the Schengen area. If relevant entry or exit stamps are not in your passport, border guards will presume that you have overstayed your visa-free limit.
You can show evidence of when and where you entered or exited the Schengen area, and ask the border guards to add this date and location in your passport. Examples of acceptable evidence include boarding passes and tickets.
You may also need to:
show a return or onward ticket
show you have enough money for your stay
If you are resident in the Czech Republic, read our Living in the Czech Republic guide for passport stamping information.
UK Emergency Travel Documents
UK Emergency Travel Documents (ETDs) are accepted for entry, airside transit and exit from the Czech Republic.
Returning to the UK
There are no special requirements for leaving the Czech Republic.
