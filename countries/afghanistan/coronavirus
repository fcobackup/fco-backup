Travel in Afghanistan
Travel in Afghanistan is dangerous and if you’re travelling, including in Kabul, you should seek professional security advice and continually reassess your personal security.
There are only minor COVID-19 related restrictions on internal travel. Specific measures vary between provinces and domestic flights are operating on a limited basis.
Accommodation
Most hotels and restaurants are open and have been instructed to follow COVID-19 guidelines, including asking customers to wear masks.
Public places and services
Sports and music events, along with bars, cinemas, museums and gyms are all closed. Restaurants and some shops have opened.
Healthcare in Afghanistan
Healthcare in Afghanistan is very limited. Medical facilities, including those in Kabul, do not have the capacity or capability to effectively deal with the outbreak. The supply of ICU beds and ventilators is low. The FCO advise against all travel to the those areas which have medical facilities with ICU beds and ventilators.
National testing capacity is at 2,000 per day. However, the actual number of tests carried out is often lower. The extent of the outbreak is difficult to accurately estimate and likely much larger than figures suggest.
If you are in Afghanistan and displaying symptoms of coronavirus, you should seek medical advice while self-isolating. The advice from the Afghan Ministry of Public Health is that if you are displaying symptoms, call 166 and they will guide you on what to do next. Please note the advisors only speak Dari (press option 1) or Pashto (option 2). You should also contact your insurance or medical assistance company.
