Be prepared for your plans to change
No travel is risk-free during COVID-19. Countries may further restrict travel or bring in new rules at short notice, for example due to a new COVID-19 variant. Check with your travel company or airline for any transport changes which may delay your journey home.
If you test positive for COVID-19, you may need to stay where you are until you test negative. You may also need to seek treatment there.
Plan ahead and make sure you:
can access money
understand what your insurance will cover
can make arrangements to extend your stay and be away for longer than planned

Healthcare in Cyprus
See the Cypriot Ministry of Health website for information on coronavirus from the Cypriot authorities. If you develop fever and/or respiratory symptoms such as shortness of breath or cough, the Cyprus Government advise that you stay indoors and immediately contact the Ministry of Health’s public health line on 1420 from a Cypriot line.
What to do if you test positive for coronavirus
If you are unable to self-isolate in your current accommodation, the Cypriot authorities will ask you to move to a quarantine hotel. The cost of quarantine hotel accommodation in this situation is covered by the Cypriot government. You can also opt to isolate in private accommodation at your own expense.
Revised guidelines for confirmed COVID-19 cases can be found on the Cyprus PIO website.
If you are identified as a close contact of someone who has tested positive for coronavirus, you are advised to take a test on days 3 and 5 from your contact with a positive case.
Further guidance, including for people who have been in close contact with someone who has tested positive for coronavirus, is available at the  Public Information Office website.

Quarantine hotels in the north
In the north of Cyprus authority-designated accommodation is at your own expense. You can also use the Güvende Kal application to request an electronic bracelet for quarantining at home. The UK government will not cover mandatory quarantine costs for British nationals. See Demonstrating your COVID-19 status
EHIC or GHIC cards cannot be used to cover any additional expenses you incur whilst staying in a quarantine hotel. Make sure you have access to funds to cover the costs or take out insurance, checking the policy has adequate cover.
If you have or are entitled to an EHIC or GHIC and you need medical treatment while staying at a quarantine hotel, the UK government will fund treatment as usual through the EHIC/GHIC scheme.
