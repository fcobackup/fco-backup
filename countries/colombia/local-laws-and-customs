Read what you can and cannot do

Carry a colour photocopy of the data page and Colombian visa from your passport at all times for identification.
Homosexuality is legal but not widely accepted, especially in rural areas. See our information and advice page for the LGBT community before you travel.
Photographing of military or strategic government sites is not allowed.
It is a serious criminal offence to have sex with a minor.
Drugs
Don’t get involved with illegal drugs of any kind. Colombian drug trafficking detection methods are sophisticated and anyone attempting to traffic drugs should expect to be arrested. Conviction leads to severe penalties. British nationals have been arrested and detained for trying to smuggle cocaine out of the country. Prison conditions are harsh. Pack your own luggage and keep it with you at all times. Don’t carry items for other people.
Spiritual cleansing
Ayahuasca, or yage, is a traditional plant used in ‘spiritual cleansing’ ceremonies by indigenous communities in Colombia, primarily in Putamayo and the Amazon region. The yage ceremony typically involves the consumption of a brew containing dimethyltryptamine (DMT), an hallucinogenic drug. Consumption of this brew is not regulated and its interaction with existing medical conditions is not well understood. People have suffered serious illnesses and in some cases death after participating in these ceremonies.
Spiritual cleansing or yage retreats are usually some distance from populated areas making it difficult to access medical attention for those who need it.
