Restrictions in response to coronavirus
Restrictions on entry
There are currently restrictions in place on entering the Czech Republic.
If you are travelling from the UK and do not have Czech Residency, you are only allowed to enter the Czech Republic for limited, specific purposes set out by the Czech Ministry of Interior. These purposes for travel include visiting family members, studying at University, or business. ~They do not include tourism from the UK. If you do not have Czech residency, you will not be allowed to enter the Czech Republic unless you can prove your visit is for one of the purposes set out by the Ministry of the Interior. If you travel to the Czech Republic without proof that your visit is for one of those purposes, you will not be allowed to leave the airport and will have to return to the UK on the next available flight.
Information on the purposes for which travel from the UK is allowed, along with information on the documents you will need to present and the restrictions you will need to follow, are available on the website of the Czech Ministry of the Interior.
If you have Czech residency, or you are entering the Czech Republic for one of the approved purposes in the list above, you will still need to comply with the Czech government’s Covid19 control measures. There are three options:
Option 1: Present a negative coronavirus test result on arrival. The test must be no more than four days old and the results should be recorded on the Medical Certificate available on the Ministry of Interior’s website (see above). You will still need to restrict your movement in the Czech Republic to essential journeys for the first 14 days, but will not need to fully self-isolate.
Option 2: Present a negative test result within 72 hours of arrival. If you enter the Czech Republic without a negative test result, you can choose to take a test within 72 hours of arrival in order to avoid self-isolation requirements. You must register by phone with the public health authority “Hygiene station” (Hygienická stanice) of the region where you will be staying to arrange the test. You can find contacts for Hygiene Stations here.
You must self-isolate until you receive your test results. If the test is negative, you may then leave your accommodation. But, as with option 1, you must restrict your movement within the Czech Republic to essential travel only. A list of testing sites is available here.
Option 3: Self-isolate for 14 days If you do not take a test, you must still register on arrival by phone with the public health authority “Hygiene station” (Hygienická stanice) of the region where you will be staying, and then self-isolate at a given address for 14 days. You can find contacts for Hygiene Stations here.
For all the above options, there are no restrictions on travelling to your place of residence from the airport or border. You are allowed to use public transport or a taxi. However, you must follow social distancing rules.
If you have Czech residency and have been away from the Czech Republic for 90 days or less, you are not required to present a test or self-isolate.
Transit through the Czech Republic from a third country
UK nationals resident in other countries can transit from a third country through the Czech Republic without Czech residency if they have a letter of confirmation from the British Embassy and can demonstrate their purpose is to travel straight back to the UK. Alongside an official letter from the Embassy, those intending to transit the Czech Republic must provide evidence of onward travel and meet the requirements set out below.
If you would like to transit through the Czech Republic from another country in order to return to the UK, contact the British Embassy in Prague on +420 257 40 2111 (choosing option 1 for English, then option 4 for consular assistance) at least 24 hours before making your journey, to request a letter of confirmation to allow you to transit the Czech Republic. You will need to provide:
full name, date of birth, and passport/ID number for each individual making the journey
intended route, including date, time (approximate) and location of entry to, and exit from, the Czech Republic
number plate of any vehicle to be used to cross the border
flight details for those seeking a flight connection, or intended route for those seeking to drive across the Czech Republic
Up to date guidance, including the certificate template with which to present your test results at the border (if required), can be found on the Czech Ministry of Interior’s website.
