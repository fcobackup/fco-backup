Hajj 2022 has now ended. Hajj 2023 will begin on 26 June 2023. In 2022, British nationals wishing to perform Hajj had to apply directly to the Saudi authorities.
If you remain in country following Hajj 2022, check visa expiry dates to avoid overstay visa penalties. If you overstay, you may incur large fines and/or be detained or banned from returning to Saudi Arabia in the future.
Pilgrims will be able to perform Umrah from 3 August 2022. British Nationals can perform Umrah on a Saudi tourist e-Visa. You can also apply to perform Umrah through the official Ministry of Hajj app ‘Eatmarna’ and also ‘Tawakkalna’. You can download Eatmarna using these links for Android users and Apple users. For more information, visit the Ministry of Hajj page or Twitter @mohu_en.
If you want to perform Umrah or Hajj, please continue to follow announcements from the Saudi Ministry of Hajj and Umrah (@MoHU_EN) and FCDO official social media channels @ukinsaudiarabia on Twitter or on Facebook.
If you are visiting from abroad, as a ‘vaccinated visitor’ (except if you are in exempted categories), before travelling you must complete a Registration Immunisation Information Form on the Muqeem website.
Before you travel for pilgrimage, carefully consider the information and advice on the website of the Saudi Arabia Embassy in London, and in the National Travel Health Network and Centre’s (NaTHNaC) factsheet.
