International travel
Direct flights between the UK and mainland China have resumed. Check with airlines for routes, schedules and ticketing.
From 5 January 2023, if you travel (or return) from mainland China to England you must take a pre-departure COVID-19 test. Read the COVID-19 guidance on entering the UK from mainland China for information on what is required.
Entry and borders
See Entry requirements to find out what you will need to do when you arrive in China.
You should check local testing facilities information on the National Health Commission website.
Be prepared for your plans to change
No travel is risk-free during COVID-19. Countries may further restrict travel or bring in new rules at short notice, for example due to a new COVID-19 variant. Check with your travel company or airline for any transport changes that may delay your journey home.
If you test positive for COVID-19, current Chinese government advice is that you should remain at home if you’re asymptomatic or have mild symptoms. Those suffering more severe symptoms should seek medical assistance.
Plan ahead and make sure you:
can access money
understand what your insurance will cover
can make arrangements to extend your stay and be away for longer than planned
Travel in China
Mandatory requirements to check temperatures and use health kit apps or scan QR codes to prove travel history have been lifted in most areas, but COVID-19 test results are still required for access to nursing homes, medical institutions, childcare facilities and schools.
Restrictions on movement and quarantine arrangements for travel between different parts of the country have been removed, although there are reports of travel still being restricted. You should check latest developments with local authorities ahead of domestic travel, including on PCR testing requirements.
If you’re planning to leave China in the near future you should regularly check with your airline for updates.
Healthcare in China
China is currently experiencing a large number of COVID-19 cases; medical facilities in some parts of the country, including Beijing, are operating at or near full capacity. Access to treatment, including intensive care, may be delayed or limited. You should ensure you have a supply of medication for COVID-19 or flu-like symptoms in case of infection. A negative COVID-19 PCR test may be required for entry to some medical facilities, but the Chinese government has stated it will not refuse medical care to those who do not have this test result.
