Cases of coronavirus (COVID-19) have been confirmed in Norway. The Norwegian authorities have introduced a number of measures to limit the spread of the virus.
Entry
Norwegian borders have been partially closed since Monday 16 March. Non-residents are not allowed to enter the country. The website of the Norwegian Ministry of Foreign Affairs has details of the very limited number of exemptions to these restrictions. Non-residents are still able to transit via Norwegian airports as long as the final destination is not within Norway, but please check with your airline before departing.
All British nationals legally resident in Norway will be allowed to enter the country, but are required to enter self-quarantine for 14 days. Exemptions for workers crossing the Swedish and Finnish borders will apply; please see the Ministry of Foreign Affairs website for the details. Those with symptoms will be isolated. Rules on how long you need to remain in quarantine have been clarified to allow those not showing symptoms to leave the country without needing to complete the full 14 days. We recommend that you travel with evidence of residency. If in doubt, please contact the Norwegian Embassy in London.
Local measures
From Thursday 12 March day care centres, schools, universities, and other educational institutions (e.g. libraries) will be closed until 26 March. There are also restrictions on all public events and large parts of the hospitality and service sectors, including those that involve close personal contact e.g. hairdressers and beauty salons. Pubs and nightclubs are required to close. Establishments serving food are allowed to open but social distancing restrictions apply. These restrictions will remain in place until at least 13 April.
The Norwegian authorities have issued recommendations that people avoid using public transport unless strictly necessary.
The Chief Medical Officer advises British nationals aged 70 and over and those with pre-existing health condition against cruise ship travel at this time. A number of Norwegian ports are restricting passenger embarkation and disembarkation. The situation can change rapidly so check with your cruise provider before travelling.
The Norwegian Institute of Public Health (Folkehelseinstituttet) website has a dedicated English language page on the coronavirus providing updates and guidance. There are also two coronavirus hotlines (open Monday-Friday, 08.30-15.30) on +47 815 55 015 for general enquiries and +47 116 117 if you believe you have been infected.
