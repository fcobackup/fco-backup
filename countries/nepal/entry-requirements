This advice reflects the UK government’s understanding of current rules for people travelling on a full ‘British citizen’ passport from the UK, for the most common types of travel.
The authorities in Nepal set and enforce entry rules. If you’re not sure how these requirements apply to you, contact the Embassy of Nepal in the UK.
COVID-19 rules
There are no COVID-19 testing or vaccination requirements for travellers entering Nepal.
Passport validity requirements
To avoid problems at immigration, make sure your passport has an ‘expiry date’ at least 6 months after your date of entry into Nepal.
Check with your travel provider that your passport and other travel documents meet requirements. Renew your passport if you need to.
You will be denied entry if you do not have a valid travel document or try to use a passport that has been reported lost or stolen.
Checks at border control
At border control, you may need to show:
a travel insurance document which has cover for healthcare costs including repatriation and other emergencies while you are in Nepal
confirmation of where you will spend your first night, for example, a hotel booking
Visa requirements
You can get a Nepal visa online up to 15 days in advance of your arrival. You can also queue up to get a tourist visa on arrival, but payment must be made in cash, with US dollars being the preferred currency. Applying in advance can reduce the time it takes you to pass through immigration. Visas are available for several lengths of stay at various costs. Look on the immigration department website for the options and how to apply.
Overstaying your visa in Nepal is a serious crime, and can lead to significant fines or imprisonment.
Vaccination requirements
At least 8 weeks before your trip, check the vaccinations and certificates you need in TravelHealthPro’s Nepal guide.
If you are arriving in Nepal directly from certain countries in Africa and Latin America, you will need to show a yellow fever certificate to enter Nepal.
Customs rules
There are strict rules about goods you can take into or out of Nepal. You must declare anything that may be prohibited or subject to tax or duty.
Bringing precious metals into Nepal is strictly regulated. You can carry gold ornaments up to 50 grams and silver ornaments up to 100 grams. If you bring in undeclared gold or silver, you may:
get a fine equivalent to the value of the goods
go to prison for between one month and 5 years depending upon the value of the goods
have the goods confiscated
be detained during the proceedings
Taking money into Nepal
When you arrive in Nepal, declare on your customs declaration any amount above the value of 5,000 US dollars in banknotes or 10,000 dollars in notes and travellers cheques combined. Customs will give a certified declaration which you must keep. You will need to convert all your Nepali currency before you leave Nepal, and the bank or exchange counter at the airport may ask you for the declaration.
ATMs are not reliable outside main tourist sites.
