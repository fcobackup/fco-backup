The information on this page covers the most common types of travel and reflects the UK government’s understanding of the rules currently in place. Unless otherwise stated, this information is for travellers using a full ‘British Citizen’ passport.
The authorities in the country or territory you’re travelling to are responsible for setting and enforcing the rules for entry. If you’re unclear about any aspect of the entry requirements, or you need further reassurance, you’ll need to contact the embassy, high commission or consulate of the country or territory you’re travelling to.
You should also consider checking with your transport provider or travel company to make sure your passport and other travel documents meet their requirements.
Entry rules in response to coronavirus (COVID-19)
Entry to Sri Lanka
Commercial airlines are operating outbound flights from Sri Lanka. Some inbound flights are operating for repatriations of Sri Lankan nationals. Entry to Sri Lanka is currently prohibited for all non-nationals and residents.
Non-national residents wishing to return to Sri Lanka should contact their nearest Sri Lankan High Commission for advice.
Cruise ship passengers will not be allowed to disembark in the country, including for temporary shore visits.
Transiting Sri Lanka
Transit via Sri Lanka is permitted, as long as the connecting flight is within 10 hours of arrival. Travellers should check with their airline on the transit times. There are limited airside refreshment facilities available due to COVID-19 restrictions.
Quarantine requirements
14 day quarantine is mandatory for all those travelling into Sri Lanka, followed by 14 days self-isolation at home. Those entering must undergo temperature checks at the airport. All entrants must now take a PCR test.
Visas
No new visas will be issued to British nationals currently outside Sri Lanka, and any British nationals arriving in Sri Lanka will be subject to mandatory 14-day quarantine period.
The visa on arrival service has been suspended as part of the government’s response to the coronavirus outbreak.
If you are already in Sri Lanka, the government has announced that the validity period of all types of visas has been extended to 11 July. If your visa has run out or will run out before 11 July you can make an appointment to apply for an extension through a new online service.
Alternatively you can pay the relevant fee and complete the paperwork at the airport on departure. You should ring the Department for Immigration and Emigration on +94 70 710 1050 if you have further questions.
Regular entry requirements
Passport validity
Your passport should be valid for a minimum period of 6 months from the date of entry to Sri Lanka.
UK Emergency Travel Documents
UK Emergency Travel Documents are accepted for entry, airside transit and exit from Sri Lanka.
