Before you travel, check the ‘Entry requirements’ section for Kyrgyzstan’s current entry restrictions and requirements. These may change with little warning. Monitor this advice for the latest updates and stay in contact with your travel provider.
If you plan to pass through another country to return to the UK, check the travel advice for the country you’re transiting.
It is more important than ever to get travel insurance and check it provides sufficient cover. See the FCDO guidance on foreign travel insurance.
Terrorist attacks in Kyrgyzstan cannot be ruled out. You should be vigilant in public places and follow security advice from the local authorities. See Terrorism.
Take care if you travel to the Oblasts (Provinces) of Osh, Batken and Jalal-Abad. See Local travel
Skirmishes can occur along the disputed Kyrgyz-Tajik border. Previous incidents have involved both civilians and border guards and several have involved firearms. There are also occasional security incidents on the Kyrgyz/Uzbek and Kyrgyz/Kazakh borders. There’s a risk of further localised violence and border closures at any time. You should remain vigilant in border areas and check local media reports before you travel. See Local travel
There is a high risk of earthquakes. See Natural disasters
You must carry your passport, or a notarised copy of it, at all times. See Local laws and customs
Dual nationality isn’t recognised in Kyrgyzstan. If you enter Kyrgyzstan on a Kyrgyz passport and also hold British nationality, the British Embassy can only provide very limited consular assistance. In cases of arrest or detention, consular access is unlikely to be granted.
If you’re abroad and you need emergency help from the UK government, contact the nearest British embassy, consulate or high commission.
