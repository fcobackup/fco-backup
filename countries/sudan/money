Cash withdrawals against non-Sudanese credit and debit cards at banks or from the majority of ATMs are not possible. There are also extremely limited options for using foreign credit or debit cards; most businesses do not offer this facility. You should therefore assume that, while possible, credit or debit card transactions may prove challenging and you should make sure you have enough cash in hard currency with you. Cash should be in US dollars dated 2006 onwards (older ones will not be exchanged). Pounds sterling are rarely exchanged. You should only change money through banks or official bureaux de exchange (eg in hotels). Donâ€™t change any money on the street.
