International travel
Commercial flights are now operating to and from Ukraine on a limited number of routes. Check with your travel company for the latest information.
Travel in Ukraine
International and domestic flights have now resumed, although some carriers are operating a reduced schedule. Public transport in cities and bus and train travel between regions have also resumed on a reduced scale.
Coronavirus measures have been extended until 31 August. When in public places, including when travelling on public transport and in taxis, you must maintain a minimum distance of 1.5 m, wear protective masks and gloves. The number of passengers per vehicle is limited to the number of seats, with the exception of metro carriages.
Failure to comply with restrictions may result in a fine or, in more serious cases, a prison sentence. Before taking public transport, you should consider whether you will be able to maintain social distancing.
Accommodation
Accommodation, including hotels and private rentals, is open to the public. When staying in a hotel, you must adhere to the same rules as for being in public place. This includes:
Wearing a protective mask in all public areas
Maintaining a minimum distance of 1.5m.
If possible, check in online in advance to avoid check-in queues at the hotel.
Further information can be found at Visit Ukraine.
Public places and services
Shops, restaurants, cafes, religious establishments, beauty salons and hairdressers, museums, libraries, hardware stores, cobblers, dentists, auditors, lawyers and notaries are now allowed to operate (providing appropriate measures are in place). The number of visitors to shopping centres, restaurants and sport facilities is limited to 1 person per 10 sq. m. Parks and recreation areas have reopened, with groups of up to eight people allowed to gather there.
When in public places, including when travelling on public transport and in taxis, you must maintain a minimum distance of 1.5 m and wear protective masks and gloves. A maximum of four customers are allowed at a table in restaurants, cafes and bars (excluding children under 14 years old).
Other restrictions are being eased in some regions, depending on the number of cases of coronavirus present and other criteria set out by the Ministry of Health. This includes the resumption of operation of gyms, fitness centres and swimming pools in most regions. The Government and local authorities have indicated that they may enact local lockdowns depending on the number of cases in differing regions.
Visas
The State Migration Service has published advice that there will be no penalties for foreigners who were staying in Ukraine legally when restrictions on leaving the country were introduced and who have not been able to leave, to apply to extend the period of their stay and/or to exchange their resident permits. This measure is limited to the period for which travel restrictions are in force.
Where the restrictions on travel and availability of government services mean that foreigners stay in Ukraine beyond the period permitted by their visa-free limit or visa validity, or that they are unable to extend residence permits, there will be no penalties imposed.
Healthcare in Ukraine

If you have COVID-19 symptoms, such as a dry cough, respiratory difficulties, and a high temperature, you should:
if you have insurance or a private medical provider in Ukraine, seek assistance from them in the first instance
if you do not have insurance or your symptoms are more severe, call an ambulance on 103. Please note that the ambulance service may not have English-speaking operators available. In this case, please enlist the help of a Ukrainian or Russian-speaking friend, family member, hotel worker etc to help you call the ambulance
In both cases, you are likely to be advised to self-isolate, or be taken to a hospital where you will be tested for coronavirus. In case of a positive diagnosis, please inform the British Embassy Kyiv by calling +380 44 490 3660 or by completing this web contact form, or ask a friend or relative to contact us on your behalf.
If taken to hospital, you are likely to be tested for coronavirus. The choice of hospital will depend on your location and the availability of hospitals and/or beds.
If you come into contact with someone who is confirmed to have COVID-19, or has COVID-19 symptoms, you must self-isolate for 14 days. Contact your insurer or private medical provider, or call an ambulance on 103, should you develop symptoms yourself. Failure to comply with these restrictions may result in a fine or, in more serious cases, a prison sentence.
