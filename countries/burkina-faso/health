Warning
FCDO advises against all travel to parts of Burkina Faso.

Before you travel check that:
your destination can provide the healthcare you may need
you have appropriate travel insurance for local treatment or unexpected medical evacuation
This is particularly important if you have a health condition or are pregnant.
Emergency medical number
Call 18 from Ouagadougou and ask for an ambulance.
Outside Ouagadougou, call the universal emergency number 112.
If you get no response, you will need to get local advice about the closest hospital and how to get to it.
Contact your insurance company quickly if you’re referred to a medical facility for treatment.
Health risks and recommended vaccines
Check TravelHealthPro’s current advice on Burkina Faso to find out how to reduce the health risks you’ll face there, inclulding:
yellow fever
Zika virus
dengue and malaria
TravelHealthPro also lists the recommended vaccines that could apply to you. At least 8 weeks before you travel, check how to get vaccines and whether you have to pay on the NHS travel vaccinations page.
Medication
The legal status and regulation of some medicines prescribed or bought in the UK can be different in other countries.
Read best practice when travelling with medicines on TravelHealthPro.
The NHS has information on whether you can take your medicine abroad.
Healthcare facilities in Burkina Faso
Medical facilities in Burkina Faso are very limited. For serious medical treatment, evacuation to Europe is necessary. Make sure you have adequate travel health insurance and accessible funds to cover the cost of any medical treatment abroad and medical evacuation.
