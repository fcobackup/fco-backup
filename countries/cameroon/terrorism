Terrorists are very likely to try to carry out attacks in Cameroon including kidnapping, particularly in the Far North region and the eastern border with CAR. Attacks could be indiscriminate, including in places visited by foreigners.
Following the terrorist attacks at the Radisson Hotel in Bamako, Mali, and the Splendid Hotel in Ouagadougou, Burkina Faso, both of which led to sieges in which a number of hotel guests were killed, it’s possible that terrorist groups including Boko Haram and Ansaru will try to carry out similar attacks on hotels or public venues in Cameroon including the capital Yaoundé. In 2016 and 2017, there have been numerous suicide attacks which have resulted in over 200 dead in the Far North region.
Islamist extremists (Boko Haram) are present in northern Cameroon, particularly in areas where the FCO advise against all travel. A number of western nationals have been kidnapped by Islamist extremists in 2014 and 2015. All were in the area to which the FCO advise against all travel.
Boko Haram has publicly threatened Cameroon with attacks and further kidnappings due to Cameroon’s involvement in the regional fight to counter Boko Haram. There’s a heightened threat of kidnap to western nationals in the north of Cameroon, including in the major cities and along the border between the Far North region and Nigeria.
The long-standing policy of the British government is not to make substantive concessions to hostage-takers. The British government considers that paying ransoms and releasing prisoners increases the risk of further hostage-taking.
There’s a heightened threat of terrorist attack globally against UK interests and British nationals from groups or individuals motivated by the conflict in Iraq and Syria. You should be vigilant at this time.
