Flights
Korean Air continue to operate direct flights from Korea to the UK twice a week on Wednesday and Saturday.
British Airways will suspend its direct service from 12 April. If you have flights booked with British Airways after this date, contact British Airways urgently to make alternative arrangements to return home.
Indirect flights to the UK transiting via a third country are also available. Flights between South Korea and a number of countries have been reduced, and some countries have altered their entry requirements for travellers who started their journey in, or transited through, South Korea. Before flying, you should check with your airline, travel agency or the relevant websites for your destination for the latest information.
You will need to pay for your return travel to the UK. If departure options are available but you cannot afford the travel costs and have exhausted all other options for getting funds, you may be eligible to apply for an emergency loan from the government. This is a last resort option and you would need to repay the loan when you are back in the UK. For more information, you should contact Corporate Travel Management (CTM). CTM are a commercial partner of the FCO and are authorised to administer such loans on behalf of the FCO.
Travelling to the airport
Buses, trains, taxis or domestic flights are available in Korea for inter-city travel and to reach the airport.
Transiting in South Korea
Transit passengers will receive a temperature check on arrival in Korea. Symptomatic individuals will be subject to a COVID-19 test and hospitalisation if found positive. Passengers who do not show symptoms and/or test negative may continue their journey. Transit Hotels are available in both Terminals 1 and 2 at Incheon Airport.
