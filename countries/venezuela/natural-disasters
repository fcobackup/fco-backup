The hurricane season runs from around 1 June to 30 November, and can affect parts of northern Venezuela. Keep an eye on weather reports on local TV and radio. You can also monitor weather updates on-line from the World Meteorological Organisation and the US National Hurricane Centre and follow the advice of the local authorities. See our tropical cylones page for advice about what to do if you’re caught up in a storm.
During the rainy season from May to November there may be flooding in low-lying areas (eg the Llanos) and in some valleys in the Andes (Merida State). There may be disruption to transport, services and infrastructure.
Venezuela is vulnerable to earthquakes. Monitor media reports and follow the advice of the local authorities. To learn more about what to do before, during and after an earthquake, see the website of the US Federal Emergency Management Agency.
