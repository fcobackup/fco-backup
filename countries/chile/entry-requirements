Regular entry requirements
Visas
If you are a British passport holder visiting Chile for less than 90 days, you do not need a visa. If you wish to stay longer, you should consult the nearest Chilean Embassy. 
On arrival in Chile the immigration authorities will issue you with a ‘Tarjeta de Turismo - Tourist Card’, an A5 sized white form. You must retain this document and present it to immigration when you leave. If you lose it, you should request a copy of the Tourist card on the PDI website, at the nearest PDI office or the one at Santiago airport.
Once in Chile, if you decide to stay for 90 days or more, you can apply for an extension choosing the “Prorroga de Turismo’ option on the Chilean Immigration Department (Extranjeria) website. You can also visit the ‘Extranjeria’ office located in San Antonio 580, Santiago. Telephone: 600 626 4222.
