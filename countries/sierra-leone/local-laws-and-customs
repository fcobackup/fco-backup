Don’t become involved with drugs of any kind.
All precious stones require an export licence. Check the quality of any gems and/or minerals you buy. Any deals that appear too good to be true probably are.
If you commit any criminal offences, including drug trafficking and diamond smuggling you can expect to be subjected to local law. There are heavy penalties and local prison conditions are harsh.
Homosexual acts are illegal in Sierra Leone. See our information and advice page for the LGBT community before you travel.
You should carry ID (passport or residence permit) at all times.
Adoption orders from Sierra Leone are not recognised in the UK. The Government of Sierra Leone, together with UNICEF, are tackling issues related to the trafficking of children.

The government office responsible for adoptions in Sierra Leone is the Ministry of Social Welfare, Gender and Children’s Affairs (Telephone: +232 76 624 597).
