The information on this page covers the most common types of travel and reflects the UK government’s understanding of the rules currently in place. Unless otherwise stated, this information is for travellers using a full ‘British Citizen’ passport.
The authorities in the country or territory you’re travelling to are responsible for setting and enforcing the rules for entry. If you’re unclear about any aspect of the entry requirements, or you need further reassurance, you’ll need to contact the embassy, high commission or consulate of the country or territory you’re travelling to.
You should also consider checking with your transport provider or travel company to make sure your passport and other travel documents meet their requirements.
Entry rules in response to coronavirus
Entry to mainland Portugal
The Portuguese Government has announced that from 1 January 2021, travel by UK nationals to Portugal, including Madeira, Porto Santo and the Azores, will not be permitted, except for essential purposes, such as to enable you to reunite with your family, or for professional, educational, health or humanitarian reasons. You should expect to be required to provide evidence to support your reason for travel to your airline and on arrival in Portugal.
This restriction does not apply to UK nationals who are legally resident in Portugal or any other EU member state. You will be allowed to enter Portugal, but you will have to show proof of residence.
Direct air travel to Portugal is permitted for any purpose from EU member states, Liechtenstein, Norway, Iceland and Switzerland as well as from Australia, Japan, New Zealand, Rwanda, Singapore, South Korea, Uruguay and Thailand. China, Hong Kong and Macao are subject to reciprocity.
Where there are no direct flights from the above countries to Portugal, you may still be allowed entry provided you have remained airside while in transit through other countries.
You need to complete an online passenger locator card before you arrive in Portugal.
Screening on arrival
All passengers travelling to Portugal from the UK must have a negative COVID-19 test taken within 72 hours of departure. Airlines are likely to deny boarding if you cannot provide this at check-in. Check the requirements with your airline in advance of travelling.
Children under the age of 2 and passengers who are in direct transit through Portugal from the UK do not require a COVID-19 test for Portugal. Check the entry requirements for your final destination.
If you are a Portuguese national, a diplomat travelling for professional reasons or you are resident in Portugal and your airline has permitted you to travel without proof of a COVID-19 test, you will need to take the test on arrival at the airport or independently within 48 hours. You will need to pay for the test and self-isolate until you receive a negative test result. You can be prosecuted if you do not comply with these requirements.
If you are travelling to Portugal from an EU member state, Liechtenstein, Norway, Iceland or Switzerland, or from Australia, China, Hong Kong, Japan, Macau, New Zealand, Rwanda, Singapore, South Korea, Uruguay or Thailand, you will be subject to health screening on arrival at mainland airports and ports. Your temperature will be checked and if it is 38ºc or over or you show signs of being unwell, you will be referred to the health authorities at the airport. You may be required to take a COVID-19 test and to self-isolate at your accommodation until you receive a negative test result.
You should not use the NHS testing service to get a test in order to facilitate your travel to another country. You should arrange to take a private test. Make sure you have a COVID-19 RT PCR nasal swab test. Check your test result identifies the type of test taken and gives your name, date of birth, the date and time the sample was collected and the date of the result.
Entry to Madeira and Porto Santo
Before you arrive in Madeira and Porto Santo:
complete and submit a traveller questionnaire 12 to 48 hours before departure.
take a COVID-19 test 72 hours before you travel and upload your test result. See the paragraph above on the type of test required
You will be required to take an additional PCR test 5 to 7 days after your initial test, irrespective of the result. From the day you arrive, until you receive the results of this additional test, you must remain in isolation at home or at your accommodation
In the unlikely event that your airline has allowed you to travel without a COVID test, you will have to take a test on arrival at the airport and remain in government provided accommodation until the results are known. This will take about 12 hours. You will then be allowed to go to your own accommodation, but you must remain in isolation until you receive the results of your second test which you will be required to take 5-7 days later.
On arrival, you will be subject to health screening. If you have not uploaded your COVID-19 test result, you will be asked to show it at the airport.
If at any stage you test positive or inconclusive, you will have to repeat the test until the result is negative and the health authorities give you a certificate allowing you to travel. You can ask the health authorities for a certificate by sending an email to UESP.MADEIRA@iasaude.madeira.gov.pt.
For further information, see the Madeira Tourist Board’s information for visitors.
Entry to the Azores
Before you arrive in the Azores:
take a COVID-19 test 72 hours before you travel and print or keep a digital copy of the result to show to the airline when you board. See the paragraph above on the type of test required.
complete a passenger questionnaire
On arrival, you will be subject to health screening. You can be prosecuted if you travel without having taken a COVID-19 test, and you will be obliged to take a test locally.
If you have not completed the passenger questionnaire online, you will be asked to fill in a form manually at the airport.
If you are staying for more than 7 days, you will have to repeat the test locally 6 days after the first test.

Inter-island travel
You should only travel between islands if your journey is essential. If you have to travel and you are travelling from São Miguel or Terceira to any of the other islands in the archipelago, you will need to
have a COVID-19 test 72 hours before you travel and show the negative result when you board, and
complete a passenger questionnaire before you depart
Ports and vessels
Cruise ships can berth at ports on mainland Portugal, but passengers can only disembark if they are Portuguese nationals or residents.
Cruise ships are allowed to dock in Madeira and Porto Santo, but passengers and crew can only embark or disembark with the consent of the health authorities. Other vessels can dock and crew and passengers can disembark subject to health screening and:
completion of a Traveller Registration form
proof of a negative COVID-19 test, carried out 72 hours prior to departure from the last port of call
If you do not have proof of having taken a test, you will need to take a test on arrival and await the results on board the vessel.
If you have been at sea for more than 14 days, you will be exempt from a COVID-19 test unless you have a temperature or you are showing signs of being unwell.
Regular entry requirements
Visas
The rules for travelling or working in European countries changed on 1 January 2021:
you can travel to countries in the Schengen area for up to 90 days in any 180-day period without a visa. This applies if you travel as a tourist, to visit family or friends, to attend business meetings, cultural or sports events, or for short-term studies or training
if you are travelling to Portugal and other Schengen countries without a visa, make sure your whole visit is within the 90-day limit. Visits to Schengen countries within the previous 180 days before you travel count towards your 90 days
to stay longer, to work or study, for business travel or for other reasons, you will need to meet the Portuguese government’s entry requirements. Check with the Portuguese Embassy what type of visa and/or work permit you may need
if you stay in Portugal with a visa or permit, this does count towards your 90-day visa-free limit
Any time you spent in Portugal or other Schengen countries before 1 January 2021 does not count towards your 90-day visa-free limit.
At Portuguese border control, you may need to use separate lanes from EU, EEA and Swiss citizens when queueing. Your passport may be stamped on entry and exit. You may also need to:
show a return or onward ticket
show you have enough money for your stay
Passport validity
Check your passport is valid for travel before you book your trip, and renew your passport if you do not have enough time left on it.
You must have at least 6 months left on an adult or child passport to travel to most countries in Europe (not including Ireland).
If you renewed your current passport before the previous one expired, extra months may have been added to its expiry date. Any extra months on your passport over 10 years may not count towards the 6 months needed.
Travelling with children
Portuguese Border Control (SEF) advise that a child under the age of 18 who is travelling to Portugal alone or without a parent or legal guardian should either:
be met at the airport or point of entry by their parent or guardian, or
carry a letter of authorisation to travel from their parent or guardian. The letter should name the adult in Portugal who will be responsible for them during their stay. There is no legal requirement for the letter to be notarised. However, the onus is on the parent or legal guardian to provide reasonable evidence, including contact details, to confirm that adequate care arrangements are in place.
Resident minors leaving Portugal
A child under the age of 18 who is resident in Portugal must carry a notarised letter of authority from their parent or guardian if they’re travelling out of the country alone or without a parent or legal guardian. The letter of authority can be issued by:
one of the child’s parents (if the parents are married)
the parent the child lives with (if the parents are separated or divorced)
one of the adoptive parents (if the child is adopted) or
the child’s legal guardian
Further information in English, together with a standard form of words (in Portuguese), are available on the Portuguese immigration service website
UK Emergency Travel Documents (ETDs)
UK ETDs are accepted for entry, airside transit and exit from Portugal.
