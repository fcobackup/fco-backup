Coronavirus travel health
See the TravelHealthPro website for further advice on travel abroad and reducing spread of respiratory viruses during the COVID-19 pandemic.
Entry and borders
See Entry requirements to find out what you will need to do when you arrive in Singapore.
Returning to the UK
When you return, you must follow the rules for entering the UK.
You are responsible for organising your own COVID-19 test, in line with UK government testing requirements. Information on local testing facilities is available.
Be prepared for your plans to change
No travel is risk-free during COVID. Countries may further restrict travel or bring in new rules at short notice, for example due to a new COVID-19 variant. Check with your travel company or airline for any transport changes which may delay your journey home.
If you test positive for COVID-19, you may need to stay where you are until you test negative. You may also need to seek treatment there.
Plan ahead and make sure you:
can access money
understand what your insurance will cover
can make arrangements to extend your stay and be away for longer than planned
Travel in Singapore
See the Singapore Government website for the latest on the COVID-19 situation and measures in place to curb its spread.
If you do not comply with these measures you could be fined, imprisoned, or both, then deported. Repeat offenders will face further fines and/or prosecution. Be aware that restrictions and penalties are subject to change at short notice.
Public spaces and services
Face masks
You must wear a face mask in public. Some exceptions are: children under 6 years old; anyone eating, drinking or taking medication; or anyone engaged in strenuous exercise. You could be fined, imprisoned, or both if you are found not wearing a face mask without a valid reason.
The Health Sciences Authority’s guide on face masks recommends that masks have at least 2 to 3 layers of fabric.
Trace Together and Health Alerts via SMS
You’ll need to scan in and out of many places using the Trace Together phone app or token:
public buildings
shopping centres and malls
schools
workplaces
places of worship
If you happen to visit a ‘hotspot’ on the same day as someone infected by the virus, you’ll receive a health alert via SMS and may need to be tested. Read further information in the Ministry of Health press release on reopening.
Quarantine in a Government Facility
If you test positive, or are considered a close contact of a person who has tested positive, you will be placed in hospital or a government quarantine facility for a period possibly up to several weeks. If a minor (someone under 21 years of age) or vulnerable person is placed in quarantine an appropriate carer is permitted to quarantine with them. Those considered to have possibly been exposed to the virus may also be required to be tested, or additionally to stay at home for a period and be monitored.
Dining out
Dining out is allowed in groups of up to five people if everyone in the group is fully vaccinated. Unvaccinated children may be included in the group of five if they are aged 12 years or below and are from the same household as the other diners. People are considered fully vaccinated from 14 days after they have completed their required doses of the following vaccines: Pfizer, Moderna, AstraZeneca (also known as CoviShield), Janssen (as known as Johnson and Johnson), Sinovac or Sinopharm. The TraceTogether app or token can be used as proof of vaccination status, or a paper copy proof of vaccination can be used.
Unvaccinated people may be part of a group of five people dining out if they have taken an antigen rapid test and tested negative within the previous 24 hours, or have recently recovered from COVID-19. Separate rules apply for dining at hawker centres where, regardless of vaccination status, a maximum of two people can dine together.
Indoor gyms
Exercise indoors without a mask is permitted in groups of up to five fully vaccinated people and for classes of up to 30 vaccinated participants. Mask-on indoor exercise is permitted for up to five people regardless of vaccination status and up to 50 people can attend mask-on exercise activities. For further guidance, visit the Singapore government website. You should follow the safe distancing measures in place.
Outdoor exercise
You can exercise outdoors without a mask alone or in a groups of up to five regardless of vaccination status.
Work
Working from home is still the default. If you must go to work, wear a face mask and keep a distance of one metre from others. Social gatherings at work are not allowed.
From 19th August, workplaces can allow up to 50% of their staff (who can work from home) to return to work with workplace social gatherings allowed in a group of up to 5.
Social gatherings
When meeting up with friends or family:
• keep group size to a maximum of five people • five different people (‘unique visitors’) can visit you at home in one day • you can have two social gatherings per day, whether at home or in a public place • keep a distance of one metre from each other
If safe distancing is not possible, while on public transport, for example, avoid speaking to each other or talking on the phone.
For guidelines on the Phase 2 (Heightened Alert) measures, visit the Singapore government website.
Healthcare in Singapore

COVID-19 vaccines if you live in Singapore
Wherever possible British nationals should aim to be vaccinated in the country where they live. We will update this page when the Government of Singapore announces new information on the national vaccination programme. You can sign up to get email notifications when this page is updated.
The Singapore national vaccination programme started in December 2020 and is using the Pfizer-BioNTech and Moderna vaccines (delete or expand as applicable). The Singapore government has opened vaccination for all residents and long-term visitors aged 12 years and over (including Permanent Residents, Employment Pass, S-Pass and Work Permit holders, foreign domestic workers, Dependent Pass, Long-Term Visit Pass and Student Pass holders).
Vaccination using Pfizer-BioNTech (also known as Comirnaty) and Moderna is free of charge. Whilst vaccination with other vaccines may be possible at private clinics for a fee, the Singapore government is discouraging the use of other vaccines. People not vaccinated with Pfizer-BioNTech or Moderna vaccines may face additional restrictions and measures. More information, including on registration, can be found at Singapore’s COVID-19 vaccination website. A Vaccine Injury Financial Assistance Programme exists to cover any vaccine related impacts on health.
The local authorities have warned that vaccine-related scams exist. If in doubt, check the Ministry of Health website or call their hotline on 1800-333-9999.
Find out more, including about vaccines that are authorised in the UK or approved by the World Health Organisation, on the COVID-19 vaccines if you live abroad.
If you’re a British national living in Singapore, you should seek medical advice from your local healthcare provider. Information about COVID-19 vaccines used in the national programme where you live, including regulatory status, should be available from local authorities.
Proof of vaccination
Once vaccinated in Singapore your vaccination status is recorded in the national ‘TraceTogether’ app/token and this can be shown at venues or events which require your vaccination status to enter. There are two ways to otherwise get proof that you have been vaccinated:
a physical card issued to you after each vaccination
a downloadable version from the Health Hub website or app
Health Hub will only show your Foreign Identification Number (FIN) if you are a resident foreign national, so have a copy of your work pass with you to show that your name matches the FIN.
Finance
For information on financial support you can access whilst abroad, visit our financial assistance guidance.
