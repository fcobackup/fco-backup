The information on this page covers the most common types of travel and reflects the UK government’s understanding of the rules currently in place. Unless otherwise stated, this information is for travellers using a full ‘British Citizen’ passport.
The authorities in Lebanon are responsible for setting and enforcing the rules for entry. If you’re unclear about any aspect of the entry requirements, or you need further reassurance, you’ll need to contact the Lebanese embassy in the UK.
You should also consider checking with your transport provider or travel company to make sure your passport and other travel documents meet their requirements.
Entry rules in response to coronavirus (COVID-19)
Entry to Lebanon
Beirut’s Rafik Hariri international airport re-opened on 1 July 2020 and there are direct and indirect commercial flights operating daily.
From 1 June, all travellers from the UK and Brazil to Lebanon will be subject to supplementary COVID-19 measures in addition to the ones already in place. All passengers (apart from children under the age of 12) will be required to take a PCR test at Beirut International Airport on arrival, which is provided at the airline’s expense. Passengers must have a hotel booking for 5 days/4 nights on arrival in one of three hotels (Mayflower Hotel Hamra, Royal Tulip Hotel Achrafieh, Alife Apart Hotel Sodeco) where they must complete 5 days of quarantine before taking a PCR test. A hotel booking is required to board the plane.
National and foreign diplomats and their families are exempt from quarantining in a hotel but must quarantine for 5 days at their accommodation. Passengers who can prove that they have received both doses of the COVID-19 vaccine at least 2 weeks before departure to Lebanon or those who have had and recovered from COVID-19 within 90 days prior travel are exempt from taking a pre-departure PCR test and from hotel quarantine.
From 28 April, passengers from India are not permitted to enter Lebanon unless they have spent at least 14 days in a third country directly prior to entry.
Certificate requirements and measures within Lebanon
If you’re travelling to Lebanon, you are required to take a PCR test at a laboratory certified by local authorities 96 hours before you travel, and to show the result at check-in at your departure airport. If you do not have a negative PCR test result within this time frame and in an approved form (paper or email, not SMS), you will not be allowed to board your flight to Lebanon. Children under 12 are exempt from this requirement. The government has announced that you are exempt from this requirement if you have received both doses of the COVID-19 vaccine more than 15 days prior to your departure to Lebanon. However, you must have received the second dose of the vaccine in one of the following places: Lebanon, US, Canada, Australia, New Zealand, European countries (including the UK), Asian countries, Egypt, Algeria, Morocco or Tunisia. As there is currently no means to certify vaccinations vaccinations issued in the UK for international travel, all travellers should continue to obtain a PCR test as stated above. Check with your local Lebanese embassy or airline if you are unclear whether your vaccine is recognised.
You should not use the NHS testing service to get a test in order to facilitate your travel to another country. You should arrange to take a private test.
Any passenger who shows symptoms of illness including COVID-19 will not be allowed to board the aircraft.
Passengers who left Lebanon for a period not exceeding one week are not required to do a PCR test before departure, but will be subject to a PCR test in Lebanon.
Self-isolation requirements and tests after arrival
From 1 June, all travellers from the UK and Brazil to Lebanon will be subject to supplementary COVID-19 measures in addition to the ones already in place. All passengers (apart from children under the age of 12) will be required to take a PCR test at Beirut International Airport on arrival, which is provided at the airline’s expense. Passengers must have a hotel booking for 5 days/4 nights on arrival in one of three hotels (Mayflower Hotel Hamra, Royal Tulip Hotel Achrafieh, Alife Apart Hotel Sodeco) where they must complete 5 days of quarantine before taking a PCR test. A hotel booking is required to board the plane.
National and foreign diplomats and their families are exempt from quarantining in a hotel but must quarantine for 5 days at their accommodation. Passengers who can prove that they have received both doses of the COVID-19 vaccine at least 2 weeks before departure to Lebanon or those who have had and recovered from COVID-19 within 90 days prior travel are exempt from taking a pre-departure PCR test and from hotel quarantine.
From 28 April, passengers from India are not permitted to enter Lebanon unless they have spent at least 14 days in a third country directly prior to entry.
All travellers to Lebanon will be required to take an additional PCR test at Beirut International Airport upon arrival (which is provided at the airline’s expense) and then to quarantine for 72 hours (apart from the countries stated above). Travellers will also be required to download and activate the “Covid Leb Track” mobile application on arrival to Lebanon, and to present the application to the authorities at Beirut International Airport at the time of the PCR test.
Diplomats and their families, official delegations and UNFIL officers are exempt from the quarantine measures, as well as those who have received both doses of the COVID-19 vaccination, on the condition that they have proof of vaccination and take a PCR test on arrival as a precautionary measure.
The Lebanese government is keeping these measures under review and they may change at short notice. You must comply with any amended regulations for testing and self-isolation. You should check with your airline and the Embassy of Lebanon in the country you are travelling from before travel.
Transit passengers
There are no testing or additional COVID-19 related procedures required for transiting travellers. Passengers with a short transit time will be allowed to proceed directly to their gate, those with a longer transit time will have to wait at a designated gate where a cafeteria is available.
Regular entry requirements
Visas
British citizens can normally apply for a free single entry tourist or family visit visa on arrival. British Overseas Citizens and British Protected Persons will need to get a visa before travelling to Lebanon. Persons of Palestinian origin may also require a visa before travelling, or may be required to carry additional documentation with them when travelling. Entry requirements are subject to change, so you should check with the Lebanese Embassy before you travel.
Overstaying without the proper authority is a serious matter. You may be refused permission to leave until a fine has been paid.
Passport validity
Your passport should be valid for a minimum period of 3 months from the date of entry into Lebanon.
UK Emergency Travel Documents
UK Emergency Travel Documents (ETDs) are accepted for entry, transit and exit from Lebanon. You can find more information on how to get an ETD on gov.uk.
If your passport is lost or stolen during your stay in Lebanon and you require an ETD to leave, you will need to visit the Public Prosecution in Adlieh building (central Beirut) to report the loss or theft. Once the police report is finalized, you will need to obtain an Exit visa prior to your departure in order to leave the country, either from the General Security’s Department of Passport and Immigration or from the General Security Office at the airport. You will need to show the police report and the ETD. You should factor the time this will take into any new travel plans.
Previous travel to Israel
If your passport contains an Israeli stamp you may be refused entry to Lebanon even if you hold a valid Lebanese visa.
Stop matches
Lebanese Immigration Authorities check all visitors’ names on arrival against a database of those wanted for, or convicted of, offences in Lebanon. If a name matches against an entry on the database the individual may be detained (or on occasion allowed entry upon surrender of their passport) until they can prove that the record does not relate to them. It’s often possible to do so by producing a copy of a birth certificate or other official documentation that allows parents’ names to be checked against the database. You should consider carrying this kind of supporting documentation.
