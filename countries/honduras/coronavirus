If you think you have COVID-19 symptoms you should seek medical advice and check the official page where all important information about COVID-19 as well as all advice from the Honduran authorities can be found.
At present, public hospitals in San Pedro Sula and Tegucigalpa are at capacity, with no space for patients with COVID-19 or patients who require intensive care.
Some private hospitals are accepting patients with COVID-19, but it will cost 1,000,000 Lempiras (over £30,000) to be admitted, with the final medical bill potentially higher.
Small clinics provide testing, basic medical attention and medication to COVID-19 patients that present mild symptoms and do not require special medical care.
British-issued prescriptions cannot be used locally. To find a pharmacy (“farmacia”) look for one of the big national chains such as Farmacias Siman, Farmacias Kielsa or Farmacia El Ahorro, among others; a quick search online should help you to identify the nearest one open.
