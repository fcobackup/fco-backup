This page has information on travelling to Singapore.
This page reflects the UK government’s understanding of current rules for people travelling on a full ‘British Citizen’ passport from the UK, for the most common types of travel.
The authorities in Singapore set and enforce entry rules. If you’re unsure how Singapore’s entry requirements apply to you, contact its UK embassy, high commission or consulate.
All travellers
In general, British citizens do not need a visa to transit or enter Singapore. It’s up to Immigration and Checkpoints Authority to decide who can enter Singapore.
All arrivals in Singapore must complete an electronic SG Arrival Card up to three days before entry into Singapore. This online form requires travel details and a health declaration. It is illegal to submit a false declaration.
If you’re arriving from certain countries in Africa and Latin America, you may need to show a yellow fever certificate to enter Singapore.
There are other measures in place for foreign crew working on ships, small vessels, or pleasure crafts at one of Singapore’s marinas. See guidelines for air/sea crew and pleasure craft owners.
From 13 February 2023 there are no COVID-19 related requirements for entering Singapore. Prior to 13 February 2023 unvaccinated people must show a pre-departure COVID-19 test and have travel insurance. See the Immigration and Checkpoints Authority.
If you’re transiting through Singapore
Transiting is when you pass through one country on the way to your final destination.
You do not need a visa for an airside transit in Singapore.
More information about transiting through Singapore can be found on the Transiting through Singapore page of the ICA website.
Arriving by car
If you are arriving in a car that is not registered in Singapore, visit the OneMotoring website to apply for a Vehicle Entry Permit.
Check your passport and travel documents before you travel
Passports
If you’re visiting Singapore, your passport should be valid for six months from the date you arrive.
If you’re a resident in Singapore there’s no minimum validity required, but you should apply for a replacement before your passport expires.
Check with your travel provider to make sure your passport and other travel documents meet their requirements.
