This advice reflects the UK government’s understanding of current rules for people travelling on a full ‘British citizen’ passport from the UK, for the most common types of travel. 
The authorities in The Bahamas set and enforce entry rules. If you’re not sure how these requirements apply to you, contact The Bahamas High Commission in the UK.
