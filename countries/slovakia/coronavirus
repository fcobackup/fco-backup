Public spaces and services
With effect from 15 October, the Slovak Government has imposed further restrictions on public life to counter the spread of COVID-19.
People may only gather in groups of up to six if they are not from the same household.
Facemasks must now be worn outdoors in all built-up areas, such as towns and villages. The wearing of facemasks remains compulsory indoors, including on public transport and in shops. Masks are not required in the countryside if you are with others from the same household or can maintain a five-metre distance.
Restaurants, bars and cafés may now only serve food and drink if they provide a takeaway service or have outdoor seating with social distancing measures in place. Outdoor seating areas must close at 10pm, but take-away and delivery services may continue after that time.
Events for more than six people are not permitted unless every participant provides a negative PCR test result no older than 12 hours. Weddings, christenings and funerals are exempt, but participants must follow social distancing and hygiene requirements.
Some professional sporting competitions may continue but without spectators.
Fitness centres, wellness centres, swimming pools, water parks, saunas, cinemas and theatres are closed.
The number of people in shops and shopping centres is limited to one person per 15 square metres. Temperature checks will be carried out at the entrances to shopping centres. You must maintain a two metre distance when queuing.
Supermarkets and chemists have reserved shopping hours between 9am and 11am for those over 65.
Local public transport is running as normal, but face masks are compulsory.
Hotels and guest houses are permitted to remain open, but may have reduced or cancelled services in order to comply with social distancing and hygiene requirements.
