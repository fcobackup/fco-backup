It is also possible to book a private charter with Airawak from Grenada to Martinique from where connections to the UK via Paris are available.
Anyone considering travelling by these routes is responsible for making sure that they meet all requirements for entry / onward travel of any and all countries and territories. To this end, they should review relevant country pages on FCO Travel Advice.

You will need to pay for your return travel to the UK. If departure options are available but you cannot afford the travel costs and have exhausted all other options for getting funds, you may be eligible to apply for an emergency loan from the government. This is a last resort option and you would need to repay the loan when you are back in the UK.
For more information, you should contact Corporate Travel Management (CTM). CTM are a commercial partner of the FCO and are authorised to administer such loans on behalf of the FCO.
