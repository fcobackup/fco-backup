Local measures
On 16 March the Andorran authorities announced a series of preventive measures, including the closure of most shops other than those selling food or other essential items such as pharmacies. This follows the cancellation of all leisure, cultural and sports activities organised by public administrations, and the closure of ski resorts.
Public transport is operating at a reduced capacity and schools, higher education institutions and vocational training centres are closed.
You can find more information regarding the measures in place on the Andorran government website (in Catalan).
