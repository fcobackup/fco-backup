Coronavirus guidance is being updated.
Read the Prime Minister’s statement for the latest information.

The information on this page covers the most common types of travel and reflects the UK government’s understanding of the rules currently in place. Unless otherwise stated, this information is for travellers using a full ‘British Citizen’ passport.
The authorities in the country or territory you’re travelling to are responsible for setting and enforcing the rules for entry. If you’re unclear about any aspect of the entry requirements, or you need further reassurance, you’ll need to contact the embassy, high commission or consulate of the country or territory you’re travelling to.
You should also consider checking with your transport provider or travel company to make sure your passport and other travel documents meet their requirements.
Restrictions in response to coronavirus
The Danish border is closed to foreign nationals who do not have a ‘worthy purpose’ for entering Denmark. Border checks are in place at all entry points. The list of ‘worthy purposes’ has been expanded to include UK residents in certain situations. Proof will be required to demonstrate a ‘worthy purpose’ to enter. Check with the Danish authorities on their helpline (+45 7020 6044) for advice on the conditions of entry for foreign nationals. You should read their online Q&A for further information.
The Danish government has issued guidance that everyone returning from private travel abroad should stay home for 14 days.
Guidelines for Greenland and the Faroe Islands
From 15 June commercial flights to Greenland are available and a daily service is operating from Copenhagen to the Faroe Islands. You should check the latest guidance on entry requirements for travel to Greenland and travel to the Faroe Islands before departure.
Regular entry requirements
The Danish authorities increased border controls at the land border with Germany in January 2016. Border controls were also introduced in November 2019 for travellers from Rønne, Helsingør, Frederikshavn, Grenaa and those using the Øresund Bridge, including all train traffic from Sweden. These checks are temporary but will be in place for an unspecified period of time.
If you’re travelling using the land border, or by rail, road, or ferry you should make sure you have your passport with you. Allow additional time, be vigilant and follow the instructions of local authorities. Check with local media, your carrier, ferry operator or Danish State Railways (DSB) for more information.
When crossing from Denmark to Sweden various forms of ID are accepted, but must include a photograph, the holder’s full name, social security number or date of birth, holders signature, a stated validity and information on the issuing authority. Children under 18 accompanied by an adult with the appropriate ID are not required to carry ID themselves.
Passport validity
