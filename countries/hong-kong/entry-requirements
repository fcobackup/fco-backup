The information on this page covers the most common types of travel and reflects the UK government’s understanding of the rules currently in place. Unless otherwise stated, this information is for travellers using a full ‘British Citizen’ passport.
The authorities in the country or territory you’re travelling to are responsible for setting and enforcing the rules for entry. If you’re unclear about any aspect of the entry requirements, or you need further reassurance, you’ll need to contact the embassy, high commission or consulate of the country or territory you’re travelling to.
You should also consider checking with your transport provider or travel company to make sure your passport and other travel documents meet their requirements.
Restrictions in response to coronavirus
Entry
Travellers arriving in Hong Kong on flights from overseas countries/territories, who are not Hong Kong residents, will be denied entry to Hong Kong. Non-Hong Kong residents travelling to Hong Kong from mainland China, Macao or Taiwan will also be denied entry if they have been to any overseas country/territory in the past 14 days.
All travellers entering Hong Kong, including Hong Kong residents, will have to take a mandatory medical test for coronavirus and will be required to undergo 14-day compulsory quarantine. Quarantine is usually spent at a residential address, but arrivals may be placed in a Hong Kong government quarantine centre. Hong Kong residents arriving from Pakistan, India, Bangladesh, Nepal and South Africa will be tested for coronavirus upon arrival and then transferred in coaches to a government quarantine centre for a 14-day compulsory quarantine period.

Health Declaration form
All inbound travellers via Hong Kong International Airport are required to submit a health declaration form.
Health screening and coronavirus testing
All arrivals (including transit passengers) will be subject to advanced screening measures, including temperature checks. Those deemed to have a high temperature will undergo further checks by the Port Health Office at the airport. If they meet further risk criteria, they will be transferred to a Hong Kong public hospital for mandatory checks/treatment.
All asymptomatic arrivals ending their journey at Hong Kong International Airport will have to provide a saliva sample which will be tested for coronavirus. After collecting baggage, travellers will be taken by shuttle bus to the designated location. Travellers will have to wait for test results, before proceeding to their mandatory quarantine location.
Passengers arriving on morning flights will be taken to the AsiaWorld Expo centre and will receive test results on the same day. This could take 8 or more hours. Passengers arriving in the afternoon and evening will need to wait for test results overnight, and will be temporarily accommodated in the Department of Health Holding Centre for Test Results (HCTR) set up in the Regal Oriental Hotel win Kowloon.
If the sample tests positive, the Hong Kong authorities will notify you and arrange for admission to a public hospital. All arrivals, including those who test negative for coronavirus, are required to undergo 14-day compulsory quarantine. See “Quarantine measures” below.

See Staying during coronavirus for further details about quarantine.
See the Hong Kong Government coronavirus website for further information.
Transit via Hong Kong
From 1 June, transit services will resume gradually at Hong Kong International Airport (all transits have been suspended from 25 March to 31 May). This process will take time; even after 1 June, the airport’s transit facilities will not be open to all flight connections, this includes connections that require passengers to change airline. You should therefore check with your travel agent or airline before travelling and check the Hong Kong International Airport website. You should not book tickets which display a transit via Hong Kong on a flight arriving before 1 June, as you will not be able to connect to flights leaving Hong Kong. There is a risk you will be placed into 14 days government quarantine. From 1 June, all passengers able to transit Hong Kong International Airport will be subject to advanced screening measures, including temperature checks. Those passengers not displaying a high temperature will be allowed to connect to their next flight. But passengers deemed to have a high temperature will undergo further checks by the Port Health Office at the airport. If they meet further risk criteria, they will be transferred to a Hong Kong public hospital for mandatory checks/treatment, where it is highly likely you will be asked to complete a mandatory COVID-19 test.
All border crossings with mainland China remain closed indefinitely, with the exception of the Shenzhen Bay Checkpoint and the Hong Kong-Zhuhai-Macau Bridge. All ferry crossings between Hong Kong and mainland China, and Hong Kong and Macao have ceased. Kai Tak Cruise and Ocean Terminals are also closed to passengers indefinitely.
Certain groups of people travelling from mainland China, Taiwan and Macao may be granted an exemption from quarantine requirements by applying in advance to the Chief Secretary of the Administration. These groups include people involved in receiving or providing education and those travelling for purposes relating to manufacturing operations, business activities or the provision of professional services in the interest of Hong Kong’s economic development.

The Macao government has announced that all travellers arriving in Macao, who are not residents of Macao, Hong Kong, Taiwan or mainland China, will be denied entry. Residents of Hong Kong, Taiwan or mainland China who have travelled overseas in the 14 days prior to their arrival will also be denied entry.
