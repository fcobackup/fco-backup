Political situation
Myanmar held national elections on 8 November 2020 in which the National League of Democracy Party won a majority. The military subsequently alleged fraud in the elections and demanded a review. On 1 February 2021, the Myanmar military declared a state of emergency and assumed control. There has been widespread political violence involving the deaths of hundreds of ordinary people, as well as a major rise in active clashes between armed actors.
On Monday 25 July, the military regime carried out the first judicial executions in decades. This action marks an escalation from the regime and there is heightened tension throughout the country as a result. Visitors to Myanmar should be extra vigilant.
You should remain cautious and avoid all demonstrations, large crowds and political gatherings. You should not attempt to photograph any gatherings. See Photography and drones for more information. You should remain vigilant and follow the advice of local authorities.
There have been a number of targeted explosions directed against official buildings by opposition activists. The use of improvised explosives is becoming increasingly sophisticated and deadly. Most of these attacks are directed against security force locations, administration offices in wards and townships, but have included attacks on schools and hospitals.
Ignoring military instructions or ignoring curfews could lead to detention and/or lengthy prison sentences. Curfews are in place nationwide. Local wards may unexpectedly change rules and curfew times and it is important to remain updated on local rules.
Myanmar has suffered from prolonged internal conflicts, involving a number of Ethnic Armed Organisations in Myanmar’s border areas. The possibility of violent clashes remains in some areas of all Border States.
The political situation remains unsettled. Restrictions on freedom of assembly, movement and the right to form trade unions remain in place following extremely narrow legislative reforms. Restrictions on freedom of speech, movement, religion, and political activity remain, and under current laws criticism of the government can result in imprisonment, detainment and deportation.
On significant anniversaries, like the anniversary of the coup (1 February), Armed Forces Day (27 March), the 8 August 1988 uprising against the government and the September 2007 protests, and other public holidays like Martyrs Day (19 July), you can expect to see an increase in security forces in Yangon and elsewhere in Myanmar. This is particularly true since the military’s seizure of power.
Yangon region
Whilst we no longer advise against all but essential travel to Yangon region, there is still a heightened risk. If you are in the Yangon region, you should remain vigilant, exercise caution and seek local advice, especially if travelling to townships under martial law. Currently, townships under martial law are Hlaing Thayar, Shwe Pyithar, North Okkalapa, North Dagon, South Dagon and Dagon Seakkan, but this is subject to change.
Violent incidents, such as explosions in public places or unrest resulting from protests, can occur with little notice across the region. Businesses with links to the military and visible military installations such as checkpoints are often the targets of attacks. You should regularly seek local advice as the security situation remains volatile and can change at short notice. Risks are higher when senior military officials visit Yangon, and also on major national occasions, such as Armed Forces Day (27 March). If you need to travel to Yangon at these times, you should seek local advice and keep a low profile. If you encounter a threatening or intimidating situation, don’t try to make your way through it. Turn round and move to safety.
Crime
There are no officially issued accurate crime statistics. Anecdotal evidence suggests occasional instances of violent crime against foreigners. The most common crimes are non-violent crimes of opportunity (pickpocketing, theft of unattended possessions in public places or hotel rooms, bag snatching, gem/confidence scams). Since the coup criminal activity continues and may increase in an unstable environment. Thieves often attempt to distract a victim by asking questions, begging for money, selling items, or bumping/jostling. You should take extra care of your belongings and take sensible security precautions at all times.
Myanmar is still largely a cash-only society. Travellers, who often need to carry large sums of local currency, should avoid displaying cash or other valuables in public. Beware of merchants offering to sell gems, gold, semi-precious stones. This could result in substantial loss of money and/or a violation of local laws. Do not buy gems or minerals from an unlicensed source.
Although levels of violent crime and robbery against foreign nationals are low, especially in Yangon, levels of crime are rising due to economic pressures. You should be vigilant at all times, even if staying with friends and offered by employers or hosts.
Scams
There have been incidents where people have received emails from individuals claiming to work for British firms seeking loans to advance their business interests in Myanmar. These have stated they are acting on advice of the British Embassy. See our pages on fraud and financial scams for further guidance.
Border areas
Violence is severe and the situation is unpredictable in most ethnic states and border areas. The Myanmar government restricts travel to most border areas. Unmarked landmines also pose a threat in many border regions. In the North West and South East, there are active military operations involving the use of air strikes, artillery bombardments and ground troops.
Landmines
As a result of years of conflict, the threat of landmines in rural areas is high, particularly in northern and central Rakhine, northern Shan and Kachin States. There is no reliable land mine mapping source, and there is evidence of landmine use spreading to other areas since the coup. Some areas with known mines are marked by signage, however this practice is not widespread. Visitors should exercise extreme caution if travelling off main roads in these areas. In 2019 a foreign tourist was killed by a landmine while travelling off the main road in Northern Shan State in the area around Hsipaw town. A woman accompanying him was also injured in the incident.
Air travel
The FCDO cannot offer advice on the safety of individual airlines. However, the International Air Transport Association publishes a list of registered airlines that have been audited and found to meet a number of operational safety standards and recommended practices. This list is not exhaustive and the absence of an airline from this list doesn’t necessarily mean that it’s unsafe. A list of recent incidents and accidents is available on the website of the Aviation Safety Network.
Airlines routinely share flight codes, meaning that airlines sometimes use aircraft from outside their own fleet. Passengers aren’t always advised in advance where this is the case.
Local flight schedules are subject to change without warning. Leave sufficient time in your travel itinerary to accommodate this.
Rail travel
Railway safety standards are significantly below those in the UK.
Road travel
Overland travel can be hazardous, particularly in the rainy season (May to October). Roads can become impassable and bridges damaged. Travel by road between many areas outside the key destinations of Yangon, Mandalay, Bago and Irrawaddy regions is restricted.
Road safety standards are significantly lower than in the UK. Under Myanmar law, the driver of a car involved in an accident with a pedestrian is always at fault. Many vehicles, including taxis and buses, are in a poor mechanical state, and serious road traffic accidents are common. Although driving is on the right in Myanmar, the majority of cars are right hand drive.
Sea and river travel
Seek local advice about where it is safe to swim or dive in the sea. River transport may not meet internationally recognised safety standards and search and rescue facilities may be limited.
Passenger ferries have been subject to attacks in Rakhine State.
During the monsoon season (normally May to October), heavy rains can cause flooding. Make sure life jackets are available and check local weather conditions before undertaking any river journey. All travellers should avoid wading, swimming or bathing in freshwater to prevent catching schistosomiasis. See Health
Mobile phones and Internet
The Myanmar authorities have previously periodically cut mobile internet services and have blocked several websites. It is possible that the internet or mobile phones could be cut with no notice.
Myanmar’s technological infrastructure has improved. International GSM roaming is now available in Myanmar and all local networks offer 3G and 4G. If roaming is enabled, some UK SIM cards will work and coverage is fairly reliable in the main cities. UK mobile service providers may charge especially high prices for roaming in Myanmar.
Many visitors travel with a spare mobile phone and buy a SIM card for a nominal fee when they arrive. This can then be topped up as needed.
