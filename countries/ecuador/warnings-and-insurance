State of Emergency declared
In January, the President declared a 60-day state of emergency (SOE) across Ecuador following an increase in criminal activity and security incidents.
There is a daily curfew from 11pm to 5am which you should follow, unless you need to travel to or from the airport. You will need to show your passport or ID and boarding pass or flight booking. Only passengers are allowed to enter the airport, family members and friends will not be allowed into the terminals to drop off or pick up passengers. You should leave extra time to travel to the airport, as extra security checks may be carried out on arrival. Check road conditions (in Spanish) before you travel.
Airports are open but some airlines have cancelled flights. Check your flight status with your airline or airport website (Quito Airport, Guayaquil Airport) before travelling to the airport.
There may be increased military and police presence around key public buildings, airports, bus terminals and on the streets. Some public buildings, shopping centres and key tourist destinations may close without warning.  Monitor local media and stay away from areas involving increased security activity.
If an incident occurs near you, follow the instructions of police and other security officials at all times.
