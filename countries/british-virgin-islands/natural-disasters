The hurricane season in the Caribbean normally runs from June to November, but can occur any time of the year. You should monitor weather updates from the US National Hurricane Centre and the BVI Department of Disaster Management. 
See our Tropical Cyclones for advice about how to prepare effectively and what to do if you’re likely to be affected by a hurricane or tropical cyclone.
