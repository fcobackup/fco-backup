The Foreign, Commonwealth & Development Office (FCDO) provides advice about risks of travel to help British nationals make informed decisions. Find out more about FCDO travel advice.
Political demonstrations
There are planned demonstrations on 17 November in Athens and major university cities, including Thessaloniki and Heraklion. These demonstrations could become violent and security forces may deploy tear gas. If you are in areas where demonstrations are taking place, remain vigilant, move away quickly from the area, stay aware of your surroundings and follow the advice of local authorities. Further information can be found on the safety and security page.
Greek authorities have increased security at some prominent locations, including tourist sites, due to events in Israel and the Occupied Palestinian Territories. Stay aware of your surroundings, stay away from demonstrations and follow the advice of local authorities. Follow “112 Greece” on X (formerly known as Twitter) for official updates.
