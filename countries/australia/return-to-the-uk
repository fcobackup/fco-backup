Commercial flights remain available to return to the UK from Australia.
If you live in the UK and are currently visiting Australia, you should return now by commercial flights. Don’t run the risk of getting stranded.
UK special charter flights will only operate for priority countries where commercial flights are not available. You should not assume that these flights will become available in countries where commercial routes are operating.
If you’re looking to return to the UK, you should also register your details with the British High Commission. This will help us in our work with airlines to keep commercial routes open and to alert you to airline advice on flight options. You may include additional details including on your location any relevant information about your health or other vulnerabilities.
Flights
Qatar Airways is operating routes to the UK, via Doha, from the following airports:
Departure airport Frequency
Sydney One flight daily
Melbourne One flight daily
Perth Four flights per week
Adelaide From 2 June, five flights per week
You can book tickets on the Qatar Airways website. Contact the airline directly for any further information on all routes.
British Airways, Emirates and Etihad are amongst the airlines which have currently temporarily suspended flights to and from Australia.
You will need to pay for your return travel to the UK. If departure options are available but you cannot afford the travel costs and have exhausted all other options for getting funds, you may be eligible to apply for an emergency loan from the government. This is a last resort option and you would need to repay the loan when you are back in the UK. For more information, you should contact Corporate Travel Management (CTM). CTM are a commercial partner of the FCO and are authorised to administer such loans on behalf of the FCO.
Travelling to your international airport
If you are already in Australia, you may travel by air to another Australian State to transit to an international flight as long as you hold a confirmed booking for that flight. You do not need to seek an exemption. You will be required to stay within the airport for the duration of your transit, or if transiting overnight, you will need to self-isolate in a hotel. In Western Australia, your transit time must be no more than 24 hours.
Qantas, Virgin Australia and Jetstar are running a limited schedule of domestic flights within Australia. Tigerair has currently suspended their domestic flights.
There are currently no restrictions if you are travelling by road to an airport within the same State but you may need to provide proof of your onward international travel. Some States require you to apply for an exemption to cross their borders. Given the fast changing situation, you should check State and Territory websites for the latest information. Links can be found on the Australian Government Coronavirus website.
If you are an Australian citizen or permanent resident
All Australian citizens, including British/Australian dual nationals, and British nationals who are permanent residents cannot leave Australia without an exemption.
If you are a British/Australian dual national who is ordinarily resident in a country outside Australia, you do not require an exemption to leave Australia. You should be ready to show evidence that you normally reside outside Australia if requested by authorities on departure at the airport.
If you are a permanent resident in Australia have a compelling or compassionate reason to travel overseas, you need to apply for an exemption in advance from the Commissioner of the Australian Border Force. You should apply for an exemption as early as possible —at least 48 hours before your intended departure time.
Further details on categories for exemptions, the exemption application form, and the evidence you must provide to support your exemption application, can be found on the Department of Home Affairs website.
