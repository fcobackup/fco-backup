There is no guarantee that flights will begin straight away once the lockdown is lifted, so if you have booked a flight with a commercial airline during June 2020 you should be prepared for the possibility that the flight will not operate.

Travel to the airport
Do not travel to the airport without a confirmed ticket.
You should allow plenty of time to get to the airport or your muster point as travelling may be more difficult than normal. You should make sure you are able to show authorities proof of a booked flight (a boarding pass if possible) and your passport.
It may not be possible to buy food or water on the way to the airport, so get these before you travel.
At the airport
You will not be able to travel if you are currently showing coronavirus symptoms (you will need to self-isolate and travel later). You should comply with any additional healthcare screening measures put in place by the authorities prior to your departure.
