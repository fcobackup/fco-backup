This page has information on travelling to Bangladesh.
This page reflects the UK government’s understanding of current rules for people travelling on a full ‘British Citizen’ passport from the UK, for the most common types of travel.
The authorities in Bangladesh set and enforce entry rules. If you’re unsure how Bangladesh entry requirements apply to you, contact its UK embassy, high commission or consulate.
All travellers
You will need the following to enter Bangladesh:
a visa (see below for information on visas).
A pre-departure negative RT-PCR test result for COVID-19 is no longer required for passengers entering Bangladesh.
Please familiarise yourself with airline requirements, as you may be required for proof of vaccination for transit or any onward travel to another country. In these cases you are advised to use the UK’s proof of COVID-19 vaccination record.
If you’re transiting through Bangladesh
Transiting is when you pass through one country on the way to your final destination.
For those planning to transit through Bangladesh on your way to another country, visas for Bangladesh are not required for those remaining airside at the airport. You should familiarise yourself with any COVID related airline requirements and those of your final destination.
Check your passport and travel documents before you travel
If you are visiting Bangladesh, your passport should be valid for 6 months when applying for a visa to visit Bangladesh.
Check with your travel provider to make sure your passport and other travel documents meet their requirements.
Foreign nationals working in Bangladesh must get an Income Tax Clearance Certificate or an Income Tax Exemption Certificate before each departure from Bangladesh. Full details are available on the Bangladesh Board of Revenue website.
Visas
You will need a visa to enter Bangladesh. You can get a visa from the Bangladesh High Commission in London.
Visas on arrival are available in the categories detailed below on arrival at Hazrat Shahjalal International Airport in Dhaka. The issuance of visas on arrival is at the discretion of the Bangladeshi immigration officer and not guaranteed. Travellers are therefore strongly encouraged to obtain visas in advance.
Visas on arrival are single entry and valid for 15-30 days and available to the following categories of travellers:
Those of Bangladeshi heritage, their spouse and children, on the basis of a Bangladesh Government issued certificate of citizenship or origin.
Those travelling on business, on the basis of an invitation letter from the inviting company, together with a foreign traders/ investors certificate from the Bangladeshi authorities. Note that the inviting company should inform the Bangladesh Directorate of Immigration and Passport in advance of travel.
British nationals travelling from the UK on government business, or for trade, investment or tourism purposes may also be eligible for a visa on arrival. You will need to provide proof of your reason for visiting, to satisfy the immigration officer at the port of entry of the purpose of your visit.
In all cases, travellers should possess a return ticket.
The fee for visa on arrival is $50 (plus tax) payable in foreign currency. Though payment in GBP is likely to be accepted, payment by US dollars is advised.
Foreign nationals currently in Bangladesh whose visas have expired have the option to extend their visa. There is a visa extension fee for this service, in addition to a penalty fee for overstaying. Visa extensions are available at the Department of Immigration and Passport of Bangladesh.
If you intend to use Bangladesh as a hub to visit other countries in the region, make sure you get a multiple entry visa. If you’re intending to work in Bangladesh make sure you get the correct visa before you travel.
If you have had your passport renewed in Bangladesh, you will need a new visa. The Bangladesh Immigration & Passport Department (telephone: 880 2 8159878 / 8123788 / 8123323) is able to issue an ‘exit visa’ or a ‘no visa required’ stamp. Officers there are unlikely to speak English, so you may need an interpreter.
Make sure you have an entry stamp placed in your passport on entry into Bangladesh otherwise you may have problems on departure.
