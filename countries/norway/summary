The Danish Government announced that it was closing its borders for a month as of 1100GMT on Saturday 14 March. Those normally living and working in Denmark will still be able to enter the country from Norway. In addition, those who need to transit through Denmark in order to return to their place of residence will be able to. However tourists and those the Danish authorities say cannot demonstrate a recognised purpose (residence, work, delivery of goods, transit) to enter Denmark will not be allowed to cross the border. There may be further updates to how these policies take effect as the Danish and local authorities implement this ruling over coming days.
