The National Security Law entered into force in Hong Kong on 30 June 2020. It includes offences of secession, subversion, organisation and perpetration of terrorist activities, and collusion with a foreign country, all of which carry a maximum penalty of life imprisonment. The legislation states that these offences apply to activities conducted both inside and outside Hong Kong, which in practice could include activities conducted in the UK. China’s mainland authorities could under certain circumstances detain and try individuals who commit an offence, or are accused of committing an offence, under the terms of this law.
There is therefore a risk for those who commit an offence under the law of being detained and removed to mainland China. Due to ongoing heightened political sensitivity, there could be an increase in protests and violence. These could occur without warning, throughout Hong Kong. You should avoid protests and demonstrations. See Political situation.
There are reports of greater scrutiny from mainland authorities at border crossings between the mainland and Hong Kong at this time, including checks on travellers’ electronic devices. See Visits to mainland China
