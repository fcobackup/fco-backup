This advice reflects the UK government’s understanding of current rules for people travelling on a full ‘British citizen’ passport from the UK, for the most common types of travel.
The authorities in Estonia set and enforce entry rules. If you’re not sure how these requirements apply to you, contact the Estonian Embassy in London.
COVID-19 rules
Countries may restrict travel or bring in rules at short notice. Check with your travel provider for changes.
If you test positive for COVID-19, you may need to stay where you are until you test negative. You may also need to get treatment there.

Entry to Estonia
There are no COVID-19 testing or vaccination requirements for travellers entering Estonia.
Passport validity requirements
To travel to Estonia, you must follow the Schengen area passport requirements.
To enter Estonia (and all Schengen countries) your passport must:
have a ‘date of issue’ less than 10 years before the date you arrive. Passports issued after 1 October 2018 are now valid for only 10 years, but for passports issued before 1 October 2018, extra months may have been added if you renewed a passport early
have an ‘expiry date’ at least 3 months after the day you plan to leave
Contact the Estonian Embassy in London if your passport does not meet both these requirements.
Check with your travel provider that your passport and other travel documents meet requirements. Renew your passport if you need to.
You will be denied entry if you do not have a valid travel document, or try to use a passport that has been reported lost or stolen.
Checks at border control
Make sure you get your passport stamped
If you’re a visitor, your passport must be stamped when you enter or leave the Schengen area (which includes Estonia). Border guards will use passport stamps to check you haven’t overstayed the 90-day visa-free limit for stays in the Schengen area. If your passport was not stamped, border guards will presume you have overstayed the visa-free limit.
If your passport was not stamped, show evidence of when and where you entered or left the Schengen area (for example, boarding passes or tickets) and ask the border guards to add the date and location in your passport.
Read about passport stamping if you live in Estonia.
At Estonian border control, you may also need to:
show a return or onward ticket
prove that you have enough money for your stay – the amount varies depending on your accommodation
Visa requirements
You can travel to countries in the Schengen area (including Estonia) for up to 90 days in any 180-day period without a visa. This applies if you travel:
as a tourist
to visit family or friends
to attend business meetings, cultural or sports events
for short-term studies or training
If you are travelling to Estonia and other Schengen countries without a visa, make sure your whole visit is within the 90-day limit. Visits to Schengen countries within the previous 180 days before you travel count towards your 90 days.
To stay longer (for example, to work, study or for business) you will need to meet the Estonian government’s entry requirements. Check the guidance from the Estonian immigration authorities.
If you stay in Estonia with a residence permit or long-stay visa, this does not count towards your 90-day visa-free limit.
Vaccination requirements
At least 8 weeks before your trip, check:
the latest information on health risks and what vaccinations you need on TravelHealthPro’s Estonia guide
where to get vaccines and whether you have to pay on the NHS travel vaccinations page
Customs rules
There are strict rules about goods that can be brought into and taken out of Estonia. You must declare anything that may be prohibited or subject to tax or duty.
Taking food and drink into the EU
You cannot take meat, milk or products containing them into EU countries. There are some exceptions for medical reasons, for example certain amounts of powdered infant milk, infant food, or pet food. Check the rules about taking food and drink into the EU on the European Commission website.
Travel from Ukraine, Russia and Belarus
If you are arriving in Estonia from Ukraine, Russia or Belarus, you can check Estonian government information on the security situation.
