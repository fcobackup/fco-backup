There are currently limited commercial options available to return to the UK from New Zealand. Most commercial flights have been suspended. In April and May, the UK operated a series of charter flights from New Zealand to help British tourists, short term visitors and their direct dependents to return to the UK. No further charter flights are planned.

Flights
Air New Zealand are operating flights to the UK. If flying via the U.S., the border restrictions announced on 20 April will not affect transit through Los Angeles International Airport (LAX) for British Nationals travelling from New Zealand. You should check the travel advice for the USA for the full detail on transit restrictions including the Electronic System for Travel Authorization (ESTA) requirements.
Qatar Airways is also operating regular flights with Air New Zealand. These involve an Air New Zealand flight from Auckland to Sydney, Melbourne or Brisbane and then onto London Heathrow via Qatar.
For transit through Australia, the Australian Department of Home Affairs website sets out requirements, including on transit visas. You can only travel to Australia to transit to another country if your connecting flight leaves from the same airport. Depending on your circumstances, you may need to apply for a transit exemption before you travel to Australia. Further details can be found in our Australia Travel Advice.
Singapore Airlines are operating flights from Auckland and Christchurch airports, with flights to London, currently three times per week. Transit through Changi is operating only in one direction, to allow homeward travel from Australia and New Zealand, and is subject to requirements and restrictions. Connections must be no longer than 48 hours, and customers must meet all departing and arriving Government requirements and restrictions. Schedules are also subject to change. For further information, check the Singapore Airlines website.
Travelling to the airport
Foreign nationals in New Zealand can use public or private transport to travel to the airport. Further information on schedules is available on public transport in Auckland and public transport in Christchurch.

are not allowed to leave the place you’re staying for the first 14 days you’re in the UK except in very limited situations (known as ‘self-isolating’)
See also the list of people who are exempt from the border rules.
