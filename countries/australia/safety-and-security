Terrorism
There is a high threat of terrorist attack globally affecting UK interests and British nationals, including from groups and individuals who view the UK and British nationals as targets. You should remain vigilant at all times.
UK Counter Terrorism Policing has information and advice on staying safe abroad and what to do in the event of a terrorist attack. Find out how to reduce your risk from terrorism while abroad.
Terrorism in Australia
Terrorist attacks in Australia cannot be ruled out.
Attacks could be indiscriminate, including in places visited by foreigners. You should be vigilant, keep up to date with local media reports and follow the advice of local authorities.
Recent terrorist attacks in Australia include:
in 2018, a person was killed and several were injured in a terrorist incident in Melbourne
in 2017, a person was shot dead and another taken hostage in Melbourne
See the Government of Australia’s national terrorism threat level.
Crime
Protecting your belongings
Take precautions to protect yourself from petty crime, including:
not leaving your bag or luggage unattended
keeping luggage out of sight in cars
keeping valuables and passport in a hotel safe
leaving copies of important documents with family and friends in the UK
carrying a photocopy of your passport for ID
being particularly careful at night in busy tourist areas
Scams
There are many different types of scams targeting people in or travelling to Australia, including dating and romance scams, websites offering fake services, or building repair scams. You can check current scams or report any concerns you have about a scam on the Scamwatch website.
Alcohol use
Drinks served in bars overseas are often stronger than those in the UK. Alcohol and drugs can lead to you being less alert, less in control and less aware of your environment.
Laws and cultural differences
Personal ID
You can reduce the risk of losing your passport by carrying a proof of age card, this could be a driving licence or a student ID. This is accepted ID for many services like opening a bank account or entering licensed premises.
Smoking and e-cigarette bans
Laws on e-cigarettes differ between states. Liquid nicotine is classed as a poison and banned from sale nationwide, however some states allow importation for personal use and use of e-cigarettes without nicotine. Get local advice on any restrictions.
Illegal drugs and prison sentences
The Australian authorities will take action against anyone who imports or is found to be trafficking illegal drugs. Prosecution can lead to a lengthy jail sentence and deportation.
LGBT+ travellers
Same-sex marriages are legally recognised. Australia is generally open minded about homosexuality, but there are isolated incidents of homophobic crime. Visit Gay Australia is a useful travel planning resource alongside LGBT+ information from the Australian Human Rights Commission.
Read more advice for LGBT+ travellers.
Taxes
Different tax rules and rates apply to residents and non-residents. Working holidaymakers are usually regarded as non-resident for tax purposes. This means they do not qualify for any tax-free personal allowance on earnings. Get guidance from the Australian Taxation Office website.
Mobile phones
The mobile phone network generally works well in cities and large towns but coverage elsewhere can be very limited or non-existent. If you’re travelling to remote areas, check with your phone provider about coverage. You can use your UK mobile phone in Australia if global roaming has been activated, but making and receiving calls can be expensive. Many visitors prefer to buy an Australian SIM card on arrival.
Outdoor activities and adventure tourism
Swimming safety
Rip currents are the main surf hazard for all beach users. They can occur at any beach, and can sweep even the strongest swimmer out to sea.
Take precautions and follow the local guidance on swim safety and the guidance on beach safety from Surf Life Saving Australia.
Rivers and pools can be subject to sudden flash flooding as a result of heavy rain elsewhere in the area. There have been cases of British nationals being injured by diving into water that was too shallow. Make sure there is sufficient depth of water before diving, and always follow warning signs.
Diving safety
Snorkelling accidents can occur and have sometimes been fatal.
You need by law to complete a medical declaration for resort diving or snorkelling. For your own health and safety, you must be truthful about any medical conditions you have.
Transport risks
Road travel
If you are planning to drive in Australia, see information on driving abroad.
If you’re hiring a car immediately on arrival be cautious about driving. You might be jetlagged and tired from your flight. Take regular rest breaks at the many rest stops on the roads.
Australia is known for having larger distances between towns and amenities, make sure you have enough water before travelling and tell someone about your plans.
Check road conditions before beginning your journey. Stay with your vehicle if it breaks down. Avoid travelling in extreme heat. Sudden storms and strong winds can make driving difficult. Take particular care when driving on unsealed roads, 4WD tracks and desert or beach roads. Northern Territory Police have in the past warned tourists to stay off unsealed tracks in remote areas of Central Australia following reports of stranded motorists.
Licences and permits
You can drive in Australia using your UK driving licence as long as:
you remain a temporary overseas visitor
your UK licence is valid
you have not been disqualified from driving anywhere
your licence is not suspended or cancelled, or your visiting driving privileges withdrawn
If you intend to stay in Australia and you hold a permanent visa, you can drive using your UK licence for a maximum of 3 months. To continue driving, you must get a local licence within this 3-month period.
You must carry your driving licence and passport when driving. Make sure you have sufficient insurance, including if you borrow a car from a friend or relative. Hire car insurance often does not cover driving on unsealed roads. Check your policy before you set off.
Driving laws
Driving laws and regulations differ in each state and territory. Driving under the influence of alcohol or drugs is illegal. The penalties can be severe. You must wear a seat belt at all times.
Driving in the outback
Prepare thoroughly if driving in remote outback areas, which can present unexpected hazards. Ensure you have a roadworthy vehicle fitted with GPS and 2 spare tyres. Take good maps and extra food, water and fuel. Plan your route carefully and get local advice before you set out. Leave your route details and expected time of return with the local tourist authorities, police, your hotel or hostel, or friends and relatives, and let them know when you’ve arrived safely.
Driving on K’gari (Fraser Island)
Following a number of serious accidents, all vehicles on K’gari (Fraser Island) must keep to a maximum speed of 80km per hour on beaches and 30km per hour in towns. 4WD vehicles must have no more than 8 occupants (including the driver) and you must store all luggage inside the vehicle.
Avoid driving at night and be aware of beach hazards like ditches created by the surf. K’gari is remote and emergency services can take many hours to reach an accident. Carry a well-stocked first-aid kit and personal medication as there is no pharmacy on the island. For more information on keeping safe in K’gari please see the Queensland Government’s parks and forests website.
