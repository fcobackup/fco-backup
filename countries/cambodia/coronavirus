Travel in Cambodia
There has been a community outbreak of COVID-19 since 20 February 2021. The Government of Cambodia has advised against travel between provinces inside Cambodia. Some provinces have introduced road blocks and entry restrictions. These are often not announced and procedures are not uniform. We recommend avoiding unnecessary travel around the country.
The Governor of Phnom Penh has introduced a curfew in Phnom Penh between 8pm and 5am every day from 1 April 2021 to 14 April 2021. During the curfew, all business activities including food stalls and restaurants (including those attached to hotels) will be suspended. There are limited exceptions to the curfew including attending funeral ceremonies and medical emergencies. Food delivery services may still be available.
You’re expected to wear a face covering when inside the airport and many airlines will ask for face coverings to be worn. While no penalties are currently being imposed by the Cambodian authorities for refusing to wear a face covering, our advice is to wear a face covering when requested to.
Accommodation
Hotel and private rental accommodation is available throughout Cambodia. Some hotels have closed and remain so, and we advise that you contact hotels directly when booking. The majority of hotels will ask to take your temperature on arrival and ask you to complete a declaration in relation to your recent travel history and whether you have any symptoms related to COVID-19.
Some services and facilities in hotels may not be available e.g. leisure facilities.
Public places and services
Many public places and services such as gyms, casinos, karaoke rooms and nightclubs have been mandated to close or have closed due to a lack of custom. You should contact venues ahead of events.
On 11 March the Government of Cambodia brought in a law on “Preventive Measures Against the Spread of COVID-19 and Other Severe and Dangerous Contagious Diseases”. The Government has also launched a map with venues to avoid. We strongly recommend that you wear masks, clean your hands and maintain social distancing in all public places.

Many medications that would require a prescription in the UK can be bought over-the-counter in Cambodia. However, you may not find a brand you are familiar with and many pharmacies sell counterfeit or out of date products. The main branch of Pharmacie de la Gare in Phnom Penh can provide medications without a prescription and can deliver medications across the country. Before you travel, you should discuss with your doctor alternative brands of medication for your condition.

COVID-19 vaccines if you live in Cambodia
Wherever possible British nationals should aim to be vaccinated in the country where they live. As further information is available about the national vaccination programme, this page will be updated. Sign up to get email notifications.
The Royal Government of Cambodia has announced that all foreign nationals who are currently residing and working in Cambodia can get vaccinated against COVID-19 at no charge in accordance with Cambodian COVID-19 Vaccination Plans.
On 4 March 2021, the Government of Cambodia launched a website for individuals to register for a vaccination at https://cambodia-vaccine.gov.kh/ (only available in Khmer).
British nationals wishing to access vaccines in Cambodia should follow the process set out by the Royal Government of Cambodia. We are not aware of any requirement for the British Embassy to provide additional forms or assistance relating to vaccinations.
The Medicines and Healthcare Products Regulatory Agency (MHRA) is the UK authority responsible for assessing the safety, quality and efficacy of vaccines. It has authorised the Pfizer/BioNTech, Oxford/AstraZeneca and Moderna vaccines for temporary supply and use in the UK. Find out more about MHRA approval for these vaccines.
British nationals living overseas should seek medical advice from their local healthcare provider in the country where they reside. Information about vaccines used in other national programmes, including regulatory status, should be available from the local authorities. This list of Stringent Regulatory Authorities recognised by the World Health Organisation may also be a useful source of additional information. Find out more information about the COVID-19 vaccines on the World Health Organization COVID-19 vaccines page.
