Terrorists are highly likely to try to carry out attacks in Germany. Attacks could be indiscriminate, including in public places such as restaurants, places of worship and markets (shopping centres).
UK Counter Terrorism Policing has information and advice on staying safe abroad and what to do in the event of a terrorist attack. Find out more about the global threat from terrorism.
The German government has announced that increased security has been put in place as a precaution at public buildings, major events, transport hubs and large public gatherings. Terrorists may target religious sites including synagogues.
The main threat is from extremists linked to Daesh (formerly referred to as ISIL) who claimed responsibility for the 2016 attacks in Germany. There is also a threat from individuals with an extreme right wing terrorist ideology. The German authorities have successfully disrupted planned attacks and made a number of arrests.
Previous attacks in Germany include:
On 4 October 2020, one person was killed and another seriously injured in a knife attack in Dresden city centre. The perpetrator was arrested.
On 19 February 2020, two mass shootings targeting shisha bars occurred in Hanau. Eleven people were killed (including the perpetrator) and five others injured.
On 9 October 2019, two people were shot and killed close to a synagogue in the eastern German city of Halle. The attacker was arrested.
On 19 December 2016, a lorry was driven into a crowd at a Christmas market in central Berlin causing 12 deaths and a number of injuries.
Thereâ€™s a heightened threat of terrorist attack globally against UK interests and British nationals, from groups or individuals motivated by the conflict in Iraq and Syria. You should be vigilant at this time.
