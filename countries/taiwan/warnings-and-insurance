The UK does not recognise Taiwan as a state and has no diplomatic relations with Taiwan, so limited support is available to British nationals. Please refer to the British Office in Taipei for further information.
Typhoon Ragasa
Typhoon Ragasa is currently expected to pass close to Taiwan from Tuesday 23 September to early Wednesday 24 September, according to Taiwan’s Central Weather Administration (CWA). This is expected to cause heavy rainfall in the eastern and southern regions of Taiwan.
Typhoons can change course and intensity. Monitor the Central Weather Administration website and local typhoon alerts. Follow the advice of local authorities. If you are due to travel, check for messages from your travel provider.
