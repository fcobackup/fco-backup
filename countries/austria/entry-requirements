This advice reflects the UK government’s understanding of current rules for people travelling on a full ‘British citizen’ passport from the UK, for the most common types of travel.
The authorities in Austria set and enforce entry rules. If you’re not sure how these requirements apply to you, contact the Austrian Embassy in the UK.
COVID-19 rules
There are no COVID-19 testing or vaccination requirements for travellers entering Austria.
Passport validity requirements
To travel to Austria, you must follow the Schengen area passport requirements.
 To enter Austria (and all Schengen countries) your passport must:
have a ‘date of issue’ less than 10 years before the date you arrive. Passports issued after 1 October 2018 are now valid for only 10 years, but for passports issued before 1 October 2018, extra months may have been added if you renewed a passport early
have an ‘expiry date’ at least 3 months after the day you plan to leave
Check with your travel provider that your passport and other travel documents meet  requirementsRenew your passport if you need to.
You will be denied entry if you do not have a valid travel document or try to use a passport that has been reported lost or stolen.
Visa requirements
You can travel to countries in the Schengen area (including Austria) for up to 90 days in any 180-day period without a visa. This applies if you travel:
as a tourist
to visit family or friends
to attend business meetings, cultural or sports events
for short-term studies or training
If you are travelling to Austria and other Schengen countries without a visa, make sure your whole visit is within the 90-day limit. Visits to Schengen countries within the previous 180 days before you travel count towards your 90 days.
To stay longer (to work or study, for business travel or for other reasons), you must meet the Austrian government’s entry requirements. Check which visa or work permit you may need with the Austrian Ministry of Foreign Affairs or Austrian Embassy in London for visa requirements .
If you stay in Austria with a residence permit or long-stay visa, this does not count towards your 90-day visa-free limit.
Make sure you get your passport stamped.
If you’re a visitor, your passport must be stamped when you enter or leave the Schengen area (which includes Austria). Border guards will use passport stamps to check you have not  overstayed the 90-day visa-free limit for stays in the Schengen area. If your passport was not stamped, border guards will presume you have overstayed the visa-free limit.
If your passport is missing a stamp, show evidence of when and where you entered or left the Schengen area (for example, boarding passes or tickets) and ask the border guards to add the date and location in your passport.
Read about passport stamping if you live in Austria.
At Austrian border control, you may need to show:
proof of your accommodation, such as hotel booking confirmation or proof of address if visiting your second home
proof of insurance for your trip – check FCDO’s travel insurance guidance
a return or onward ticket
proof that you have enough money for your stay
Vaccination requirements (other than COVID-19)
At least 8 weeks before your trip, check the vaccinations and certificates you need on TravelHealthPro’s Austria guide.
Customs rules
There are strict rules about goods that can be brought into and taken out of Austria. You must declare anything that may be prohibited or subject to tax or duty.
Taking food into Austria
You cannot take meat, milk or products containing them into EU countries. There are some exceptions such as powdered baby milk, baby food and special foods or pet feed required for medical reasons.
