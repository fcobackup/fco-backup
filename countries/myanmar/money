There is currently severe disruption to banking services. You may find that some ATMs are not working. Some bank branches may be closed and some banks have imposed limits on daily withdrawals. Electronic payments and transfers are working but many commercial outlets will only accept cash.
You should expect to rely on cash for most of your stay (preferably US dollars). Visitors bringing in excess of $10,000 (or equivalent) in foreign currency should declare this to Customs on arrival or risk facing imprisonment.
Dollars will be required when you leave the country for visa fines or to pay for excess baggage.
Once in country it can be difficult finding a money changer to exchange US dollars into kyats. Due to concerns over counterfeit money, dollars with the letters AB and CB at the start of the serial number (top left-hand corner of the note) arenâ€™t always accepted. Notes with pen marks, folds or tears are also not accepted.
An increasing number of hotels, restaurants and shops now accept credit and debit cards, and mobile banking services are increasingly common. If you intend to pay for hotels or restaurants with a credit or debit card, you should phone ahead and confirm that this will be possible. Many vendors will charge a high service fee for paying by card.
