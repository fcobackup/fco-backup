This follows a similar announcement by New Zealand from 19 March. As many flight connections to and from Fiji connect in Australia and New Zealand, options to depart Fiji are likely to reduce. If you’re currently a visitor in Fiji, you’re advised to prepare to leave as soon as possible. If you’re resident in Fiji, you should be aware of the potential impact of the border closures and flight restrictions on future travel plans.
