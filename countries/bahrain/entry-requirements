Entry rules in response to coronavirus
Entry to Bahrain
Bahrain International Airport remains open, including for transit and transfer passengers, and visas on arrival have been reintroduced for 68 nationalities including the UK. All arrivals into Bahrain will be required to undergo and pay for the enhanced arrivals testing procedure for COVID-19 and need to self-quarantine until test results have been received. Any person staying in Bahrain for 10 days or more must repeat the testing procedure on the 10th day following their arrival in the Kingdom. You will be required to download the “BeAware” app in advance of testing. You should check Bahrain’s visa portal for the most up to date information.
Flights may also be subject to suspension or a reduced/changed service. You should check with your airline for the most up to date information before travelling to Bahrain and monitor the Bahrain News Agency for further updates as these restrictions may be subject to change.
The causeway to Saudi Arabia currently remains closed.
Transiting Bahrain
Transit and transfer passengers are permitted to use Bahrain International Airport without the requirement to undergo testing. You should check Bahrain’s visa portal for the most up to date information.
Testing on arrival
All arrivals into Bahrain must undergo a coronavirus test on arrival costing 30 Bahraini Dinar and self-isolate until test results have been received . A further coronavirus test, also costing 30 Bahraini Dinar, is required at the end of the 10 day period.
Quarantine requirements
All arrivals into Bahrain will be subject to coronavirus testing procedures, and will be required to self-isolate until test results have been received. Those who test positive will be subject to further quarantine measures and health treatment at hospital or quarantine centres. Those who test positive but are without symptoms may be permitted to self-isolate at home. An additional coronavirus test is required 10 days following arrival, which can be booked through the “BeAware” app or by calling 444.
The Government of Bahrain has stated that anyone subjected to self-isolation/quarantine must comply or face up to three months in jail and a fine of up to 10,000 BHD. Visit the website of the Government of Bahrain’s Ministry of Health for additional information.
Data collection
All arrivals are required to wear an electronic bracelet, provide contact details and download the “BeAware” Bahrain app, which will be used to monitor compliance during the self-isolation period. The bracelet will be removed only after a negative test on completion of the self-isolation period. This test can be booked through the app or by calling 444.
Regular entry requirements
Visas
Make sure you check the latest entry requirements with the Embassy of the Kingdom of Bahrain before you travel.
The Government of Bahrain reintroduced visas on-arrival across the Kingdom’s entry points from 4 September 2020. Travellers can also get a visa in advance, either online or from the Embassy of the Kingdom of Bahrain in the UK.
On 19 July 2020 the Nationality, Passports and Residence Affairs (NPRA) department announced that all valid and expired visit visas would be extended for an additional three months – from 21 July 2020 until 21 October 2020.
Those visitors intending to stay in Bahrain beyond 21 October 2020 will be allowed to apply through the eVisa portal to renew their visit visas. With effect from 22 July 2020, holders of valid visas can enter Bahrain without the need for a letter of prior permission. This excludes visas issued on arrival at Bahrain’s ports and airports.
Individuals should enquire about their individual circumstances by visiting the NPRA website.
Visitors can be issued visas for various lengths up to 6 months, depending on their need and at the discretion of the Immigration Officer. You may be asked to provide evidence of onward or return travel. If you enter as a visitor you must not take up employment.
In Bahrain you can apply to renew your visa at the NPRA at the Ministry of Interior. You can apply for residency through the Labour Market Regulatory Authority (LMRA).
Business visitors should bring a letter of invitation.
If you’re currently a resident of Qatar you require a visa to enter the Kingdom of Bahrain. Visas can be applied for online. You should attach a copy of your Qatari residency card to the application. Failure to obtain a visa in advance will result in a refusal of entry into Bahrain.
Passport validity
Your passport should be valid for a minimum period of 6 months from the date of entry into Bahrain.
UK Emergency Travel Documents
UK Emergency Travel Documents (ETDs) are not valid for entry into Bahrain. However, ETDs are accepted for airside transit and exit from Bahrain.
Yellow fever certificate requirements
Check whether you need a yellow fever certificate by visiting the National Travel Health Network and Centre’s TravelHealthPro website.
Exit requirements
You must have legal status in Bahrain when you leave. You may be prevented from leaving Bahrain if you are subject to a travel ban, involved in legal proceedings, have unpaid debt, or are a child subject to a custody dispute. You can be fined if you overstay or fail to extend your legal residency.
Previous travel to Israel
Evidence of a previous visit to Israel like an Israeli entry/exit stamp in your passport doesn’t normally cause any difficulties when entering Bahrain. It is, however, for the Bahraini authorities to determine the right of entry into the country. If you have any concerns, you should contact the Embassy of the Kingdom of Bahrain in London.
