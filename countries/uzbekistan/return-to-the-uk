All commercial flights in and out of the country have been suspended. Any UK nationals who have booked flights, including those already in Uzbekistan, should directly contact airlines or travel agentsto discuss the implications of this measure.
The Uzbek Government has organised two flights from Tashkent to Munich which are due to depart during the week commencing 23 March. A number of British nationals have secured seats. Those who wish to book seats on these flights but have not yet done so should contact the Uzbekistan Airway ticket offices by e-mail directly for any remaining availability, which is extremely limited. Please note that Uzbekistan Airways will not accept bookings over the telephone for these flights. It is unclear if the Uzbekistan Government will arrange additional chartered flights to European destinations at this time. However, if this situation changes, this Travel Advice will be updated and further details will be issued via the British Embassyâ€™s social media channels.
