There are currently very few commercial options available to return to the UK from Costa Rica. We know this is concerning for British people trying to leave Costa Rica. The UK government is working closely with airlines, the Costa Rican authorities and other governments to make sure as many options as possible are available for you to return to the UK.
What to do
Commercial flights with United Airlines to Houston are in operation and details are available through the United Airlines website. There are currently no direct flights from Houston to UK but connections are available to other US airports with suitable onward travel options. This may involve a lengthy/overnight transit. You will require a valid ESTA or visa and to comply with the relevant Entry Requirements.
British Airways are scheduled to resume flights to/from Costa Rica on 27 June 2020.
Until recently it had been possible to leave Costa Rica by land via Nicaragua to catch flights from Managua airport. However, all commercial flights from Managua have ended and Nicaragua has reportedly closed its borders.
If you cannot leave Costa Rica at this time, you should:
follow the advice of local authorities, including local measures to help minimise your risk of exposure to coronavirus.
find accommodation that’s suitable for your needs. The Costa Rican authorities have ordered the closure of all hotels, except those providing accommodation to foreign tourists and some essential workers, until 30 April. For tourist advice, including accommodation and travel, call +506-2299-5827 or via WhatsApp messaging at +506-8628-3247.
keep in regular contact with family and friends at home, so they know you are safe and well.
See more information and advice about staying where you are if you cannot return to the UK.
Resident and non-resident British nationals in Costa Rica who have been unable to leave due to flight cancellations should contact their airline or tour operator urgently to find out what support they can offer. You should review updates provided by the airport authorities on the following website. You should also contact your insurance company regarding coverage.
Future travel options
The UK government is working closely with airlines, the Costa Rican authorities and other governments to make sure as many options as possible are available for you to return to the UK.
You will need to pay for your return travel to the UK. If departure options are available but you cannot afford the travel costs and have exhausted all other options for getting funds, you may be eligible to apply for an emergency loan from the government. This is a last resort option and you would need to repay the loan when you are back in the UK. For more information, you should contact Corporate Travel Management (CTM). CTM are a commercial partner of the FCO and are authorised to administer such loans on behalf of the FCO.
This travel advice will be updated when departure options become available. Sign up for travel advice email alerts and follow the British Embassy on Facebook and Twitter.
