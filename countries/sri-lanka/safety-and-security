Terrorism  
There is a high threat of terrorist attack globally affecting UK interests and British nationals, including from groups and individuals who view the UK and British nationals as targets. Stay aware of your surroundings at all times. 
UK Counter Terrorism Policing has information and advice on staying safe abroad and what to do in the event of a terrorist attack. Find out how to reduce your risk from terrorism while abroad. 
Terrorism in Sri Lanka 
Terrorists are likely to try and carry out attacks in Sri Lanka. 
Attacks could be indiscriminate, including in places visited by foreigners such as hotels, tourist sites and places of worship. Avoid crowded public places, large gatherings and demonstrations, and follow the advice of local authorities. 
On Easter Sunday in April 2019, more than 250 people, including 8 British nationals, were killed in terrorist attacks against 3 churches and 3 hotels in Sri Lanka: in Colombo, Negombo and in Batticaloa. 
Political and economic situation 
Protests and demonstrations can happen anywhere across the island at short notice, and can become violent.  Security authorities may use water cannons and tear gas to control protesters.
Large-scale protests in 2022 resulted in violence and loss of life. Movement around the island was difficult due to restrictions such as curfews and roadblocks.  
Avoid demonstrations, political protests or large gatherings. Monitor local media and sign up to get email notifications when this advice is updated.
Crime 
Protecting yourself and your belongings 
There’s been an increase in incidents of low-level opportunistic crime. Store your belongings as safely as possible to avoid thefts from hotels and guesthouses and minimise the number of personal items you carry with you.  
On the street, criminals may ride past on mopeds or motorbikes and try to snatch your bag. Take care of your passport and money by keeping them in a body-belt. Carry bags on the side of you that is furthest from the road and do not place bags in the front basket of bicycles. 
Violent crimes against foreigners are rare. Gun crime is not uncommon, but usually it is due to a dispute between different criminal groups. 
Using bank cards safely 
Credit card fraud is common. Do not let your card out of your sight during transactions. Only use ATMs attached to banks or major hotels.  
Drink spiking 
Be alert to the possible use of ‘date rape’ and other drugs including GHB.
Buy your own drinks and always keep them in sight to avoid them being spiked. Alcohol and drugs can reduce your vigilance, making you less in control.  Drinks served in bars in Sri Lanka are often stronger than those in the UK.
Sexual assault 
Women continue to report incidents of verbal and physical harassment by men, ranging from sexually suggestive or lewd comments to physical advances and sexual assaults. 
Incidents can happen anywhere, but the majority of reported cases take place in crowded areas including: 
markets 
bus and railway stations, or on buses 
sporting events 
tourist sites 
Take care when travelling alone or in small groups, and consider carrying a personal alarm. 
Laws and cultural differences  
Personal ID 
You must carry an official form of identification at all times. Your passport is an acceptable form of identification.
Alcohol laws and bans 
You could be fined if you ignore instructions not to drink alcohol in certain public areas. 
Alcohol is not usually available on religious holidays. Drinking in public on these days could be culturally insensitive. Check locally for dates of religious holidays of when this would apply. 
Smoking and e-cigarette bans 
You could be fined if you ignore signs not to smoke in certain public areas. 
Detention and prison sentences 
There are severe penalties for drug offences, terrorism and all other serious crimes. You could be held without charge indefinitely. If convicted, you may face a lengthy jail sentence. 
If you’re arrested under Sri Lanka’s Prevention of Terrorism Act, you could be detained without charge awaiting a trial date.  
Using cameras, binoculars and drones in secure areas
Do not fly drones near, use binoculars to look at, or take photographs of: 
military bases 
government buildings 
vehicles used by VIPs  
Check how to register and operate drones with Sri Lanka’s Civil Aviation Authority. 
LGBT+ travellers 
Same-sex relations are illegal, but the FCDO is not aware of any prosecutions. 
Read more advice for LGBT+ travellers. 
Laws on clothing 
Nude or topless sunbathing is not allowed. 
If you enter a Buddhist temple: 
cover your legs and shoulders 
take off shoes and hats 
Religion 
Disrespecting Buddhist images and artefacts, or making offensive remarks about religion, is a serious offence and can lead to arrest. If you have visible tattoos of Buddha, you can been refused entry to Sri Lanka or face deportation. Do not pose for photographs standing in front of a statue of Buddha. 
Wildlife 
Some Sri Lankan animals can be dangerous. If in doubt, follow advice from authorised guides or local authorities. Wild elephants and crocodiles will attack humans on occasion. Though not common in populated areas, venomous insects and snakes are found in many parts of the country. Feral dogs are common and sometimes carry rabies. 
Outdoor activities and adventure tourism  
Swimming safety 
Many beaches in Sri Lanka have dangerous surf or rip tides at certain times of the year. Seek advice from your hotel or tour operator before going in the sea. 
Transport risks  
Road travel  
You need a 1949 International Driving Permit and a Sri Lankan recognition permit to drive a hire vehicle. 
You cannot buy an IDP outside the UK, so get one before you travel.  
When you arrive in Sri Lanka, take your UK driving licence and your IDP along with 2 passport photos to the office of the Automobile Association of Ceylon at 40 Sir Mohomad Macan Markar Mawatha, Colombo 00300, to verify your documents and get a recognition permit. Your hire car company may be able to help with this. 
Tourists can hire cars, tuk tuks and motorbikes in Sri Lanka.  If you hire a vehicle, make sure you:
have a valid driving licence
have appropriate insurance
check that the vehicle is roadworthy before you start your journey
ensure that the company you rent the vehicle from is registered with the Sri Lanka Tourist Board and has a ‘Safe & Secure’ certificate
Road safety 
Some roads, particularly in more remote areas, may be in poor condition. Driving is erratic and there are frequent road accidents, particularly at night. Remain alert for pedestrians and animals on busy roads. Riding a motorbike can be particularly dangerous.
If you have a collision, stay at the site of the accident with your vehicle as long as it is safe to do so. If it is not safe or if you feel threatened, report to the local police station. 
There are still security checkpoints on main roads in parts of the country. Follow the instructions of the police or army officers on duty. Security forces have opened fire on vehicles that have not stopped when asked. Roads around government and military sites in Colombo are often closed for security reasons, such as access for VIP convoys. 
Buses 
Public buses are often driven fast, rarely give way and are often poorly maintained leading to serious bus accidents in recent years. Tourist buses are usually driven more professionally and safely, but standards can vary.
Taxis 
You can book taxis using local and international taxi apps. There is less availability outside tourist areas. Motorised rickshaws (tuk-tuks) are available for hire in towns and villages. Agree a price before you set off or look for one with a working meter.
There are occasional reports of harassment, particularly of women travellers at night. Change to a different tuk-tuk or taxi if you have any concerns about the driver or their standard of driving. 
Rail travel 
When travelling by train, make sure you stay within the train carriage while the train is moving. There have been fatal accidents when visitors have hung out of open doorways or windows of trains. Take care of your personal possessions at all times. There have been incidents of theft and pickpocketing. 
Sea travel 
You need prior permission to enter Sri Lankan waters and the security zones in coastal areas. 
The threat of piracy and armed robbery in the Gulf of Aden and Indian Ocean remains significant. The combined threat assessment of the international Naval Counter Piracy Forces is that all sailing yachts under their own passage should stay out of the designated High Risk Area or face the risk of being hijacked and held hostage for ransom.
See more advice on piracy and armed robbery at sea. 
Extreme weather and natural disasters 
Monsoon 
Monsoon rains can cause flooding in many places in Sri Lanka. Floods can cause widespread displacement of people, injuries and occasional deaths. Heavy rains and landslips can also lead to road closures and affect local transport links. 
Monitor Sri Lanka’s Disaster Management Centre and the Sri Lankan Department of Meteorology for updates and follow local advice. 
Tropical cyclones 
There is a risk of tropical cyclones. Monitor Sri Lanka’s Disaster Management Centre and the World Meteorological Organisation for updates.
