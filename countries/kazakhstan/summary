On 20 March 2019, the capital of Kazakhstan, Astana, was formally renamed Nur-Sultan. However, the previous name is likely to be widely used for some time.
The border between Kazakhstan and Turkmenistan is currently closed to traffic. You’re advised not to try to cross the road border but to seek alternative routes, such as via Uzbekistan, until further notice.
You can travel to most places in Kazakhstan, but travel to any closed area requires advance permission from the Kazakh government. Some military/restricted areas are not clearly marked. Take care when travelling away from normal routes. See Local travel
You can travel to Kazakhstan without a visa, provided your stay does not exceed 30 days (the day you arrive counts as day 1, regardless of arrival time). If you wish to stay longer than 30 days, you’ll need a visa. See Entry requirements
Most visits to Kazakhstan are trouble-free, but crime against foreigners does sometimes occur. See Crime
You must carry your original passport at all times. See Local laws and customs 
Terrorist attacks in Kazakhstan can’t be ruled out. See Terrorism
