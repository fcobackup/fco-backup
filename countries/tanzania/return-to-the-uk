This page gives you guidance on how to return to the UK from Tanzania including information on special flights and support from the UK government.
The Government of Tanzania announced on 18 May that it had lifted the ban on international flights arriving and departing Tanzania. A number of airlines (Emirates, Ethiopian, Fly Dubai, Turkish and Qatar) have indicated that they will resume flights in the coming weeks. You should contact the airlines directly for more information.
UK special flights
There are currently no further special flights organised from Tanzania.
This travel advice will be updated when further departure options become available. Sign up for travel advice email alerts and follow the British High Commission on Twitter and Facebook.
Financial support for a flight
If you have exhausted all other options available to you for getting funds, you may be eligible to apply for an emergency loan from the government to cover the cost of the ticket.
This is a last resort option and you would need to repay the loan when you are back in the UK.
Our partner CTM is also authorised to administer such loans on behalf of the FCO and details will be available when you are asked to pay.
Your journey home: re-entering the UK
When you return, you must follow the rules for entering the UK. You:
need to provide your journey and contact details up to 48 hours before you’re due to arrive in the UK
are not allowed to leave the place you’re staying for the first 14 days you’re in the UK except in very limited situations (known as ‘self-isolating’)
See also the list of people who are exempt from the border rules.
The National Travel Health Network and Centre (NaTHNaC) also provides advice on how to stay safe as you travel by air.
Future options
The UK government is working closely with airlines, the Tanzanian authorities and other governments to make sure options are available for you to return to the UK as soon as possible. A number of airlines (Emirates, Ethiopian, Fly Dubai, Turkish and Qatar) have indicated that they will resume flights in the coming weeks. You should contact the airlines directly for more information.
