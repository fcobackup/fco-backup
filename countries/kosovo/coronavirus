Be prepared for your plans to change
No travel is risk-free during COVID. Countries may further restrict travel or bring in new rules at short notice, for example due to a new COVID-19 variant. Check with your travel company or airline for any transport changes which may delay your journey home.
Plan ahead and make sure you:
can access money
understand what your insurance will cover
can make arrangements to extend your stay and be away for longer than planned
What to do if you test positive for COVID-19
If you test positive for COVID-19, the Kosovan government requires you to self-isolate for 10 days, or 7 following two negative tests. You are responsible for your own accommodation. Under-18s will also be expected to self-isolate. If you need assistance during your period of self-isolation, the Kosovan government advises that you should contact municipal authorities.
