Significant industrial action is continuing across France. This is primarily affecting transport and public services, with ongoing cancellations and severe delays to train, metro, bus and tram services. Further disruption and cancellations of Eurostar services between London St Pancras and Paris Gare du Nord have also been announced. Other international rail services such as those to the Netherlands, Belgium, Italy and Germany may also be affected. Industrial action at ports may cause delays and cancellations to some cross-Channel ferry services. Industrial action by hauliers on some major roads may also cause delays or blockages. Strike action by Air France workers and air traffic controllers may also cause disruption to air travel.
If you’re due to travel, check the website of your chosen operator for the latest information before you set off. In the event of any disruption to Channel crossings, information about alternative routes and operators is available via this interactive map.
As part of the ongoing industrial action, wider demonstrations are planned across France. Avoid demonstrations wherever possible and follow the advice of the local authorities.
There is a general threat from terrorism. There may be increased security in place over the festive period, including at Christmas markets and other major events that might attract large crowds. You should remain vigilant and follow the advice of local authorities.
Terrorists are very likely to try to carry out attacks in France. Due to ongoing threats to France by Islamist terrorist groups, and recent French military intervention against Daesh (formerly referred to as ISIL), the French government has warned the public to be especially vigilant and has reinforced its security measures. Check the French government’s advice about what to do if a terrorist attack occurs. See Terrorism
There remain some migrants around Calais, who may seek to enter the UK illegally. There have been instances of migrants seeking to slow down traffic on approach roads to ports, including by placing obstacles on the Calais Port approach road. If this happens you should keep moving where it’s safe to do so, or stop and call 112 if isn’t safe to proceed (keeping car doors locked).
All vehicles, including motorbikes, driving in central Paris, Lyon and Grenoble now need to display a special ‘pollution sticker’. See Road travel
