Health
Health screening
British nationals resident in the UK may travel to Lithuania. The Lithuanian Government recommends that all arrivals from the UK self-isolate for 14 days. While in isolation, you should:
register your arrival with the Lithuanian Ministry of Health within 24 hours of arrival in Lithuania
not travel beyond a 1km radius of your place of self-isolation, without medical permission. It is recommended that you wear a face mask when leaving your place of isolation
not attend public gatherings, shops or public services
not have guests/visitors
organise for essential provisions to be delivered by municipal authorities, friends, family or delivery services
consult with a GP by phone/email to arrange extensions to prescriptions

Finance
There is a range of financial support from the government that you can access while you are unable to return due to coronavirus restrictions.
If you’re in Lithuania, and have exhausted all other options to cover essential living costs while you wait to return home, you could apply for an emergency loan for your living costs from the UK government. You can only apply if you normally live in the UK and you cannot return home. This last-resort option is for those most in need, and you would need to repay the loan when you are back in the UK. Apply for an emergency loan.
