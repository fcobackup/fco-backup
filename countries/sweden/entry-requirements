Entry rules in response to coronavirus (COVID-19)
Entry to Sweden
In light of the new variant of COVID-19 found in the UK, the Swedish government has imposed restrictions on travel from the UK to Sweden.
A temporary entry ban applies to all passengers arriving from the UK, with the exception of Swedish citizens. The ban comes into force at 2300 (UK time) on 21 December 2020 and will apply for one month.
With effect from 1500 (UK time) on 21 December, the Swedish government has suspended all passenger flights from the UK to Sweden for 48 hours. You should contact your travel provider for more information.
The Swedish government recommends that all passengers who arrived in Sweden from the UK since 12 December should self-isolate for seven days. They should also take a PCR test on the day of arrival and after five days. More information is available from the Swedish Public Health Agency.
Sweden is also restricting entry from Denmark from 2300 (UK time) on 21 December.
Restrictions by neighbouring countries
Countries neighbouring Sweden (Denmark, Norway and Finland) have introduced some restrictions. Check country-specific FCDO Travel Advice for details.
Regular entry requirements
Visas
The rules for travelling or working in Europe change from 1 January 2021:
you will be able to travel to countries in the Schengen area for up to 90 days in any 180-day period without a visa as a tourist, to visit family or friends, to attend business meetings, cultural or sports events, or for short-term studies or training.
if you are travelling to Sweden and other Schengen countries without a visa, make sure your whole visit is within the limit. Visits to Schengen countries within the previous 180 days before you travel would count towards the 90-day limit
to stay for longer, to work or study, for business travel or for other reasons, you will need to meet the entry requirements set out by Sweden. This could mean applying for a visa and/or work permit. You should check with the Swedish Embassy what type of visa and/or work permit, if any, you will need
if you are in Sweden with a visa or permit, your stay will not count towards the 90-day limit
The 90-day limit for visa-free travel begins on 1 January 2021. Any days you stay in Sweden or other Schengen countries before 1 January 2021 will not count towards the 90-day limit.
At border control for Sweden, you may need to:
show a return or onward ticket
show you have enough money for your stay, and
use separate lanes from EU, EEA and Swiss citizens when queueing
Your passport may be stamped on entry and exit.
Passport validity
Your passport should be valid for the proposed duration of your stay.
Check your passport is valid for travel before you book your trip. You will need to renew your passport before travelling if you do not have enough time left on your passport.
UK Emergency Travel Documents
UK Emergency Travel Documents (ETDs) are accepted for entry, airside transit and exit from Sweden.
