Terrorists are likely to try to carry out attacks in China.
UK Counter Terrorism Policing has information and advice on staying safe abroad and what to do in the event of a terrorist attack. Find out more about the global threat from terrorism.
Although foreigners haven’t been specifically targeted, attacks may occur in places visited by foreigners. Since early 2014, a number of explosions and knife attacks have occurred in public places, including in busy railway stations, resulting in injuries and fatalities. You should take particular care during national holidays or when transiting public transport hubs, and always follow the advice of the local authorities.
There have been no recent attacks in the main tourist areas. The risk is higher in the Xinjiang Uyghur Autonomous region. According to the Chinese government, most attacks are carried out by Uyghur separatists with possible links to the East Turkestan Islamic Movement (ETIM). You should take particular care and remain vigilant when travelling to or within Xinjiang.
There’s a heightened threat of terrorist attack globally against UK interests and British nationals, from groups or individuals motivated by the conflict in Iraq and Syria. You should be vigilant at this time.
