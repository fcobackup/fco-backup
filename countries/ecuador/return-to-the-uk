Future travel options
The Government has announced that a limited number of domestic and international flights will begin operating from 1 June.
You will need to pay for your return travel to the UK. If departure options are available but you cannot afford the travel costs and have exhausted all other options for getting funds, you may be eligible to apply for an emergency loan from the government. This is a last resort option and you would need to repay the loan when you are back in the UK. For more information, contact Corporate Travel Management (CTM). CTM are a commercial partner of the FCO and are authorised to administer such loans on behalf of the FCO.
If you cannot leave Ecuador at this time, see advice on staying in Ecuador during coronavirus.
Departing the Galapagos
If you are in the Galapagos, the authorities have issued a Whatsapp group invitation for people to get information on flight opportunities to leave the islands, which can be accessed here and here. The Galapagos Authorities are aware that the groups have a limited capacity, so please keep trying.
If you have any queries regarding travel back to mainland Ecuador, you can contact the Galapagos authorities via email at galapagosresponder@gmail.com.
Financial support for a flight
If you have exhausted all other options available to you for getting funds, you may be eligible to apply for an emergency loan from the government to cover the cost of the ticket.
You would need to repay the loan when you are back in the UK.
Our partner CTM is also authorised to administer such loans on behalf of the FCO and details will be available when you are asked to pay.
Travelling to the airport
When travelling to the airport, outside of curfew hours, including travel between provinces, you need a safe passage document. Email BritishEmbassy.Quito@fco.gov.uk to get one. A consular officer will respond as quickly as possible.
It is very important that you carry documents that justify your movement, including a confirmed booking, your passport and the safe passage document referred to above. A safe passage document is required for each traveller.
Once you have filled out the form, you will need to send a copy or photo via email to the Ministry of Foreign Affairs at dcp@cancilleria.gob.ec so they can confirm validity if you are stopped.
Drivers and taxis need to arrange their own safe passage document through this updated website.
Your journey home: re-entering the UK
The Ecuadorean authorities require all passengers and crew members to wear face masks to enter airports and to board a plane, and throughout the flight at all times. Upon arrival at the airport, you should expect to pass a temperature check to enter. People that present a body temperature above 38°c will not be allowed in.
When you return, you must follow the rules for entering the UK. You:
need to provide your journey and contact details up to 48 hours before you’re due to arrive in the UK
are not allowed to leave the place you’re staying for the first 14 days you’re in the UK except in very limited situations (known as ‘self-isolating’)
See also the list of people who are exempt from the border rules.
The National Travel Health Network and Centre (NaTHNaC) also provides advice on how to stay safe as you travel by air.
