The Foreign and Commonwealth Office (FCO) advise against all travel to the following parts of Burkina Faso: all areas of the country north of the town of Boulsa; areas within 40km of the western border with Mali; the W National Park in the south-east bordering Niger and Benin.
The FCO advise against all but essential travel to the rest of Burkina Faso, including the capital Ouagadougou.
The armed attacks which took place on the morning of 2 March against the French Embassy and the National Army Headquarters in central Ouagadougou are now under control and security operations are over. Provisional figures from the government are 8 attackers and 8 soldiers killed and over 80 people injured. These figures are likely to rise. You should continue to exercise caution, monitor local media for updates and follow the advice of the local authorities.
Terrorists are very likely to try to carry out attacks in Burkina Faso, including kidnaps. You should exercise particular caution around religious holidays. In August 2017, gunmen attacked the Aziz Istanbul restaurant in Ouagadougou. In January 2016, there was a terrorist attack against a hotel and café in central Ouagadougou. Further attacks are possible. See Terrorism
You should take extra care and follow the instructions of the security authorities. There is a risk that terrorist groups may cross the border from Mali and the northern border with Niger into Burkina Faso to carry out kidnap attacks. In January 2016, 2 western nationals were abducted in the northern town of Djibo near the border with Mali, 1 of whom has since been released. There have also been recent attacks on police and military personnel close to the borders with Mali, Niger and Cote d’Ivoire which have been linked to terrorist activity. See Terrorism
