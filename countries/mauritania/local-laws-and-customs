Local laws reflect the fact that Mauritania is an Islamic country. You should respect local traditions, customs, laws and religions at all times and be aware of your actions to ensure that they do not offend other cultures or religious beliefs, especially during the holy month of Ramadan or if you intend to visit religious areas. See Travelling during Ramadan.
There have been incidences of visitors receiving large fines at the airport and having their passports confiscated for trying to import pork products such as chorizo, ham and bacon.
You should dress modestly. Sale and consumption of alcohol is against the law. Police sometimes object to photography without prior permission.
Carry ID, especially when travelling outside Nouakchott (where you may encounter many police road checks). You should comply promptly with directions from the police and other Mauritanian security forces.
Homosexuality is a punishable offence in Mauritania. See our information and advice page for the LGBT community before you travel.
Drugs laws are severe. Those found in possession of any illegal drug may receive a prison sentence.
