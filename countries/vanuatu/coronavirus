Coronavirus travel health
On 5 March 2022, Vanuatu confirmed a first case of community transmission of COVID-19. Community cases have since been recorded widely across Vanuatu provinces. As of 16 June 2022, all islands and provinces have moved to Recovery Level 1. As a result, the nationwide Public Health Emergency has been lifted.

Be prepared for your plans to change
No travel is risk-free during COVID-19. Countries may further restrict travel or bring in new rules at short notice, for example due to a new COVID-19 variant. Check with your travel company or airline for any transport changes which may delay your journey home.
If you test positive for COVID-19, you may need to stay where you are until you test negative. You may also need to seek treatment there.
Plan ahead and make sure you:
can access money
understand what your insurance will cover
can make arrangements to extend your stay and be away for longer than planned
