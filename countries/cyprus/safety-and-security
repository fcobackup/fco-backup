Political situation
The Republic of Cyprus is a full member of the EU, but the country remains divided by the Green Line. The self-declared ‘Turkish Republic of Northern Cyprus’ is not recognised by the British government.
The authorities in north Cyprus do not share information regarding British Nationals in distress with the British High Commission, or the families affected. Even when the High Commission is aware of a British National in distress, the authorities in the north will not share information about their location, wellbeing or treatment. British nationals travelling to the north of Cyprus are more vulnerable and at greater risk.
Crime
Crime against tourists is not common, but you should keep passports, money and other valuables safe. Room safes and hotel safety deposit boxes have been targeted previously.
Personal attacks, including sexual assaults, are infrequent but they do occur. Be alert to the possible use of ‘date rape’ and other drugs including ‘GHB’ and liquid ecstasy. Buy your own drinks and keep sight of them at all times to make sure they are not spiked. Female travellers should be particularly watchful. If you drink, know your limit; drinks served in bars are often stronger than those in the UK. Avoid splitting up from your friends, and don’t go off with people you don’t know.
Local travel
The operations of crossing points are affected by coronavirus (COVID-19) control measures. See Coronavirus.
Even when the crossing points are operating under normal conditions, British and other foreign nationals who have entered Cyprus through the north (such as via Ercan airport) are considered by the Government of the Republic of Cyprus to have entered Cyprus through an illegal port of entry. The Republic of Cyprus does not recognise the self-declared ‘Turkish Republic of Northern Cyprus’ in the north of Cyprus, nor residence permits issued by the administration there. The Government of the Republic of Cyprus may fine you for illegal entry if you cross into the south, or refuse you entry into or exit from the Republic, or prevent crossing at the boundary with the north.
The maximum period of visa-free stay in the Republic of Cyprus for all non-resident UK Nationals is 90 days within a 180-day period. The Republic of Cyprus authorities count time spent in the north of Cyprus towards the 90 day visa-free total. You should not exceed the maximum stay allowed on the island. If you do overstay, you should expect difficulties at the airport on exit. Furthermore, if you subsequently return to Cyprus you could face further difficulties, including being refused entry and/or being placed on a stop list for a period of between 3 to 5 years. The British High Commission cannot provide assistance in such cases. Many cars hired in the south are not insured for use in the north. Check with your insurance company - you will not be allowed through a crossing without the correct insurance documents. At some of the crossing points it is possible to buy car insurance for the north. There are controls on the quantities and types of goods that can be bought in the north and brought into the south, including from the bicommunal village of Pyla in the buffer zone. Goods, including cigarettes, may be confiscated at the checkpoint and you may be fined. The Republic of Cyprus currently imposes a limit of 40 cigarettes per person on crossing the Green Line from the north of Cyprus.
Anyone with documents relating to the purchase of property in the north of Cyprus when crossing the Green Line could face criminal proceedings.
Road travel
If you are planning to drive in Cyprus, see information on Driving Abroad.
Licences and documents
Short-term visitors and tourists can drive using a UK driving licence.
If you’re living in Cyprus, check the Living in Guide for information on requirements for residents.
Driving a British car abroad
You may need a UK sticker to drive your car outside the UK. From 28 September 2021 UK stickers have replaced GB stickers. Check the GOV.UK Displaying number plates website for more information on what to do if you are driving outside the UK.
Driving standards
Driving standards are poor. In 2019 there were 52 road deaths in the Cyprus (source: Department for Transport). This equates to 5.9 road deaths per 100,000 of population and compares to the UK average of 2.6 road deaths per 100,000 of population in 2019.
Driving regulations
Cypriot driving regulations are similar to those in the UK and driving is on the left.
You may be fined if you drive without a seat belt or ride a motorbike without a crash helmet. Heavy fines also apply if you use a mobile telephone or are under the influence of alcohol while driving. When hiring a vehicle, check that it is roadworthy and that you have appropriate insurance cover and safety equipment. 
See the European Commission, AA and RAC guides on driving in Cyprus.
Road Safety
Make sure any vehicle you hire is in good condition and check that you’re insured. When renting mopeds or quad bikes, insurance sold by the hire company usually only provides third party insurance, which only covers the cost of damage to another vehicle. Any damage sustained to the rental vehicle in many cases may need to be paid for by you, or you may face arrest if you do not pay and the hire company decide to press charges.
Rental companies often ask for your passport as a deposit. That is illegal. You should never offer your passport as collateral.
Quad biking
Quad biking is considered an extreme sport and carries the risk of serious injury or death. Specific travel insurance to cover quad bike rental is essential to avoid you having to pay the costs of private health care and/or repatriation to the UK. Always take care to read the details of your insurance cover before you travel on holiday, paying particular attention to the small print and exclusions on your insurance policy.
Swimming
Bathing is generally safe, but you should be aware of strong seas and undertows. Always comply with warning signs and swim only from approved beaches.
Adventure sports
If you intend take part in any adventure sports, water sports or diving, make sure you have the right travel insurance. Only use properly licensed and insured operators and satisfy yourself that adequate safety precautions are in place. Don’t hand over your passport as a guarantee against the return of equipment.
Political situation
The Republic of Cyprus is a full member of the EU, but the country remains divided by the Green Line. The self-declared ‘Turkish Republic of Northern Cyprus’ is not recognised by the British government.
The authorities in north Cyprus do not routinely share information regarding British Nationals in distress with the British High Commission, and this impedes our ability to respond quickly in order to support vulnerable British nationals there.
Child Abduction – north Cyprus
The authorities in north Cyprus do not act on British instruments of Court and will not share information with the British High Commission on minors who are subject to UK court orders. This means we are unable to ensure that these minors are properly safeguarded.
