Be prepared for your plans to change
Countries may further restrict travel or bring in new rules at short notice, for example due to a new COVID-19 variant. Check with your travel company or airline for any transport changes which may delay your journey home.
If you test positive for COVID-19, you may need to stay where you are until you test negative. You may also need to seek treatment there. If you are staying in hotel accommodation and you test positive you may be moved to a government supervised quarantine facility (e.g. an approved hotel), with guidance and assistance from the Ministry of Health.
Plan ahead and make sure you:
can access money
