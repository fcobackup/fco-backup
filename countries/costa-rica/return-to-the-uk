What to do
There is a French repatriation flight leaving San Jose for Paris on Wednesday 15 April. To reserve a seat you should contact the British Embassy urgently at Consular.CostaRica@fco.gov.uk. You will be asked to show proof of onward travel to your final destination before you board this flight.
British Airways have ceased operations to/from Costa Rica and their last flight scheduled for Monday 30 March was cancelled. British Airways are scheduled to resume flights to/from Costa Rica on 27 June 2020.
Until recently it had been possible to leave Costa Rica by land via Nicaragua to catch flights from Managua airport. However, all commercial flights from Managua have ended. There have also been reports of intermittent border closures. British nationals entering Nicaragua would be required to show a Health Certificate to the Nicaraguan border authorities, certifying that they have been tested and found negative for COVID-19.
If you cannot leave Costa Rica at this time, you should:
follow the advice of local authorities, including local measures to help minimise your risk of exposure to coronavirus.
