Entry rules in response to coronavirus (COVID-19)
Entry to Angola
Angola’s borders remain closed. Entry to Angola is prohibited except for Angolan nationals and foreign nationals resident in Angola. Exceptions are made for medical evacuations, for a small number of humanitarian flights and for the entry and exit of essential workers.
Advance passenger information requirement
All passengers are required to complete an advance passenger information form 72 hours before entry to Angola.
Testing prior to arrival and departure
All air passengers arriving and departing in Angola are required to have taken a coronavirus PCR test in the 72 hours prior to their arrival and departure from Angola. You should carry proof of your negative test result with you. You should speak to your airline if in doubt.
You should not use the NHS testing service to get a test in order to facilitate your travel to another country. You should arrange to take a private test.
Quarantine requirements
All air passengers arriving in Angola will need to undertake compulsory quarantine for at least 7 days. Returning residents can quarantine in their own homes. Non-resident essential workers have to quarantine in a government or government-approved facility. The Angolan authorities will release you from quarantine once you have tested negative for coronavirus. You must spend at least 7 days in quarantine before being tested.
Regular entry requirements
Visas
You must apply for a valid visa and/or work permit before travelling to Angola, otherwise you will be detained at the airport and then deported. The process can take a long time. You should check all entry requirements with the Angolan Embassy in London well in advance.
The Angolan government has extended the validity of existing visas for all foreign nationals in-country to 31 December 2020.
If you’re applying for a tourist visa, you can submit documentation online in advance of travel and be granted a pre-approval within 72 hours. This allows you to receive your physical visa on entry into Angola, subject to a fee equivalent to USD $120, paid in cash, Visa or MasterCard. Further information can be found on the online application portal.
You’ll be fined 15,000 Kwanzas (Angolan currency) per day if you overstay your visa. You won’t be allowed to leave the country until your fine has been paid. Legal action will be taken against you if you don’t pay your fine. This may include being detained, deported or not being allowed to re-enter Angola.
Fines are in place for a wide range of visa offences including working, studying or residing without the correct visa, changing employment without notifying the authorities, employing staff with incorrect visas, failing to renew residence cards, or changing address without notifying the authorities.
Passport validity
Your passport should be valid for a minimum period of 6 months from the date of entry into Angola.
UK Emergency Travel Documents
UK emergency travel documents are not valid for entry or transit into the Republic of Angola.
