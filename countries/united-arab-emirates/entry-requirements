Read what you can and cannot do

The information on this page covers the most common types of travel and reflects the UK government’s understanding of the rules currently in place. Unless otherwise stated, this information is for travellers using a full ‘British Citizen’ passport.
The authorities in the country or territory you’re travelling to are responsible for setting and enforcing the rules for entry. If you’re unclear about any aspect of the entry requirements, or you need further reassurance, you’ll need to contact the embassy, high commission or consulate of the country or territory you’re travelling to.
You should also consider checking with your transport provider or travel company to make sure your passport and other travel documents meet their requirements.
Visas
On 2 April the UAE Government announced its decision to renew for a further two weeks the suspension of entry of all UAE residents who are currently abroad and this is still in place for most UAE residents. See Coronavirus for further information about how British residents can apply to return to the UAE.
The UAE Ministry of Foreign Affairs and International Cooperation (MOFAIC) has provided a hotline for holders of valid UAE Residence visas who wish to return to the UAE: +971 (0)9 208 3344.
If you are transiting through a UAE airport to another destination, check with your carrier before travelling.
On 13 April, the Federal Authority for Identity and Citizenship announced that visas and entry permits that expired after 1 March 2020 are now valid until the end of December 2020. This includes visit visas, residency visas and ID cards. For residents it applies to those both inside and outside the UAE. For visitors it applies only to those who are still in the UAE.
If you have any questions on the validity or expiry of your visa, contact UAE Immigration directly. If you’re living outside the UAE, contact the nearest UAE Embassy for advice.
Living and working in the UAE
If you have entered Dubai on a visit visa and you wish to work then you should get a probationary work permit, valid for up to 3 months, from the Ministry of Labour. If you don’t get this permit and are caught working while on a visit visa, then you risk being jailed or fined and deported.
For further information, including on how to stay in the UAE for longer than 60 days, visit the websites of the UAE Consulate in London, the Naturalisation and Residency Department – Dubai or the UAE Federal E-Government Portal.
If you apply for a residence visa, you will have to take a blood test. Those testing positive for HIV or hepatitis are detained and then deported. There is no appeal process.  
UAE employers may ask foreign employees to deposit their passports with the company as part of the terms and conditions of employment. While this is not an unusual practice, it is illegal under UAE labour law.
You should cancel your work visa before leaving the country permanently. If you don’t do this, you risk being reported as an absconder and could be arrested if you return to the UAE, even if you are in transit to another country. Failure to repay debts or resolve any outstanding cases against you may also result in your arrest on return or transit through the UAE.
If you have any doubt about your status before returning to the country seek advice from a local lawyer.
On 13 April, the Federal Authority for Identity and Citizenship announced that visas and entry permits that expired after 1 March 2020 are now valid until the end of December 2020. This includes visit visas, residency visas and ID cards. For residents it applies to those both inside and outside the UAE. For visitors it applies only to those who are still in the UAE.
On 5 April the Cabinet approved a decision exempting holders of expired residence visas from fines until the end of this calendar year. Please see UAE official sources for full details or contact the Federal Authority of Identity and Citizenship (ICA) on 600 522222.
Passport validity
Your passport should be valid for a minimum period of 6 months from the date of entry into the UAE. If you hold a residence permit, your passport must be valid for at least 3 months in order to travel into the country.
If you’re transiting the UAE (and not passing through Immigration) your passport only needs to have a minimum of 3 months validity from the date of transit.
Medication
If you’re planning to travel with any prescribed or over the counter medicines for personal use, you’ll need to meet the UAE’s specific requirements for your medicine to be allowed into the country.
If you’re entering the country with medication that the UAE classes as narcotic, psychotropic, controlled or semi-controlled, approval is needed from the UAE authorities. A list of medicines where this rule applies, allowed quantities and documents to present can be found on the UAE Ministry of Health website.
Approval can be requested in advance or on arrival. To gain approval prior to travelling, you can apply online using the electronic application form and accompanying user guide on the UAE Ministry of Health website. The UAE authorities advise that applications are normally processed within 5 working days. If you arrive in the UAE without prior approval, you will be asked to present the documents cited on the list above. It is not guaranteed that you will receive approval.
If you arrive in the UAE without prior approval or the required documentation, the medication will not be allowed into the UAE and you may be prosecuted under UAE law. If you need more information on controlled medicines or the process for obtaining permission, you should contact the UAE Ministry of Health by emailing info@moh.gov.ae or calling +971 800 11111.
If you’re travelling in transit through a UAE airport and do not intend on entering the country, or are entering the country with other types of medicine not listed in the above, you’re not required to go through this approval process.
In all cases, there are limits on the amount of medication that can be brought into the country legally. The Ministry of Health advise that you can bring up to 3 months’ supply of medication as a visitor, reduced to one month’s supply if the medication is included in the list requiring approval.
Previous travel to Israel
UAE immigration authorities have advised that British nationals with valid or expired Israeli visas or stamps in their passports should not face any difficulties entering the UAE as long as they don’t intend to work. If you do intend to work, further checks may be required and there is a risk that entry may be refused.
British-Israeli dual nationals may be refused entry to the UAE. If you have any concerns or further queries, contact the Embassy of the United Arab Emirates in London.
Exit requirements
Visitors must have legal status in the UAE when they depart. If you are subject to a travel ban, involved in legal proceedings, have unpaid debt or are a child subject to a custody dispute, you may be prevented from leaving the country.
Thermal scanning is in operation at airports. Departing passengers may be subject to testing, quarantine and medical treatment in the UAE.
UK Emergency Travel Documents
UK Emergency Travel Documents are accepted for entry, airside transit and exit from the United Arab Emirates.
All ETDs for entry are required to have at least 6 months validity from the date of entry into the UAE. If you’re planning to enter the UAE using a UK ETD, you should contact the nearest UAE Embassy or Consulate before you travel to seek advice about whether a visa is required. If you’re requesting a two-way ETD from the UAE, you must check with UAE immigration on the documents you would need to present in order to return.
