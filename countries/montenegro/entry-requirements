The information on this page covers the most common types of travel and reflects the UK government’s understanding of the rules currently in place. Unless otherwise stated, this information is for travellers using a full ‘British Citizen’ passport.
The authorities in the country or territory you’re travelling to are responsible for setting and enforcing the rules for entry. If you’re unclear about any aspect of the entry requirements, or you need further reassurance, you’ll need to contact the embassy, high commission or consulate of the country or territory you’re travelling to.
You should also consider checking with your transport provider or travel company to make sure your passport and other travel documents meet their requirements.
Under Montenegrin law you must carry a valid form of ID with you at all times, for example a driving licence, passport or equivalent, otherwise you may be fined. Keep a photocopy of your passport in a safe place.
Visas
You can enter Montenegro for short-term stays of up to 90 days without a visa. The Montenegrin law considers “stays of 90 days” as 90 days in total in a 180-day period, counted from the first entry date.
On entering Montenegro, make sure the border police put an entry stamp in your passport. This helps avoid problems related to verifying the length of your stay in the country.
If you’re in the UK and you would like to consult if and what type of Montenegrin visa you need before you travel, contact the Montenegrin Embassy in London.
If you wish to extend your stay once in Montenegro, you will need to apply for a visa or a temporary residence permit from the Montenegrin Ministry of Interior Affairs no later than one week before the 90-day period expires.
Passport validity
Your passport should be undamaged and in accordance with local law should be issued in the last 10 years and valid for at least 3 months after your planned date of departure from Montenegro.
If you hold dual citizenship, the Montenegrin authorities will consider you a citizen of the issuing state of the passport with which you entered Montenegro.
Border crossings
Only enter Montenegro through recognised border crossings.
If you are planning a mountaineering tour which involves crossing borders other than at an official border crossing point, contact the National Tourist Organisation for advice.
There may be additional delays on roads approaching the border crossings between Montenegro and Croatia as Croatia implements an EU decision on enhanced border controls which involves additional checks.
Registration
By law you must register with the local police or tourism organisation in the town/city where you’re staying within 24 hours of your arrival in Montenegro, unless you’re staying in a hotel or other commercial accommodation where you’ll be registered automatically on checking in.
If you don’t register you may be fined, detained or face a court appearance.
Customs requirements
The Montenegro Customs Administration advises travellers of the main regulations regarding import of food, medicines, flora and fauna species, animals, tobacco and alcoholic beverages and firearms, in their downloadable guide.
Although there is no limit to the amount of money you can bring into Montenegro, you should declare sums of money in excess of €10,000 (including travellers’ cheques or equivalent in other currencies). To take more than €10,000 out of the country you will need to provide proof that you brought the money in. Customs Officers at all border points issue declaration forms. On departure, you will need to return a certified copy of this declaration to customs. For sums of money in excess of €15,000 you should also have obtained a document which states the origin of the funds. If you fail to comply with these rules, your money may be confiscated.
To avoid customs charges, declare items of value like expensive jewellery, photographic and computer equipment.
UK Emergency Travel Documents
UK Emergency Travel Documents are accepted by Montenegrin authorities for entry, airside transit and exit from Montenegro and are valid forms of identity documents in Montenegro.
