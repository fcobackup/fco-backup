At least 8 weeks before your trip, check the latest country-specific health advice from the National Travel Health Network and Centre (NaTHNaC) on the TravelHealthPro website. Each country-specific page has information on vaccine recommendations, any current health risks or outbreaks, and factsheets with information on staying healthy abroad. Guidance is also available from NHS (Scotland) on the FitForTravel website.
General information on travel vaccinations and a travel health checklist are available on the NHS website. You may then wish to contact your health adviser or pharmacy for advice on other preventive measures and managing any pre-existing medical conditions while you’re abroad.
Make sure you have the recommended vaccinations before travelling to Sudan. There is a particular risk to public health in conflict affected areas where immunisation coverage is poor.
The legal status and regulation of some medicines prescribed or purchased in the UK can be different in other countries. If you’re travelling with prescription or over-the-counter medicine, read this guidance from NaTHNaC on best practice when travelling with medicines. For further information on the legal status of a specific medicine, you’ll need to contact the embassy, high commission or consulate of the country or territory you’re travelling to.
The government of Sudan has declared an outbreak of Chikungunya in the east of Sudan (especially Red Sea and Kassala). There have also been reports of cases in other parts of Sudan. Further information can be found on the TravelHealthPro website. There are also many cases of malaria in Darfur. Following a heavy rainy season, many parts of the country are experiencing an increased population of mosquitoes and other disease vectors, including insects and contaminated drinking water. For further information see the TravelHealthPro advice.
As a general rule, GP facilities in Khartoum are adequate but the hospitals are not suitable for more serious medical problems. Make sure you have adequate travel health insurance and accessible funds to cover the cost of any medical treatment abroad, medical evacuation and repatriation.
