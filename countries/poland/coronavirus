Public spaces and services
Masks are no longer compulsory in open public spaces if you are able to maintain 1.5 metre distance from others. Children under 4 are not required to wear masks. When outside, you should keep a 1.5 metre distance from others, unless you are a parent with a child under 13 or the carer of a disabled person.
You must wear a mask at all times in enclosed spaces, on public transport, in taxis or in an open space where you are unable to maintain a 1.5 meter distance. Police and sanitary inspectors are entitled to issue you with an on-the-spot fine (approximately PLN500/£100) if you are found not to be wearing a mask when you should. Further prosecution could result in a fine of up to PLN 30,000 (£6,000) for failing to follow sanitary rules.
There are no longer restrictions on the number of people attending religious services and funerals. You are allowed to organise wedding receptions and other family celebrations for up to 150 people. Outdoor concerts and events are allowed with limits on numbers attending. But in areas with high infection rates, the authorities may set limits that are much lower and in some cases, events may be cancelled at short notice.
Public transport is operating with reduced capacity seating to maintain appropriate distance between passengers. You can still use taxis.
Some sporting facilities are open with limits on visitor numbers. If you plan to visit a cultural or sports venue we recommend first consulting their website for information about opening. Many have information in English as well as Polish. National Forests, parks and beaches are open.
There are no limits on customer numbers in shops but you must wear a mask and use the hand sanitiser provided for customers.
Restaurants and pubs are permitted to open but you must only take off your mask when seated at the table. Hairdressers may also open by appointment only. Most museums, libraries and cultural venues are open. Cinemas, theatres and concert halls are open with capacity limited to 50%. Swimming pools, gyms, indoor play centres and theme parks, saunas, tanning salons, massage salons and tattoo parlours are also open, with strict hygiene rules in place.
Since 27 August the city of Krakow has been placed under stricter sanitary rules due to an increase in Covid cases. The tighter restrictions in place include:
Congress and fair organisers reducing numbers of participants based on the size of the venue;
Weddings and other family gatherings limited to 100 guests (as opposed to 150);
Sporting events, theatres, cinemas and other cultural events required to reduce spectators to 25% (from the national 50%).
The situation in Krakow will be monitored by Polish authorities and could change at short notice. If you have tickets for any event that may be affected by smaller permitted audience numbers check with event organisers for further information.
Restaurants, pubs, shops, hotels and museums are open and operating according to the national sanitary rules listed
Other areas of Poland with high infection rates now have stricter measures in place, resulting in further reductions in numbers of people permitted to enter a venue, or in some cases complete closure. For updates on areas with stricter measures in place which are labelled red and amber zones see the Polish Ministry for Health’s Twitter pages (in Polish – look for the colour coded map).
The above national measures may be extended further, in scope and time, at short notice. In areas with high infection rates, the authorities may set local restrictions at short notice resulting in further reductions in numbers of people permitted to enter a venue, or in some cases complete closure.
Road and air travel

Hotels and short term accommodation establishments are open subject to strict sanitary rules.
