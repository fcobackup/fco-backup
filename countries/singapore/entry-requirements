The information on this page covers the most common types of travel and reflects the UK government’s understanding of the rules currently in place. Unless otherwise stated, this information is for travellers using a full ‘British Citizen’ passport.
The authorities in the country or territory you’re travelling to are responsible for setting and enforcing the rules for entry. If you’re unclear about any aspect of the entry requirements, or you need further reassurance, you’ll need to contact the embassy, high commission or consulate of the country or territory you’re travelling to.
You should also consider checking with your transport provider or travel company to make sure your passport and other travel documents meet their requirements.
Restrictions in response to coronavirus
If you need to visit Singapore in extenuating circumstances, you should make a request to the Singapore government by submitting a Form 14 to the Immigration and Checkpoints Authority and wait for a response before attempting to travel.
All long-term pass holders (those who hold long-term visit passes or student passes, or in-principle approval for a long-term pass) need approval before entering or returning to Singapore. Permission requests must be made to Singapore’s Immigration and Checkpoints Authority, by email, to ICA_nCoV_request@ica.gov.sg.
Work pass holders and Permanent Residents
All work pass holders must comply with all Singapore government regulations or face their passes being revoked and/or fines/jail.
The Singapore Ministry of Manpower will only allow work pass holders and/or their dependents to enter Singapore if they have obtained prior approval of the Ministry. Employers of work pass holders are required to obtain approval from the Ministry before pass holders travel to Singapore. Approval may be subject to conditions such as obtaining a doctor’s certificate before flying.
Any work pass holders or dependents who are granted permission to enter Singapore will be issued with a 14-day Stay at Home Notice (SHN). Further details can be found on the Ministry of Manpower website. Work pass holders will be refused entry or risk deportation if they do not comply with this requirement. They also risk having their work pass revoked.
Self-isolation requirements
Everyone granted permission to enter Singapore will be issued with a 14-day Stay at Home Notice (SHN) which must be served at a government designated hotel and costs $2,000 (unless you have spent 14 days or more before arrival in Australia, Brunei, Mainland China, Hong Kong, Japan, Macau, New Zealand, South Korea, Taiwan or Vietnam. If you meet this criteria, you will be permitted to carry out 14 days quarantine at your place of residence in Singapore, if you have one). In addition to quarantine fees, all arrivals must pay for a Covid-19 test which will be conducted before the 14 day quarantine period ends. Whilst you are serving your 14 days quarantine you will not be allowed to leave your room. Smoking may not be allowed in the facilities. The 14 day period cannot be reduced, even if you wish to leave Singapore. Failure to comply carries a fine and a jail term of up to six months. More details can be found on the Singapore government website.
See information on questions about facilities for returnees on the Singapore Government website.
Permanent Residents and approved work pass holders with permission to enter Singapore must submit an online health declaration in advance of their arrival into Singapore. Otherwise it will need to be completed upon entry and may result in delays to immigration clearance.
Transit
Singapore’s Changi Airport has allowed transit to authorised airlines from 2 June but to date transit is only possible in certain circumstances. Check with your airline before undertaking a journey via Singapore.
Regular entry requirements
Visas
You don’t normally need a visa to enter Singapore for stays of up to 90 days for tourism, business or social visits. You may be eligible to enter Singapore using the enhanced Immigration Automated Clearance System (eIACS) under the Frequent Traveller Programme.
Passport validity
Your passport should be valid for a minimum period of 6 months from the date of entry into Singapore. If you are intending to transit Singapore to neighbouring countries, make sure your passport is valid for at least 6 months. You may be refused entry or turned away by airlines if your passport does not meet this requirement.
Entry is normally refused if you have a damaged passport or pages missing. Make sure your passport is in good condition before arriving in Singapore. Being refused entry can result in significant cost and a long stay at the airport.
Travelling while pregnant
Women who are more than six months pregnant no longer need to get permission before travelling, but the final decision on the length of stay permitted rests with the immigration officer on arrival. Prior entry clearance is required for women intending to give birth in Singapore. You can apply at the High Commission for the Republic of Singapore in London or the nearest Singapore Embassy/High Commission if you’re not in the UK.
Customs regulations
Importing certain controlled drugs and pirated copyright material is prohibited and there are restrictions on entering with items like replica guns, radio communications equipment, and weapons and ammunition (including empty cartridge cases and air guns). For more information visit the travellers section of the Singapore Customs government website.
Yellow fever certificate requirements
Check whether you need a yellow fever certificate by visiting the National Travel Health Network and Centre’s TravelHealthPro website.
Medication
Some prescribed and over the counter medicines available in the UK are considered controlled substances in Singapore. You must apply for prior authorisation and a permit at least 10 working days before your travel date from the Singapore Health Sciences Authority in order to bring any such medication into Singapore. For medicines that do not contain a controlled substance, you may bring up to three months’ supply into Singapore without prior approval, but must bring supporting documents such as a letter from your doctor or a copy of the prescription as proof that the medicines are for your personal use. For more information, consult the Health Sciences Authority website. If you have questions, email hsa_info@hsa.gov.sg
Arriving from the Middle East
If you’re arriving from an airport in the Middle East, you may be subject to screening for Middle East Respiratory Syndrome (MERS). If you display symptoms, you may face quarantine or further testing.
UK Emergency Travel Documents
UK Emergency Travel Documents (ETDs) are accepted for entry, airside transit and exit from Singapore. Your ETD should be valid for at least 6 months. No visa is required on an ETD when entering or transiting Singapore.
