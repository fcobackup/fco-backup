This page reflects the UK government’s understanding of current rules for people travelling on a full ‘British Citizen’ passport, for the most common types of travel.
The Swedish government sets and enforces its entry rules. For further information contact their UK based embassy. Check with your transport provider or travel company to make sure your passport and travel documents meet their requirements.
If you are travelling to Sweden for work, read the guidance on visas and permits as the rules have changed since 1 January 2021.
Entry rules in response to coronavirus (COVID-19)
Entry to Sweden
The Swedish Government has announced that travellers who can present a UK vaccine certificate are exempt from the ban on entry to Sweden and the COVID-19 test requirement.
Entry to Sweden if you are fully vaccinated:
If you are fully vaccinated, you can enter Sweden for all purposes, without the need to test or self-isolate if:
you received your second vaccine dose more than 2 weeks before you arrive
the vaccine is approved by the European Medicines Agency
You must provide proof that you have been fully vaccinated. Children (under 18 years) accompanying fully vaccinated adults are exempted from all travel restrictions, including testing.
Entry to Sweden from if you are not fully vaccinated:
If you are not fully vaccinated, you will need the following:
Proof you are exempt from the current travel ban under another exemption. See the Swedish Police website for further details
A valid test taken in the last 48 hours or proof you are exempt from the testing requirements. See the Swedish Police website for further details.
Demonstrating your COVID-19 status
Sweden will accept the UK’s proof of COVID-19 recovery and vaccination record and proof of COVID-19 vaccination issued in the Crown Dependencies. Your final vaccine dose must have been administered at least 14 days prior to travel. If you are travelling with a printed PDF proof of vaccination status, it must date from 1 November to ensure that the certificate can be scanned successfully. Your NHS appointment card from vaccination centres is not designed to be used as proof of vaccination and should not be used to demonstrate your vaccine status.
On arrival
Everyone entering Sweden from the UK is recommended to get a PCR test for COVID-19 upon arrival. Those who have been vaccinated at least three weeks before arrival in Sweden are exempt from this recommendation.

Regular entry requirements
Visas
The rules for travelling or working in European countries changed on 1 January 2021:
you can travel to countries in the Schengen area for up to 90 days in any 180-day period without a visa. This applies if you travel as a tourist, to visit family or friends, to attend business meetings, cultural or sports events, or for short-term studies or training.
if you are travelling to Sweden and other Schengen countries without a visa, make sure your whole visit is within the 90-day limit. Visits to Schengen countries within the previous 180 days before you travel count towards your 90 days.
to stay longer, to work or study, for business travel or for other reasons, you will need to meet the Swedish government’s entry requirements. Check with the Swedish Embassy what type of visa and/or work permit, if any, you may need
if you stay in Sweden with a residence permit or long-stay visa, this does not count towards your 90-day visa-free limit
Any time you spent in Sweden or other Schengen countries before 1 January 2021 does not count towards your 90-day visa-free limit.
At Swedish border control, you may need to queue in separate lanes from EU, EEA and Swiss citizens.
Check your passport is stamped if you enter or exit the Schengen area through Sweden as a visitor. Border guards will use passport stamps to check you’re complying with the 90-day visa-free limit for short stays in the Schengen area. If relevant entry or exit stamps are not in your passport, border guards will presume that you have overstayed your visa-free limit.
You can show evidence of when and where you entered or exited the Schengen area, and ask the border guards to add this date and location in your passport. Examples of acceptable evidence include boarding passes and tickets.
You may also need to:
show a return or onward ticket
show you have enough money for your stay
If you are resident in the Sweden your passport should not be stamped. You should proactively show your proof of residence as well as your valid passport at Swedish border control. For further information, see our Living in Sweden guide.
Passport validity
If you are planning to travel to an EU country (except Ireland), or Switzerland, Norway, Iceland, Liechtenstein, Andorra, Monaco, San Marino or Vatican City, you must meet the Schengen area rules.
Your passport must meet 2 requirements. It must be:
less than 10 years old on the day you enter (check the ‘date of issue’)
valid for at least 3 months after the day you plan to leave (check the ‘expiry date’)
We are asking the European Commission to clarify the 10-year rule. Their guidance for Schengen border guards may not be updated until the spring of 2022. Until then, for some Schengen countries your passport may need to be less than 10 years old during your whole visit, and the 3 months at the end of your visit may need to be within 10 years of your passport’s issue date.
Check both the issue date and the expiry date in your passport. If you renewed your passport early, extra months may have been added to its expiry date. This could affect the requirement for your passport to be less than 10 years old.
Contact your travel provider or embassy of the country you are visiting if you think that your passport does not meet both these requirements. Renew your passport if you need to.
UK Emergency Travel Documents
UK Emergency Travel Documents (ETDs) are accepted for entry, airside transit and exit from Sweden.
Travelling with children
If you’re travelling with children other than your own, you should carry a letter of consent from the child’s parent or guardian.
Pets
Check guidance before travelling with pets.
Border controls
Border controls are in place in Sweden for people travelling from Denmark via the Öresund crossing and arriving on ferries from Denmark and Germany. Make sure you carry a passport or national ID card when entering Sweden. More detailed information is available from the Swedish authorities.
