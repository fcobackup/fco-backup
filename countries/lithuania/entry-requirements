This advice reflects the UK government’s understanding of current rules for people travelling on a full ‘British citizen’ passport from the UK, for the most common types of travel.
The authorities in Lithuania set and enforce entry rules. If you’re not sure how these requirements apply to you, contact the Embassy of the Republic of Lithuania in the UK.
COVID-19 rules
There are no COVID-19 testing or vaccination requirements for travellers entering Lithuania.
Passport validity requirements
To travel to Lithuania, you must follow the Schengen area passport requirements.
To enter Lithuania (and all Schengen countries) your passport must:
have a ‘date of issue’ less than 10 years before the date you arrive. Passports are now valid for only 10 years, but for passports issued before 1 October 2018, extra months may have been added if you renewed a passport early
have an ‘expiry date’ at least 3 months after the day you plan to leave
Contact the Embassy of Lithuania in the UK if you think that your passport does not meet both these requirements. Renew your passport if you need to.
Check with your travel provider that your passport and other travel documents meet requirements.
You will be denied entry if you do not have a valid travel document, or try to use a passport that has been reported lost or stolen.
Checks at border control
Make sure you get your passport stamped
If you’re a visitor, your passport must be stamped when you enter or leave the Schengen area (which includes Lithuania). Border guards will use passport stamps to check you have not overstayed the 90-day visa-free limit for stays in the Schengen area. If your passport was not stamped, border guards will presume you have overstayed the visa-free limit.
If your passport was not stamped, show evidence of when and where you entered or left the Schengen area (for example, boarding passes or tickets) and ask the border guards to add the date and location in your passport.
Read about passport stamping if you live in Lithuania.
At border control, you may also need to:
show proof of your accommodation, for example, a hotel booking confirmation or proof of address for a second home
show proof of your travel insurance
show a return or onward ticket
prove that you have enough money for your stay – the amount varies depending on your accommodation
Visa requirements
You can travel to countries in the Schengen Area for up to 90 days in any 180-day period without a visa. This applies if you travel:
as a tourist
to visit family or friends
to attend business meetings, cultural or sports events
for short-term studies or training
If you are travelling to Lithuania and other Schengen countries without a visa, make sure your whole visit is within the 90-day limit. Visits to Schengen countries within the previous 180 days before you travel count towards your 90 days.
Apply for a visa
To stay longer (for example, to work, study or for business) you must meet the Lithuanian government’s entry requirements. Check which type of visa or work permit you need with the Embassy of Lithuania in the UK.
If you stay in Lithuania with a residence permit or long-stay visa, this does not count towards your 90-day visa-free limit.
You can apply online at Lithuania’s Migration Department.
Arrivals from Belarus, Ukraine or Russia, including the Kaliningrad Oblast
If you have arrived in Lithuania from Belarus, Ukraine or Russia (including the Kaliningrad Oblast) and need help, call +370 5246 2900 and select the option for “calling about an emergency involving a British national.” You can also send an enquiry via the web contact form.
British nationals can travel to Lithuania from Belarus, Russia or Ukraine by car or bus. Trains between Kaliningrad and Moscow allow British nationals to get off in Lithuania.

Vaccination requirements
At least 8 weeks before your trip, check the vaccinations and certificates you need in TravelHealthPro’s Lithuania guide.
Customs rules
There are strict rules about goods that can be brought into and taken out of Lithuania. You must declare anything that may be prohibited or subject to tax or duty.
Taking food and drink into Lithuania
You cannot take meat, milk or products containing them into EU countries. There are some exceptions for medical reasons, for example certain amounts of powdered infant milk, infant food, or pet food. Check the rules about taking food and drink into the EU on the European Commission website.
