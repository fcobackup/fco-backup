This information is for people travelling on a full ‘British citizen’ passport from the UK. It is based on the UK government’s understanding of South Korea’s current rules for the most common types of travel.
The authorities in South Korea set and enforce entry rules. If you’re not sure how these requirements apply to you, contact the South Korean Embassy in the UK.
COVID-19 rules
There are no COVID-19 testing or vaccination requirements for travellers entering South Korea.
Passport validity requirements
To enter South Korea as a tourist for up to 90 days, your passport must have an ‘expiry date’ after the date you are leaving South Korea.
To enter South Korea on a long-term visa, your passport should have an ‘expiry date’ at least 6 months after the date you arrive.
Check with your travel provider that your passport and other travel documents meet requirements. Renew your passport if you need to.
You will be denied entry if you do not have a valid travel document or try to use a passport that has been reported lost or stolen.
Visa requirements
You can enter South Korea for up to 90 days for short-term business or tourism. You must have an onward or return ticket. It’s illegal to be employed in South Korea while visiting visa-free, whether as a teacher or in any other capacity.
South Korea operates an electronic travel authorisation system called K-ETA. Anyone eligible for visa-free entry to South Korea is usually required to get K-ETA approval before departure. However, British nationals travelling visa-free to South Korea are temporarily exempt from requiring a K-ETA until December 31, 2024. Further information about the K-ETA exemption can be found on the K-ETA notice board.
If you need to apply for a K-ETA, you should ensure that you apply through the Korean government’s official K-ETA website. Other sites offering K-ETA application services are generally scams. It can take up to 72 hours for K-ETA approval to be granted.
If you are travelling for any purpose other than short-term business or tourism, check visa requirements with the South Korean Embassy in the UK.
For those in South Korea on a work visa, all employment changes must be authorised by Korean Immigration.
Re-entry permits for long-term visa holders
Most foreign nationals in South Korea on long-term visas are allowed to re-enter South Korea within one year of departure without the need for a re-entry permit. Check with the Korea Immigration Service.
If you are resident and intend to spend more than a year outside of South Korea, in most cases, you must apply for a multiple re-entry permit via the Hi Korea website before departure. If you require a re-entry permit, engage early with the immigration authorities and apply for a re-entry permit at least 4 working days ahead of any planned travel. 
Visas for working as an English teacher
To get a visa to teach English in South Korea, you must have a 3-year university degree. A Teaching English as a Foreign Language (TEFL) qualification alone is not enough. If you are found to have a teaching visa by deception, you will be detained and deported.
British nationals teaching English in South Korea have sometimes found living and working conditions to be below their expectation or have had difficulties getting the correct visas and residence permits. Some also report more serious problems such as breach of contract, confiscation of passport, payment being withheld and inadequate insurance.
Check all terms and conditions of your employment carefully. If possible, speak to other teachers from the place where you plan to work before accepting any offer. If you are in South Korea and in need of assistance, you should contact the British Embassy in Seoul.
Health screening
The UK is currently designated as a ‘Quarantine Inspection Required Area’ by South Korea. Travellers arriving in South Korea from ‘Quarantine Inspection Required Areas’ (including those who have transited in a ‘Quarantine Inspection Required Area’) need to submit a health questionnaire, either through the pre-entry Q-Code system or by completing a paper-based questionnaire on arrival in South Korea.  
Failure to complete required health screenings could result in a fine of up to KRW 10 million. Check the list of Quarantine Inspection Required Areas and Q-Code submission process prior to travel.
Vaccine requirements
For details about medical entry requirements and recommended vaccinations, see TravelHealthPro’s South Korea guide.
Customs rules
There are strict rules about goods you can take into or out of South Korea. You must declare anything that may be prohibited or subject to tax or duty.
