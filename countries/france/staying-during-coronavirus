Local measures
France began progressive deconfinement from 11 May. Each départment was categorised ‘red’, ‘orange’ or ‘green’, dictating the extent to which measures could be relaxed. Currently all départments in mainland France are categorised as ‘green’. Certain confinement measures may still apply, however, depending on the department you are in. For more information see the government website.
Since 11 May, wearing masks on public transport is compulsory for all users aged 11 and over, with fines for those who are not compliant. Masks are also compulsory in taxis and private hire vehicles without a plexiglass screen.
Health
The French government advises those with possible coronavirus symptoms to call 112. You should not go directly to the doctor or emergency services.

Finance
There is a range of financial support from the government that you can access while you are unable to return due to coronavirus restrictions.
If you’re in France, and have exhausted all other options to cover essential living costs while you wait to return home, you could apply for an emergency loan for your living costs from the UK government. You can only apply if you normally live in the UK and you cannot return home. This last-resort option is for those most in need, and you would need to repay the loan when you are back in the UK. Apply for an emergency loan.

If you need urgent consular assistance, contact your nearest British embassy, high commission or consulate. All telephone numbers are available 24/7.
