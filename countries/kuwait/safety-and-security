Military activity in the Red Sea area       
Military activity is currently underway in response to attempts by Houthi militants to prevent movement of international shipping in the Red Sea. While the area of activity is limited to the Red Sea and Yemen, there is a possibility that Travel Advice for nearby countries could change at short notice. You should continue to monitor Travel Advice and follow any relevant instructions from local authorities.
Crime
Violent crime against foreigners is rare. However, you should take care if you intend to travel to Jahra, where there have been incidents involving firearms, or Jleeb Al Shuyoukh, where there have been instances of robbery.
Local travel
You should only use authorised land border crossing points into Iraq and Saudi Arabia. Border posts can be easily missed on the Kuwait-Saudi Arabian border, but you must get an exit or entry stamp before continuing your journey. Any unauthorised movement near borders is illegal and dangerous, with armed guards regularly patrolling them. If you plan to cross the border from Kuwait into Iraq, make sure you have the correct paperwork. See the Iraqi Embassy to Kuwait’s website for more information
Landmines and other hazardous ordnance are still present in Kuwait. You should avoid off-road driving. If you do travel off-road, restrict your movements to clearly identifiable tracks, and take great care even if an area has been officially cleared. Don’t pick up any metal, plastic or other objects lying around.
Road travel
If you have a visit visa, you can drive in Kuwait using an International Driving Permit (IDP) or a valid UK licence. Since 28 March 2019, it has been a requirement to have the 1968 version of the IDP, with the 1926 IDPs previously issued by the UK no longer accepted in Kuwait. You can only get IDPs over the counter from UK Post Offices. You will not be able to buy one outside the UK.
Before driving you must obtain third party insurance in Kuwait. If you’re hiring a car, you can usually get insurance through your car hire company. However, if you’re planning to drive a car belonging to a relative or friend then you’re responsible for obtaining insurance. The insurance document must be kept with you at all times while driving.
If you live, or are considering living in Kuwait, see our Living in Kuwait guide for information on driving licences.
Driving conditions are hazardous. Many drivers pay little attention to other road users; drive in excess of speed limits; switch lanes without warning; ignore traffic lights and use mobile phones while driving.
If you have a major accident, where there are serious injuries or your car is not drivable, you must stay with your vehicle if it is safe to do so, call the police on 112, and not attempt to move the vehicle before they arrive. If you have a minor accident, where there are no serious injuries, try to take pictures of any damage to the vehicles involved in the accident if it is safe to do so. Record the licence plate numbers of any vehicles involved, and, if it is drivable, move your car from the road to avoid blocking traffic (you can be fined if you fail to do so). Call the police and follow their instructions on what to do next.
Sea travel
Many areas of the Gulf are highly sensitive, including near maritime boundaries and the islands of Bubiyan and Warbah in the northern Gulf and both Abu Musa and the Tunbs in the southern Gulf. The area in the northern Gulf, between Iran, Iraq and Kuwait has not been demarcated and vessels entering these areas have been detained and inspected. There have been occasional arrests. Make careful enquiries before entering these waters or visiting ports.
Following maritime restrictions issued by the Kuwaiti Ministry of Interior in 2011, you should take extra care when sailing in Kuwaiti waters. You should also remain alert to the effect any regional tensions may have on your planned route. Vessels operating in the Gulf of Oman, North Arabian Sea, Gulf of Aden and Bab El Mandeb regions may be under an increased risk of attack.
Take care when travelling by Dhow, as the safety of these vessels may not be up to UK standards. Make sure life jackets are available.
Political situation
Recent developments in the Middle East have led to heightened tensions in the region. There have been a number of planned, peaceful protests in Kuwait City’s Irada Square and smaller gatherings across the city, including at Kuwait University. You should continue to remain vigilant and avoid large crowds.  Only Kuwaiti citizens have the legal right to assembly.
Regional events continue to have an impact on local public opinion, with minor isolated cases of vandalism targets at and calls to boycott some international companies. You should be mindful of local sensitivities on these issues, follow the advice of the local authorities, and be alert to news reports and local and regional developments which might trigger public demonstrations.
