This page reflects the UK government’s understanding of current rules for people travelling on a full ‘British Citizen’ passport, for the most common types of travel.
The authorities in Rwanda set and enforce entry rules. For further information contact the embassy, high commission or consulate of the country or territory you’re travelling to. You should also consider checking with your transport provider or travel company to make sure your passport and other travel documents meet their requirements.
Entry rules in response to coronavirus
Entry to Rwanda
The Government of Rwanda has updated its guidance for passengers arriving to or departing from Rwanda
On 28 November 2021 the Government of Rwanda announced that, in response to the COVID-19 Omicron variant, direct flights between Rwanda and southern Africa are suspended.
All travellers arriving in Rwanda must have a negative COVID-19 certificate. The only accepted test is a SARS-CoV 2 Real Time Polymerase Chain Reaction (RT-PCR) performed within 72 hours prior to departure (meaning travellers must be tested and get results within 3 days of their first flight). Other tests, such as Rapid Diagnostics Tests (RDTs), are not accepted. A COVID-19 test is not mandatory for accompanied children under 5 years. You should not use the NHS testing service to get a test in order to facilitate your travel to another country. You should arrange to take a private test.
All travellers arriving in Rwanda must complete the passenger locator form and upload the COVID-19 test certificate before heading to the airport.
All travellers arriving or transiting for more than 12 hours through Rwanda will be screened upon entry and take a RT-PCR test on arrival, at their own cost.
All arriving passengers (except those arriving from countries particularly affected by Omicron) must quarantine for 24 hours in a designated hotel at their own expense. A list of designated hotels can be found on the Rwanda Biomedical Centre website. Passengers must then take a further PCR test, paid for by the Government of Rwanda, 7 days after arriving, at a designated testing site.
All passengers arriving from countries particularly affected by Omicron, or those who have visited those countries within 7 days or arrival in Rwanda, are required to quarantine for 7 days in designated hotels, at their own cost. As at 29 November, this applies to Botswana, Eswatini, Lesotho, Malawi, Mozambique, Namibia, South Africa, Zambia and Zimbabwe. These passengers are also required to take an additional test, covered by the Government of Rwanda, taken on day 7 from the arrival date at a designated hotel.
You should monitor the website of the office of the Prime Minister of Rwanda for further updates.
Entry at land borders remains restricted.
Screening on arrival
Screening procedures are in place for coronavirus at all entry points.
Testing on departure
All travellers departing from Rwanda must test negative for COVID-19. The only accepted test is a SARS-CoV 2 Real Time Polymerase Chain Reaction (RT-PCR) performed within 72 hours before departure performed by the Rwanda Biomedical Center/National Reference Laboratory, Provincial or District Hospitals. Other tests, such as Rapid Diagnostics Tests (RDTs), are not accepted. A COVID-19 Test is not mandatory for accompanied children under 5 years. Passengers are encouraged to book and pay for their tests at least 2 days prior to departure through the online platform available on the Rwanda Biomedical Centre.
Further information about testing on departure is available in the Government of Rwanda’s guidance.
Regular entry requirements
Visas
You need a visa to enter Rwanda. Thirty-day tourist visas are free and available on arrival for citizens of member states of the Commonwealth (including the UK), as well as for those of the African Union and the Francophonie.
You can also choose to get a visa in advance at any Rwandan diplomatic mission or online. Further information about visa requirements is available from the Rwandan High Commission.
If you’re planning to apply for resident/business or missionary multiple entry visas on entry to Rwanda you will need to get UK police clearance before you travel. You can find details of how to do this on the ACRO Criminal Records Office website. This usually takes a minimum of 10 working days to process.
Passport validity
Your passport should be valid for at least 6 months from the date of entry into Rwanda. You’ll need one blank page on your passport for entry stamps.
If your UK passport has expired since 1 January 2020 the Government of Rwanda have agreed that such passports will be treated as valid for travel until December 2021. However, you still need to ensure you have a valid visa to remain in Rwanda. You should renew your visa if required at the Rwanda Directorate-General of Immigration and Emigration
UK Emergency Travel Documents
UK Emergency Travel Documents (ETDs) are accepted for entry, airside transit and exit from Rwanda. If you’re travelling into Rwanda on an ETD, you’ll be expected to provide Rwandan Immigration with a reason for the use of an ETD, eg proof of residency. If you’re seeking to use a two-way ETD, should clear this with Rwandan Immigration before you travel.
Yellow fever certificate requirements
Check whether you need a yellow fever certificate by visiting the National Travel Health Network and Centre’s TravelHealthPro website.
