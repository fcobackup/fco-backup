All scheduled commercial flights have been cancelled but there are occasional charter flights leaving Mongolia.
Charter flights
The Government of Mongolia has arranged a charter flight to Frankfurt, departing at 9.40am local time on 2 May. Foreign nationals can purchase tickets for the outward leg. The British Embassy cannot guarantee seats on this flight, which are available through public sale only. To buy a ticket, contact MIAT direct on +976 11 313385 or visit the MIAT Ticket Office on the 2nd floor of Central Tower (east side of Sukhbaatar square).
If you choose to leave on this flight, check the latest FCO travel advice for Germany. You are responsible for making your own onward travel arrangements and you should be sure that you can continue your journey to your destination. Be aware the situation is changing daily around the world.
You should be prepared to be at the airport 2 or 3 hours in advance. You may have to undertake medical checks before boarding the flight. You should not be accompanied to the airport as access to the terminal will be for flight passengers only. You should make sure your luggage will be checked though to your destination. If MIAT cannot undertake this task you should check with Frankfurt airports that you will be allowed to collect your luggage and check-in for your onward flight.
We understand there are no tickets available on the Seoul charter flights on 30 April and 1 May.
You will need to pay for your return travel to the UK. If departure options are available but you cannot afford the travel costs and have exhausted all other options for getting funds, you may be eligible to apply for an emergency loan from the government. This is a last resort option and you would need to repay the loan when you are back in the UK. For more information, you should contact Corporate Travel Management (CTM). CTM are a commercial partner of the FCO and are authorised to administer such loans on behalf of the FCO.
