Travel and borders
The Lebanese authorities have closed Lebanon’s borders, including Beirut Rafic Hariri Airport..
There are some exceptions to the closure. Those with Lebanese nationality, Lebanese residency or who are a member of a family of a Lebanese national should contact their nearest Lebanese Embassy.
If you are concerned about your visa expiring please contact General Security on 1717 or +961 (0) 1424668 for advice. General Security are currently extending visas and not issuing fines for visas that have expired since COVID19 restrictions have been introduced.
Public measures
The Lebanese authorities have announced a lock-down in Lebanon. This has been extended until at least 10 May 2020. The Government has also announced plans for a phased approach to easing restrictions. Current restrictions include:
Individuals must remain at home. Public and private gatherings are banned
Public departments, municipalities, unions, universities, public and private schools are closed, with the exception of core institutions, including security agencies, hospitals, pharmacies and banks (though ATMs and electronic transfers are functioning)
Traffic is banned between 2100 and 0500. Outside of these hours restrictions are in place to limit the number of public and private vehicles on the roads. Vehicles with license plates ending in 1,3,5,7 or 9 are only permitted to move on Mondays, Wednesdays and Fridays. Vehicles with license plates ending in 0,2,4,6 or 8 are only permitted to move on Tuesdays, Thursdays and Saturdays. No vehicles are permitted to move on Sundays. There are exemptions in place for military and security forces, the International Committee for the Red Cross, diplomatic and specific health and food industry related vehicles.
Outside this, private cars containing more than two people may be stopped and all public transport is suspended. There may be difficulties accessing taxis
Most private companies and stores are closed; exceptions include bakeries, supermarkets, and haulage companies.
Fabric face masks must be worn when outside the home and a safe distance between individuals maintained.
Those over the age of 65 years old are advised to stay home and not go out unless absolutely necessary.
It is clear the Government of Lebanon is enforcing strictly restrictions on movement, in line with public health measures it has previously introduced. The issuance of fines, and the establishment of roadblocks, is increasingly widespread. We also understand that violators of the Government of Lebanon’s restrictions are liable to be imprisoned for up to three years. You should only leave home in exceptional circumstances – for example going to supermarkets or pharmacies for essential items, or to access medical care. You should comply with all local restrictions introduced by the Lebanese authorities. These restrictions may be changed at short notice.
Keep up to date with information from your tour operator, transport or accommodation provider on the impact on any existing travel plans. If you need further information about entry requirements, contact the local immigration authorities or the nearest Lebanese embassy.
