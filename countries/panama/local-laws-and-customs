Donâ€™t become involved with drugs of any kind. Possession of even small quantities of illegal drugs can lead to imprisonment.
The judicial process is slow and sentencing may take up to two years. If you are found guilty of possession of controlled or illegal substances, you could receive a long prison sentence or heavy fine.
Conditions in prisons and other detention facilities in Panama are harsh. Most facilities are overpopulated with limited access to healthcare. There have been recent cases of riots ending in prisoner deaths.
Smoking
Smoking in public places is prohibited. In January 2008, Panama introduced legislation to reduce the use of tobacco and tobacco-derived products. Those caught smoking in non-designated areas face a fine of $25.00-$100.00US.
LGBT+
Same-sex civil unions are illegal; however, same-sex relationships are legal in Panama. Most Panamanians are generally tolerant to LGBT+ travellers. However, Panamanian law does not prohibit discrimination based on sexual orientation and gender identity. There have been incidents of police officers detaining LGBT+ couples on the grounds of public indecency. Displays of affection can lead to unwanted attention. Casco Viejo is considered a safe place for LGBT+ travellers. See our information and advice page for the LGBT+ community before you travel.
