Entry and borders
See Entry requirements to find out what you will need to do when you arrive in Panama.
Be prepared for your plans to change
No travel is risk-free during COVID-19. Countries may further restrict travel or bring in new rules at short notice, for example due to a new COVID-19 variant. Check with your travel company or airline for any transport changes which may delay your journey home.
If you test positive for COVID-19, you may need to stay where you are until you test negative. You may also need to seek treatment there.
Plan ahead and make sure you:
can access money
understand what your insurance will cover
can make arrangements to extend your stay and be away for longer than planned
Travel in Panama
You should monitor the press and official announcements of the Panamanian government to ensure you are up to date with any changes to COVID-19 restrictions.
Measures in place to combat the spread of COVID-19 vary by province, including curfews. Travel restrictions between provinces may be introduced at short notice. You may be randomly tested for COVID-19 if you are stopped. The police and security forces are empowered to enforce restrictions on movements and events due to the current state of emergency. You must follow their instructions. Domestic flights are operating. Airports, ports and borders remain open; proof of good health will be required at these entry points.
Make sure you check the local guidance from Panamanian authorities in your area. See the Ministry of Tourism website (in Spanish), Ministry of Health Twitter page (in Spanish) and Visit Panama website (in English)
Public spaces and services
The wearing of masks inside enclosed or crowded areas is no longer compulsory. You must wear a mask on buses and the metro as well as in public and private medical facilities.
Many venues – such as restaurants, bars, museums and other social events - have reduced capacity, although the consumption of alcohol is permitted. Restrictions may be amended based on vaccination status and some venues are requesting proof of full vaccination as a condition of entry. Respect the limits posted on signs at venues.
Some sporting events may require you to complete a QR code for “Safe Mobility” before entering the event. You must adhere to safety measures including the use of face masks and social distancing.
Panama will accept the UK’s proof of COVID-19 recovery and vaccination record. For more information, see the ‘Demonstrating your COVID-19 vaccination status’ section.
Healthcare in Panama
If you are concerned that you may be unwell as a result of coronavirus, you should call the national hotline on 169, or use the Panamanian Government’s “R.O.S.A” (virtual clinic) to send a WhatsApp message, and follow their advice.
You can access the Panamanian public healthcare system on the same terms as Panamanians. Coronavirus tests for those who meet the clinical requirement to be tested will be free of charge.
Most public and private medical centres do not accept walk-ins and require you to book an appointment prior to arrival.
