Terrorists are very likely to try to carry out attacks in Thailand. Bomb and grenade attacks have been indiscriminate, including in places visited by foreigners. There were explosions in Bangkok in April and May 2017. You should take care, particularly in public places, follow the advice of the local authorities and monitor local media reports. The Thai authorities have on a number of occasions warned of the possibility of attacks to coincide with symbolic dates or holidays.
In October 2016, the Thai authorities say they disrupted planned attacks in Bangkok. Further incidents are possible throughout Thailand.
In August 2016, there were a multiple explosions and incidents in tourist areas across Thailand (including Hua Hin, Trang, Krabi, Nakhon Sri Thammarat, Patong and Loma in Phuket, Surat Thani, and Khao Lak in Phang Nga) involving improvised explosive devices (IEDs) and incendiary devices.
There have also been attacks in the past in the main cities of Thailand, including in Bangkok. In 2015 a bomb exploded at the Erawan Shrine in Bangkok, resulting in numerous casualties, including the death of a British national. In February 2015 there were 2 explosions at the Siam station of Bangkok’s Skytrain (BTS) system, near the entrance to the Siam Paragon shopping mall. Other explosions happened in Koh Samui in 2015, and in Chiang Mai in 2010.
Since 2004, there have been almost daily attacks in Thailand’s deep south, including arson, bombings and shootings. Targets have included civilians and members of the security forces, government offices, tourist hotels, discos, bars, shops, marketplaces, supermarkets, schools, transport infrastructure and trains. Over 7,000 people have been killed and several thousand more injured. No British nationals have been killed in these attacks, but some foreigners have been killed and injured.
Martial law has been in place in the provinces of Pattani, Yala, Narathiwat and in the Sadao district of Songkhla province since 2006. The security authorities can detain suspects without charge, censor the media, conduct searches and seize documents. The FCO advise against all but essential travel to the provinces of Pattani, Yala, Narathiwat and Songkhla.
