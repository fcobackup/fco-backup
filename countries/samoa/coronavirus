The Samoan authorities have introduced a number of precautionary measures in response to the coronavirus (COVID-19) pandemic. A State of Emergency was declared on 20 March by the Government of the Independent State of Samoa. The Samoan Government has announced that with effect from 26 March all international travel to and from Samoa by plane will cease until further notice. You should monitor the health advisory website.
All international cruise ships and yachts will not be granted entry into Samoa at this time. Some countries in the region have also introduced travel restrictions to and from the Pacific islands. You should check specifics for any countries that might be involved in your travel when planning a trip to and/or from Samoa.
