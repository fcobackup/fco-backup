Children aged six years or younger are not required to wear a face mask.

Upon arrival at your accommodation, you will normally be subject to a temperature test and asked to complete a health questionnaire. Some accommodation providers will request your travel history.

Public spaces and services
The South African authorities have published COVID-19 guidelines and advice and have introduced measures to limit the spread of the virus. Failure to comply could result in a fine or arrest.

Healthcare in South Africa
If you take regular medication, make sure you can access a repeat prescription if you need to. Most medicines that require a prescription from a doctor in the UK will require a script in South Africa (‘script’ is the widely used term in South Africa for ‘prescription’). If you need a prescription in advance, you can visit a local doctor. The doctor might prescribe on the basis of your visit, or they may ask you to obtain an electronic prescription from your medical practitioner in the UK to allow them to write a script. Pharmacies are readily available, with larger pharmacy groups Dis-Chem and Clicks having stores across the country. Some (but not all) of these stores have medical practitioners on site who can write prescriptions.
Most medical practitioners speak English, particularly in major cities and tourist areas. Visit our list of doctors.
