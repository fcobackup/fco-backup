In recent weeks, several large-scale political demonstrations have taken place on Hong Kong Island, in Kowloon and various suburbs in the New Territories. Clashes have taken place between police and protesters following otherwise peaceful protest activities. These have involved significant violence.
Reports indicate that protests are likely to continue. There are a number of planned rallies on the weekend of 2-4 August:
2 August: Chater Gardens, Hong Kong Island
3 August: Mong Kok, Kowloon
4 August: Western District, Hong Kong Island, and Tseung Kwan O, New Territories
You should be prepared that the situation around protests and public gatherings could change quickly, with the potential for significant violence. If you’re in and around areas where demonstrations are taking place, you should remain vigilant, follow the advice of local authorities and move away quickly to a safe place if there are signs of disorder.
Some protests may not have received authorisation from the police. Unauthorised protests have a higher degree of unpredictability, and when compared with authorised protests have been met previously with a more rapid and more severe police response. You should therefore exercise a particular degree of vigilance in the vicinity of these unauthorised protests. Local media reporting clearly identifies which protests are unauthorised.
Activities related to protests have spilled over into large public spaces, including shopping centres, housing estates and metro (“MTR”) stations, on the margins of recent protest routes. Protests can deviate from planned routes and there is the possibility of injuries among those accidentally caught up in events. Demonstrations may lead to sections of the city being closed off and public transport being significantly affected. In recent protests, bus routes, MTR stations and the Hong Kong Macao Ferry Terminal have temporarily suspended operations without warning.
On 20 July, Hong Kong police announced that they had seized a quantity of explosives and offensive weapons in the New Territories and that they were still investigating the motive.
