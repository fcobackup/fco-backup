Indirect commercial flights to return to the UK are available.
From 8 June there are no longer restrictions on the UK side on direct flights arriving in England from Argentina; they would have to arrive at dedicated terminals at Heathrow and Birmingham airports. Different requirements might apply for arrivals into Scotland, Wales and Northern Ireland. However, Argentina continues to ban direct flights to and from the UK and there are none currently in operation.
Commercial flights
Due to restrictions imposed by Argentina, there are currently no direct flights between Argentina and the UK. Travellers should consult their airline or tour operator if they have booked travel.
Flights from Brazil, Chile, India and Mexico into Argentina have also been suspended until further notice.
Every month the Argentine authorities approve a certain number of exceptional international commercial flights.
There are a limited number of indirect flights which can be used to connect with the UK. Check with your airline or travel company for the latest information. You should also check the travel advice for the countries you will be transiting.
Travelling to the airport
You can travel from your accommodation to the airport if you have a valid plane ticket and are not showing any symptoms of coronavirus.
You need to complete an electronic ‘sworn statement’ form within 48 hours of leaving, self-certifying that you are not suffering from symptoms associated with coronavirus and that you have not been in contact with confirmed cases in the preceding fortnight.
Your journey home: re-entering the UK
When you return, you must follow the rules for entering the UK.
You are responsible for organising your own COVID-19 test, in line with UK government testing requirements.
From 8 June, direct flights could arrive in England from Argentina, but they would have to arrive at dedicated terminals at Heathrow and Birmingham airports. Different requirements may apply for arrivals into Scotland, Wales and Northern Ireland.
The National Travel Health Network and Centre (NaTHNaC) also provides advice on how to stay safe as you travel by air.
