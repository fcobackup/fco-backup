Cases of coronavirus (COVID-19) have been confirmed in Cameroon. See information on measures introduced in Cameroon to limit the spread of the virus. Find out how to return to the UK from Cameroon.

within 40km of the border with Nigeria, except Garoua in North region (see below)
within 40km of the border with Chad
within 40km of the border with the Central African Republic (CAR)
North West region
South West region (including the towns of Buea, Muyuka and Tiko in Fako division), except Limbe in Fako division (see below)
the Bakassi Peninsula
The FCO advise against all but essential travel to:
Limbe in Fako division, South West region

Cases of coronavirus (COVID-19) have been confirmed in Cameroon. The Cameroonian authorities have introduced a number of measures to limit the spread of the virus. Cameroon has closed all its land, sea and air borders, effective from 18 March. See Coronavirus
A small number of non-consular staff and dependents were drawn down from the British High Commission. The British High Commission will continue to carry out essential work including providing 24/7 consular assistance and support to British people in Cameroon.
Armed separatists imposed lockdowns in August and September 2019. During a lockdown in February 2019, there were reports of violence and loss of life. Urban transport in towns and cities was affected and vehicular traffic in and out of the region was restricted. Incidents of sporadic gunfire also occurred, including shooting in Bamenda, Buea and the outskirts of Limbe. You should monitor local media to check for the latest information about the shutdown.
General strikes (or ‘ghost towns’) are called in the North West and South West (Anglophone) regions for each Monday, with additional days often called in particular periods including February, May and October. Violence and travel disruption is regularly reported on these days.
There have also been multiple clashes between the Cameroonian security forces and armed groups over the past year in many places in the North West and South West regions. In the first four months of 2019, clashes between the army and armed separatists were reported in the towns of Bafut, Tubah, Ndu, Widikum, Muyuka and in Lebialem, Momo, Bui and Mezam divisions. Restrictions including night curfews and a ban on public meetings, which were imposed following violent and deadly clashes in 2017, remain in place. There is a high risk of violent criminality, especially at night.
If you decide to travel to, or within, areas of the Anglophone regions where the FCO advise against all travel or all but essential travel, you should consider carefully the risks of travel, monitor developments closely, keep a low profile and minimise your movements. See North West and South West (Anglophone) regions
Political developments and increased tensions related to the North West and South West (Anglophone) regions could lead to isolated incidents of violence in other parts of the country, including Yaoundé. This could affect western interests, as well as places frequented by foreigners. You should remain vigilant and keep up to date with developments via the media and local authorities. See Political situation
Terrorists are very likely to try to carry out attacks in Cameroon, particularly in the Far North region and the eastern border with Central African Republic. Attacks could be indiscriminate, including in places visited by foreigners such as restaurants, bars, markets, hotels, shopping centres and places of worship. The terrorist group Boko Haram and the Islamic State West Africa (ISWA) is active in the Far North region but attacks could occur anywhere, potentially including major towns and cities such as Yaoundé and Douala. There have been numerous suicide attacks since 2015, which have resulted in over 200 dead in the Far North region, although since 2017 these have been predominately adjacent to the border with Nigeria. Key targets have been large open markets, hotels, parks and sporting venues. There have also been hostages taken and heavy gunfights reported in Babouang and Mbarang in Adamawa region (Cameroon). See Terrorism
There is a heightened threat of kidnap to western nationals in the north of Cameroon, including in the major cities and along the border between the Far North region and Nigeria. Boko Haram has publicly threatened Cameroon with attacks and further kidnappings due to Cameroon’s involvement in the regional fight to counter Boko Haram.
There have been reports of criminality including large armed gangs and highway bandits, stopping travellers, taking hostages and demanding payment, particularly in the east of Cameroon, close to the Central African Republic (CAR) border. There are frequent instances of violence in CAR spilling across the border to Cameroon. See Crime
Nigerian military operations in the states of Borno, Yobe and Adamawa in Nigeria could have an impact across the border in Cameroon.
Avoid travelling at night across Cameroon unless absolutely necessary, due to risks from criminality, poor infrastructure and erratic driving.
UK health authorities have classified Cameroon as having a risk of Zika virus transmission. For information and advice about the risks associated with Zika virus, visit the National Travel Health Network and Centre website.
There are increased reports of piracy in the Gulf of Guinea. Take great care when travelling in coastal waters, including the coastline of Cameroon and the Doula port. Despite the high crime levels, most visits to Cameroon are trouble-free. Only a few British nationals needed consular assistance in the past year.
If you’re abroad and you need emergency help from the UK government, contact the nearest British embassy, consulate or high commission. Consular support is severely limited in parts of Cameroon (particularly East, Far North, North-West and South-West).
Take out comprehensive travel and medical insurance before you travel.
