Coronavirus travel health
See the TravelHealthPro website for further advice on travel abroad and reducing spread of respiratory viruses during the COVID-19 pandemic.
Travel in Singapore
Read the Singapore Government article on the phased approach to resuming activities safely for information.
Those who do not comply with these measures will be fined. Repeat offenders will face further fines and/or prosecution. Be aware that restrictions and penalties are subject to change at short notice.
Public spaces and services
The wearing of facemasks is compulsory for everyone when outside of their place of residence, except children under 6 years old, when eating or when engaged in strenuous exercise.
Most shops, services and eateries are open with social distancing measures in place. No alcohol will be available in restaurants after 10:30pm.
You must record visits to any shops, services etc. through a ‘Safe Entry’ phone app or by signing in at the entrance. You will be required to either download Singapore’s ‘TraceTogether’ app or, if resident in Singapore, collect a ‘TraceTogether’ token from the Singapore government in order to enter an increasing number of locations (see https://www.tracetogether.gov.sg/).
Groups of up to 5 people are allowed outside the home. Households can receive up to 5 visitors at one time. A distance of 1 metre should be maintained between people, except when this is not possible due to space constraints e.g. in a lift or on public transport. Speaking is discouraged on public transport.
Healthcare in Singapore
