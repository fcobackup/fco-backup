Healthcare in Azerbaijan
A number of medical facilities are allocated specifically for coronavirus patients. Previously everyone infected had been hospitalised as a precautionary measure. This is no longer the case and only those with the most serious symptoms are usually taken to hospital, with many given the option to self-isolate or be treated at home. However, this will depend on individual circumstances. If you think you might have symptoms of coronavirus you should call 103 or 804.
