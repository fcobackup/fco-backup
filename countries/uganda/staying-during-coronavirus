This page gives you guidance on how to stay safely in Uganda as a visitor, if you are unable to return to the UK.
Everyone should comply with the measures put in place in Uganda to limit the spread of coronavirus (COVID-19).
Moving around in Uganda
The Ugandan authorities have introduced measures to limit the spread of coronavirus. On 20 September, internal lockdown measures were relaxed:
It is mandatory for everyone aged 6 or above to wear a face mask when outside your house. Further guidance is available from the Ministry of Health website.
A curfew remains in place from 9pm to 6am.
Movement by personal vehicles is now permitted in all districts including those with an international border, but is still limited to 4 people per car (including the driver) and they must all wear masks if there is more than one person in the vehicle.
Travel by public transport (including minibus taxis, buses, coaches, passenger trains) is now allowed in all except. Tuk tuks and boda bodas (motorbike taxis) are allowed to carry passengers but must stop operating by 6pm.
Gatherings of more than 5 people are still prohibited. Public exercise is still banned.
Shopping malls and arcades, supermarkets, pharmacies, hairdressers and salons are open. Casinos, gaming centres, cinemas, and bars remain closed.
Hotels and restaurants are open with social distancing measures in place and food delivery services remain operational outside of curfew hours.
Places of worship are allowed to reopen but with some restrictions in place.
Open air sports are now allowed without spectators. Indoor sports activities including gyms remain closed.

Visas
Immigration offices in Uganda have now re-opened. The Ministry of Internal Affairs have advised that fines accrued for overstaying visa or permits from 18 March to 9 June 2020 are waived. Discretion to waive fines outside of this period lies with the Commissioner of Immigration. Cases will be considered on a case-by-case basis. Foreign nationals can submit an enquiry via the Directorate’s web based form.

Finance
There is a range of financial support from the government that you can access while you are unable to return due to coronavirus restrictions.
If you’re in Uganda, and have exhausted all other options to cover essential living costs while you wait to return home, you could apply for an emergency loan for your living costs from the UK government. You can only apply if you normally live in the UK and you cannot return home. This last-resort option is for those most in need, and you would need to repay the loan when you are back in the UK. Apply for an emergency loan.

If you need urgent consular assistance, contact your nearest British embassy, high commission or consulate. All telephone numbers are available 24/7.
