The information on this page covers the most common types of travel and reflects the UK government’s understanding of the rules currently in place. Unless otherwise stated, this information is for travellers using a full ‘British Citizen’ passport.
The authorities in the country or territory you’re travelling to are responsible for setting and enforcing the rules for entry. If you’re unclear about any aspect of the entry requirements, or you need further reassurance, you’ll need to contact the embassy, high commission or consulate of the country or territory you’re travelling to.
You should also consider checking with your transport provider or travel company to make sure your passport and other travel documents meet their requirements.
Entry rules in response to coronavirus (COVID-19)
Entry to Lesotho
Lesotho entered “Orange level” restrictions from 6 January 2021.
Under previous “Orange level” entry and exit to Lesotho was restricted to emergency cases and transport of essential goods and services. New regulations have not yet been published by the government. Travellers with negative COVID-19 certificates are currently still being allowed to enter and exit Lesotho, but this could change at any point and with little advance warning.
This advice will be updated once the Lesotho government regulations have been published or if the situation at the border posts changes.
SAA Airlink flights between Maseru and Johannesburg Airport have resumed but with a reduced timetable.
The border crossing points at Maseru Bridge, Caledonspoort (Butha Buthe), Maputsoe Bridge, Qacha’s Nek Bridge and Vanrooyens Gate (Mafeteng) remain open, but this is subject to change at short notice. Their hours of operation are reduced due to the COVID-19 related curfew in South Africa. See our travel advice for South Africa for further information.
If you wish to enter or exit Lesotho, you’ll need a negative PCR COVID-19 test taken within 72 hours of travel. You should not use the NHS testing service to get a test in order to facilitate your travel to another country. You should arrange to take a private test.
Truck drivers, Basotho students studying in South Africa and others who cross the border daily are permitted to cross for 14 days before a further test is required.
Basotho nationals and residents who exit Lesotho with a negative COVID-19 certificate will be permitted to re-enter within 7 days of the original test.
Transiting via South Africa
All visitors to Lesotho must travel through, or transit via, South Africa.
In response to the new variant of COVID-19, there are restrictions in place for travel from South Africa to the UK. See our travel advice for South Africa for further information.
Screening on arrival and departure
Everyone entering Lesotho will be screened for coronavirus.
Individuals entering or leaving Lesotho must provide evidence of a negative PCR COVID-19 test, taken within 72 hours of travel.
You should comply with any additional screening measures.
Quarantine requirements
Travellers showing symptoms of coronavirus will be required to self -isolate at their permanent or temporary residence or may be placed in an isolation facility in a government hospital at their own expense.
Data collection
Travellers entering Lesotho may be required to provide details of where they will be staying to aid the Government’s efforts to tackle COVID-19.
If you need further information about entry requirements, contact the local immigration authorities or the nearest Lesotho High Commission.
