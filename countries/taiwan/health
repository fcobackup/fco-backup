There has been a significant increase in cases of dengue fever. Cases are usually concentrated in the south of Taiwan (including the cities of Kaohsiung and Tainan) and are highest during the summer months. See the Taiwan Centre for Disease Control website for more information. You should take precautions to avoid mosquito bites.
If you need emergency medical assistance during your trip, dial 119 and ask for an ambulance.
