Visas
Suspension of tourist visas, e-visas, visa on arrival and visa exemptions came in to effect on 31 March.
The latest information on visas from the relevant authorities is as below -
Tourist Visa: As things stand, if you entered Cambodia on a tourist visa on or after 1 January 2020, you do not need to seek a visa extension provided you leave the country by 30 April. Anyone leaving before this date will not be charged an overstay fine. The authorities are currently considering whether to extend this beyond 30 April. However, they may decide to not to offer a further extension and applicable fines may apply.
Other Visas: For non-tourist visas such as EG visas, there is no automatic extension in place and these can be renewed at any time in the usual way.
