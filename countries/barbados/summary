From 4 July, Barbados is exempt from the FCO advice against all non-essential international travel. This is based on the current assessment of COVID-19 risks.
Travel is subject to entry restrictions
If you arrive in Barbados without being tested for COVID-19, you will be subjected to a mandatory test on arrival. You will need to isolate until the test results are provided. This can take a maximum of 48 hours.
Anyone who tests positive for COVID-19 will be placed in isolation until they have recovered.
Full details can be found on the Visit Barbados website. You are advised to comply with the instructions and monitor the guidance on a regular basis as the guidance may change at short notice.
