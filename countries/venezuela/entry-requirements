This page has information on travelling to Venezuela.
This page reflects the UK government’s understanding of current rules for people travelling on a full ‘British Citizen’ passport from the UK, for the most common types of travel.
The authorities in Venezuela set and enforce entry rules. If you’re unsure how Venezuela’s entry requirements apply to you, contact its UK embassy, high commission or consulate.
All travellers
All individuals 5 years old or older travelling to Venezuela must present either of the following at port of origin:
proof of COVID-19 vaccination you may use your UK COVID Pass.
a negative COVID-19 PCR-RT test performed within 72 hours of arrival
For a proof of COVID-19 vaccination to be considered valid, at least 14 calendar days must have passed since your last vaccine dose of a complete vaccination scheme (for both 2-dose or 1-dose vaccines). If more than 270 days have passed since your last dose of a complete vaccination scheme, proof of a vaccine booster is required.
You should not use the NHS testing service to get a test in order to facilitate your travel to another country. You should arrange to take a private test.
If you’re fully vaccinated
If you’re fully vaccinated you must comply with the rules set out above – see All travellers.
Proof of vaccination status
Proof of COVID-19 vaccination is required for check-in at port of origin. Individuals who are not fully vaccinated may use, alternatively, a negative COVID-19 PCR-RT test performed within 72 hours of arrival as a substitute for proof of vaccination. Please note that proof of vaccination might be required to allow entry to some indoor venues such as restaurants and cafes. You may use your UK COVID Pass in electronic or PDF form, or provide your vaccination card for this purpose.
If you’re not fully vaccinated
Individuals who are not fully vaccinated may use, alternatively, a negative COVID-19 PCR-RT test performed within 72 hours of arrival as a substitute for proof of vaccination– see All travellers.
If you’ve had COVID-19 in the past year
Having recovered from COVID-19 does not exempt travellers from the standard entry rules set out by local authorities. Please make sure to comply with the entry rules set out above – see All travellers.
Children and young people
Children 5 years old and older must comply with local COVID-19 standard entry requirements as set out above - please see entry requirement rules for All travellers above.
If you’re transiting through Venezuela
Transiting through Venezuela on your way to other country is permitted for travellers as long as they comply with the mandatory standard COVID-19 entry requirements set out above – please see entry requirements rules for All travellers. Travellers should also make sure their passport is valid for entry and transit in Venezuela.
See Check your passport and travel documents before you travel below.

Exemptions
Local authorities have not set out any exemptions to the above stated standard COVID-19 entry requirements for Venezuela. See All travellers.
Check your passport and travel documents before you travel
If you’re visiting Venezuela, your passport should be valid for at least 6 months beyond the day you plan to leave Venezuela.
If you’re a resident in Venezuela, your passport must be valid at the time of your arrival. Your residence visa/permit must also be valid.
Check with your travel provider to make sure your passport and other travel documents meet their requirements.
Visas
If you’re arriving by air, you can enter for up to 90 days on a tourist card issued on arrival. You must have a valid return ticket. If you’re arriving overland or by sea, you must get a visa in advance from your nearest Venezuelan Embassy or Consulate.
If you are overstay the 90 days you may be arrested and fined when departing. Extensions of up to 90 days can be arranged at any SAIME (immigration service) for a fee but you must apply before your tourist card and stamp expire. If you are living in Venezuela, the only place where you can apply for or extend your residency permit is the main SAIME office in Caracas. Avoid companies offering residency permits as they may not be genuine.
Dual nationality
Any dual national Venezuelan citizens must use their Venezuelan identity documents to enter and leave the country. The authorities may not allow you to depart Venezuela otherwise.
Travelling with children
Children travelling unaccompanied, with a guardian, or with one parent must provide a travel permit from the non-travelling parent(s) confirming that they consent for the child to travel without them. This permit must include all the relevant travel details and must be obtained through the nearest local SAREN office, or the respective Court for Children and Adolescents.
If the child is resident overseas, the travel permit must be obtained through the nearest Venezuelan Embassy or Consulate.
The child should carry this travel permit while travelling within the country and also at time of departure from Venezuela. Children may be denied exit from the country otherwise.
UK Emergency Travel Documents
UK Emergency Travel Documents (ETDs) are accepted for entry, airside transit and exit from Venezuela. The ETD must be valid for at least 6 months beyond your period of intended stay in Venezuela. The usual visa requirements for land and sea arrivals apply. If you are a dual British/Venezuelan national you must have a valid Venezuelan travel document (passport) in order to be allowed to depart – a UK Emergency Travel Document cannot substitute this requirement. If you are a resident in Venezuela with an irregular immigration status (you don’t have a valid residence visa/permit) you need to submit a “retorno voluntario” request to SAIME 48 hours before your departure – you must visit your nearest SAIME office and present a valid travel document, your departure ticket and pay an applicable fine; you may be arrested at the airport otherwise.
