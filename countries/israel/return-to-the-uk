There are still some commercial options to return to the UK from Israel and the Occupied Palestinian Territories.
If you live in the UK and are currently visiting Israel or the Occupied Palestinian Territories, you are strongly advised to return now by commercial means. Do not risk getting stranded.
UK special charter flights will only operate for priority countries where commercial flights are not possible. You should not assume that these flights will become available in Israel or the Occupied Palestinian Territories because commercial routes are operating.
Flights
There are currently no routine direct flights to the UK. However, some one-off and indirect options are available:
El-Al is operating a special passenger flight to London (via Paris) on 30 April. Full details can be found on the El-Al website
Some airlines are still operating international flights from Tel Aviv Ben Gurion Airport. Israir Airlines continues to operate a number of one-off flights to European destinations. For further information, check the Israir Airlines website (in Hebrew only)
Check travel advice for any country that you will transit on the way back to the UK, as you may need to show proof of onward travel or complete additional documents.

You will need to pay for your return travel to the UK. If departure options are available but you cannot afford the travel costs and have exhausted all other options for getting funds, you may be eligible to apply for an emergency loan from the government. This is a last resort option and you would need to repay the loan when you are back in the UK. For more information, you should contact Corporate Travel Management (CTM). CTM are a commercial partner of the FCO and are authorised to administer such loans on behalf of the FCO.
Travelling to the airport
There are limited public transport services to Ben Gurion International Airport, and local taxis and minicabs can be arranged. You will need to comply with social distancing and health regulations when travelling to the airport. There are some restrictions on land crossings. See Land crossings
