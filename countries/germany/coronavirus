See the TravelHealthPro website for further advice on travel abroad and reducing spread of respiratory viruses during the COVID-19 pandemic.

Entry and borders
See Entry requirements to find out what you will need to do when you arrive in Germany.
Be prepared for your plans to change
No travel is risk-free during COVID-19. Countries may further restrict travel or bring in new rules at short notice, for example due to a new COVID-19 variant. Check with your travel company or airline for any transport changes which may delay your journey home.
If you test positive for COVID-19, you may need to stay where you are until you test negative. You may also need to seek treatment there.
Plan ahead and make sure you:
can access money
understand what your insurance will cover
can make arrangements to extend your stay and be away for longer than planned
Public spaces and services
Medical grade masks, usually FFP-2 masks, are legally required on public transport and in health and social care settings. You should bring an FFP-2 mask with you to Germany.
States are permitted to declare themselves or areas of their territory a hotspot and impose more stringent measures, such as mask-wearing in other settings or C-19 certification. Statesâ€™ measures are available from the German government.
If travellers develop symptoms associated with COVID-19 (coughing, a runny nose, sore throat or fever) they should get in touch by phone with a doctor or contact the hotline 116 117. Often travel guides or hotels can also help in such cases.
Guidance from the Federal Health Ministry is available.
Testing positive for COVID-19 in Germany
Anyone testing positive with a self-test is entitled to take a follow-up certified rapid antigen test or PCR test. Those testing positive with a certified rapid antigen test or PCR test are required to self-isolate. Mandatory self-isolation ceases after 5 days. The German authorities recommend staying in self-isolation until you test negative with a rapid-antigen test. The Federal Health Ministry provides guidance on self-isolation.
The local health office (Gesundheitsamt) is responsible for monitoring self-isolation and will provide further guidance in individual cases. You can find your local health office by postcode.
