The FCDO advises against all travel to Ukraine.
This page reflects the UK government’s understanding of current rules for people travelling on a full ‘British Citizen’ passport from the UK, for the most common types of travel.
The authorities in Ukraine set and enforce entry rules. If you’re unsure how Ukraine’s entry requirements apply to you, contact its UK embassy, high commission or consulate.
All travellers
Upon arrival, all foreign nationals are required to provide proof of health insurance that covers COVID-19 observation and treatment for the duration of their stay, unless they are exempt. Insurance must be purchased from a company registered in Ukraine or a foreign company that has a representative office or an insurance partner in Ukraine. See Exemptions.
If you’re fully vaccinated
If you’re fully vaccinated, you will need to provide a document confirming receipt of at least one dose of COVID-19 vaccination with WHO-approved vaccines. Ukraine lists these as Pfizer, AstraZeneca (Vaxzevria, Covishield and SKBio), Janssen, Moderna, Sinopharm and CoronaVac. This is in addition to the requirement to provide proof of health insurance that covers COVID-19.
Proof of vaccination status
Ukraine will accept the UK’s proof of COVID-19 vaccination record and proof of COVID-19 vaccination issued in the Crown Dependencies. Your NHS appointment card from vaccination centres is not designed to be used as proof of vaccination and should not be used to demonstrate your vaccine status.
Non-exempt foreign nationals without proof of vaccination (ie one or both doses) will be required on arrival to install the “Vdoma” app, which monitors self-isolation. The State Border Service will refuse entry to anyone who is unable, or refuses, to install the “Vdoma” app. See the official Visit Ukraine site and click “more details” for further information.
If you’re not fully vaccinated
If you’re not fully vaccinated, you will need to present a negative Rapid Antigen Test, taken no more than 72 hours before entry, or a negative PCR test taken no more than 72 hours before entry to Ukraine. This is in addition to the requirement to provide proof of health insurance that covers COVID-19. You will also be required to install the Vdoma app on your phone.
If you’ve had COVID-19 in the past year
Ukraine will accept the UK’s proof of COVID-19 recovery record to demonstrate proof of COVID-19 recovery.
Residents of Ukraine
As of 3 December 2021, foreigners with a residence permit or exemption may enter, but must undergo a mandatory 14-day self-isolation and will not be able to take a test to reduce the period of self-isolation.
Foreigners without a residence permit or other exemption (see Visit Ukraine for details) who have spent more than 7 of the last 14 days in South Africa, Botswana, Zimbabwe, Namibia, Lesotho, Eswatini, Mozambique or Malawi, must undergo a mandatory 14-day self-isolation.
Children and young people
Children under 12 do not have to provide proof of vaccination or a negative test to enter Ukraine.
If you’re transiting through Ukraine
If you’re transiting Ukraine, you are required to provide documents confirming your departure from the country within 48 hours and proof of health insurance that covers COVID-19 observation and treatment for the duration of your stay. Insurance must be purchased from a company registered in Ukraine or a foreign company that has a representative office or an insurance partner in Ukraine. Transiting travellers are exempt from self-isolation and installing the Vdoma application.
Travellers arriving in Ukraine or crossing the administrative points from non-government-controlled parts of Donetsk and Luhansk oblasts and Crimea will be subject to health monitoring on arrival. You should comply with any additional screening measures put in place by the authorities.
Further information about visiting Ukraine during the quarantine period can be found at the Ukrainian authorities’ Visit Ukraine webpage.
Exemptions
According to the resolution 1236 (9 December 2020) of the Ukrainian Government (Cabinet of Ministers), as updated on 25 October 2021, certain categories of foreign nationals are exempt from the insurance, PCR/RAT/express testing or vaccination requirements, and do not have to install the “Vdoma” app. These categories include foreign nationals who are:
recognised as refugees
accredited diplomats in Ukraine, or members of accredited diplomats’ families;
air, sea, and land transport crews, or
military personnel from NATO or “Partnership for Peace” countries taking part in exercises with the Ukrainian military
The full list of exemptions is available on Visit Ukraine.
Foreign nationals who are permanent residents of Ukraine are exempt from the insurance and PCR/RAT testing requirement, though they must provide a document confirming receipt of one or more doses of a recognised COVID-19 vaccine.
The final decision on a person’s eligibility to enter Ukraine rests with the Ukrainian State Border Service. The entry requirement policies of foreign governments are imposed and enforced at their discretion.
Check your passport and travel documents before you travel
You should check with your travel provider to make sure your passport and other travel documents meet their requirements.
Passport validity
If you’re travelling without a visa, your passport should be valid for the proposed duration of your stay. No additional period of validity beyond this is required. If you’re applying for a visa, your passport may need to have an additional period of validity. Check with the Ukrainian Embassy in London for further details.
Visas
British Citizen passport holders can enter Ukraine without a visa for visits of up to 90 days within a 180-day period. Ukraine has confirmed that this policy will continue to apply to British citizens until 30 January 2023.
If you’re planning to stay in Ukraine for longer than 90 days in a 180 day period, you need to get a visa. For more advice on entry requirements contact the Ukrainian Embassy in London or Consulate General in Edinburgh.
You will need to complete an immigration card. Immigration officials may require you to scan your fingerprints as part of biometric data collection at border crossing points. For more details, visit the website of the State Border Guard Service of Ukraine.
Proof of financial means
You may be asked to provide evidence that you have sufficient funds to support you during your stay. The Ukrainian authorities accept the following as a proof of sufficient funds: cash, bank cards along with bank statements, accommodation bookings, tourist vouchers, a letter from the person or company you’re visiting stating that they will cover your expenses, a return ticket or onward travel ticket. You can find more information on the websites of the Ukrainian Embassy in the UK  and State Border Service of Ukraine.
Borders
It is illegal under Ukrainian law to enter internationally recognised Ukrainian territory through a border point that isn’t currently controlled by the Ukrainian authorities. If you do so, you risk arrest or a fine, and you may be subject to a travel ban.
International border crossings that aren’t currently under the control of the Ukrainian authorities include all land border crossings into Donetsk oblast, many of the land border crossings into Luhansk oblast, all air and sea ports in Crimea and the Kerch Bridge road and rail crossing into Crimea.
If you intend to visit any of the areas not controlled by the Ukrainian authorities, you should apply to the State Migration Service of Ukraine for a special entry permit. Information on border crossing procedure, entry/exit regulations and checkpoints are provided at the State Border Guard Service of Ukraine website.
UK Emergency Travel Documents
UK Emergency Travel Documents are accepted for exit from Ukraine. Where possible, we are supporting individuals who have been unable to collect physical travel documents. You should expect increased documentation and safeguarding checks by border guards. You may wish to print copies of documentation to facilitate your crossing.
Customs regulations
You can find general information about importing and exporting items on the website of the State Customs Service of Ukraine  (in Ukrainian).
There are strict customs regulations governing the export from Ukraine of antiques and items of historical interest. If in doubt seek prior permission from the customs authorities.
Bringing your car to Ukraine
