Entry rules in response to coronavirus
Entry to Bahrain
Bahrain International Airport is open, including for transit and transfer passengers, and visas on arrival are available for UK nationals. The King Fahd Causeway is also open for travel between Saudi Arabia and Bahrain.
Since 20 February 2022 there is no PCR testing nor quarantine requirements for any arrivals regardless of their vaccination status, including those arriving via the Causeway.
Your airline may have their own boarding requirements and may be liable to move to a reduced service as appropriate depending on the COVID-19 situation. You should check with your airline for the most up to date information before travelling to Bahrain.
Entry rules are subject to change at short notice so travellers are advised to check Bahrain’s latest COVID-19 decisions, the Bahrain News Agency, and Bahrain’s Airport website for information on this and other updates.
Demonstrating your COVID-19 status
You do not need to demonstrate your COVID-19 status to enter Bahrain. If this changes, Bahrain has confirmed they will accept the UK’s proof of COVID-19 recovery and vaccination record. Your NHS appointment card from vaccination centres is not designed to be used as proof of vaccination and should not be used to demonstrate your vaccine status.
Transiting Bahrain
Transit and transfer passengers are permitted to use Bahrain International Airport without the requirement to undergo testing. You should check Bahrain’s visa portal for the most up to date information.
For travel from Bahrain to Saudi Arabia, check the latest travel information on the Saudi Arabia Travel Advice page.

There is no requirement to test for COVID-19 on arrival.
Quarantine requirements
There is no requirement to quarantine on arrival. However those who test positive for COVID-19 when in Bahrain are required to self-isolate at home or at their hotel as per the advice of the authorities. If necessary, COVID-19 health treatment will be given free of charge.
Regular entry requirements
Visas
Make sure you check the latest entry requirements with the Embassy of the Kingdom of Bahrain before you travel.
The Government of Bahrain reintroduced visas on-arrival across the Kingdom’s entry points from 4 September 2020. Travellers can also get a visa in advance, either online or from the Embassy of the Kingdom of Bahrain in the UK.
Holders of valid visas can enter Bahrain without the need for a letter of prior permission. This excludes visas issued on arrival at Bahrain’s ports and airports. Business visitors should bring a letter of invitation.
Visitors can be issued visas for various lengths up to 6 months, depending on their need and at the discretion of the Immigration Officer. You may be asked to provide evidence of onward or return travel. If you enter as a visitor you must not take up employment.
In Bahrain you can apply to renew your visa at the Nationality, Passports and Residential Affairs department at the Ministry of Interior. You can apply for residency through the Labour Market Regulatory Authority (LMRA). Individuals should enquire about their individual circumstances by visiting the NPRA website.
If you are currently a resident of Qatar you require a visa to enter the Kingdom of Bahrain. Visas can be applied for online. You should attach a copy of your Qatari residency card to the application. Failure to obtain a visa in advance will result in a refusal of entry into Bahrain. If intending to travel to Qatar from Bahrain, travellers should ensure they seek advice from airlines or tour operators.
Passport validity
Your passport should be valid for a minimum period of 6 months from the date of entry into Bahrain.
UK Emergency Travel Documents
UK Emergency Travel Documents (ETDs) are not valid for entry into Bahrain. However, ETDs are accepted for airside transit and exit from Bahrain, although an exit stamp is also required which can take one week to process. A police report is only needed if the previous passport was lost or stolen. Once the ETD is issued, an exit stamp is required from the Nationality, Passports and Residence Affairs Agency (NPRA). This is only available via online request. This process requires a copy of the ETD, flight ticket and a complete Service Form. This form will need to be completed and stamped by the employer or sponsor (please ensure all sections on the form are completed). Please allow up to one week for the production of the exit stamp. British Nationals cannot exit Bahrain without this immigration stamp.
Yellow fever certificate requirements
Check whether you need a yellow fever certificate by visiting the National Travel Health Network and Centre’s TravelHealthPro website.
Exit requirements
You must have legal status in Bahrain when you leave. You may be prevented from leaving Bahrain if you are subject to a travel ban, involved in legal proceedings, have unpaid debt, or are a child subject to a custody dispute. You can be fined if you overstay or fail to extend your legal residency.
