Crime
The vast majority of visits are trouble-free and crime levels are low, but you should take sensible precautions to protect yourself and your belongings. Don’t accept lifts from strangers. Use only licensed taxis or other recognised forms of public transport. If using apps, check licence plates and confirm with drivers the passenger name. Let someone know you are on the way home and the registration details of the car.
Female visitors and residents should take care when walking or travelling alone, and should use a reputable taxi company, particularly at night.
Personal attacks, including sexual assault and rape, are relatively rare, but do happen. If the alleged attacker is found guilty, sentences can be severe. However, Qatari law places a high burden of proof on the victim to demonstrate that the sexual relations were not consensual, especially when the victim consumed alcohol or where the alleged attacker was known to the victim. If the sexual relations are determined to have been consensual, either individual may still face prosecution for the offence of sex outside of marriage in certain circumstances. See Local Laws and customs page.
If you’re a victim of sexual assault, contact the British Embassy (00974 4496 2000) at the earliest opportunity for guidance about local procedures.
Road travel
You should obtain a 1968 International Driving Permit (IDP) if you plan to drive on your UK licence. You can only get IDPs over the counter from 2,500 UK Post Offices. You will not be able to buy an IDP outside the UK, so get one before you travel.
You can drive in Qatar with a valid UK driving licence for up to 6 months (with a valid IDP). If you’re staying longer than 6 months, you will need to apply for a Qatari driving licence and sit both the theory and practical tests.
If you’re planning to hire a car, check in advance what documents and information the car hire company will need.
If you’re living in Qatar, check the Living in Qatar guide for information on licence requirements for residents.
Road discipline is very poor; speeds are high and accidents are common. If you have an accident, stay with your vehicle until the police arrive and tell you that you may leave. It’s an offence to leave the scene of the accident, but if no one has been injured and it’s safe to do so, you can move your vehicle to a safer place. You’ll need to get a police report for insurance purposes.
The driver and front seat passenger must wear a seat belt at all times. You must not use a mobile phone while driving. Even minor expressions of ‘road rage’ like rude gestures can attract significant penalties. Offenders may be fined, imprisoned and/or deported. You may be banned from leaving the country until your case has been resolved.  More serious cases may take up to 6 months to be heard. Driving in Qatar is on the right hand side. Flashing your lights in Qatar can mean a driver is coming through, rather than giving way.
Excursions to the desert can be hazardous unless in a properly equipped 4 x 4 vehicle. Always travel in convoy with other cars, take a supply of water and a mobile telephone, and leave travel plans with friends or relatives.
It’s an offence in Qatar to drink and drive, and there is zero tolerance for it. Driving under the influence of alcohol is punishable by a custodial sentence of between one month and three years, a fine of QAR10,000 to QAR50,000, or both. Offenders may also be deported.
Check the MeTrash2 app before heading to the airport for any trip, as any outstanding traffic violations will be listed here. An outstanding violation may result in you being detained at immigration and denied onward travel. Fines for all violations should be settled in full before you travel.
Sea travel
Many areas of the Gulf are highly sensitive, including near maritime boundaries and the islands of Abu Musa and the Tunbs in the southern Gulf. Vessels entering these areas have been detained and inspected, and there have been occasional arrests. You should make careful enquiries before entering these waters or visiting ports.
Regional tensions may also affect your route. Vessels operating in the Gulf of Oman, Northern Arabian Sea, Gulf of Aden and Bab El Mandeb regions may be at increased risk of maritime attack.
Take care when travelling by Dhow, as the safety of these vessels may not be up to UK standards. Make sure life jackets are available.
Political situation
Regional developments continue to have an impact on local public opinion in the region. You should be aware of local sensitivities on these issues. You should follow news reports and avoid public gatherings and demonstrations. There is the potential for increased tension on Fridays.
In the event of any incidents, you should monitor local media reports and follow the advice of the local authorities.
