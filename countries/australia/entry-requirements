The information on this page covers the most common types of travel and reflects the UK government’s understanding of the rules currently in place. Unless otherwise stated, this information is for travellers using a full ‘British Citizen’ passport.
The authorities in the country or territory you’re travelling to are responsible for setting and enforcing the rules for entry. If you’re unclear about any aspect of the entry requirements, or you need further reassurance, you’ll need to contact the embassy, high commission or consulate of the country or territory you’re travelling to.
You should also consider checking with your transport provider or travel company to make sure your passport and other travel documents meet their requirements.
Restrictions in response to coronavirus
Entry to Australia
You will need to apply for a visa via special exemption to be able to travel to Australia – normal visa applications are no longer accepted. Only Australian citizens and returning permanent residents and their immediate family members are permitted to enter Australia without an exemption until further notice.
Travellers who have a compassionate or compelling reason to enter or transit through Australia can apply to the Australian authorities for an exemption. There are a limited number of categories for exemption.
You should provide as much documentary evidence as you can to support your application for an exemption. For further information on the exemption categories and documentation required, see the Department of Home Affairs website.
The Department of Home Affairs is experiencing high levels of demand for exemptions and there is no guarantee of either the timing of a decision or the outcome. You should make your application as early as possible and provide full supporting documentation.
All travellers entering Australia need to undertake a mandatory 14-day quarantine at a designated facility (for example a hotel) at their port of arrival. This is provided by the Australian government and is free of charge, except in the Northern Territory. You may face a range of penalties for non-compliance.
Transit
Almost all travellers seeking to transit through Australia need to apply for, and be granted,an exemption in advance. You will need to provide evidence that you have connecting flights booked in advance within a strict timeframe. You will also need a valid visa. See the Department of Home Affairs website for further details on transiting Australia, including the criteria for exemptions and how to apply.
If your exemption application is granted, you will be able to enter Australia for purposes of transit for up to 72 hours.
If you transit period of up to 8 hours can remain airside throughout at the airport. You must maintain social distancing, cough etiquette and hand hygiene.
If your transit period is between 8 to 72 hours, you must secure an additional exemption from Australia’s 14-day quarantine arrangements issued by the relevant State health authority. You must apply for that in advance of your travel by email. Supporting information and details on how to apply can be found on the Department of Health website. here. You will also need a valid visa. You can apply for a Transit subclass 771 visa online on the Department of Home Affairs website.
If you are transiting for longer than 8 hours, you will be directed on arrival in Australia to a quarantine facility by Australian authorities. You will be required to remain there until proceeding to the airport for your departing flight. You will not be required to make your own quarantine or transport arrangements: these are handled by local authorities.
If you plan to travel or transit on from Australia, check the latest entry restrictions for your destination and keep in touch with your airline, cruise line or tour operator before you travel.
Existing visas and extensions
Latest COVID-19 guidance on visa conditions and potential extensions is available on the Department of Home Affairs website. The guidance is clear that any visa application will be assessed considering the COVID-19 enhanced border measures and the applicant’s individual circumstances. Applications for new visas should be made before a current visa expires, and if a current visa holder has a “no further stay” condition, a request to waive this condition must be made.
Regular entry requirements
Visas
Subject to current restrictions, British citizens can usually get the following types of electronic visitor visa:
eVisitor visa direct from the Department of Immigration & Border Protection. There is no visa application charge or service fee for this
Electronic Travel Authority (ETA) via your travel agent or airline. There is no visa application charge, but a service fee of A$20 applies
Information on all other types of visa is available from the Department of Immigration & Border Protection, or from the Australian High Commission in London.
If you hold an ePassport you can use SmartGate to pass through passport control when arriving in Australia. See the Australian Border Force website for more information.
Working holiday visa
If you’re on a working holiday visa you should be aware of your rights as employees in Australia and how to report any concerns about unfair or unlawful treatment.
Thousands of British working holiday makers travel to Australia each year with the vast majority enjoying their stay without issue. Working conditions, accommodation and medical facilities are generally of a good standard.
In October 2016 the Fair Work Ombudsman published a report following an inquiry into the wages and conditions of people working under the working holiday visa program, which highlighted exploitative workplace cultures where unreasonable and unlawful requirements were being imposed in some isolated and remote workplaces. If you have concerns about your workplace conditions or treatment you can contact the Fair Work Ombudsman on 13 13 94. You can also report concerns to them anonymously.
If you feel you’re being treated unfairly or unlawfully by an employer, you can email the UK’s National Crime Agency (NCA) at the British High Commission in Canberra at: Australia.WHVreferrals@fco.gov.uk. The NCA is working with a number of Australian authorities to help identify and address any illegal employer behaviour affecting British nationals.
For further information and advice, see our working holiday makers booklet.
Passport validity
For entry into Australia, your passport should be valid for the proposed duration of your stay. No additional period of validity beyond this is required.
If you are transiting another country on your way to or from Australia, make sure you check the entry requirements for that country. Many countries will only permit entry if you have at least 6 months validity remaining on your passport.
Dual nationals
If you’re a British national living in Australia with Australian citizenship, or you’re a dual national, you should leave and enter Australia on your Australian passport, otherwise you may face difficulties and delays. For more information, see the Department of Foreign Affairs & Trade’s website. Please see the Coronavirus page for more information on current restrictions on dual nationals leaving Australia.
