Coronavirus
Cases of coronavirus (COVID-19) have been confirmed in Argentina. The Argentine authorities have introduced a number of measures to limit the spread of the virus:
• A nationwide quarantine will be in place from midnight on Thursday 19 March to midnight on Tuesday 31 March. During this period, people will only be able to leave their homes to buy necessities, such as medicines or foodstuffs, in their local area. Anyone found outside their home without justification will be charged with committing a public health crime.
• The government has closed the country’s borders for all those entering except for Argentine citizens and resident foreign nationals.
• There is 30-day suspension, from 12 March, of all international flights from the UK (as well as the whole of Europe, the US, China, Japan, South Korea and Iran) to Argentina.
• From midnight on 19 March to midnight on 24 March, all internal flights and long distance trains and buses will be cancelled. Local buses and trains in metropolitan Buenos Aires will only allow seated passengers from 19 March to 31 March. These regulations are subject to change at short notice and you should check with your travel provider before your journey. Further information is also available on the Argentine Ministry of Health website (in Spanish).
Further information on coronavirus, including advice on preparing for foreign travel and helping reduce the spread of the virus, is available from Public Health England and on the TravelHealthPro website.

General Health
At least 8 weeks before your trip, check the latest country-specific health advice from the National Travel Health Network and Centre (NaTHNaC) on the TravelHealthPro website. Each country-specific page has information on vaccine recommendations, any current health risks or outbreaks, and factsheets with information on staying healthy abroad. Guidance is also available from NHS (Scotland) on the FitForTravel website.
General information on travel vaccinations and a travel health checklist is available on the NHS website. You may then wish to contact your health adviser or pharmacy for advice on other preventive measures and managing any pre-existing medical conditions while you’re abroad.
The legal status and regulation of some medicines prescribed or purchased in the UK can be different in other countries. If you’re travelling with prescription or over-the-counter medicine, read this guidance from NaTHNaC on best practice when travelling with medicines. For further information on the legal status of a specific medicine, you’ll need to contact the embassy, high commission or consulate of the country or territory you’re travelling to.
While travel can be enjoyable, it can sometimes be challenging. There are clear links between mental and physical health, so looking after yourself during travel and when abroad is important. Information on travelling with mental health conditions is available in our guidance page. Further information is also available from the National Travel Health Network and Centre (NaTHNaC).

Local medical care
If you need emergency medical assistance during your trip, dial 107 or 911 and ask for an ambulance. You should contact your insurance/medical assistance company promptly if you are referred to a medical facility for treatment.
Medical facilities are good, but can be expensive. Public hospitals tend to be crowded. Make sure you have adequate travel health insurance and accessible funds to cover the cost of any medical treatment abroad and repatriation. If you have a specific condition, bring a sufficient quantity of medical supplies and medicines with you.
