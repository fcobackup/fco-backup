Entry rules in response to coronavirus
Entry to Slovakia
There are travel restrictions for travellers from the UK and most other countries.
From 1 January 2021, only those people who are resident in Slovakia, close relatives of residents, commercial transport personnel, students studying in Slovakia or those falling under certain limited exemptions may enter the country if they arrive directly from the UK or any other non-Schengen country which is not on Slovakia’s list of low-risk countries. The above restriction does not apply for UK nationals who enter Slovakia via the land borders with Hungary, Austria, Czech Republic or Poland, or who fly from any country in the Schengen area.
For full details of entry requirements and a list of exemptions, you should check the Slovak Foreign Ministry website.
Unless you have spent all of the previous 14 days in a country on Slovakia’s list of low risk countries (as listed on the Ministry of Foreign Affairs’ website) you must:
register in advance of travel or at the border on the Slovak Government’s website and present your completed registration to border officials if asked.
once registered, the authorities will contact you to arrange a free RT-PCR test for COVID-19.
if you arrive in Slovakia by air, you also need to complete the Slovak government’s Passenger Locator Form and present a printout to border officials.
you should enter self-isolation immediately after arrival. If you are self-isolating at a private residence, anyone living in the same household must also self-isolate.
if you have spent time in the UK in the 14 days prior to your arrival into Slovakia the earliest you may take a PCR test to end self-isolation is 5 days after arrival.
after you receive a negative test result, you may end your self-isolation. If you spent the 14 days prior to your arrival in Slovakia exclusively in an EU country, you may end your self-isolation after 10 days without waiting for your negative test result, if you have no symptoms. For other countries, including the UK, you must complete 14 days of self-isolation if you do not receive a negative test result. Failure to comply with these requirements may result in a fine of up to 5,000 euros.
If you have spent the previous 14 days in Switzerland, EU or EEA countries and can show a negative RT-PCR test for COVID-19 which is no older than 72 hours, you do not need to register with the Public Health Authority, or enter self-isolation. A negative COVID-19 antigen test completed in Austria or the Czech Republic and no older than 72 hours is also accepted. You must carry your test results with you during your stay in case the authorities ask for it.
From 7 December, if you are a cross-border worker (also known as ‘Pendlers’ or ‘Frontier Workers’) or you regularly cross the border, you must show a negative RT-PCR test or antigen test no older than 14 days.
From 18 December, short cross-border trips to take a passenger to an airport in Austria, Hungary, Czech Republic or Poland are exempt from testing requirements on return to Slovakia. The driver must register in advance and be able to show evidence of the passenger’s flight. More information (in Slovak) on the Foreign Ministry website.
The above information applies to UK nationals arriving by air or across land borders with Austria, Czech Republic, Hungary and Poland.
Entry into Slovakia from Ukraine is limited to certain categories of foreign traveller:

Regular entry requirements
Visas
If you hold a British Citizen passport, you don’t need a visa to enter Slovakia. If you’re planning a stay of longer than 3 months, see our Living in Slovakia guide and contact the Slovak Embassy if you have further questions.
The rules on travel will stay the same until 31 December 2020.
Visas from 1 January 2021
The rules for travelling or working in Europe will change from 1 January 2021:
you will be able to travel to countries in the Schengen area for up to 90 days in any 180-day period without a visa as a tourist, to visit family or friends, to attend business meetings, cultural or sports events, or for short-term studies or training.
if you are travelling to Slovakia and other Schengen countries without a visa, make sure your whole visit is within the limit. Visits to Schengen countries within the previous 180 days before you travel would count towards the 90-day limit
to stay for longer, to work or study, for business travel or for other reasons, you will need to meet the entry requirements set out by Slovakia. This could mean applying for a visa and/or work permit. You should check with the Slovak Embassy what type of visa and/or work permit, if any, you will need
if you are in Slovakia with a visa or permit, your stay will not count towards the 90-day limit
The 90-day limit for visa-free travel will begin on 1 January 2021. Any days you stay in Slovakia or other Schengen countries before 1 January 2021 will not count towards the 90-day limit.

show a return or onward ticket
show you have enough money for your stay, and
use separate lanes from EU, EEA and Swiss citizens when queueing
Your passport may be stamped on entry and exit.
Passport validity  
The rules on travel will stay the same until 31 December 2020.
Your passport should be valid for the proposed duration of your stay; you do not need any additional period of validity on your passport beyond this.
Make sure your passport is in a presentable state before you travel. The Slovak authorities can refuse entry if your passport is worn or damaged, or looks as if it’s been tampered with.
Passport validity from 1 January 2021
From 1 January 2021, you must have at least 6 months left on an adult or child passport to travel to most countries in Europe (not including Ireland).
If you renewed your current passport before the previous one expired, extra months may have been added to its expiry date. Any extra months on your passport over 10 years may not count towards the 6 months needed.
Check your passport is valid for travel before you book your trip. You will need to renew your passport before travelling if you do not have enough time left on your passport.
Registering with the Slovak authorities
If you plan to stay in Slovakia for a longer period of time, you should register with the police within 3 days of arrival. You’ll need your passport, 2 photographs and proof of accommodation. You’ll have an option to apply for a Slovak ‘green card’, which can be used as proof of your ID, while your passport is kept in a safe place. Visit the website of Ministry of Interior of the Slovak Republic for further information.
UK Emergency Travel Documents
UK Emergency Travel Documents (ETDs) are accepted for entry, airside transit and exit from Slovakia. They are also accepted for a return to Slovakia if you normally live there.
