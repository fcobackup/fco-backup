Crime
Street crime is extremely rare. However, you should take the usual precautions with passports and money.
Drinks served in bars overseas are often stronger than those in the UK. Do not accept drinks from strangers or leave drinks unattended.
Road travel
From 28 March 2019, you will need to have a 1968 International Driving Permit (IDP) to drive in San Marino. 1949 IDPs previously issued by the UK will still be valid for use in San Marino until expiry. From 1 February 2019, you can only get IDPs over the counter from 2,500 UK Post Offices. You will not be able to buy an IDP outside the UK, so get one before you travel.”
Driving is on the right-hand side of the road. It’s a legal requirement for motorists to carry one red warning triangle to be placed, in the event of an accident or breakdown, behind the vehicle.  
You should also carry a certificate of car insurance.
At the time of entering the country, car insurance must be valid for more than three months.
