Travel may be subject to entry restrictions
A landing ban is in place for all flights from the UK to Austria until 21 February
All travellers arriving in Austria from the UK must fill in a pre-travel clearance online form and quarantine for 10 days upon arrival. You have the option of taking a self-funded PCR or antigen test after 5 days (your day of arrival counts as day 0). If your result is negative, you will no longer need to stay in quarantine
