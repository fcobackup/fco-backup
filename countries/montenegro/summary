The Foreign, Commonwealth & Development Office (FCDO) advises against all but essential travel to:
The whole of Montenegro based on the current assessment of COVID-19 risks.
Travel to Montenegro is subject to entry restrictions
Visitors travelling from all countries except those bordering Montenegro require a negative PCR test taken within 72 hours of travel or proof of vaccination against COVID-19 to enter Montenegro. Montenegrin citizens and holders of Montenegrin residence permits can enter Montenegro without such a test but will be required to self-isolate or quarantine for 14 days.
If you notice symptoms of a respiratory infection you must follow the guidelines of the Institute of Public Health, which include contacting a local epidemiological service. The guidance and contact details of epidemiological services are available in English from the Institute of Public Health.
See Entry requirements for more information before you plan to travel.
