Be prepared for your plans to change
No travel is risk-free during COVID. Countries may further restrict travel or bring in new rules at short notice, for example due to a new COVID-19 variant. Check with your travel company or airline for any transport changes which may delay your journey home.
If you test positive for COVID-19, you may need to stay where you are until you test negative. You may also need to seek treatment there.
Plan ahead and make sure you:
can access money
understand what your insurance will cover
can make arrangements to extend your stay and be away for longer than planned

COVID-19 vaccines if you live in Sudan
We will update this page when the Government of Sudan announces new information on the national vaccination programme. You can sign up to get email notifications when this page is updated.
The Sudanese national vaccination programme started in March 2021 using the AstraZeneca vaccine, and from July 2021 vaccination centres are now administering the Sinopharm vaccine. British nationals resident in Sudan are eligible for vaccination if they choose to join the programme. The Sudanese Ministry of Health has confirmed that the initial phase of the rollout, which applied to all nationalities over 60 years old, has now been extended to include those over 45 years old presenting either a passport or national ID. British nationals in Sudan can find out more about the local vaccine programme as publicised on the Sudanese Ministry of Health website, where there is a section marked “Foreigners”.
Find out more, including about vaccines that are authorised in the UK or approved by the World Health Organisation, on the COVID-19 vaccines if you live abroad.
If you’re a British national living in Sudan, you should seek medical advice from your local healthcare provider. Information about COVID-19 vaccines used in the national programme where you live, including regulatory status, should be available from local authorities.
