The Italian authorities have introduced measures in response to the coronavirus (COVID-19) pandemic. If you’re in Italy, follow the advice of the Italian authorities.
The Italian authorities have advised against travel for tourism purposes throughout Italy, and that tourists already on holiday in Italy should limit their movements to those necessary to return to the place where they live.
Travel to Italy is possible for emergency purposes only. Travellers arriving in Italy from abroad are obliged to self-isolate for 14 days, even if they have no symptoms. They should also complete a self-declaration (“autodichiarazione”) stating the purpose of their trip to Italy and report promptly to local health authorities (more information on all these requirements is available via the Ministry of Foreign Affairs FAQ).
