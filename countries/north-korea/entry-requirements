You should also consider checking with your transport provider or travel company to make sure your passport and other travel documents meet their requirements.

Visas
You will need a visa to enter North Korea. For further information contact the Embassy of the Democratic People’s Republic of Korea (DPRK) in London.
You must register with the Ministry of Foreign Affairs if your visit is for more than 24 hours. Most hotels will automatically complete this process on your behalf.

Your passport should be valid for the proposed duration of your stay. No additional period of validity beyond this is required.

Travelling with children
Single parents or other adults travelling alone with children should be aware that some countries need documentary evidence of parental responsibility before allowing lone parents to enter the country, or in some cases, before permitting the children to leave the country.
