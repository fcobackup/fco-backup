Returning to the UK
Travelling from and returning to the UK
Check what you must do to travel abroad and return to England, Scotland, Wales or Northern Ireland.
If you plan to pass through another country to return to the UK, check the travel advice for the country you’re transiting. If you will pass through a red list country, book your hotel quarantine package before travelling to the UK.
You are responsible for organising your own COVID-19 test, in line with UK government testing requirements. The National Institute of Public Health in Phnom Penh is able to provide a health certificate for travel; other health providers may be available. You can also call the COVID-19 hotline on 119 for advice.
Be prepared for your plans to change
No travel is risk-free during COVID. Countries may further restrict travel or bring in new rules at short notice, for example due to a new COVID-19 variant. Check with your travel company or airline for any transport changes which may delay your journey home.
If you test positive for COVID-19, you may need to stay where you are until you test negative. You may also need to seek treatment there.
Plan ahead and make sure you:
can access money
understand what your insurance will cover
can make arrangements to extend your stay and be away for longer than planned

Hotel and private rental accommodation is available throughout Cambodia. Some hotels have closed and remain so, and we advise that you contact hotels directly when booking. The majority of hotels will ask to take your temperature on arrival and ask you to complete a declaration in relation to your recent travel history and whether you have any symptoms related to COVID-19.
Some services and facilities in hotels may not be available e.g. leisure facilities.

Many medications that would require a prescription in the UK can be bought over-the-counter in Cambodia. However, you may not find a brand you are familiar with and many pharmacies sell counterfeit or out of date products. The main branch of Pharmacie de la Gare in Phnom Penh can provide medications without a prescription and can deliver medications across the country. Before you travel, you should discuss with your doctor alternative brands of medication for your condition.

COVID-19 vaccines if you live in Cambodia
We will update this page when the Royal Government of Cambodia announces new information on the national vaccination programme. You can sign up to get email notifications when this page is updated.
The Cambodian national vaccination programme started in February 2021 and is using the Sinopharm, Sinovac, AstraZeneca (Covishield) and Janssen (Johnson and Johnson) vaccines. The Royal Government of Cambodia has stated that British nationals resident and working in Cambodia are eligible for vaccination if they choose to join the programme. There is no need to register with the British Embassy. You should visit your local sangkat office for details on local vaccination sites and schedules. Cambodia is currently offering a vaccine to anyone under 18 years old.
