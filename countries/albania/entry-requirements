If you’re unclear about any aspect of the entry requirements, or you need further reassurance, you’ll need to contact the embassy, high commission or consulate of the country or territory you’re travelling to.
You should also consider checking with your transport provider or travel company to make sure your passport and other travel documents meet their requirements.
Entry rules in response to coronavirus (COVID-19)
Land borders are open with the exception of the border with Montenegro which remains closed until a further notice from the Montenegrin authorities.
If you are a British national with a Greek residence and are travelling to Greece from Albania you must complete an online Passenger Locator Form (PLF) (in English) at least 48 hours before your arrival in Greece. You may also have to comply with other requirements from the Greek authorities, including testing and self-isolation.
Keep up to date with information from your tour operator, transport or accommodation provider on the impact on any existing travel plans. If you need further information about entry requirements, contact the local immigration authorities or the nearest Albanian Embassy/Consulate.
