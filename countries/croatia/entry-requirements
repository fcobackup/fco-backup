Entry rules in response to coronavirus
Entry to Croatia
On 21 July 2021, Croatian authorities announced that from Monday 26 July 2021 all travellers from the UK must present a negative COVID-19 antigen test which must not be older than 48 hours or a negative PCR test no older than 72 hours on arrival, regardless of their vaccination status.
UK nationals travelling to Croatia from countries other than the UK, Cyprus, Russia, South Africa, Brazil or Zanzibar may present one of the following documents on arrival:
a negative COVID-19 antigen not older than 48 hours, or;
a negative PCR test result not older than 72 hours, or;
proof of a vaccination, or;
a doctor’s certificate of recovery following a positive test result between 11 and 180 days prior). (See ‘Demonstrating your COVID-19 vaccination status’).
Children under 12 and accompanied by a parent/guardian are exempt from the requirement to present a negative test result, and to self-isolate, if the parent or guardian has one of the documents set out above. Details of further exemptions from the requirements set out above are available here and include for example passengers transiting Croatia in under 12 hours.
If you do not have one of the documents listed above, and are not subject to a specific exemption, you will be required to take a PCR test or rapid antigen test upon arrival in Croatia. You need to self-isolate until the results of a negative test are received. Upon entry to Croatia, you will be handed instructions regarding the conditions for self isolation, which will include details about ending your self-isolation through a negative test. See more information about testing centres in Croatia. In the case of a rapid antigen test, if you stay in Croatia for longer than 10 days, a rapid antigen test must be repeated within 10 days from the date of issuing the first test.
If you travel to another country after receiving a negative PCR (72 hours validity) test or rapid antigen test (48 hours validity) in Croatia and return back to Croatia within less than 48 or 72 hours (for PCR) from the date of testing, you will not be required to provide a new test from the country you travelled to.
Additional documents for entry
You will need to complete an online entry form before you travel to Croatia.
You should carry a copy of your accommodation booking or proof of ownership of holiday homes / boats when arriving in Croatia. If you are travelling to Croatia for business, you should carry evidence of a business invitation or meetings.
Demonstrating your COVID-19 vaccination status
Croatia will accept either certificate of completion of a two dose vaccine course (Pfizer, Moderna, AstraZeneca, Gamaleya, Sinopharm) or a certificate of receipt of a one dose vaccine (Janssen, Johnson & Johnson). In both cases immunization must have been completed 14 days prior to arrival. Alternatively Croatia will accept a doctor’s certificate of recovery within the previous 6 months, alongside proof of a first dose of Pfizer, Moderna, AstraZeneca, Gamaleya, Sinopharm if administered less than 180 days of arrival.
Croatia will accept the UK’s solutions to demonstrate your COVID vaccination status. Your NHS appointment card from vaccination centres is not designed to be used as proof of vaccination and should not be used to demonstrate your vaccine status.
Travelling to Croatia from South Africa, Brazil, India or Zanzibar
There are additional restrictions if you are travelling to Croatia from South Africa, Brazil, India or Zanzibar. In addition to holding a negative PCR test result taken within 48 hours prior to arrival, permitted travellers must also undergo a mandatory 14 day self-isolation period on arrival to Croatia. The isolation period can be reduced to 7 days if a subsequent PCR test confirms a negative result.
Details of eligibility to travel, possible exemptions, and instructions for arrivals including approved rapid antigen tests are available from the Croatian Ministry of Interior. PCR tests are available at most Croatian airports – travellers should check this with the specific airports they are travelling to. Those seeking a test on arrival will need to contact a clinic directly and may temporarily leave their accommodation to attend a test appointment. See more information about testing centres in Croatia. Tests cost approximately 700 Croatian Kuna and results are generally available within 48 hours.
Entering if you own property in Croatia
If you own property in Croatia, you will be allowed to enter Croatia if you have a title deed (or purchase contract, other written proof of ownership, vessels anchored in Croatia) and an EU Digital COVID Certificate, a negative PCR test result not older than 72 hours (from sampling to arrival at the border crossing) or a rapid antigen test result for COVID-19 not older than 48 hours (from sampling to arrival at the border crossing point); or if you perform PCR or rapid antigen testing immediately upon arrival in Croatia and stay in self-isolation until receiving a negative test result
