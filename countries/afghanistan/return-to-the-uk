Future travel options
The UK government is working closely with airlines and other governments to identify options for returning to the UK.
If you are trying to leave Afghanistan, register your details with the British Embassy Kabul and we will be in touch if flight options become available. You should also sign up for travel advice email alerts and follow the British Embassy on Twitter. Keep also checking local media and with local travel agents and airlines for the most up to date information on the resumption of flight operations.
See more information and advice about staying in Afghanistan if you cannot return to the UK.
You will need to pay for your return travel to the UK. If departure options are available but you cannot afford the travel costs and have exhausted all other options for getting funds, you may be eligible to apply for an emergency loan from the government. This is a last resort option and you would need to repay the loan when you are back in the UK. For more information, you should contact Corporate Travel Management (CTM). CTM are a commercial partner of the FCO and are authorised to administer such loans on behalf of the FCO.
For questions about travel insurance, contact your insurance provider and if you’re not happy with their response, you can complain to the Financial Ombudsman Service.
