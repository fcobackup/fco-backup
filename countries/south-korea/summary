With effect from 28 September 2018, changes to Korean Traffic Law come into effect, including:
All passengers in vehicles must wear seat belts including in rear seats. City buses that are not fitted with seat belts are exempt from this regulation.
Drivers will be required to take precautionary measures when parking on hills/slopes (such as placing stops behind each wheel, or turning the steering wheel to ensure that the front wheels of the vehicle are angled towards the kerb).
Further information can be found in the Korean Road Traffic Act (changes to the text of the current law are highlighted in blue). Anyone seeking additional advice should contact the Korean police authority.
The level of tension on the Korean peninsula grew considerably in 2017 due to a series of North Korean nuclear and missile tests. On 21 April 2018, North Korea announced a halt to nuclear and intercontinental ballistic missile testing.
Since the start of 2018, there has been a renewal of direct contact between the North and South Korean governments, as well as between North Korea and the United States. Under the Panmunjom Declaration signed at the inter-Korean summit on 27 April, South Korea and North Korea pledged to agree a peace treaty formally to end the Korean War, alongside a number of other commitments to build inter-Korean ties and reduce military tensions. On 12 June, US President Donald Trump met North Korean leader Kim Jong Un in Singapore. In a joint statement, North Korea reaffirmed its previous commitment to the denuclearisation of the Korean peninsula.
In the past, periods of diplomatic engagement have failed to be sustained. This has led to further missile or nuclear tests by North Korea and a return to instability in the region. The level of tension and the security situation can therefore still change with little notice. Tensions usually rise around the time of South Korean-US military exercises. In the past, heightened tensions haven’t affected daily life. See Political situation
