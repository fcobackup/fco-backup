Bahrain is a socially liberal state, but many Bahrainis are conservative.
Respect local traditions, customs, laws and religions at all times and be aware of your actions to ensure that they don’t offend, especially during the holy month of Ramadan and Shia religious festivals. Bahrainis observe some religious anniversaries that may not be celebrated in neighbouring Gulf countries.
In 2019, the holy month of Ramadan is expected to start on 6 May and finish on 4 June. See Travelling during Ramadan. You should respect local traditions, customs, laws and religions at all times and be aware that there may be legal penalties associated with non-compliance during the month of Ramadan.
Dress conservatively in public places, especially religious sites.
Don’t bring video cassettes or DVDs into the country. They may be withheld on arrival at the airport.
Bahraini law doesn’t criminalise same sex-activity between consenting adults who are at least 21 years of age, although sodomy is illegal. Bahrain is a liberal country compared with most others in the region, but many Bahrainis hold conservative social views. There are some reported cases of individuals punished for same-sexual activity, but in practice arrests for homosexual behaviour are relatively rare. See our information and advice page for the LGBT community before you travel.
All residents and visitors must carry photographic ID. Under Bahraini law, it’s an offence not to be able to present photographic ID if you’re asked to do so by a member of the Bahraini authorities, and you may be subject to a fine of up to 300BHD.
