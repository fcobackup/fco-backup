Entry and borders
See Entry requirements to find out what you will need to do when you arrive in Taiwan.
Public spaces and services
Starting from 1st December 2020, face masks must be worn in the following types of public venues: healthcare facilities, public transportation, places of consumption, learning facilities, sports and exhibition venues, entertainment venues, religious and places of worship, offices and business venues. Members of the public who do not wear a face mask as required and refuse to wear a mask after being advised to do so will be fined up to NT$15,000.
If individuals choose to dine at the above-mentioned public venues, as long as social distancing is maintained or partitions are installed inside those locations, masks can be temporarily removed while eating.
Travel in Taiwan
There are no domestic travel restrictions in Taiwan.
Travelling to and from the airport
On arrival in Taiwan, you will be required to take an allocated taxi to your self-isolation destination. For more information about self-isolation see Entry requirements.
Taxis and public transport systems are operating normally in Taiwan. The wearing of face masks is mandatory on all public transport. If you use public transport and are not wearing a face mask, you may be fined up to NT$15,000. Be aware that some taxi drivers may refuse to take a passenger who is not wearing a face mask.
Accommodation
Only a limited number of designated quarantine hotels may host self-isolating travellers. If you are planning to stay in a hotel to complete the self-isolation period, you should confirm that a room is available and that it meets your requirements prior to travelling.
Due to an increased number of travellers now entering Taiwan, demand for the limited number of hotels permitted to host self-isolating travellers has increased, and you may find it difficult to find accommodation at short notice.
For a list of designated quarantine hotels in Taipei, please visit Taipei City Government’s FAQ page. If you are planning to stay in a hotel outside of Taipei, you may need to contact the local authority in that area prior to booking or making final arrangements. For more information and contact details, please visit the Taiwan Tourism Bureau’s ‘Taiwan Stay’ website.
If you have access to private accommodation in Taiwan, you may choose to self-isolate there rather than in a hotel. You should confirm that you will be permitted to self-isolate in your preferred accommodation before travelling.
Healthcare in Taiwan
