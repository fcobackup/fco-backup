Future travel options
If you wish to leave DRC, you should also register your interest to leave by email to Kinshasa.Consular@fco.gov.uk.
You will need to pay for your return travel to the UK. If departure options are available but you cannot afford the travel costs and have exhausted all other options for getting funds, you may be eligible to apply for an emergency loan from the government. This is a last resort option and you would need to repay the loan when you are back in the UK.
For more information on applying for an emergency loan for the Air France special flight please email Kinshasa.Consular@fco.gov.uk.
If you cannot leave Democratic Republic of Congo
If you cannot leave DRC at this time, see advice on staying in DRC during coronavirus.
