The authorities in the country or territory you’re travelling to are responsible for setting and enforcing the rules for entry. If you’re unclear about any aspect of the entry requirements, or you need further reassurance, you’ll need to contact the embassy, high commission or consulate of the country or territory you’re travelling to.

Entry rules in response to coronavirus (COVID-19)
Entry to Mauritius and quarantine requirements
From midnight local time on 21 December, the Government of Mauritius has, in response to the COVID-19 situation, advised that individuals who have been in the UK within the previous 15 days will not be allowed entry to Mauritius. On 8 January, the Government of Mauritius announced that this measure will be in force until at least 31 January 2021.
Since 1 October, to enter Mauritius, you must:
Book airline travel and accommodation via the official Mauritian Tourism Promotion Agency website.
Undergo a period of “in room” quarantine in a government-approved hotel on a full board basis for 14 days on arrival.
Take a COVID-19 test no more than 7 days before your departure for Mauritius and demonstrate a negative test result on entry. You should not use the NHS testing service to get a test in order to facilitate your travel to another country. You should arrange to take a private test.
Take a COVID-19 test on the day of arrival, and on day 7 and day 14 of your stay. If at any point, you receive a positive test result, you will be transferred to a public medical facility for treatment.
Regular entry requirements
Visas
You don’t need a visa to enter Mauritius. On arrival, your passport will be stamped allowing entry to the country for 60 days. You’ll need to be able to provide evidence of onward or return travel.
If you intend to work in Mauritius, you must get a work permit before you travel.
The Mauritian immigration services have confirmed that foreign nationals in Mauritius on a tourist entry do not need to extend their “leave to stay” period (as stamped in your passport on arrival) if it is due to expire during the current confinement period.
Passport validity
Your passport should be valid for the proposed duration of your stay. No additional period of validity beyond this is required. It should have at least one blank passport page.
UK Emergency Travel Documents
UK Emergency Travel Documents (ETDs) are accepted for entry, transit and exit from Mauritius.
