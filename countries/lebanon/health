If you have a health condition, or you are pregnant, you may need specialist healthcare abroad. Check whether your destination country can provide the healthcare you may need and ensure you have appropriate travel insurance for unexpected medical evacuation or local treatment.
See the Coronavirus travel health and Healthcare sections in the Coronavirus page for COVID-19 health information.
At least 8 weeks before your trip, check the latest country-specific health advice from the National Travel Health Network and Centre (NaTHNaC) on the TravelHealthPro website. Each country-specific page has information on vaccine recommendations, any current health risks or outbreaks, and factsheets with information on staying healthy abroad. Guidance is also available from NHS (Scotland) on the FitForTravel website.
General information on travel vaccinations and a travel health checklist is available on the NHS website. You may then wish to contact your health adviser or pharmacy for advice on other preventive measures and managing any pre-existing medical conditions while you’re abroad.
The legal status and regulation of some medicines prescribed or purchased in the UK can be different in other countries. If you’re travelling with prescription or over-the-counter medicine, read this guidance from NaTHNaC on best practice when travelling with medicines. For further information on the legal status of a specific medicine, you’ll need to contact the embassy, high commission or consulate of the country or territory you’re travelling to.
While travel can be enjoyable, it can sometimes be challenging. There are clear links between mental and physical health, so looking after yourself during travel and when abroad is important. Information on travelling with mental health conditions is available in our guidance page. Further information is also available from the National Travel Health Network and Centre (NaTHNaC).
Health Risks
There have been reported cases of cholera in Lebanon, details of which can be found on NaTHNaC . Further guidance is also available in their Cholera factsheet.
Local medical care
The availability and quality of medical treatment available in Lebanon is being affected by the economic crisis and the fuel shortages. For example, air conditioning and lighting may be turned off, non-essential medical treatment may be cancelled and hospitals may refuse to take patients if they are unable to treat them. The provision of emergency and life-saving care, including life support care, could be severely impacted.
Medical care in Lebanon can be expensive and most medical providers and hospitals are insisting on significant cash deposits before admitting patients, including in emergency situations. Make sure you have adequate travel health insurance and accessible funds to cover the cost of any medical treatment abroad and repatriation.
Doctors are generally well qualified, though nursing standards vary. The economic crisis has caused a number of health care professionals to leave the country, this may affect staffing levels. The majority of medical staff speak French and English.
Medical supplies are increasingly hard to find in country. You should therefore bring any medicines you need with you to Lebanon. The legal status and regulation of some medicines prescribed or purchased in the UK can be different in other countries. If you’re travelling with prescription medication you should carry a medical certificate confirming that the medication has been prescribed for a medical condition.
If you need emergency medical assistance during your trip, dial 112 and ask for an ambulance. You should contact your insurance/medical assistance company promptly if you are referred to a medical facility for treatment. A list of medical facilities is available here.
