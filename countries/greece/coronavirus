Coronavirus travel health
Check the latest information on risk from COVID-19 for Greece on the TravelHealthPro website.
See the TravelHealthPro website for further advice on travel abroad and reducing spread of respiratory viruses during the COVID-19 pandemic.
Entry and borders
See Entry requirements to find out what you will need to do in order to enter Greece.
Wearing a mask
At present, it is mandatory to wear a mask in all public places (both indoors and outdoors), in all areas of Greece.
COVID-19 restrictions
All restrictions remain under regular review. In Regional Units (περιφερειακές ενότητες) where the spread of COVID-19 is particularly high and hospital capacity is limited, restrictions may be tighter or re-imposed with limited notice.
Only the most relevant measures to travellers are included below. You should keep up-to-date by checking this page regularly, and following local announcements.
As restrictions may vary, you should check the latest local guidance (in Greek).
you must use a facemask in all indoor and outdoor public and communal spaces, including work-places and on public transport;
a curfew is in place from 12:30am to 5am;
restricted numbers are in place for churches and religious services;
Maximum 3 persons permitted to travel in a taxi or a private vehicle (unless all members of the same family).
Cross-regional travel is allowed for mainland Greece and the islands of Lefkada, Evia and Salamina (use of self-tests ahead of travel is strongly recommended but is not mandatory).
Cross-regional travel to the rest of the islands is permitted but only with either:
proof of vaccination and 14 days since second dose (see Demonstrating your COVID-19 vaccination status), or
a negative result from a PCR test carried out up to 72 hours prior to travel; or
a negative result from a rapid test or self-test conducted up to 24 hours before travel; or
documentary proof of having recovered from Covid-19 (at least 2 months since infection, and no more than 9 months)
Travel in Greece
Travel within Greece between Regional Units is permitted subject to adherence to public health measures as outlined above. You must wear a mask at all times on all public transport.
If you are travelling via ferry, you will need to complete a health questionnaire and hand it to the ferry operator before boarding. The necessary forms will be provided by the operator: you should contact them directly if you need further information. Temperature checks may also be carried out before boarding.
If you are travelling by internal (domestic) flights, specific measures relating to check-in, baggage allowances and other details are in place to reduce the spread of coronavirus. You should check with your operator directly for further detail.
Accommodation
All hotels are permitted to open, and other types of accommodation, including e.g. Airbnb, private rentals and hostels, are also available. However, you should note that many operators are likely to reduce their offer and close some accommodation during the winter months, particularly in light of measures put in place by the Greek authorities to fight the spread of COVID-19. You should check directly with your accommodation provider in case of related concerns.
Healthcare in Greece
If you think you have symptoms, including a fever or respiratory difficulties such as shortness of breath or a cough, you should avoid visiting local health facilities, but contact a doctor remotely to see whether a test is recommended. There is likely to be a cost associated with this, for call out, examination and testing, which you will have to pay.
If you are staying in a hotel or resort, your accommodation provider will have a list of private doctors that they will call to assess your symptoms and conduct a COVID-19 test.
If you have arranged your own accommodation you can find details of English speaking, private doctors on our list of healthcare providers.
If you are tested and the result is positive, the Greek authorities will ask you to quarantine until advised otherwise. You may be able to remain in your existing accommodation, or be required to transfer into a state hospital or other government-provided accommodation. Costs related to transfer to alternative accommodation and treatment at state healthcare facilities will be covered by the Greek Government. The nature of your accommodation may differ from the specifications of your pre-booked hotel, villa or other place of stay. Depending on local arrangements, travellers in groups may be required to stay in separate accommodation (e.g. if a sufficient number of rooms is not available in one venue, your group may be spread across different accommodation locations).
For more information, consult the Greek National Public Health Organisation (NPHO) online or via telephone (dial 1135, or 210 521 2054, from within Greece).
Your emotional and mental wellbeing is important. Read guidance on how to look after your mental wellbeing and mental health.
