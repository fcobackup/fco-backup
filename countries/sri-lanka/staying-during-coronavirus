This page gives you guidance on how to stay safely in Sri Lanka as a visitor, if you are unable to return to the UK.
Everyone should comply with the measures put in place in Sri Lanka to limit the spread of coronavirus (COVID-19).
Moving around in Sri Lanka
The government has reduced curfew measures in most of the country. However, overnight curfew measures (12am – 4am) and social distancing instructions remain in force everywhere. The police say anyone breaking curfew or social distancing will be arrested.
Curfew measures are being updated regularly. You should follow the media for updates, or speak to your hotel or travel agent for the latest information.
Checkpoints have been introduced in a number of places, and those not adhering to the restrictions risk arrest. Follow the instructions of the local authorities at all times.
Visas
If you are already in Sri Lanka, the government has announced that the validity period of all types of visas has been extended to 11 July. If your visa has run out or will run out before 11 July you can make an appointment to apply for an extension through a new online service: http://eservices.immigration.gov.lk/vs.
Alternatively you can pay the relevant fee and complete the paperwork at the airport on departure. You should ring the Department for Immigration and Emigration on +94 70 710 1050 if you have further questions.
Accommodation
A small number of tourists have reported problems with hotels trying to cancel bookings made by foreign visitors, and some incidents of harassment. Speak to your travel agent about any accommodation booking problems, and report any incidents of harassment to the police first and then to the British High Commission.
Health
The Sri Lankan healthcare system will come under significant further strain as the number of cases increases. Access to routine and emergency healthcare may be limited. View Health for further details on healthcare in Sri Lanka.

Finance
There is a range of financial support from the government that you can access while you are unable to return due to coronavirus restrictions.
If you’re in Sri Lanka, and have exhausted all other options to cover essential living costs while you wait to return home, you could apply for an emergency loan for your living costs from the UK government. You can only apply if you normally live in the UK and you cannot return home. This last-resort option is for those most in need, and you would need to repay the loan when you are back in the UK. Apply for an emergency loan.
