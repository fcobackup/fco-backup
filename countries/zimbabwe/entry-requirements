This page has information on travelling to Zimbabwe. Check what you must do to return to the UK.
This page reflects the UK government’s understanding of current rules for people travelling on a full ‘British Citizen’ passport from the UK, for the most common types of travel.
The authorities in Zimbabwe set and enforce entry rules.
All travellers
You will need a visa to visit Zimbabwe. It is no longer possible to get a visa from the Zimbabwean Embassy in London.
See Visas section for more information.
If you’re fully vaccinated
If you’re fully vaccinated, you can enter Zimbabwe by presenting a vaccine certificate (2 doses) for one or more of the World Health Organisation-approved vaccines. Alternatively, you can present a valid negative test certificate of a COVID-19 PCR test taken no more than 48 hours prior to departure.
You will be required to complete track and trace information on arrival in Zimbabwe.
Residents of Zimbabwe
Returning residents can enter Zimbabwe by presenting a vaccine certificate (2 doses) for one or more of the World Health Organisation-approved vaccines. Alternatively, you can present a valid negative test certificate of a COVID-19 PCR test taken no more than 48 hours prior to departure.
Returning residents who do not present proof of vaccination or the result certificate of a negative COVID-19 test taken no more than 48 hours before their departure to Zimbabwe may be required take a PCR test and to quarantine for 10 days at their own cost.
Returning residents are required to complete track and trace information on arrival in Zimbabwe.
Proof of vaccination status
Zimbabwe will accept proof that you have received a full course (2 doses) of any one or more of the vaccines approved by the World Health Organisation.
If you’re not fully vaccinated
If you’re not fully vaccinated, you must possess the result certificate of a negative COVID-19 test taken no more than 48 hours before your departure to Zimbabwe.
You will be required to complete track and trace information on arrival in Zimbabwe.
If you’ve had COVID-19 in the past year
Entry requirements for Zimbabwe are not dependent on whether you have tested positive for COVID-19 in the past year.
Children and young people
Observed practice indicates that children under the age of five do not require proof of vaccination or a negative COVID-19 test certificate.
Children aged between 5 and 17 should follow the rules for fully vaccinated travellers to enter Zimbabwe.
If you’re transiting through Zimbabwe
Transiting is when you pass through one country on the way to your final destination.
Transiting through Zimbabwe is permitted for travellers in possession of a vaccine certificate (2 doses) for one or more of the World Health Organisation-approved vaccines or a valid negative test certificate of a COVID-19 PCR test taken no more than 48 hours prior to departure.
Check with your airline or travel provider for further transit requirements.
Exemptions
There are no exemptions to Zimbabwe’s entry requirements.
Check your passport and travel documents before you travel
Passport validity
If you are visiting Zimbabwe, your passport should be valid for a minimum period of six months from the date of your arrival and have three blank pages left in it to enable you to enter Zimbabwe and exit via one of the neighbouring countries, if leaving at short notice becomes necessary.
Check with your travel provider to make sure your passport and other travel documents meet their requirements.
Visas
You will need a visa to visit Zimbabwe.
It is no longer possible to get a visa from the Zimbabwean Embassy in London. Most visitors use the visa on arrival service. The current cost is $55 US Dollars for a Single Entry Visa (this includes a service charge) and $70 US Dollars for a Double Entry Visa (this includes a service charge). Take enough cash with you in small notes to pay for your visa at the airport. For more information, visit eVisa Zimbabwe.
Visitors are typically given entry permission for 30 days but you should check that the number of days given at the port of entry covers your intended period of stay. You can apply to have this period renewed and extended if required. If you wish to extend or renew visas or permits, you must do so via the relevant Government of Zimbabwe department. It is illegal to give a false statement in support of a visa.
Make sure you travel with the correct documentation, otherwise you risk arrest and deportation. You aren’t allowed to conduct any business or seek employment if you have a tourist visa. Volunteering and missionary work over a period of 30 days is considered work and a temporary employment permit is required to engage in these activities while in Zimbabwe. You must have the correct visa or work permit in order to work. Check current entry requirements with the Zimbabwe Embassy in London before you travel.
Anyone intending to carry out journalistic activity must arrange prior accreditation through the Zimbabwean Embassy in London. Journalists should not carry out any reporting or official photography without the proper accreditation as there is a risk of arrest, detention in difficult conditions, a fine and deportation. The Zimbabwean government has made clear that they will penalise any journalists found to be working in Zimbabwe without accreditation.
The Zimbabwe Government uses a broad definition of journalism. This may include any form of interview, filming or photography. You should also carefully consider risks associated with engaging in social media activities such as posting comments, blogging or sharing photographs, which could be construed as journalism.
Dual nationals
A growing number of British nationals who have travelled from the United Kingdom to Zimbabwe recently on Zimbabwean one-way temporary travel documents have found themselves stranded in Zimbabwe as these documents are not valid for re-entry to the United Kingdom. In some cases, this has caused serious inconvenience.
Arms embargo
There is a United Kingdom arms embargo against Zimbabwe. It is an offence in UK law to take firearms into Zimbabwe at the current time, even if you intend to bring them back to the UK at the end of your visit.
KAZA Univisa
The KAZA Univisa is valid for travel between Zimbabwe and Zambia and day trips into Botswana. It is available at Harare, Bulawayo and Victoria Falls airports and at the land borders at Victoria Falls (Zambian border) and Kazungula (Botswana border). It costs US $50 and it is valid for 30 days.
Travelling with children to, from and through South Africa
If you’re travelling with children to, from or through South Africa, see our South Africa travel advice page for information and advice about the documents you’ll need to carry.
Yellow fever certificate requirements
Check whether you need a yellow fever certificate by visiting the National Travel Health Network and Centre’s TravelHealthPro website.
UK Emergency Travel Documents
Zimbabwe recognises UK Emergency Travel Documents (ETDs) as valid travel documents. ETDs are accepted at ports of entry and exit and must be valid for the period of intended stay.
It may be necessary to produce a police report if your passport has been lost or stolen and you have been issued with an ETD as immigration officials want to see evidence of entry stamps on departure/exit.
Exiting Zimbabwe
You should check with your travel provider or airline prior to departure for any COVID-19 requirements for your transit and destination countries.
