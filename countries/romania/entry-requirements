This page reflects the UK government’s understanding of current rules for people travelling on a full ‘British Citizen’ passport, for the most common types of travel.
The authorities in Romania set and enforce entry rules. For further information contact their embassy, high commission or consulate. You may also check with your transport provider or travel company to make sure your passport and travel documents meet their requirements.
If you are travelling to Romania for work, read the guidance on visas and permits as the rules have changed since 1 January 2021.
Entry rules in response to coronavirus (COVID-19)
Entry to Romania
The UK is on Romania’s “Red List” of countries of high epidemiological risk.
On 1 July the Romanian government announced that for individuals arriving in Romania from Great Britain only, the following exceptions from quarantine will apply:
individuals who have completed a full course of vaccination at least ten days before arriving in Romania
individuals confirmed positive with COVID-19 in the last 180 days prior to entry into Romania, and for whom at least 14 days have passed from the date of confirmation to the date of entry into the country
children aged 12 years or under, without the need to present the negative result of an RT-PCR test for COVID-19
children over 12 years and under 16 have to present a negative RT-PCR test for COVID-19, performed no later than 72 hours before boarding (for those who travel by public transport) or entry into the national territory (for those traveling by their own means)
Travellers ineligible for exemption from quarantine when arriving from the UK will be required to quarantine for fourteen days.
The text of the declaration can be found on the Romanian government website(in Romanian).
The Government publishes weekly updates on current entry conditions for travellers. These decisions are published on the CNSCBT website (in Romanian).
Demonstrating your COVID-19 status
Romania will accept the UK’s proof of COVID-19 recovery and vaccination record. Your NHS appointment card from vaccination centres is not designed to be used as proof of vaccination and should not be used to demonstrate your vaccine status.
Regular entry requirements
Visas
The rules for travelling or working in European countries changed on 1 January 2021:
you can travel to Romania for up to 90 days in any 180-day period without a visa. This applies if you travel as a tourist, to visit for family or friends, to attend business meetings, cultural or sports events, or for short-term studies or training
visits to other EU or Schengen countries do not count towards your 90-day limit in Romania as it is not in the Schengen area. Visits to Romania do not count towards your 90-day visa-free limit in the Schengen area
to stay longer, to work or study, for business travel or for other reasons, you will need to meet the Romanian government’s entry requirements. Check with the Romanian Embassy what type of visa and/or work permit you may need
if you stay in Romania with a residence permit or long-stay visa, this does not count towards your 90-day visa-free limit
Any time you spent in Romania before 1 January 2021 does not count towards the 90-day visa-free limit.
At Romanian border control, you may need to use separate lanes from EU, EEA and Swiss citizens when queueing. Your passport may be stamped on entry and exit.
You may also need to:
show a return or onward ticket
show you have enough money for your stay
Passport validity
Check your passport is valid for travel before you book your trip, and renew your passport if you do not have enough time left on it.
Make sure your passport is:
valid for at least 3 months after the day you plan to leave [country name]
less than 10 years old
The 3 months you need when leaving a country must be within 10 years of the passport issue date.
If you renewed your current passport before the previous one expired, extra months may have been added to its expiry date. Any extra months on your passport over 10 years may not count towards the minimum 3 months needed.
Parental consent when travelling with minors
Some British nationals travelling with minors who hold Romanian citizenship (irrespective of whether they hold citizenship of other countries) are prevented from leaving the country without notarised parental consent from the minor’s non-travelling parent/s. While enforcement of this may vary at borders, British nationals travelling with minors who hold Romanian citizenship should obtain notarised parental consent before departure from Romania.
A list of the public notaries can be found on the website of the National Union of Public Notaries from Romania.
