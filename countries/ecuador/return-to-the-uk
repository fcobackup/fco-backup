The British Embassy Quito continues to work closely with the Ecuadorean authorities and commercial airlines on all possible options for a return to the UK for British nationals in Ecuador.
As part of these efforts, the Embassy invites British people in Ecuador to send their email address to britishembassy.quito@fco.gov.uk. This will be used to inform you of the availability of outgoing flights secured through diplomatic permissions.
The British Embassy will also issue updates on Twitter and Facebook with the latest available information on flight departure options.
Flights
Some flights are still departing from Ecuador, but disruption and cancellations are highly likely. Contact your travel provider for information.
You may need to make alternative plans in order to leave the country. You should urgently contact your airline to confirm any existing reservations and also your insurance company regarding coverage.
Airlines are facing very high call volumes. If you are unable to speak to a representative, most airlines also enable you to check flight status and make new bookings online. You can check current flight status on the Quito Airport website or Guayaquil Airport website. Only passengers with a confirmed international flight reservation will be allowed to enter Quito Airport.
Safe passage documents
Authorities are requiring individuals to have a safe passage document when travelling between provinces and to the airport. Email BritishEmbassy.Quito@fco.gov.uk to get a safe passage document. A consular officer will respond as quickly as possible. It is very important that you carry documents that justify your movement, including a confirmed booking, your passport and the safe passage document referred above.
Departing the Galapagos
If youâ€™re in the islands and wish to leave, whether you have flight tickets or not, you need to register with the local authorities to ensure you can be contacted by email.
A WhatsApp group invitation has been issued for people to get official information directly, which can be accessed here and here. The Galapagos Authorities are aware of that the group is at maximum capacity, so keep trying.
The Galapagos authorities are introducing new measures such as a medical check before departure. Detailed information on these measures is being sent directly to travellers via email.
These regulations are subject to change at short notice. You should contact your airline, travel agent and insurance provider to discuss plans.
