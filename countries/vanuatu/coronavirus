The Vanuatu authorities have introduced a number of precautionary measures in response to the coronavirus (COVID-19) pandemic.
On 26 March, the government of Vanuatu declared a State of Emergency in response to the coronavirus pandemic. The State of Emergency is in place for an initial period of 14 days. During that time, social gatherings of more than five people are prohibited. Some restaurants, bars and most supermarkets remain open but must close by 7.30pm each day. Public transport must end by 9pm at night. International flights in and out of Vanuatu have been suspended since 23 March and are not expected to resume while the State of Emergency is in place.
The government of Australia has announced that from 9pm Australia Eastern Standard Time on 20 March, entry to the country will only be permitted to Australian citizens or permanent residents. This follows a similar announcement by New Zealand from 19 March. As many flight connections to and from Vanuatu connect in Australia and New Zealand, options to depart Vanuatu have reduced. If you’re resident in Vanuatu, you should be aware of the potential impact of the border closures and flight restrictions on future travel plans. See also Return to the UK

The government of New Zealand has put in place strict measures to limit transit through their airports. More information on this is available from Immigration New Zealand.

Medical care

Due to the rapidly changing nature of the COVID-19 outbreak across the region, flight availability and entry requirements/prohibitions can change at short notice. You should take these limitations and risks into account when making their making travel plans.
