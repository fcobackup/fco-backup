This page has information on travelling to Uganda.
This page reflects the UK government’s understanding of current rules for people travelling on a full ‘British Citizen’ passport from the UK, for the most common types of travel.
The authorities in Uganda set and enforce entry rules. If you’re unsure how Uganda’s entry requirements apply to you, contact its UK embassy, high commission or consulate.
All travellers
You’ll need a visa to enter Uganda. Following an announcement by the Ugandan Ministry of Internal Affairs on October 14 2021, you are required to have a visa before your trip. Visas will not be issued on arrival.
See the Visas section for more information.
A negative COVID-19 PCR test certificate is no longer required for fully vaccinated inbound and outbound travellers. Children under the age of 6 are exempted from providing a negative COVID-19 PCR test certificate whether vaccinated or not.
Arriving passengers will be subject to temperature checks and will be screened for infectious diseases by the Port Health authorities. If your temperature is above normal or you display COVID-19 symptoms you may be required to take a COVID-19 test. If a foreign national tests positive for COVID-19 and wishes to be repatriated for treatment outside of Uganda, they will be expected to cover the costs themselves.
Only passengers with valid tickets and airport officials will be allowed into the terminal building.
For more information about entry requirements, visit the Ugandan Directorate of Citizenship and Immigration Control website.
Due the Ebola outbreak, which was declared over on 11 January 2023, temperature screening has been implemented for outbound travellers at all border crossing points including Entebbe International Airport.
If you’re fully vaccinated
If you are fully vaccinated (and for children under the age of 6) you are now able to enter Uganda via air and land border points without showing a negative COVID-19 PCR certificate. You will be required to show evidence that you are fully vaccinated.
Proof of vaccination status
You are required to show your COVID-19 vaccination status on arrival at Entebbe International airport and land border points in Uganda
If you’re not fully vaccinated
If you are not fully vaccinated you will need to show a negative COVID-19 PCR certificate issued no more than 72 hours before departure on arrival by land or air.
If you’ve had COVID-19 in the past year
There are no special arrangements in place for travellers who have tested positive for COVID-19 in the past year.
Children and young people
Children under the age of 6 do not need to show a negative COVID-19 test certificate on arrival. Unvaccinated children aged 6 and above will need to show a negative COVID-19 test certificate issued no more than 72 hours before departure on arrival at land border points and Entebbe International Airport
If you’re transiting through Uganda
If you are transiting through Uganda on your way to another country and staying in the airport (airside) you will need to provide proof that you are fully vaccinated or provide a negative COVID-19 test certificate on arrival.
If you are transiting through Uganda on your way to another country and will be passing through immigration (sometimes known as a layover), for example to stay in a hotel for a flight the next day, you will need to provide proof that you are fully vaccinated or provide a negative COVID-19 test certificate on arrival.
Exemptions
There are no exemptions to Uganda’s entry requirements.
