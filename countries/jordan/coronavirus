The Jordanian government suspended all direct air passenger flights between the UK and Jordan from 21 December 2020. This suspension has now been extended until 18 January. A further review is expected and there is the possibility of a further extension.
Passengers who have been in the UK within the previous 14 days, including passengers who have passed through the UK in transit, are not permitted to enter Jordan during this period. You cannot transit from the UK through a third country to enter Jordan. Indirect routes remain unaffected for outbound flights from Jordan.
British nationals affected by flight cancellations should contact their airlines for further information and for advice on possible alternative flight options via a third country. Please be aware, however, that several third countries have themselves suspended flights to and from the UK and others may follow suit at very short notice.
British nationals who require consular assistance should call the British Embassy on + 962 6 5909200 and follow instructions for consular assistance.
The government of Jordan reopened Queen Alia International Airport on 10 September to a limited number of commercial flights.

Those who test positive with severe symptoms will need to go to a COVID-19 designated hospital for isolation and treatment if required. Those with a negative test result will be required to complete seven days of self-quarantine. You will also be required to take a PCR test after seven days of self-quarantine.

Healthcare in Jordan
Six hospitals have been designated to treat patients with coronavirus.
The increase in coronavirus cases in Jordan since September 2020 has placed a strain on medical capacity. The Jordanian authorities recognise this and have taken measures to increase coronavirus specific bed space through the construction of several field hospitals in the country and through the commandeering of private medical facilities.
The Ministry of Health has a dedicated call centre (111) available 24/7 for residents and citizens to utilise in case of any enquiries regarding coronavirus. In an emergency dial 911.
If you develop coronavirus symptoms or have a known exposure to COVID-19 call 111 or contact a doctor immediately and self-quarantine for 14 days. See our list of medical practitioners in Amman.
