Entry and borders
To curb the spread of COVID-19, the Government of India announced that all scheduled international and domestic commercial passenger services will remain suspended until 3 May 2020. All passenger train services are also suspended until 3 May 2020.
All land borders with Bangladesh, Bhutan, Myanmar and Nepal in East and North East India are closed.

Hotels in some states have been instructed to refuse entry to foreign nationals. British Nationals opting for repatriation through special flights are being allowed to travel with special permission obtained by the British High Commission from the Indian Ministry of External Affairs.
