Be prepared for your plans to change
No travel is risk-free during COVID. Countries may further restrict travel or bring in new rules at short notice, for example due to a new COVID-19 variant. Check with your travel company or airline for any transport changes which may delay your journey home.
If you test positive for COVID-19, you may need to stay where you are until you test negative. You may also need to seek treatment there.
Plan ahead and make sure you:
can access money
understand what your insurance will cover
can make arrangements to extend your stay and be away for longer than planned

COVID-19 vaccines if you live in Lebanon
We will update this page when the Government of Lebanon announces new information on the national vaccination programme. You can sign up to get email notifications when this page is updated.
The Lebanese national vaccination programme started in February 2021 and is using the Pfizer-BioNTech and AstraZeneca vaccines. The Government of Lebanon has stated that British nationals resident in Lebanon are eligible for vaccination if they choose to join the programme. The Lebanese authorities have issued a pre-registration form to register to receive the vaccine in Lebanon (you will need some assistance completing the form if you are a non-Arabic speaker). Private programmes run by employers may use other vaccines such as Sputnik V and Sinopharm in addition to Pfizer-BioNTech and AstraZeneca.
Find out more, including about vaccines that are authorised in the UK or approved by the World Health Organisation, on the COVID-19 vaccines if you live abroad.
If you’re a British national living in Lebanon, you should seek medical advice from your local healthcare provider. Information about COVID-19 vaccines used in the national programme where you live, including regulatory status, should be available from local authorities.
