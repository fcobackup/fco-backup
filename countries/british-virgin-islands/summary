Since the hurricanes of September 2017, rebuilding back better has been the vision of the islands. Tourism, particularly in the marine sector, has bounced back and all beaches are open. However, recovery and clean-up efforts are continuing and several hotels remain closed. Swimmers should be mindful that debris may remain on some beaches or in the sea, and should exercise caution.
Local authorities can provide further information and you should follow their advice. You can follow the Department of Disaster Management and HM Governor’s Office Facebook pages and the Twitter account of Governor Gus Jaspert for updates on BVI.
The hurricane season usually runs from June to November and further storms could affect the Caribbean.
