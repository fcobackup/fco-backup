This section has safety advice for regions of India. It only covers regions where the Foreign, Commonwealth and Development Office (FCDO) has specific advice.

India-Pakistan border area and western India
FCDO advises against all travel within 10km of the India-Pakistan border. The Wagah-Attari border crossing is closed.
The India-Pakistan border in Gujarat and Rajasthan is unmarked in some areas. Approaching it away from an official crossing point could be dangerous. Where it is unmarked, you could enter Pakistan illegally. 
Union Territory of Jammu and Kashmir 
FCDO advises against all travel to the Union Territory of Jammu and Kashmir (including Pahalgam, Gulmarg, Sonamarg, the city of Srinagar and the Jammu-Srinagar national highway), except for:

travel within the city of Jammu
There have been frequent terrorist incidents in Jammu and Kashmir. There is a continuing threat, towards Indian government targets and civilians including tourists and foreign nationals. See Terrorism.
There is a heavy security presence in the Kashmir Valley. This, combined with violent protests and operations by security forces, has resulted in a number of deaths and serious casualties.
The authorities can impose and lift curfews and other restrictions frequently and quickly. Stay vigilant, monitor local media, and follow the advice of local authorities and your travel company.
Foreign nationals are vulnerable in rural districts and outside the main population centres and tourist areas. There is a risk of unpredictable violence, including bombings, grenade attacks, shootings and kidnapping. The long-standing policy of the UK government is not to make substantive concessions to hostage takers. The level of consular assistance that the British High Commission in India can provide in Jammu and Kashmir is severely limited.
Manipur
FCDO advises against all but essential travel to the state of Manipur. Some insurgent groups are active in north-east India in the state of Manipur.

There may be curfews and other restrictions including transport disruptions and the suspension of internet services at short notice in some parts of the state.
You should:
avoid protests or large gatherings
follow the advice of the local authorities and your travel company
monitor local media and follow any curfew restrictions
