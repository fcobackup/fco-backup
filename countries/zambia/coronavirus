COVID-19 vaccines if you live in Zambia
Wherever possible British nationals should aim to be vaccinated in the country where they live. As further information is available about the national vaccination programme, this page will be updated. Sign up to get email notifications.
The Zambia national vaccination programme started in April using the AstraZeneca vaccine.
British people resident in Zambia are currently eligible for vaccination if they are aged over 65 or have a medical condition that puts them at greater risk of severe disease due to COVID-19, including high blood pressure, cardiovascular disease, diabetes, obesity, cancer, TB, and HIV.
A list of vaccination sites is available on the Zambian Ministry of Health website.
The Medicines and Healthcare Products Regulatory Agency (MHRA) is the UK authority responsible for assessing the safety, quality and efficacy of vaccines. It has authorised the Pfizer/BioNTech, Oxford/AstraZeneca and Moderna vaccines for temporary supply and use in the UK. Find out more about MHRA approval for these vaccines.
British nationals living overseas should seek medical advice from their local healthcare provider in the country where they reside. Information about vaccines used in other national programmes, including regulatory status, should be available from the local authorities. This list of Stringent Regulatory Authorities recognised by the World Health Organisation may also be a useful source of additional information. Find out more information about the COVID-19 vaccines on the World Health Organization COVID-19 vaccines page.
