The Foreign and Commonwealth Office (FCO) is advising British nationals against all non-essential international travel at this time. Existing advice for Guinea remains in place:
The FCO advise against all but essential travel to the Middle Guinea region, including Labé, Pita and Dalaba.
Keep up to date with information from your tour operator, transport or accommodation provider on the impact on any existing travel plans. If you need further information about entry requirements, contact the local immigration authorities or the nearest Guinean Embassy.

The government of Guinea has introduced a number of measures to limit the spread of coronavirus. The President declared a state of emergency until 15 May. Conakry Airport is closed until further notice. For more information, see Coronavirus and Return to the UK
Given the rapidly changing situation in Guinea we have temporarily withdrawn a limited number of UK staff and their dependents from the British Embassy. The Embassy will continue to carry out essential work including providing 24/7 consular assistance and support to British people in Guinea.
There have been regular demonstrations in Guinea since October 2019 leading to significant travel disruption and a number of violent incidents including deaths. Protests in Middle Guinea in January led to several public buildings being ransacked and set on fire and increased criminal activity. The National Front for the Defence of the Constitution (FNDC) have continued to call for demonstrations. Demonstrations may be spontaneous and unpredictable, with routes blocked. There has been damage to vehicles passing through or around demonstrations as well as an increase in criminality. Serious violence occurred around the legislative elections and referendum which were held on 22 March 2020. Demonstrations are likely to continue. You should exercise caution and be vigilant, staying clear of demonstrations and monitor local media. “Villes mortes” (general strikes) happen intermittently. See Political situation
Terrorist attacks can’t be ruled out. Attacks could be indiscriminate. You should be vigilant, especially in places visited by foreigners. See Terrorism
The Guinean authorities maintain police and local militia checkpoints across the whole country. Carry identification with you at all times. See Road travel and Local laws and customs
Motorists have encountered theft at gun point, particularly at night. See Crime
Road travel can be hazardous due to poor driving standards and the state of the roads. Essential supplies, such as fuel, may run low from time to time. You should avoid travelling at night outside Conakry. See Road travel
Exchanging foreign currency on the street or using unofficial money changers is illegal and can result in military detention. See Money
If you need urgent consular assistance, call the British Embassy Conakry. See Consular assistance
Take out comprehensive travel and medical insurance before you travel.
