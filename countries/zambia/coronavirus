Returning to the UK
As of 20 October, all travellers wishing to leave Zambia to travel to a country that requires a negative COVID-19 test will be required to produce a medical certificate stating that they have tested negative for COVID-19 in the previous 14 days.
This requirement does not apply to travellers to a destination that does not require a negative test (including the UK) but travellers are advised to check with their airline on their requirements prior to travel.
To obtain a certificate, travellers must take their negative test result to UTH Hospital, the Zambia National Health Public Institute, the District Health Office or the Public Health Office and pay a 200 Kwacha fee.
COVID-19 tests must have been taken in Zambia. Holders of tests taken outside Zambia are not exempt from this requirement, even if the test was taken within the previous 14 days.
There are no direct flights between Zambia and the UK. Check FCDO travel advice for the latest guidance on transiting through third countries.
When you return, you must follow the rules for entering the UK.
