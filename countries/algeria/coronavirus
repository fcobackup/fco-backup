Since 1 July, given a recent increase of confirmed Covid-19 cases, local authorities nationwide, have powers to enact additional measures in cluster areas, with the approval of central authorities. As a result, localised lockdowns are possible, and markets and other areas with a high concentration of shops could be shut down for at least 15 days.
All security services and local authorities have been instructed to rigorously monitor and enforce compliance with preventive and other social distancing measures. Penalties include fines up to the equivalent of £600, and 6 months imprisonment.
The wearing of facemasks became mandatory on 24 May in all public spaces, including when using public transport, and within private cars and taxis.
Accommodation
Hotels are open, with compulsory sanitary measures in place; facilities may be restricted. There are designated hotels for repatriated Algerians to do the required 14 days quarantine on arrival.
Public places and services
Mosques, restaurants and cafes are permitted to reopen from 15 August. This is conditional on social distancing and sanitary measures being in place. Mask wearing is obligatory and air conditioning and fans are banned.
In the 29 provinces where restrictions are still in place, mosques will open for four daily prayers during the week, and three on Friday. Women and children are currently banned from entering.
Universities will start to reopen from 23 August. Schools remain closed.
There is a nationwide ban on family gatherings of any kind, including marriages.
