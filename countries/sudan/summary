The Foreign and Commonwealth Office (FCO) is advising British nationals against all non-essential international travel at this time. Existing advice for Sudan remains in place:
The FCO advise against all travel to:
the Darfur states
the Abyei Region
South Kordofan and Blue Nile states
the southern area of West Kordofan state that was previously part of South Kordofan, as shown on the map
within 50km of the border with South Sudan in White Nile and Sennar states
within 200km of the border with Libya
The FCO advise against all but essential travel to:
within 100km of the border with Egypt in areas west of the Nile Valley
within 20km of the border with Eritrea
areas of North Kordofan and West Kordofan states south of the Kost-El Obeid-En Nahud road
The Sudanese authorities have introduced a number of measures to limit the spread of the virus, including the closure of all borders, a 24/7 lockdown in Khartoum state from 18 April for three weeks (with a window from 6am – 1pm to allow people to go out to buy food), and night time curfews continue in the remainder of the country. There are currently no international commercial passenger flights operating into or out of Sudan or internal flights. See Coronavirus and Return to the UK.
An Air Cairo special charter flight from Khartoum to Paris will operate on Saturday 9 May for holders of British and other European passports who normally live in the UK or Europe. There are restrictions in Paris for onward travel. See Return to the UK.
Given the rapidly changing situation in Sudan we are temporarily withdrawing a limited number of UK staff and their dependants from our Embassy. The Embassy will continue to carry out essential work including providing 24/7 consular assistance and support to British people in Sudan.
While the broader political and security situation in Sudan has stabilised since April 2019, you should continue to maintain a high level of vigilance across the country, avoid all protests and large gatherings, monitor developments closely and follow the instructions of local authorities and security services. See Political situation
Consular support is severely limited in parts of Sudan where the FCO has existing advice against all travel and all but essential travel (as set out above). The British Embassy no longer registers British nationals in Sudan and the capacity of the British Embassy to help in times of crisis may be limited. You should consider your own travel arrangements carefully and make sure you have up-to-date travel documents and visas in case you need to leave at short notice. See this crisis guidance page for more information about the precautions you should take in the event of a crisis and the help and support the British Embassy can provide.
Terrorists are likely to try to carry out attacks in Sudan. Attacks could be indiscriminate, including in places frequented by expatriates and foreign travellers. See Terrorism
You will need a visa to visit Sudan. See Visas
If you’re abroad and you need emergency help from the UK government, contact the nearest British embassy, consulate or high commission.
The Overseas Business Risk service offers information and advice for British companies operating overseas on how to manage political, economic, and business security-related risks.
Take out comprehensive travel and medical insurance before you travel.
