For security reasons, the FCDO advises against all travel to the breakaway regions of South Ossetia and Abkhazia, and against all but essential travel to areas immediately adjacent to the Administrative Boundary Lines with Abkhazia and South Ossetia.
The British government does not recognise the unilateral declarations of independence made by the de facto authorities in the breakaway regions of Abkhazia and South Ossetia. Consular support is not available in parts of Georgia where the FCDO advise against all travel. See Local travel
