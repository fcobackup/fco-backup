This page reflects the UK government’s understanding of current rules for people travelling on a full ‘British Citizen’ passport, for the most common types of travel.
The authorities in Pakistan set and enforce entry rules. For further information contact the embassy, high commission or consulate of the country or territory you’re travelling to. You should also consider checking with your transport provider or travel company to make sure your passport and other travel documents meet their requirements.
Entry rules in response to coronavirus (COVID-19)
Entry to Pakistan
Since 5 May, Pakistan has restricted the number of international flights to/from Pakistan.
On 20 March, the Pakistan government announced that entry restrictions for inbound travellers from the UK will be lifted from 23 March. Travellers are still required to present evidence of a negative COVID-19 test taken up to 72 hours before the start of travel.
You should not use the NHS testing service to get a test in order to facilitate your travel to another country. You should arrange to take a private test.
For information about this and possible quarantine periods on arrival please see Pakistan government advice.
The Pakistani authorities have closed land borders with Afghanistan, India and Iran. Despite this, there are ongoing limited border openings for repatriation and trade. Those crossing into Pakistan may have to comply with coronavirus testing and quarantine measures. The FCDO currently advises against travel to the most of the Afghanistan and Iran border areas.
Testing / screening on arrival
If travelling by air, you will be subject to Rapid Antigen testing on arrival at airports in Pakistan. From 5 May Pakistan government guidelines state that those testing negative will then need to undergo 10 days of self-quarantine at home. Travellers who test positive will be moved to a self-paid facility for 10 days quarantine. A second PCR test will be conducted on the 8th day of quarantine, following which a negative result will enable a passenger to proceed home and a positive result will necessitate a further quarantine period or move to hospital if required. Travellers to Pakistan will also be required to provide their contact information through the Pass Track App or through a web-based form. If necessary you may also be able to fill in a health declaration form on arrival.
Government guidelines, issued on 18 November, state that children under the age of 12 and disabled passengers are exempt from the COVID-19 test requirement and Pass Track App requirement. However they will be required to complete a health declaration form upon arrival.
You may also be required to follow special measures before boarding flights to Pakistan and while on board the aircraft, including the wearing of a face mask.
Pakistan government guidance, including links to the Pass Track App and web-based form is available on their COVID-19 website.
Screening on departure
If you’re leaving Pakistan, you will be screened at the airport for any symptoms of COVID-19. You may also be subject to thermal screening for high temperatures. If you’re free from symptoms you will be allowed to travel. If you’re suspected of having symptoms of COVID-19, including fever, cough and breathing difficulty, you will be subject to a secondary screening by a medical professional. After which, you may be allowed to board if it is assessed that you do not have symptoms, have not been at risk of exposure and do not have a fever. If the secondary screening assesses that you may have COVID-19 you may be asked to self-isolate for 14 days before you can travel. You may also be referred to a medical facility.
