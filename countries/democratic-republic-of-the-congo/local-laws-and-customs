Avoid taking photographs in public places (particularly of borders or military installations). You risk being arrested and detained. Journalists should not conduct interviews or film without the necessary local permits.
Adopting children from DRC
The FCO advise against adopting from DRC. The UK doesn’t recognise adoptions made in the DRC as the DRC is not a signatory to the Hague Convention on Protection of Children and Co-operation in Respect of Intercountry Adoption.
Since 2013 the DRC government has suspended issuing exit permits for children adopted by foreigners in DRC. This has resulted in large numbers of children adopted by foreign nationals unable to leave the country, or their departure being delayed by more than 30 months. In May 2017 the DRC Senate adopted a law banning homosexual couples and trans-sexual couples from adopting Congolese children. The FCO strongly advise families considering adoption to seek advice beforehand, including legal advice in the UK and in the DRC. Read more about adopting a child from overseas.
