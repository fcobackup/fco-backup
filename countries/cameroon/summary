On 22 October 2018, Paul Biya was announced winner of the 7 October presidential election. The president will be sworn in soon. Some political parties are contesting the result and there may be demonstrations during this period. You should be vigilant, avoid large gatherings and monitor local media.
There were reports of deaths in some towns and villages in the Anglophone (North West and South West) regions on 7 October and the days after, as a result of clashes between separatists and government security forces. These general strikes (or ‘ghost towns’) are called for each Monday and can become violent. You should be vigilant, avoid large gatherings and monitor local media.
In mid-June, armed Anglophone separatist groups erected barricades on several spots along the Buea – Muyuka – Kumba road in the South West Region for several days. Travelers were stranded. The army clashed with separatists and cleared the road. There were casualties. Spontaneous road blocks recur.
Armed groups are operating in the area. A security checkpoint was attacked at Mutengene (Tiko) in June. Other clashes occurred in Bolifamba (Mile 16) and Muea.
Kidnaps have been reported in the North West and South West regions. A Tunisian road technician was killed in a rescue operation in March in the South West. There have been multiple exchanges of fire between the Cameroonian security forces and armed groups over the past few months in many places in the two Anglophone regions.
This follows violent and deadly clashes between demonstrators and the Cameroonian security forces in the North West and South West regions in September and October 2017. Restrictions including night curfews, a ban on public meetings and others remain in place. A general strike is observed in parts of the two regions on some days. If you’re in these regions, you should remain vigilant and keep in touch with developments through local media.
Terrorists are very likely to try to carry out attacks in Cameroon. The terrorist group Boko Haram is active in the Far North region but attacks could occur anywhere including major towns and cities such as Yaoundé and Douala. There have been numerous suicide attacks since 2016 which have resulted in over 200 dead in the Far North region. Key targets have been large open markets, hotels, parks and sporting venues. There have also been hostages taken and heavy gunfights reported in Babouang and Mbarang in Adamawa region (Cameroon).
There is a heightened threat of kidnap to western nationals in the north of Cameroon, including in the major cities and along the border between the Far North region and Nigeria. Boko Haram has publicly threatened Cameroon with attacks and further kidnappings due to Cameroon’s involvement in the regional fight to counter Boko Haram. See Terrorism
There have been reports of criminality including large armed gangs and highway bandits, stopping travelers, taking hostages and demanding payment, particularly in the east of Cameroon, close to the Central African Republic (CAR) border. There are frequent instances of violence in CAR spilling across the border to Cameroon.
Criminality by large gangs and hostage taking for ransom are also a threat more widely in Adamawa region. In January 2017, an armed group attacked a UN border monitoring team near the Nigerian border killing 5 people.
Nigerian military operations in the states of Borno, Yobe and Adamawa in Nigeria could have an impact across the border in Cameroon.
UK health authorities have classified Cameroon as having a risk of Zika virus transmission. For information and advice about the risks associated with Zika virus, visit the National Travel Health Network and Centre website.
There are increased reports of piracy in the Gulf of Guinea. Take great care when travelling in coastal waters, including the coastline of Cameroon and the Doula port. Despite the high crime levels, most visits to Cameroon are trouble-free. Only a few British nationals needed consular assistance in the past year.
If you’re abroad and you need emergency help from the UK government, contact the nearest British embassy, consulate or high commission.
