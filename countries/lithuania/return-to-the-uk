There are currently extremely limited commercial options available to return to the UK from Lithuania. All commercial flights between Lithuania and the UK have been cancelled until further notice. From 00:00EET Saturday 4 April there will be no flights in or out of Lithuania; the only sea route after this will be a limited passenger ferry service between Klaipeda and Kiel (Germany).
We know this is concerning for British people trying to leave Lithuania. We will update this page if further options for you to return to the UK become available.
What to do
If you cannot leave Lithuania at this time, you should:
follow the advice of local authorities, including local measures to help minimise your risk of exposure to coronavirus
find accommodation that’s suitable for your needs, if you can. You should note that many local authorities across Lithuania have closed all hotels, short-term rented apartments and other accommodation services.
keep in regular contact with family and friends at home, so they know you are safe and well
