Political situation
Belarus is governed by an authoritarian regime with the security forces loyal to it. The authorities show little tolerance for their opposition counterparts. You should maintain a high level of security awareness, particularly in public places and avoid demonstrations.
Belarusian authorities launched a violent crackdown against demonstrators across Belarus following the Presidential elections on 9 August 2020. Further demonstrations and protests are possible and could become confrontational, with security forces likely to use excessive force to disperse and detain demonstrators. You are advised to remain vigilant, avoid crowds, and if protests do break out, you should leave the area immediately. . If you intend to work as a journalist in Belarus, you must receive accreditation from the Ministry of Foreign Affairs of Belarus before you travel.
Military movements
The Belarusian regime are facilitating Russia’s illegal invasion of Ukraine. Russian military operations are taking place inside Belarus. The situation is unpredictable and could further escalate without warning. This has increased the risk of conflict within Belarusian borders. In the event of conflict taking place, our ability to offer consular assistance may be limited. Events in Ukraine are fast moving and you are strongly advised to check the Ukraine travel advice.
There remains a particularly high risk of military activity in Yelsk, Mazyr , Rechitsa, Luninets, Gomel, Asipovichy, Baranovichi and Brest where Russian and Belarusian military personnel and equipment are present. You should avoid restricted areas reserved for military exercising or for conducting operations. Do not take photographs of military activity, establishments or sites of strategic importance – it is illegal to do so. There may not be warning signs in locations where prohibitions are in place. If in doubt you should leave potentially restricted areas immediately.
The situation in Minsk and other major cities is calm, but this could change quickly. You should remain vigilant throughout Belarus, especially in the southern and western areas, and make sure you are ready to change your travel plans quickly if you need to. Monitor the media and this travel advice regularly, subscribe to email alerts and read our advice on how to deal with a crisis overseas.
Polish border situation
Due to ongoing migratory pressure, the situation close to the Polish border is unpredictable, particularly around the Bruzgi-Kuzniсa crossing. The crossing is now closed to vehicles and more border checkpoints may close or implement restrictions at short notice. There are increased restrictions on movement and activities in the border areas. If you are near the border you should remain cautious and avoid large crowds or gatherings.
On 10 February 2023, the Polish authorities closed the Bobrovniki/Berestovitsa border checkpoint. The only operational border crossings on the Belarus-Poland border at the moment are Brest/Terespol for cars and buses and Kozlovichy/Kukuryki for trucks.
Crime
There is little crime in Belarus but, you should be alert at all times to the possibility of mugging, pickpocketing and theft from vehicles or hotel rooms.

On 24 May 2021, in response to the forced diversion and landing of a Ryanair flight from Athens to Vilnius the UK government issued an advisory notice to strongly advise all UK airlines to cease overflights of Belarusian airspace. The operating permit for Belavia, the main Belarusian airline, to fly between the UK and Belarus is suspended, and UK airspace is closed to all Belarusian registered carriers. This means there are no direct flights from Belarus to the UK. On 25 May, 2021 the European Union agreed to ban the overflight of EU airspace for Belarusian registered aircraft.
People wishing to travel from Belarus to the UK will now have to exit Belarus by the land border and fly via a neighbouring country, or take an indirect air route via a country that has not imposed a ban.
