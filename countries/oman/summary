The FCDO advises against all but essential travel to:
the whole of Oman based on the current assessment of COVID-19 risks.
On 21 December 2020, the Supreme Committee announced the closure of its land, sea and air borders with effect from 22 December at 1 am. This will remain in place for 7 days and will be subject to review by the Omani authorities. During this time, it will not be possible to enter or leave Oman.
Travel to Oman is subject to entry restrictions
See Entry requirements for more information before you plan to travel.

Following the attack on the coalition base at Taji in Iraq on 11 March, and subsequent US airstrikes, tensions may be raised across the region. There is a possibility of an increased threat against Western interests, including against UK citizens. You should remain vigilant and keep up to date with the latest developments, including via the media and this travel advice.
Most visits to Oman are trouble-free. You should maintain a high level of security awareness and take care in public places and on the roads. Avoid large crowds and demonstrations.
Terrorist attacks in Oman can’t be ruled out. See Terrorism
Piracy remains a threat in the Gulf of Aden and the Indian Ocean. See Sea travel
If you’re abroad and you need emergency help from the UK government, contact the nearest British embassy, consulate or high commission.
