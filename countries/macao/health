At least 8 weeks before your trip, check the latest country-specific health advice from the National Travel Health Network and Centre (NaTHNaC) on the TravelHealthPro website. Each country-specific page has information on vaccine recommendations, any current health risks or outbreaks, and factsheets with information on staying healthy abroad. Guidance is also available from NHS (Scotland) on the FitForTravel website.
General information on travel vaccinations and a travel health checklist is available on the NHS website. You may then wish to contact your health adviser or pharmacy for advice on other preventive measures and managing any pre-existing medical conditions while you’re abroad.
The legal status and regulation of some medicines prescribed or purchased in the UK can be different in other countries. If you’re travelling with prescription or over-the-counter medicine, read this guidance from NaTHNaC on best practice when travelling with medicines. For further information on the legal status of a specific medicine, you’ll need to contact the embassy, high commission or consulate of the country or territory you’re travelling to.
While travel can be enjoyable, it can sometimes be challenging. There are clear links between mental and physical health, so looking after yourself during travel and when abroad is important. Information on travelling with mental health conditions is available in our guidance page. Further information is also available from the National Travel Health Network and Centre (NaTHNaC).
Coronavirus
There is an ongoing outbreak of coronavirus in China. The virus originated in Wuhan City, Hubei Province, but cases have been confirmed in other parts of China, including Macao.
The Macao government has announced a series of measures designed to prevent the spread of the virus:
Visitors to Macao may be asked to provide details of their travel 14 days prior to arrival.
Visitors who have been to Hubei province, China, within 14 days of their arrival will be denied entry to Macao unless they present a medical certificate confirming that they are free of infection from the novel coronavirus. Non-Macao residents who may have been exposed to the coronavirus may not be allowed to enter Macao.
Anyone entering Macao who has travelled to South Korea, Italy or Iran in the 14 days prior to their arrival will be required to submit to 14 day medical observation at a designated venue.
Anyone entering Macao who has travelled to Germany, France, Spain and Japan in the 14 days prior to their arrival will be required to submit to medical examination and, at that discretion of the authorities, serve a 14 day medical observation at a designated venue.
Macao residents who are currently in areas affected by the virus are asked to go into 14 days of self-imposed isolation upon return to Macao to prevent the spread of infection. *From midnight on 17 March anyone travelling from or transiting the UK, US, Canada, Brazil, Egypt, Australia, New Zealand and the Schengen area will be required to quarantine for 14 days. Macao residents are allowed to conduct the 14-day quarantine at home, non-residents will have to stay at the Pousada Marina Infante hotel at their own expense.
You should comply with any additional screening measures put in place by the local authorities. The Macao government website provides further information.
Further advice on coronavirus is available from Public Health England and on the TravelHealthPro website.

Make sure you have adequate travel health insurance and accessible funds to cover the cost of any medical treatment abroad and repatriation.
