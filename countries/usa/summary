Due to the current US Federal Government partial shutdown, a number of US National Parks are closed or have limited services available. Please check with the US National Park Service and the Park itself before travelling. State Parks are not affected.
A number of airports are severely affected by the partial shutdown, due to the shortage of air traffic control and security staff, while others continue to operate as normal. Some airports are recommending passengers arrive 4-5 hours prior to departure for international flights, you should check with your airline before you travel. Customs procedures on arrival have also been affected and travellers can expect longer than normal processing times. Other non-essential services provided by Federal Government agencies may also be affected during the shutdown – check local media for up-to-date information.
