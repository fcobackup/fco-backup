The legal status and regulation of some medicines prescribed or purchased in the UK can be different in other countries. If you’re travelling with prescription or over-the-counter medicine, read this guidance from NaTHNaC on best practice when travelling with medicines.

If a passenger shows signs of mpox (monkeypox) upon arrival in Peru through the Jorge Chavez international airport, the local authorities will escort them to the airport medical centre for screening. If a test result is positive, authorities will arrange for the passenger to quarantine in the nearest hospital for 21 days. If the case is considered low by the hospital, the passenger can spend their 21-day quarantine in their accommodation. The passenger will need to cover all costs. There are no known protocols for mpox at land borders in Peru. Please note that this can change at short notice.
