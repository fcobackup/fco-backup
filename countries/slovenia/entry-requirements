Testing/screening on arrival
Health checks may be conducted at all border entry points. If you display signs of coronavirus infections you will be refused entry, unless you hold a permanent residence permit for Slovenia.
Quarantine requirements
The Slovenian authorities have implemented a Red list of countries, to determine the requirements for people arriving into Slovenia from overseas. The rules around entry are detailed, and subject to regular change. You should regularly consult this Travel Advice and the Slovenian Government websites listed below to ensure you have the latest information. Full details can be found on this Slovenian Government website.
From 24 October 2020, the Slovenian authorities have added the whole of the UK to the Red List. You should also be aware that the Slovenian authorities have declared specific regions of neighbouring countries to be on the Red List. You can find the full details here.
Everyone travelling to Slovenia from a country on the Red List will be required to quarantine for 10 days unless:
they meet one of the specific exemptions that are listed by the Slovenian government. The list of exemptions can be found here; or
They are able to provide a negative PCR test result or a negative Antigen test result that is not more than 48 hours old.
From 9 January 2021, negative PCR tests conducted from both EU countries and non-EU countries will be accepted, provided the test is conducted by an institution recognised by the Slovene authorities. The current list of recognised institutions can be found here.
From 9 January, Slovenia will only recognise rapid antigen tests that have been conducted in EU Member States.
From 9 January, Slovenia will no longer offer rapid antigen testing for arrivals.
If your travel is deemed by the Slovenian authorities to be non-essential, then you may be denied entry by the Slovenian authorities, even if you have a negative PCR test.
Anyone required to enter into quarantine will need to provide an address (where they will be staying) to the Border authorities. Failure to do so may result in the Border authorities denying you entry into Slovenia. During self-isolation, you are required to stay in your accommodation and not socialise outside of your household. You can take short walks for exercise, but should maintain social distancing and not engage with people from outside your household. The local municipality can make arrangements for the delivery of essential supplies if friends or family cannot support you.
All arriving travellers will be given advice at the border regarding the steps they may need to take.

Regular entry requirements
Visas  
The rules for travelling or working in European countries changed on 1 January 2021:
you can travel to countries in the Schengen area for up to 90 days in any 180-day period without a visa. This applies if you travel as a tourist, to visit family or friends, to attend business meetings, cultural or sports events, or for short-term studies or training.
if you are travelling to Slovenia and other Schengen countries without a visa, make sure your whole visit is within the 90-day limit. Visits to Schengen countries within the previous 180 days before you travel count towards your 90 days.
to stay longer, to work or study, for business travel or for other reasons, you will need to meet the Slovenian government’s entry requirements. Check with the Slovene Embassy what type of visa and/or work permit, you may need.
if you stay in Slovenia with a visa or permit, this does not count towards your 90-day visa-free limit.
Any time you spent in Slovenia or other Schengen countries before 1 January 2021 does not count towards your 90-day visa-free limit.
At Slovenian border control, you may need to use separate lanes from EU, EEA and Swiss citizens when queueing. Your passport may be stamped on entry and exit. You may also need to:
show a return or onward ticket
show you have enough money for your stay
Passport validity
Check your passport is valid for travel before you book your trip, and renew your passport if you do not have enough time left on it.
You must have at least 6 months left on an adult or child passport to travel to most countries in Europe (not including Ireland).
If you renewed your current passport before the previous one expired, extra months may have been added to its expiry date. Any extra months on your passport over 10 years may not count towards the 6 months needed.
UK Emergency Travel Documents
UK Emergency Travel Documents (ETDs) are accepted for entry, airside transit and exit from Slovenia.
