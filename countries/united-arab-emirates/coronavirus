Vessels already in port have been allowed to disembark passengers at the end of cruises.
The Cruise Line International Association (CLIA) has adopted an enhanced member health policy which all CLIA ocean member cruise lines are required to follow to address COVID-19.

Local measures
The authorities have introduced strict measures to limit the spread of COVID-19.
You should keep up to date with local public health measures and comply with instructions. If you fail to do so you risk being fined or imprisoned. The authorities have advised that the public should remain at home unless they need to buy food, basic essentials or medicine, and maintain social distancing when doing so.
The UAE National Disinfection Programme is now running daily between 2200 and 0600. During these times movement outside should be for medical emergencies only. In Dubai, a permit is required during these hours and you should apply through the Dubai permits website.
On 24 April, daytime movement restrictions in Dubai emirate were relaxed to remove the requirement for a permit between 0600 – 2200. Limited exercise outside of the home is permitted during these times.
Local restrictions may change frequently and you should keep up to date with information via official sources such as Dubai Media Office and Emirates News Agency.
Tourist and cultural sites have been closed temporarily. Pharmacies and supermarkets remain open. Since 24 April, Dubai shopping malls, markets and commercial outlets will be open for restricted hours, social distancing and other measures will apply.
All schools in the UAE are now closed for the remainder of this academic year. Many events have been cancelled. If you are planning to attend a specific event in the UAE, check with the organisers.
