COVID-19 vaccines if you live in Bulgaria
Wherever possible British nationals should aim to be vaccinated in the country where they live. As further information is available about the national vaccination programme, this page will be updated. Sign up to get email notifications.
The Government of Bulgaria has included foreign nationals, including UK citizens, resident in Bulgaria in its plans for vaccine rollout. There are two parts to the Bulgarian rollout programme:
the National Vaccination Plan, which is proceeding to vaccinate the population according to priority groups; and
the Mass Vaccination Scheme “green corridor”, which operates intermittently, as supplies allow.
UK nationals resident in Bulgaria will be offered a vaccination against Covid-19 at the same time as Bulgarian citizens under the provisions of the National Vaccination Plan. They can also put themselves forward as part of the “green corridor” scheme that allows hospitals to vaccinate all those who wish to come forward, regardless of age or priority grouping.
The Bulgarian health authorities are using only those vaccines approved by the European Medicines Agency (EMA): the Oxford/Astra Zeneca, Modena and Pfizer/BioNTech vaccines.
On 19 April, Bulgarian Health authorities announced that the AstraZeneca vaccine will not be administered to women under the age of 60 who are at risk of thrombosis, at the discretion of their GPs. Those who have received a first dose of the AstraZeneca vaccine will be able to either receive a second dose of the same vaccine or receive a second dose of the Pfizer vaccine, but not earlier than 84 days after the first shot. Those who have received a first dose, but in the meantime became infected with the coronavirus, can receive the second dose no earlier than 6 months after the laboratory confirmation the diagnosis. Those who have recovered from coronavirus, can be vaccinated no earlier than 3 months after the laboratory confirmation of the diagnosis.
Official information on the Bulgarian vaccination programme is available on Bulgaria’s coronavirus website (in Bulgarian).
On 18 May, Bulgaria’s Health Ministry outlined the procedure to fix inaccuracies in Covid-19 vaccination certificates. Citizens who find discrepancies in their issued certificates (wrong name, date of vaccination, identification number, address, etc.) must send a formal request to the vaccination centre where they received the jab or to the relevant Regional Health Inspectorate, for the territory where the vaccination centre is located. The request can be freely worded and should contain the vaccine recipient’s full name, contact details, information about the vaccines administered, as well as a detailed description of the error. If necessary, copies of relevant documentation can be attached. See here for a full list of the Regional Health Inspectorates and their contact details. In cases where the names in the vaccination certificate are misspelled, the errors can also be reported directly to the Ministry of Health by sending an email to mhcallcenter@mh.government.bg with an attached copy of the vaccination certificate and the correct spelling of the names.
Residence can be demonstrated by using either your Bulgarian residence permit or passport along with another form of documentation showing that you are legally resident in Bulgaria, such as a tenancy agreement, S1 social security document or similar.
National Vaccination Plan
To participate in the national vaccination plan, you should make sure that you are registered with a GP/family doctor and ensure that they are aware that you wish to be vaccinated. The family doctor can let you know when the vaccine will be provided under the relevant phase.
Mass Vaccination Scheme (‘green corridor’)
The ‘green corridor’ scheme is designed to facilitate mass vaccination when vaccine supply permits. To participate, check the list of all participating medical establishments.
If you would like to participate in the scheme, visit Bulgaria’s coronavirus website to register. Currently, the platform is available only in Bulgarian. The registration process requires users enter their personal identification data, to select their preferred vaccine, vaccination centre and time slot. Permanent and long-term residents in Bulgaria can use their ‘personal number of a foreign national’ (ЛНЧ – личен номер на чужденец) in order to register.
The Medicines and Healthcare Products Regulatory Agency (MHRA) is the UK authority responsible for assessing the safety, quality and efficacy of vaccines. It has authorised the Pfizer/BioNTech, Oxford/AstraZeneca and Moderna vaccines for temporary supply and use in the UK. Find out more about MHRA approval for these vaccines.
British nationals living overseas should seek medical advice from their local healthcare provider in the country where they reside. Information about vaccines used in other national programmes, including regulatory status, should be available from the local authorities. This list of Stringent Regulatory Authorities recognised by the World Health Organisation may also be a useful source of additional information. Find out more about COVID-19 vaccines on the World Health Organisation COVID-19 vaccines page.

You are responsible for organising your own COVID-19 test which is consistent with the published guidelines.
