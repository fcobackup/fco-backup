Terrorists are very likely to try to carry out attacks in Mali, including in the capital Bamako.
UK Counter Terrorism Policing has information and advice on staying safe abroad and what to do in the event of a terrorist attack. Find out more about the global threat from terrorism.
Attacks could be indiscriminate and occur without warning, including in places visited by foreigners and large crowds. You should be especially vigilant and where possible avoid places frequented by foreigners and large crowds, including diplomatic premises, hotels, restaurants, bars, nightclubs, stadiums, concert halls, shopping areas, markets, national infrastructure, public areas such as tourist attractions, airports and other transport hubs, places of worship and businesses with western interests. Large crowds and foreign, national or local government facilities, including those belonging to the defence and security forces, may also be a target.
On 16 June, the US government issued a security alert advising that a terrorist attack in Bamako may be planned targeting Malian government offices, the airport, and/or locations frequented by Westerners including diplomatic facilities, hotels, and restaurants.
You should be vigilant, be alert to announcements, monitor local media and follow the advice of the local authorities. Take particular care during festivities, and religious and public holiday periods. Avoid all large gatherings, including during national day celebrations and public holidays. Large gatherings can also include music festivals, shows, concerts, sporting events and any public marches or demonstrations. The Festival au Désert in Timbuktu was cancelled in January 2017 and has not taken place since due to security concerns. Festivals in other parts of the country are also vulnerable to attack. There may be a heightened risk of attack during election periods and religious festivals including the month of Ramadan.
During public holidays and festivals, including New Year and Eid celebrations, security measures in Mali can be heightened due to the ongoing threat posed by terrorist organisations. During such periods you should exercise increased vigilance, limit your movements and continue to avoid large gatherings. If you think a particular venue would present a good target for terrorist activities then you should avoid it.

Following French/African military intervention in Mali in January 2013, there is a high threat of retaliatory kidnap or attack against western interests. There have been a number of recent bomb attacks in Gao, Kidal, Timbuktu and in Khalil. Methods of attack have included complex attacks by militants, vehicle ambushes, small arms fire and the use of improvised explosive devices (IEDs). Malian, MINUSMA (the UN Peacekeeping Mission in Mali) and international security forces are regularly targeted, particularly in the regions of Kidal, Mopti, Timbuktu, Gao and Menaka, and attacks are frequent.
In early 2017 the government of Mali joined Chad, Burkina Faso, Niger and Mauritania (G5 Sahel countries) in announcing an agreement to set up a joint counter-terrorism force to tackle the jihadist threat, named the G5 Sahel Joint Force. The Joint Force has also been targeted by extremists.
The threat is likely to continue as groups remain intent on demonstrating capability and increasing influence across the region. The threat to western interests in the region remains. Read more about the threat from terrorism in the Sahel region.
Kidnap
There is a very high threat of kidnapping by AQ-affiliated and other regional Islamist groups. These include Jamaat Nusrat al-Islam wal Muslimeen (JNIM) and Islamic State Greater Sahara (ISGS). These groups operate throughout Mali, Niger and Burkina Faso. The kidnap threat is most significant in Northern Mali and increasingly in the centre, however there is a risk of kidnap in all parts of the country including the capital Bamako and areas in the south of Mali where the FCDO advises against all but essential travel. Westerners have been kidnapped in Mali, including in Kidal, Kayes, Timbuktu, Gao and Hombori, and the wider Sahel region.
Recent kidnap incidents include:
In May 2022, three Italian nationals and a Togolese national were kidnapped by armed men in Sincina, near the southern border with Burkina Faso
A French national was kidnapped from Gao in April 2021
Four hostages, including French and Italian nationals, were released in October 2020.
An Italian and Canadian national were kidnapped in December 2018 in Burkina Faso and were found alive by UN peacekeepers in March 2020 in northeast Mali after reportedly escaping.
In May 2019, two French tourists and their Beninese guide were kidnapped in northern Benin by an armed group. The guide was found dead and the hostages were later rescued in northern Burkina Faso whilst reportedly on their way to Mali
In January 2019, a Canadian citizen was kidnapped in northern Burkina Faso and subsequently found dead.
Several foreign nationals were kidnapped in from the northeastern region of neighbouring Burkina Faso in September 2018.
In February 2017 a Colombian nun was kidnapped in Sikasso region, in the south of Mali, and has since been released in October 2021
If you are working or travelling in Mali, you should be aware of the risk of terrorist kidnapping. You should maintain a high level of vigilance at all times, including when travelling and in crowded public places, including camps for displaced people, religious gatherings and insecure spaces like places of worship, markets, shopping areas, hotels, bars, nightclubs, restaurants and transport hubs. You should make sure you have carefully considered the threat and have reasonable, proportionate mitigation measures in place.
British nationals are viewed as legitimate targets, including those engaged in tourism, humanitarian aid work, journalism or business sectors. If you are kidnapped, the reason for your presence is unlikely to serve as a protection or secure your safe release.
The long-standing policy of the British government is not to make substantive concessions to hostage takers. The British government considers that paying ransoms and releasing prisoners builds the capability of terrorist groups and finances their activities. This can, in turn, increase the risk of further hostage-taking. The Terrorism Act (2000) makes payments to terrorists illegal.
The terrorist threat in the Sahel and Lake Chad Basin
There are a number of terrorist groups active in the region. These include JNIM, Islamic State West Africa (ISWA), Islamic State Greater Sahara (ISGS), Al Qaeda in the Islamic Maghreb (AQIM), Al Murabitoun, Ansar Dine, Katiba Macina and Boko Haram. These groups are capable of carrying out attacks and kidnaps over long distances. Kidnapping for ransom is the primary source of finance for JNIM. Criminal gangs also carry out kidnapping for terrorist groups in return for financial rewards.
There’s a heightened threat of terrorist attack globally against UK interests and British nationals from groups or individuals motivated by the conflict in Iraq and Syria.
