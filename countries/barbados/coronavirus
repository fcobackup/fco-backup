Cases of coronavirus (COVID-19) have been confirmed in Barbados. The Barbados authorities have introduced a number of measures to limit the spread of the virus.
All persons arriving in Barbados will be placed in a Barbadian government quarantine facility for 14 days.
The Ministry of Health and Wellness has issued a call for all persons who arrived in Barbados from the UK or US between March 15 and 22 to contact the ministry. This is to enable the ministry to make contact and ensure individuals remain well. Persons may contact the ministry by phoning +1 (246) 832 6171 between 9am and 5pm local time. Persons may also convey the information by WhatsApp, text message or email covid19.hotline@health.gov.bb
A daily curfew operates from 6pm to 6am local time. Outside of these hours movement continues to be restricted to purchase food or medicine, to seek medical treatmentvists to hardware stores and banks, or to work in an essential service. Persons are allowed out for essential shopping and to go to the bank on specific days and times as set by the government of Barbados. The schedule is determined by the first letter of a person’s surname. Persons should carry picture ID otherwise to gain entry to premises. Long queues have been reported and it would be sensible for people to take with them a bottle of water and an umbrella to shield them from the sun. In addition, some premises are only allowing people wearing face mask to enter the premises. You should follow the Barbados Government Information Service on Facebook for further details as plans are subject to change at short notice.
