This page has information on travelling to Thailand. Check what you must do to return to the UK.
This page reflects the UK government’s understanding of current rules for people travelling on a full ‘British Citizen’ passport, for the most common types of travel.
The authorities in Thailand set and enforce entry rules.
All travellers
You need to apply for permission to enter Thailand.
If you’re fully vaccinated
Travel by air
From 1 May, if you’re fully vaccinated, you can apply to enter Thailand via the Thailand Pass and do not need to quarantine. RT-PCR tests before and upon arrival are not required. You must have been fully vaccinated for at least 14 days before your date of travel and the vaccines must be approved by Ministry of Public Health.
Travel via land border
If you enter Thailand through land border, you will also need to apply on Thailand Pass website.
Proof of vaccination status
All persons aged 18 or over must have a vaccination certificate.
Thailand will accept the UK’s proof of COVID-19 recovery and vaccination record. A digital certificate or a screenshot of evidence of your COVID-19 vaccination status should be accepted. Your final vaccine dose must have been administered at least 14 days prior to travel. Your NHS appointment card from vaccination centres is not designed to be used as proof of vaccination and should not be used to demonstrate your vaccine status.
If you’re not fully vaccinated
If you’re not fully vaccinated, you can apply to enter Thailand via the Thailand Pass. You will be required to have a negative result from a COVID-19 RT-PCR test or a professional ATK test, issued no more than 72 hours before departure.
You may be required to download the Thai Chana COVID-19 tracking app when you arrive.
If you’ve had COVID-19 in the past year
If you’re not fully vaccinated but have recovered from COVID-19 and have received at least 1 dose of approved vaccine, you will need to show a medical certificate of recovery in order to enter Thailand.
Residents of Thailand
If you have a Thai resident visa and usually live in Thailand but you cannot return within the required year, the Thailand authorities will grant you an extension to your compulsory return deadline. You must return to Thailand as soon as you can.
Children and young people
Children aged 17 and under can enter Thailand under the same scheme as their parents or legal guardian and do not need to show proof of vaccination.
More information about entry requirements for children can be found on Ministry of Foreign Affairs website.
You may be separated from your children if they test positive for COVID-19. If this happens and you need help, you can call the Embassy on +66 (0)2 305 8333.
If you’re transiting through Thailand
If you are transiting in Thailand you do not need to register for a Thailand Pass. You must however have proof of insurance with minimum coverage of at least 10,000 USD. More information can be found on the Ministry of Foreign Affairs Thailand Pass website.
Exemptions
There are no exemptions to Thailand’s entry requirements.
Check your passport and travel documents before you travel
Passport validity
Your passport must have at least 6 months’ validity remaining from your date of entry into Thailand. You may be refused entry to Thailand if your passport is damaged or has pages missing.
If you’re a dual national, you must leave Thailand on the same passport you used to enter. If you don’t, you may experience difficulties as you pass through immigration.
Visas
You need a valid visa to stay in Thailand. If you do not have a valid visa you will have to pay overstay penalties. You should speak to your local Immigration Office or visit the Thai Immigration website.
You are legally required to have a valid passport in Thailand. If your passport expires, your visa will become invalid . If you need to renew or apply for a new British passport, see Overseas British passport applications.
If you cannot renew or change your visa and are not able to travel to the UK (because the border is closed, for example) contact the British Embassy in Bangkok.
If you have queries about visas or entry requirements, check with the Royal Thai Embassy, Thai Immigration Authority and Thai Ministry of Foreign Affairs.
Thai authorities may introduce further measures in response to COVID-19. You can monitor the latest updates from Thailand’s Ministry of Public Health website.
Under normal circumstances, British passport holders arriving by air or land can enter Thailand for 30 days without a visa (a ‘visa exemption’). If you need to stay longer, you can extend your stay once for up to 30 days. You must apply for the extension before your visa exemption period ends.
You can enter Thailand through a land border using the 30-day visa exemption 2 times in one year. If you need to enter by land more than this, you’ll need to get the appropriate visa before you travel. For more information, contact the nearest Thai embassy or consulate.
If you plan to stay for more than 30 days or you will work in Thailand. you must get the appropriate visa before you travel
The only legal way to get a new visa, entry permit or extension of stay is from a Thai Embassy or Consulate, an Immigration Officer when you enter Thailand, or one of the Immigration Offices around the country. Visas issued by visa shops, travel agents or by any other means are likely to be illegal and lead to criminal proceedings.
If you stay beyond the period of your visa (‘overstay’), you’ll be fined 500 baht per day up to a maximum of 20,000 baht. You also risk being held in detention, fined, deported at your own expense and banned from re-entering Thailand. The enforcement of penalties for overstaying is strict and conditions in detention centres can be harsh. Deportation by the Thai authorities can be a lengthy process and you will also be banned from re-entering Thailand for up to 10 years.
If you’re living or staying in Thailand on a long-term visa, immigration rules can be complex and are subject to change. It is your responsibility to ensure you meet the requirements of your visa. Stay informed and contact your local immigration office for more information.
If you have any queries about visas or entry requirements, check with the Royal Thai Embassy or Thai Immigration Authority.
Proof of onward travel and funds
Immigration officials in Thailand may ask you for proof of onward travel (eg a return or onward air ticket). You should make all reservations before travelling to Thailand. Some airlines have refused to board passengers without evidence of onward travel.
Immigration officials may also ask for evidence of adequate finances and have refused entry to people who could not show this. This is not defined in law and can be interpreted in a number of ways.
Employment
To work in Thailand you will need a work permit or business visa. Failure to follow this rule can lead to arrest and deportation.
Yellow fever certificate requirements
Check whether you need a yellow fever certificate by visiting the National Travel Health Network and Centre’s TravelHealthPro website.
UK Emergency Travel Documents
UK Emergency Travel Documents (ETDs) are accepted for entry, airside transit and exit from Thailand. If you’re planning to enter Thailand using a UK ETD, you should contact the nearest Thai Embassy or Consulate before you travel to seek advice about whether a visa is required. If you’re requesting a 2-way ETD from Thailand, you must provide proof that you have a non-immigrant visa.
