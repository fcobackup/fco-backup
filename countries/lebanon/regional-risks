Warning
FCDO advises against all travel to parts of Lebanon.

This section has safety advice for regions of Lebanon. It only covers regions where FCDO has specific advice.
You should also read FCDO’s overall travel advice and safety and security advice.
Southern suburbs of Beirut
FCDO advises against all travel to the southern suburbs of Beirut due to the presence of armed groups and heightened risk of organised crime including kidnapping.
Weapons are common in these areas and groups such as Hizballah have arms that are beyond state control. On 2 January 2025, there was a missile explosion in Msharafieh in Beirut’s southern suburbs.
Areas in the South and Nabatiyeh Governorates
Since 7 October 2023, there have been frequent mortar and artillery exchanges and airstrikes in Lebanon, most of which (but not all) have been in the South and Nabatiyeh Governorates. Although a cessation of hostilities was agreed in November 2024, strikes have continued in these areas in 2025 targeting Hizballah operations. Further strikes cannot be ruled out.
There is a UN peacekeeping presence in the area south of the Litani River due to tensions between Lebanon and Israel.
The Israeli Defence Forces retain a presence in locations along the boundary between Lebanon and Israel. British Nationals should be aware that Israeli Defences Forces have fired at civilians who have ignored their instructions to leave these areas.
See Conflict affecting Lebanon for further information.
Areas in the Bekka Governorate, including the Beqaa Valley
FCDO advises against all travel to areas in the Bekka Governorate (as described in ‘Warnings and insurance’ page) due to risks from criminal activity in these areas.
Since 26 February 2024, there have been several IDF airstrikes in the Beqaa Valley, including in the city of Baalbek. There is a risk of further strikes in the area.
Areas in the Baalbek-Hermel Governorate
British Nationals should be vigilant to heightened risks from criminal activity in the Baalbek-Hermel Governorate. From January 2025, there have been deadly armed clashes between Lebanese and Syrian groups in border towns near Hermel.
In 2023, the Lebanese Armed Forces conducted raids against narcotics factories in Baalbek, resulting in the death of numerous soldiers. Since 11 March 2024, there have been airstrikes close to the highway and near to the border with Syria. Further strikes cannot be ruled out in this area.
Palestinian refugee camps
FCDO advises against all travel to the 12 Palestinian refugee camps. See Palestinian refugee camp locations on the UN Relief and Works Agency website.
Palestinian refugee camps are volatile environments where the Lebanese state has limited capacity to impose law and order. There has been a long pattern of violent clashes.
In September 2023, Ain el Hilweh camp witnessed intense violence resulting in a number of casualties. There were reports of bullets reaching as far as Ghaziyeh Town (2km south). Tensions remain high and could escalate without warning.
Akkar Governorate including the city of Tripoli
FCDO advises against all travel to the Akkar district. This includes the area 5km from the Syrian border due to the unstable security situation in Syria. The Israeli Defence Forces have carried out airstrikes in the area near the Syrian border. Further airstrikes cannot be ruled out.
FCDO advises against all travel to Tripoli due to the risk of violent clashes between armed groups and counter-terrorism operations.
