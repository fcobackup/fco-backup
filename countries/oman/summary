The FCDO advises against all but essential travel to:
The whole of Oman based on the current assessment of COVID-19 risks.
Travel to Oman is subject to entry restrictions
It is possible for British nationals with valid residence, tourist, business ‘express’ and family visit visas to travel to Oman.
Anyone entering Oman must have a PCR test no more than 72 hours before their arrival in Oman and complete an online pre-registration form. On landing, they must have a second PCR test and after 7 days self-isolation take a third test (see Entry requirements section)
You must have valid health insurance (covering coronavirus) to enter Oman
Restrictions are in place at the land borders. In exceptional circumstances, you may be able to get permission to cross the Oman/UAE border
See Entry requirements for more information before you plan to travel.
Preparing for your return journey to the UK
If you’re returning to the UK from overseas, you will need to:
provide your journey and contact details before you travel
check if you need to self-isolate on your return
Check our advice on foreign travel during the coronavirus (COVID-19) pandemic and sign up for email alerts for this travel advice.
If you’re planning travel to Oman, find out what you need to know about coronavirus there in the Coronavirus section.
During the COVID-19 pandemic, it is more important than ever to get travel insurance and check it provides sufficient cover. See the FCDO’s guidance on foreign travel insurance.
A limited schedule of international flights, including to the UK have resumed.
Following the attack on the coalition base at Taji in Iraq on 11 March, and subsequent US airstrikes, tensions may be raised across the region. There is a possibility of an increased threat against Western interests, including against UK citizens. You should remain vigilant and keep up to date with the latest developments, including via the media and this travel advice.
Most visits to Oman are trouble-free. You should maintain a high level of security awareness and take care in public places and on the roads. Avoid large crowds and demonstrations.
Terrorist attacks in Oman can’t be ruled out. See Terrorism
Piracy remains a threat in the Gulf of Aden and the Indian Ocean. See Sea travel
If you’re abroad and you need emergency help from the UK government, contact the nearest British embassy, consulate or high commission.
