The security situation in Israel and the Occupied Palestinian Territories can be fast moving, tense and unpredictable. You should be vigilant at all times and keep up to date with local media and travel reports. You should avoid all demonstrations and large gatherings.
In April 2021, there have been confrontations and violent clashes between Israeli and Palestinian protestors and Israeli security forces in Jerusalem. These incidents have occurred particularly in the evenings and around entrances to the Old City (including Damascus Gate, Herod’s Gate and New Gate). There have also been clashes in other parts of East Jerusalem including in Sheikh Jarrah, Wadi Al Joz, and Musrara, at points along Route 60, and near Jaffa Street in West Jerusalem. Reported incidents included stone throwing, fighting between protestors, protestors temporarily blocking roads, and damage to cars and property. Security forces have deployed stun grenades and water cannons. There is now a significant police presence in these areas. Further confrontations are possible and could escalate quickly. You should exercise extreme caution when moving around these areas, avoid any demonstrations, and follow instructions of local authorities.
Terrorists are very likely to try to carry out attacks in Israel and the Occupied Palestinian Territories. Attacks could be indiscriminate, including places frequented by foreigners, and on public transport. See Terrorism
There have been repeated instances of rocket fire from Gaza, which may occur well beyond the Gaza border area; Israel has often responded by returning projectile fire into Gaza. If travelling in central or southern Israel, familiarise yourself with the safety actions that you should take in the event of a warning siren, follow advice from local authorities and stay informed of the security situation through the media and this travel advice. See Gaza
There are significant tensions between Israel, and the Assad regime and Iranian military forces in Syria. The situation remains fragile, with attempted and actual military exchanges either side of the border. If travelling in the area remain vigilant, follow advice from local authorities and stay informed of the security situation through the media and this travel advice.
There are also continued tensions between Israel and Lebanon. The situation on the ground could change quickly. See Border with Lebanon
In Israel and the West Bank, including Tel Aviv, East Jerusalem and the Old City (particularly the Damascus Gate and Lion’s Gate areas of the Old City) and Hebron, there have been numerous violent clashes between protestors and security forces and stabbing, shooting, arson, vehicle ramming and stone throwing attacks on people and vehicles. These types of incidents also happen along Route 60 within the West Bank (the main road connecting Jerusalem with Nablus and Hebron) and along Route 443 between Tel Aviv and Jerusalem. There’s a risk that tourists or bystanders could be caught up in any incident. You should avoid any demonstrations and follow instructions of local authorities.
Be especially vigilant and take great care at the Qalandiya checkpoint between East Jerusalem and Ramallah, in areas close to refugee camps, in and around Israeli settlements and in the cities of Jenin, Nablus and Ramallah. There have also been several violent incidents in the northern West Bank area (north of Tappuah). Individuals carrying weapons have been arrested in Nablus.
There is a risk of increased tension around Jewish high holidays (Passover, Rosh Hashana, Yom Kippur and Succoth) and after Friday prayers and on religious holidays. Demonstrations and other forms of civil unrest can occur at short notice and often turn violent. See Safety and security
If you’re abroad and you need emergency help from the UK government, contact the nearest British embassy, consulate or high commission. Consular support is severely limited in parts of the Occupied Palestinian Territories and Occupied Golan Heights where the FCDO has existing advice against all travel (see above).
