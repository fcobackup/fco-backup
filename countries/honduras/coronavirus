Be prepared for your plans to change
No travel is risk-free during COVID-19. Countries may further restrict travel or bring in new rules at short notice, for example due to a new COVID-19 variant. Check with your travel company or airline for any transport changes which may delay your journey home.
If you test positive for COVID-19, you may need to stay where you are until you test negative. You may also need to seek treatment there.
Plan ahead and make sure you:
can access money
understand what your insurance will cover
can make arrangements to extend your stay and be away for longer than planned
Travel in Honduras
Restrictions to prevent the spread of coronavirus are in place. If you are in Honduras you should observe social distancing of at least 1.5 metres.
On 22 March 2023 local authorities declared that the proper use of masks is mandatory in the following places:
in private and public hospitals, medical and dental clinics, vaccination centres, medical and dental laboratories, nursing homes, prisons and other places that provide health services
in places where social distancing cannot be observed, for example closed and crowded spaces (such as public transport), places with poor ventilation, airports and as recommended by local authorities
You should familiarise yourself with the COVID-19 threat level in your area and keep up to date with any changes.
Visit the website of the Honduran Police and the website of the National Institute of Migration for more information on present restrictions related to COVID-19.
Ensure you have the documents for your hotel, car rental, tour or ticket reservations with you at all times. Local authorities may stop you and ask for documents confirming your travel plans.
You can keep up to date with the COVID-19 situation in Honduras and any current restrictions by visiting the official website of the Honduran Government.

If you think you have COVID-19 symptoms you should seek medical advice.
The public health system has limited capacity for handling severe and critical cases of COVID-19.
Some private hospitals are accepting patients with COVID-19, but it will cost 1,000,000 Lempiras (over £30,000) to be admitted, with the final medical bill potentially higher.
Small clinics can provide testing, basic medical attention and medication to COVID-19 patients with mild symptoms who do not require special medical care.
British-issued prescriptions cannot be used locally. To find a pharmacy (“farmacia”) look for one of the big national chains such as Farmacias Siman, Farmacias Kielsa or Farmacia El Ahorro, among others; a quick search online should help you to identify the nearest one open.
Your emotional and mental wellbeing is important. Read guidance on how to look after your mental wellbeing and mental health during the COVID-19 pandemic
