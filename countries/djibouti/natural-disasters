Djibouti is in an active volcanic and earthquake zone. To learn more about what to do before, during and after an earthquake, see the website of the US Federal Emergency Management Agency.
Intense rainfall, whilst rare, can lead to flash floods, particularly in the vicinity of Djibouti City, most recently in November 2019. This can lead to major disruption, damage to buildings and roads, and the outbreak of water-borne and respiratory diseases. You should avoid flood areas and follow official advice.
