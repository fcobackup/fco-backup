The Foreign, Commonwealth & Development Office (FCDO) advises against all travel to within 25km of Eritrea’s land borders, as the borders are currently closed.
Eritrea’s land borders are closed. Some international flights have resumed.
Before you travel, check the ‘Entry requirements’ section for Eritrea’s current entry restrictions and requirements. These may change with little warning. Monitor this advice for the latest updates and stay in contact with your travel provider.
If you plan to pass through another country to return to the UK, check the travel advice for the country you’re transiting.
It is more important than ever to get travel insurance and check it provides sufficient cover. See the FCDO’s guidance on foreign travel insurance.
All foreign nationals, including diplomats, must apply in advance for a travel permit to leave the Asmara region. See Travel Permits and Consular Assistance.
Consular support is severely limited in parts of Eritrea. If you’re in Eritrea and you need urgent help (for example, you’ve been attacked, arrested or someone has died), call the British Embassy in Asmara on +291 1 125 123. If you’re in the UK and worried about a British national in Eritrea, call 020 7008 5000. See Consular Assistance
The Eritrean authorities consider all British nationals holding either Eritrean or PFDJ identity documents (including out of date documents) as Eritrean nationals. The British Embassy is unable to offer consular assistance to dual nationals in Eritrea. See Dual nationals.
Although there’s no recent history of terrorism in Eritrea, attacks can’t be ruled out. See Terrorism.
If you’re abroad and you need emergency help from the UK government, contact the nearest British embassy, consulate or high commission.
