The information on this page covers the most common types of travel and reflects the UK government’s understanding of the rules currently in place. Unless otherwise stated, this information is for travellers using a full ‘British Citizen’ passport.
The authorities in the country or territory you’re travelling to are responsible for setting and enforcing the rules for entry. If you’re unclear about any aspect of the entry requirements, or you need further reassurance, you’ll need to contact the embassy, high commission or consulate of the country or territory you’re travelling to.
You should also consider checking with your transport provider or travel company to make sure your passport and other travel documents meet their requirements.
Entry rules in response to coronavirus (COVID-19)
Entry to Peru
The entry of foreign nationals who travel from India, South Africa and/or Brazil or who have stopped over in India, South Africa and/or Brazil in the last 14 calendar days and do not reside in Peru, is banned until 30 May. Commercial international travel started on 5 October 2020. Passengers need to wear a face mask and a facial protector and need to have proof of a negative result from a COVID-19 PCR (molecular) or antigen test taken 72 hours before the commercial flight. You should not use the NHS testing service to get a test in order to facilitate your travel to another country. You should arrange to take a private test.
Quarantine requirements
All passengers arriving in Peru, irrespective of nationality and country of origin, have to show a molecular or antigen test with a negative result. If your test result is positive, you will have to self-isolate following the local authorities’ advice.
Peruvian nationals and foreign residents in Peru who enter Peru from India, South Africa or Brazil or who have stopped over in India, South Africa or Brazil must isolate by law in their homes, shelters or accommodation for 14 calendar days upon arrival in Peru.
Visas
During the state of emergency, the Peruvian authorities have confirmed that fees will be waived for overstays on visas owing to the State of Emergency only.
Regular entry requirements
Visas
Normally, you don’t need a visa to travel if the purpose of the visit is tourism. If you’re travelling for any other purpose, check entry clearance requirements with the Peruvian Consulate-General in London.
If you have tourism status in Peru, you’ll need to apply online for a special permit in order to sign any type of contract, eg, purchase of a home, business contracts, at a notary public. For more information, please contact the Peruvian Immigration Office or the Peruvian Consulate-General in London.
On arrival, you’re normally given permission to stay for up to 90 days.
Double check the period of time you’ve been granted. If you overstay, you’ll need to pay a fine. In the worst case scenario you could be held in detention.
While it is not required by the immigration authorities, some airlines require passengers to show proof of onward travel (e.g. an airline ticket) in order to travel to Peru.
Immigration
Land borders in Peru remain closed. If you want to enter or leave Peru by land, you must request a special permit to the Peruvian Ministry of Foreign Affairs, and possibly to the Ministry of Foreign Affairs of your country of origin/destination.
If you enter Peru overland from Ecuador, make sure your passport is stamped with a Peruvian entry stamp at the local immigration office. Most people crossing the border with Ecuador enter Peru through Aguas Verdes (Tumbes region) - you may need to ask for directions to the immigration office. If your passport is not stamped at the border with Ecuador, you can have it stamped at the Immigration Office in the city of Tumbes.
If you enter Peru from Bolivia by bus or taxi, make sure your passport is stamped with a Peruvian entry stamp at the immigration office in Desaguadero or Copacabana (Puno region).
Immigration authorities may also not let you leave Peru without a valid exit stamp from the last country you visited.
If you enter Peru without an entry stamp then you’re required by law to apply for a new entry stamp at the nearest immigration office. The immigration authorities will need you to provide your passport and evidence of your entry to Peru, eg air/bus ticket in your name, exit stamp from the last country you visited, and any other documentation they deem necessary. If you’re unable to provide any such evidence you must apply for an exit or expulsion order at the Immigration Office in Lima. You won’t be allowed to leave Peru without this, and you may be prevented from re-entering Peru for the next five to ten years.
The British Embassy can’t intervene in immigration issues. Make sure you get your entry stamp when you arrive in Peru, but if your passport was not stamped on entry into Peru, we can assist you in requesting the entry stamp or the exit order. The sooner you start that process, the better.
Passport validity
Your passport should be valid for a minimum period of 6 months from the date of entry into Peru.
UK Emergency Travel Documents
UK Emergency Travel Documents (ETD) are currently not accepted to enter or transit Peru. They are accepted to leave Peru only, issued by the British Embassy in Lima. After receiving the ETD, the holder will have to approach the Peruvian Immigration Office to get a new entry immigration stamp. This can be done at the airport. If the previous passport was lost or stolen, the authorities will request a police report.
Customs
British nationals have experienced problems when trying to enter the country with more than one laptop. You should familiarise yourself with Peruvian immigration or customs procedures before you enter the country. For further details contact the Peruvian Consulate in London.  
If you are returning to the UK via Europe, be aware that the customs authorities in European airports frequently confiscate duty free alcohol and other liquids purchased at the duty free shops in Lima airport from passengers in transit.  
Travelling with children
Children under the age of 18 years travelling on a British passport who have resident status in Peru need written permission (Autorización de Viaje Notarial) from the non accompanying parent(s) to leave the country.
This permission is obtained by a notary public in Peru. The letter must mention the proposed destination, the purpose of the trip, the date of departure and the return date.
If unable to obtain a notarial permission, the child will need a judicial written permission (Autorización de Viaje Judicial) issued by a judge. If one of the parents has committed certain crimes, the other parent can request a judicial written permission from the judge. If one of the parents is deceased, the other parent would need to submit the death certificate to a notary public, so that an indefinite notarial permit to travel with the child is issued.
Children who have tourist status do not need these permissions, but immigration officers are free to request them in circumstances considered suspicious by the immigration authorities or if the child has stayed in Peru for over 183 days.
For further information, contact the Peruvian Consulate in London or the Peruvian Immigration Department.
