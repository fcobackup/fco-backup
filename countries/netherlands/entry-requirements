The information on this page covers the most common types of travel and reflects the UK government’s understanding of the rules currently in place. Unless otherwise stated, this information is for travellers using a full ‘British Citizen’ passport.
The authorities in the country or territory you’re travelling to are responsible for setting and enforcing the rules for entry. If you’re unclear about any aspect of the entry requirements, or you need further reassurance, you’ll need to contact the Embassy, High Commission or Consulate of the country or territory you’re travelling to.
You should also consider checking with your transport provider or travel company to make sure your passport and other travel documents meet their requirements.
Entry rules in response to coronavirus (COVID-19)
Entry to the Netherlands
The Dutch Government has announced that from 1 January 2021, non-EU/EEA nationals and nationals of non-Schengen states, including UK nationals, will not be permitted entry to the Netherlands for non-essential purposes due to EU-wide COVID-19 restrictions. Please see the Dutch Government’s website for a list of exemptions. International arrivals from outside the EU and Schengen countries remain subject to entry checks to prevent non-essential travel.
This measure does not apply to UK nationals who are legally resident in the Netherlands, who will be allowed to re-enter the country. UK nationals who are legally resident in the Netherlands will, from 1 January 2021, have to demonstrate they have a residency permit, a certificate of application or a document with their address, and may be subject to questioning by Dutch border authorities when they arrive in the Netherlands.
The Dutch Government requires all international travellers aged 13 and above travelling by aeroplane, passenger ferry, train and coach to be in possession of a negative PCR COVID-19 test result and a completed test declaration. More information on these requirements can be found here. There are some limited exemptions to this requirement, listed on Dutch Government’s website.
If you are travelling via Belgium or France, check FCDO Travel Advice for those countries.
Testing/ screening on arrival
If you’re travelling to or from the Netherlands by air you must complete a health screening form and have it ready to show on request during your journey, whether you are at the departure airport, on the aircraft or at the arrival airport. This form is not required if travelling to the Netherlands by road or ferry.
You may be refused permission to travel based on your declaration.
On arrival in the Netherlands your declaration will be checked by public health and security authorities.
Quarantine requirements
The Dutch Government has a colour-coded system of high-risk (orange) and lower risk (yellow) countries and regions. Travellers entering the Netherlands from high-risk (orange) regions or countries are required to self-isolate for 10 days upon arrival, unless stated otherwise in the Dutch travel advice.
Further information on self-isolation in the Netherlands can be found on the Dutch Government’s website (in English).
Data collection
Local health authorities may use passenger data to carry out contact tracing for passengers arriving from high-risk (orange) countries.
Regular entry requirements
Visas
If you hold a British Citizen passport, you don’t need a visa to enter the Netherlands. If you’re planning a stay of longer than 3 months, see our Living in the Netherlands guide and contact the Netherlands Embassy if you have further questions.
The rules on travel will stay the same until 31 December 2020.
Visas from 1 January 2021
The rules for travelling or working in Europe will change from 1 January 2021:
you will be able to travel to countries in the Schengen area for up to 90 days in any 180-day period without a visa as a tourist, to visit family or friends, to attend business meetings, cultural or sports events, or for short-term studies or training.
if you are travelling to the Netherlands and other Schengen countries without a visa, make sure your whole visit is within the limit. Visits to Schengen countries within the previous 180 days before you travel would count towards the 90-day limit
to stay for longer, to work or study, for business travel or for other reasons, you will need to meet the entry requirements set out by the Netherlands. This could mean applying for a visa and/or work permit. You should check with the Netherlands Embassy what type of visa and/or work permit, if any, you will need
if you are in the Netherlands with a visa or permit, your stay will not count towards the 90-day limit
The 90-day limit for visa-free travel will begin on 1 January 2021. Any days you stay in the Netherlands or other Schengen countries before 1 January 2021 will not count towards the 90-day limit.
At border control for the Netherlands, you may need to:
show a return or onward ticket
show you have enough money for your stay, and
use separate lanes from EU, EEA and Swiss citizens when queueing
Your passport may be stamped on entry and exit.
Passport validity
The rules on travel will stay the same until 31 December 2020.
Your passport should be valid for the proposed duration of your stay; you do not need any additional period of validity on your passport beyond this.
Passport validity from 1 January 2021
From 1 January 2021, you must have at least 6 months left on an adult or child passport to travel to most countries in Europe (not including Ireland).
If you renewed your current passport before the previous one expired, extra months may have been added to its expiry date. Any extra months on your passport over 10 years may not count towards the 6 months needed.
Check your passport is valid for travel before you book your trip. You will need to renew your passport before travelling if you do not have enough time left on your passport.
Before you travel, make sure your passport is in good condition. The Netherlands authorities often impound damaged passports and some travellers have had to get an emergency travel document to leave the country.
Travelling with children
Dutch border authorities have strengthened their precautions against child abduction. Parents (particularly fathers) travelling in sole charge of their children are regularly stopped for further checks at Schiphol airport and occasionally prevented from boarding flights.
You should carry a signed authorisation form for travelling abroad with a minor and associated documents (outlined in the above link). See also Get permission to take a child abroad.
UK Emergency Travel Documents
UK ETDs are accepted for entry, airside transit and exit from The Netherlands
Moving to the Netherlands
If you intend to live in the Netherlands, you should get important documents (birth certificate and marriage certificates) officially certified (apostilled) at the FCDO Legalisation Office.
