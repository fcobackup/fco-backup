Conflict in Israel and the Occupied Palestinian Territories
There was a large scale terrorist attack by Hamas in southern Israel and Hamas continues to launch rockets into Israel. There are Israeli air strikes into Gaza.
If you are in an area affected by the fighting,  follow the instructions of Israeli Home Front Command. To find these:
visit the Israeli Home Front Command website (available in Israel only)
call 104 if you are in Israel
The Israeli government has declared a state of emergency across the whole country. International borders (air and land) in Israel and the Occupied Palestinian Territories (OPTs) could close at short notice.
Due to the security situation, some family members of staff at the British embassy in Tel Aviv and British Consulate in Jerusalem are temporarily being withdrawn. The embassy and consulate continue with essential work including services to British nationals.

Assisted departure
The UK government will facilitate commercial flights to the UK to help British nationals wanting to leave Israel following the Hamas attack. The first flight is due to depart from Ben Gurion Airport in Tel Aviv on 12 October.
Vulnerable British nationals will be prioritised for these flights. FCDO will contact people who are eligible for the flights directly. You should not make your way to the airport unless you are contacted. Register your presence to receive important updates, including information on support to leave the country.
Travelling to Egypt from Gaza 
If you are a British national in Gaza who wants to enter Egypt, check the status of the Rafah crossing into Egypt before you travel. Movement to the Rafah crossing and beyond is at your own risk. You should only travel if you judge it is safe to do so. Check the Egypt travel advice.
