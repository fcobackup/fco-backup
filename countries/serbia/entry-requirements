This information is for people travelling on a full ‘British citizen’ passport from the UK. It is based on the UK government’s understanding of the current rules for the most common types of travel.
The authorities in Serbia set and enforce entry rules. If you’re not sure how these requirements apply to you, contact the Serbian Embassy in the UK.
Passport validity requirements
Your passport must have an ‘expiry date’ at least 90 days after the date you plan to leave Serbia.  
Check with your travel provider that your passport and other travel documents meet requirements. Renew your passport if you need to.
You will be denied entry if you do not have a valid travel document or try to use a passport that has been reported lost or stolen.
Visa requirements
You can visit Serbia without a visa for up to 90 days within a 6-month period, for business or tourism.
For details about employment visas and long-stay visas, check the information from the Serbian Embassy in the UK.
If you want to extend your stay while you are in Serbia, you can apply at the police station where you’re registered at least 30 days before the 90-day period expires. For more information visit the website of the Serbian Ministry of Foreign Affairs.
Make sure you get your passport stamped.
When entering Serbia, make sure border guards stamp your passport. If you try to leave Serbia without an entry stamp you could face charges of illegal immigration, a heavy fine and a prison sentence.
Land border crossings
Only enter Serbia by land through recognised border crossings. Serbian borders remain open for entry and exit, subject to any entry requirements currently in place in neighbouring countries.
Travelling between Serbia and Kosovo
The authorities in Serbia do not consider the designated crossing points with Kosovo to be official international border crossing points.
It is possible to travel from Serbia to Kosovo, and back again.
To travel from Kosovo to Serbia, you must have a Serbian entry stamp from Belgrade, Niš or Kraljevo airports, or from one of Serbia’s land border crossings with:
Bosnia and Herzegovina
Bulgaria
Croatia
Hungary
Montenegro
North Macedonia
Romania
You are likely to be refused entry into Serbia from Kosovo without a valid Serbian entry stamp. We are also aware of isolated incidents where Serbian authorities have cancelled Kosovo stamps in passports of foreign nationals or denied foreign nationals entry to Serbia if they have Republic of Kosovo stamps in their passports.
If you are planning to travel between Serbia and Kosovo, see the Kosovo travel advice.
Tensions between Serbia and Kosovo can cause difficulties at border crossings with Kosovo.
Registering with the police
You must register with the local police where you’re staying within 24 hours of your arrival in Serbia. If you’re staying in a hotel, check-in staff will register you automatically. If you do not register, you could get a fine, and face arrest and a court appearance.
Vaccine requirements
For details about medical entry requirements and recommended vaccinations, see TravelHealthPro’s Serbia guide.
Customs rules
There are strict rules about goods that can be brought into and out of Serbia. You must declare anything that may be prohibited or subject to tax or duty.
You must declare personal items of value you’re carrying – for example, jewellery, cameras and computing equipment. These are exempt from customs duties.
Taking money into and out of Serbia
If you are carrying cash or travellers cheques worth more than 10,000 euros, you must:
complete a declaration form at customs on arrival in Serbia – a customs officer will certify this by signing or stamping the form
keep a copy of the certified form while you are in Serbia
show the certified form when you leave Serbia
If you are taking any Serbian dinars into the country, you must show the receipt from the bank where you bought them.
Customs officers may seize your money if you do not follow these rules.
You should exchange any unwanted dinars before you leave Serbia. British banks do not normally exchange dinars. Do not use street dealers. Only change money through banks or official exchange offices.
It is not possible to exchange Scottish and Northern Irish banknotes in Serbia.
