At least 8 weeks before your trip, check the latest country-specific health advice from the National Travel Health Network and Centre (NaTHNaC) on the TravelHealthPro website. Each country-specific page has information on vaccine recommendations, any current health risks or outbreaks, and factsheets with information on staying healthy abroad. Guidance is also available from NHS (Scotland) on the FitForTravel website.
General information on travel vaccinations and a travel health checklist is available on the NHS website. You may then wish to contact your health adviser or pharmacy for advice on other preventive measures and managing any pre-existing medical conditions while you’re abroad.
The legal status and regulation of some medicines prescribed or purchased in the UK can be different in other countries. If you’re travelling with prescription or over-the-counter medicine, read this guidance from NaTHNaC on best practice when travelling with medicines. For further information on the legal status of a specific medicine, you’ll need to contact the embassy, high commission or consulate of the country or territory you’re travelling to.
While travel can be enjoyable, it can sometimes be challenging. There are clear links between mental and physical health, so looking after yourself during travel and when abroad is important. Information on travelling with mental health conditions is available in our guidance page. Further information is also available from the National Travel Health Network and Centre (NaTHNaC).
Coronavirus
Cases of coronavirus (COVID-19) have been confirmed in Romania. The Romanian authorities have introduced a number of measures to limit the spread of the virus. Restrictions for travellers arriving in Romania include:
• mandatory quarantine in an institution such as a hospital if you have travelled from Italy, Hubei Province in China, Madrid, Iran, or Daegu City or Chendongo County in South Korea
• all flights, bus, and rail routes from Italy are suspended, and airlines have been asked to deny boarding to travellers coming from the above countries and areas
• travellers arriving from other parts of China, South Korea, all of Iran, and Heinsberg District in North-Rhine Westphilia in Germany will be asked to self-isolate for 14 days on arrival.Travellers arriving from the UK are required to fill in a form to self-certify that they are infection-free. Infringements on these procedures are being pursued with fines of up to €4000
• the Romanian Government has indicated that travel restrictions are likely to expanded in the coming days. There are some indications that travel from the UK may be more tightly managed.
Within Romania the Government has:
• announced the closure of national museums and other tourist attractions such as the Palace of the Parliament
• banned confined space events with more than 100 participants, and all events with more than 1000 participants
• closed all schools in the country until at least 22 March, which may be extended
• recommended all universities suspend courses until 31 March
• asked private companies based in cities and with over 99 employees to vary working hours to reduce overcrowding on public transport. Government ministries have been mandated to work with much lower staffing levels
• advised against non-essential use of public transport
The public health system is already under significant strain.
Further information on coronavirus, including advice on preparing for foreign travel and helping reduce the spread of the virus, is available from Public Health England and on the TravelHealthPro website.
You can find more information about cases in Romania on the TravelHealthPro country page.
Healthcare
The rules on access to healthcare will stay the same until 31 December 2020.
You should get a free European Health Insurance Card (EHIC) before leaving the UK. After 31 December 2020, your UK-issued EHIC might not be valid.
The EHIC entitles you to state provided medical treatment that may become necessary during your trip. Any treatment provided is on the same terms as Romanian nationals. If you don’t have your EHIC with you or you’ve lost it, you can call the Department of Health Overseas Healthcare Team (+44 191 218 1999) to get a Provisional Replacement Certificate.
It is important to take out comprehensive travel insurance that includes cover for emergency medical treatment and associated costs. The existing EHIC arrangements are not an alternative to travel insurance, as some health-related costs, including for medical repatriation, ongoing medical treatment and non-urgent treatment, are not covered. Read more about what your travel insurance should cover.
If you’re living in Romania, you can also find more information on healthcare for residents in our Living In Romania guide.
If you need emergency medical assistance during your trip, dial 112 and ask for an ambulance. If you are referred to a medical facility for treatment you should contact your insurance/medical assistance company immediately.
