Travel in Thailand
Travelling to/from the airport or other port of arrival
Domestic air travel options within Thailand are opening up but remain more limited than before. If you intend to leave Thailand and need to take a domestic flight to reach your international airport, you should check with your provider and plan accordingly.
Bus, train and boat routes are opening up but may be subject to restrictions. Make sure that you can get to your international departure airport.
Provincial authorities may enforce measures which are stricter or different to those in other areas, including closing borders or imposing internal travel restrictions.
Requirements when travelling e.g. public transport, taxis
Internal bus and train routes are opening up and travel between provinces is now permitted. However, travellers moving between provinces may be required by local authorities to undergo quarantine on arrival in a new province so you should check the requirements for your destination.
If you are taking an internal flight in Thailand, you may be asked to download an app or complete additional travel documentation. Some regional airports are temporarily closed – you should double-check before travelling. There may be road checkpoints in place across Thailand so you should carry a passport as proof of identification when in public. There have recently been instances where non-Thais have not been allowed to use transport between provinces or visit public sites, such as temples. You should check before you book or travel.
Local restrictions
An emergency decree is currently in place until 31 July 2020. A number of measures have been outlined stating, among other instructions, that you must not:
enter high risk areas
hoard essential goods
attend public gatherings
propagate false information
Further measures may be introduced at any time. You should follow the advice of the Thai authorities. Keep up to date with the latest health advice provided by Thailand’s Ministry of Public Health and updates from the Thai government on the situation.
A phased lifting of lockdown measures across Thailand is underway. Details of the measures may differ between different provinces. Measures may also change or even be reimposed at short notice in response to COVID-19 conditions. Provincial authorities may enforce measures which are stricter or different to those in other areas, including closing hotels and beaches. Check the details for the province where you are.
Relevant penalties for breaches of regulations
Everyone should comply with the measures put in place in Thailand to limit the spread of coronavirus (COVID-19). There have been several cases of foreign nationals being arrested and fined or sentenced to jail for breaching restrictions.
The Thai Department of Disease Control linked the smoking of cigarettes to the impact of coronavirus. Smoking in public is banned and can result in a fine of up to 5,000 Baht. Electronic cigarettes are already illegal in Thailand and their use may incur further fines or imprisonment.
Accommodation
Hotel and private rental accommodation is available throughout Thailand. Some hotels have closed and remain so, and we advise that you contact hotels directly when booking.
The majority of hotels will ask to take your temperature on arrival and ask you to complete a declaration in relation to your recent travel history and whether you have any symptoms related to COVID-19.
Some services and facilities in hotels may not be available e.g. leisure facilities.
Public spaces and services
Most public places and services are now open with social distancing measures in place. Some entertainment venues such as pubs and clubs are still temporarily closed or operating with restrictions. Some provinces may impose stricter measures including lockdowns on certain premises. Most shops and malls etc now have processes in place to register customers on entry and exit.
Health
The Thai authorities have advised the elderly (over 70 years), children (under 5 years) and those with pre-existing medical conditions (diabetes, hypertension, respiratory diseases, lung diseases) not to leave their home except for essential purposes, such as buying groceries, conducting business transactions, going to a hospital or filing complaints to the police.

Finance
For information on financial support you can access whilst abroad, visit our financial assistance guidance.
If you’re in Thailand and have exhausted all other options to cover essential living costs while you wait to return home, you could apply for an emergency loan for your living costs from the UK government. You can only apply if you normally live in the UK and you cannot return home. This is a last resort option for those most in need and you would need to repay the loan when you are back in the UK. Apply for an emergency loan.
