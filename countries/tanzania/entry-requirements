This page has information on travelling to Tanzania.
This page reflects the UK government’s understanding of current rules for people travelling on a full ‘British Citizen’ passport from the UK, for the most common types of travel.
The authorities in Tanzania set and enforce entry rules. If you’re unsure how Tanzania’s entry requirements apply to you, contact its UK embassy, high commission or consulate.
All travellers
You do not need to show a COVID vaccination certificate or negative COVID test to enter Tanzania.
Health officials may screen you for COVID symptoms on arrival. They may also randomly select travellers for rapid antigen testing.
If you’re transiting through Tanzania
Your carrier or final destination country may have separate rules on vaccination and testing requirements. Check with your transport provider or travel agent for their COVID-19 requirements before you travel.
Check your passport and travel documents before you travel

If you are a resident in Tanzania, your passport must be valid for 6 months from the date you arrive.
Check with your travel provider to make sure your passport and other travel documents meet their requirements.
Visas
All British passport holders need a tourist or business visa to enter Tanzania. Tanzania has introduced an ‘e-visas’ system through which applications can be submitted and approved online in advance of travel. It is no longer possible to get a visa from the Tanzanian High Commission in London.
It is also possible to get a tourist or business visa for a single entry on arrival at main ports of entry to Tanzania, subject to the fulfilment of all immigration requirements. You may be asked to provide proof of your return journey. You will not be able to get a multiple entry visa on arrival. For further information about visas visit the Tanzanian immigration website .
If you are planning to work or volunteer, you will need a valid work permit which can also be applied for online via the Tanzanian immigration website. Your employer or volunteer organisation should arrange this before you travel.
If you overstay the validity of your visa or permit you can be arrested, detained and fined before being deported. Reports made to the British High Commission by Black, Asian and Minority Ethnic (BAME) British passport holders have indicated that they are experiencing additional levels of harassment from immigration officials. In these circumstances, you should stay calm and request that the Consular section of the British High Commission is immediately informed.
