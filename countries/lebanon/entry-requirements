Entry rules in response to coronavirus (COVID-19)
Entry to Lebanon
Beirut’s Rafik Hariri international airport re-opened on 1 July with initially limited capacity of 2,000 passengers daily and limited flights.
All passengers travelling to Lebanon must fill this health declaration form online before departure, as required by the Lebanese Ministry of Public Health. In case this is not possible, the form can be filled on-board, in order to enter Lebanese territory.
Passengers travelling to Lebanon, except military personnel, diplomats, members of international organizations, UNIFIL and members of the Lebanese National Social Security Fund or staff cooperative, need to possess an insurance policy that is valid for the duration of their stay in Lebanon, covering all costs of treatment for Coronavirus on Lebanese territory. Alternatively, the policy can be obtained at the insurance counters upon their arrival at Rafik Hariri International Airport-Beirut
Testing and screening on arrival
People travelling to Beirut will be required to comply with testing and self-isolation measures to reduce the spread of coronavirus. Check with the airline and Lebanese embassy before booking. Any passenger who shows symptoms of illness including COVID-19 will not be allowed to board the aircraft.
Travellers arriving in Lebanon from countries where PCR testing is available, except for children under five years of age, are required to take a PCR test at a laboratory certified by local authorities within 96 hours prior to travel, and to show the result at check-in before proceeding to immigration. If the test result is positive, the passenger will be prohibited from boarding the aircraft.
Upon arrival at Rafik Hariri International Airport, passengers will be required to take another PCR test, and must adhere to home quarantine until receiving the result (between 24 hours to 48 hours). Certain airlines are covering the cost of this test whilst others may not. Travellers should check with their airline.
Passengers travelling from countries without PCR testing capability will be required to have a test on arrival (excluding children under five years of age) and will be obliged to isolate for 24 hours in hotels that have been selected by the Ministry of Tourism, until they have received the results of the test conducted at the airport. Passengers travelling with some airlines may be required to pay $50 for the test, to be paid through the airline, whilst certain airlines may cover the cost. Travellers should check with their airline. Passengers will have to take a second test after 72 hours at their own expense at an accredited laboratory in accordance with the instructions of the Lebanese Ministry of Public Health. Passengers will not be allowed to leave their quarantine hotel until they have provided full details of the second test that they have booked. After leaving the hotel, passengers will still have to quarantine until the result of the new PCR test is issued via text message along with an electronic copy.
For passengers travelling from countries where PCR testing is not available for all, but who have conducted the PCR test there within 96 hours prior to their trip to Lebanon and the result was negative, it is possible to be exempted from another PCR test 72 hours after their arrival in Lebanon, according to the decision of the Ministry of Public Health Medical Team at the airport.
Passengers who left Lebanon for a period not exceeding one week will be exempt from PCR testing on arrival.
Connecting passengers are allowed to board a flight from PCR testing countries without conducting a PCR test before departure.
Quarantine requirements
If you test positive for COVID-19 after entering Lebanon, you will have to quarantine at designated centres from and may be required to download a mobile phone application for follow up. The quarantine centres are managed by the respective Governorates Crisis Management Sub-Committee. Throughout, you will be required to follow Ministry of Health guidelines.
Transit Passengers
There are no testing or additional COVID-19 related procedures required for transiting traveller. Passengers with a short transit time will be allowed to proceed directly to their gate, those with a longer transit time will have to wait at a designated gate where a cafeteria is available.
Regular entry requirements
Visas
British citizens can normally apply for a free single entry tourist or family visit visa on arrival. British Overseas Citizens and British Protected Persons will need to get a visa before travelling to Lebanon. Persons of Palestinian origin may also require a visa before travelling, or may be required to carry additional documentation with them when travelling. Entry requirements are subject to change, so you should check with the Lebanese Embassy before you travel.
Overstaying without the proper authority is a serious matter. You may be refused permission to leave until a fine has been paid.
Passport validity
Your passport should be valid for a minimum period of 3 months from the date of entry into Lebanon.
UK Emergency Travel Documents
UK Emergency Travel Documents (ETDs) are accepted for entry, transit and exit from Lebanon.
If your passport is stolen, you’ll need to report the theft to the police in the area where it took place and obtain a police report before an ETD can be issued. If your passport has been lost, you’ll need to go to the nearest General Security office and get a certificate of loss before an ETD can be issued. These are mandatory steps in all cases where the original passport showing the entry stamp into Lebanon isn’t available.
Once an ETD has been issued to you, you’ll need to visit the General Security office in central Beirut to obtain an exit visa before you can depart. You should factor the time this will take into any new travel plans.
Previous travel to Israel
If your passport contains an Israeli stamp you may be refused entry to Lebanon even if you hold a valid Lebanese visa.
Stop matches
Lebanese Immigration Authorities check all visitors’ names on arrival against a database of those wanted for, or convicted of, offences in Lebanon. If a name matches against an entry on the database the individual may be detained (or on occasion allowed entry upon surrender of their passport) until they can prove that the record does not relate to them. It’s often possible to do so by producing a copy of a birth certificate or other official documentation that allows parents’ names to be checked against the database. You should consider carrying this kind of supporting documentation.
