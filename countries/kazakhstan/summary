COVID-19 entry restrictions for Kazakhstan
Before you travel, check the ‘Entry requirements’ section for Kazakhstan’s current entry restrictions and requirements. These may change with little warning. Monitor this advice for the latest updates and stay in contact with your travel provider.
Travelling from and returning to the UK
Check what you must do to travel abroad and return to England, Scotland, Wales or Northern Ireland.
If you plan to pass through another country to return to the UK, check the travel advice for the country you’re transiting. If you will pass through a red list country, book your hotel quarantine package before travelling to the UK.
Protests in all main cities have led to a nationwide State of Emergency being declared with a curfew in place from 11pm to 7am. This may be extended at short notice. On 4 January 2022, protests became increasingly violent, particularly in Almaty where we advise against all but essential travel. Entry to and exit from Almaty is currently restricted. Other cities in the south are also difficult to access.
If you are in Almaty, you should stay away from areas where there is a risk that you could get caught up in incidents of unrest. See Safety and security
