This page reflects the UK government’s understanding of current rules for people travelling on a full ‘British Citizen’ passport, for the most common types of travel.
The authorities in Wallis and Futuna Islands set and enforce entry rules. For further information contact the embassy, high commission or consulate of the country or territory you’re travelling to. You should also consider checking with your transport provider or travel company to make sure your passport and other travel documents meet their requirements.
Entry rules in response to coronavirus (COVID-19)
Travellers must fill in a travel certificate (or “attestation”) (available here). All travellers over the age of 11 must undertake a test for COVID-19 within 72 hours before departure for Wallis and Futuna. The test is obligatory and the traveller must show proof of a negative result before embarking.
Travellers may also need to produce a self-certified document affirming that they have no COVID symptoms and that to their knowledge they have not been in contact with any person confirmed positive within the last 14 days. You should check with your travel operator and the local Prefecture’s advice ahead of travel.
Airlines may refuse boarding to anyone who does not produce both proof of a negative result and the self-certified document.
It is also necessary to register with the Cellule d’Organisation des Vols (COV) before travelling to Wallis and Futuna. Further information is available on the website of the local Prefecture.
You may be subject to a period of quarantine upon arrival. Please see the website of the local Prefecture for further details.
These entry requirements are subject to change. For further information on the entry restrictions in place for French Overseas Territories, please see the French government’s website before travelling.
