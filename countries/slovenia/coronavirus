Travelling from and returning to the UK
Check what you must do to travel abroad and return to England, Scotland, Wales or Northern Ireland.
If you plan to pass through another country to return to the UK, check the travel advice for the country you’re transiting. If you will pass through a red list country, book your hotel quarantine package before travelling to the UK.
You are responsible for organising your own COVID-19 test, in line with UK government testing requirements. You should check that the test result can be provided in the correct format and language.
Be prepared for your plans to change
No travel is risk-free during COVID. Countries may further restrict travel or bring in new rules at short notice, for example due to a new COVID-19 variant. Check with your travel company or airline for any transport changes which may delay your journey home.
If you test positive for COVID-19, you may need to stay where you are until you test negative. You may also need to seek treatment there.
Plan ahead and make sure you:
can access money
understand what your insurance will cover
can make arrangements to extend your stay and be away for longer than planned
Moving around in Slovenia
Movement between all statistical regions is permitted.
Public spaces and further measures
Surgical or FFP2 type facemasks are mandatory in all enclosed public spaces, including on public transport. Surgical or FFP2 facemasks are recommended in open places and outside where a distance of 1.5 metres cannot be maintained. Fabric masks are not permitted.
There are no requirements for children under the age of six to wear facemasks. Facemasks are also not required to be worn by primary school pupils up to 5th grade when in classrooms, and people practicing non-contact sports, if a distance of 3 metres can be maintained.
Many of the rules apply across all of Slovenia, but some rules are specific to regions depending on their Covid-rating. You can find the status of a specific statistical region on the Slovenian Government website.
From 21 February 2022, the requirement to demonstrate your COVID-19 status (known locally as ‘PCT’) to access services has been removed, with the exception of those accessing services in hospitals, healthcare, social care and prisons. Full details can be found on the Slovene Government website. The following proof can be used in order to demonstrate your COVID-19 status to access the services in hospitals, health care, social care or prisons:
Proof of full vaccination (as outlined below in ‘Proof of vaccination’)
Proof of a negative PCR test (taken within 72 hours), or a negative rapid antigen test (taken within 48 hours).
Proof of recovery from COVID-19 (dated more than 10 days ago and less than six months ago).
From 19 February 2022, a person who has been in close contact with someone who has tested positive for COVID-19 will no longer be required to self-isolate at home. They should continue to inform all those with whom they have been in contact. It is also recommended that those in close contact with a positive case from their household self-test for 7 days.
From 19 February 2022, rapid antigen testing is no longer free. Self-administered rapid antigen tests are available to buy from pharmacies.
Proof of vaccination
You will only be required to demonstrate proof of vaccination to access the services in hospitals, health care, social care or prisons. The Slovene government recognises vaccination certificates, which conform to the EU Digital Covid Status Certification framework, illustrating that you are fully vaccinated with a vaccine authorised by the European Medical Authority. This means:
7 days after a second dose of Oxford/AstraZeneca, Pfizer/BioNTech, Moderna
28 days after a single dose of Johnson & Johnson
7 days after a single injection for those able to demonstrate they have already been infected (this only applies to those vaccinated in Slovenia)
Slovenia will accept the UK’s proof of COVID-19 recovery and vaccination record. If you are travelling with a printed PDF proof of vaccination status, it must date from 1 November or after to ensure that the certificate can be scanned successfully, if domestic certification is required. Your NHS appointment card from vaccination centres is not designed to be used as proof of vaccination and should not be used to demonstrate your vaccine status. From 1 February 2022, people aged 18 and above, will need to show proof that their second COVID-19 vaccination was received no more than 270 days previously. Vaccination certificates issued after a booster dose of Moderna or Pfizer will also be considered as proof of vaccination and is not subject to the 270 day limit. If you are travelling with a printed NHS PDF proof of vaccination status, it must be dated 1 November 2021 onwards and be the version for travel purposes, not the version for domestic use in the UK, in order to ensure that the certificate can be scanned successfully, if certification in Slovenia is required. Your NHS appointment card from vaccination centres is not designed to be used as proof of vaccination and should not be used to demonstrate your vaccine status.
More information on how to obtain a certificate/QR code is available, if vaccinated in Northern Ireland and if vaccinated in Scotland.

COVID-19 vaccines if you live in Slovenia
Wherever possible British nationals should aim to be vaccinated in the country where they live. We will update this page when the Government of Slovenia announces new information on the national vaccination programme. You can sign up to get email notifications when this page is updated.
The Slovenian national vaccination programme started in December 2020 and is using the AstraZeneca, Pfizer-BioNTech, and Moderna vaccines. The use of Janssen (Johnson and Johnson) has been suspended. The Government of Slovenia has stated that British nationals resident in Slovenia are eligible for vaccination, including boosters. You should register your interest online via the zVEM service, and also notify your doctor in Slovenia. You will need your EMŠO (Identity card) number and your Slovene health insurance card. The vaccine registration facility is only available in Slovene, so you might need some assistance if you don’t speak Slovene.
Alternatively, you can go to the vaccination centres across the country or view the current schedule (in Slovene).
Find out more, including about vaccines that are authorised in the UK or approved by the World Health Organisation, on the COVID-19 vaccines if you live abroad.
British nationals living in Slovenia should seek medical advice from your local healthcare provider. Information about COVID-19 vaccines used in the national programme where you live, including regulatory status, should be available from local authorities.
If you receive your COVID-19 vaccination in Slovenia, you can get an EU Digital COVID Certificate from the national authorities. The Certificate proves that you have been vaccinated against COVID-19, received a negative test result, or recovered from COVID-19. It will help facilitate your travel within the EU and, in some countries, you can use it to demonstrate your COVID-19 status to businesses and other organisations.
