Before you travel check that:
your destination can provide the healthcare you may need
you have appropriate travel insurance for local treatment or unexpected medical evacuation
This is particularly important if you have a health condition or are pregnant.
Emergency medical number
Call 211111 (in Windhoek) or 10111 (everywhere else) and ask for an ambulance.
Contact your insurance company promptly if you’re referred to a medical facility for treatment.

Namibia has one of the highest prevalence rates of HIV in the world. In 2021 the UNAIDS Report on the Global AIDS Epidemic estimated that around 210,000 adults aged 15 or over were living with HIV. This was around 11.8% of the adult population, compared to around 0.2% of adults in the UK. Take normal precautions to avoid exposure to HIV/AIDS.

Healthcare facilities in Namibia
There are good medical facilities in Windhoek. Private hospitals may insist on payment before starting treatment even if you have comprehensive travel insurance. They may ask you to pay and reclaim from your insurer later. Some travel insurance policies are not recognised by some Namibian hospitals. Check if your product is accepted in Namibia before you travel and get alternative coverage, if needed.
