Be prepared for your plans to change
No travel is risk-free during COVID. Countries may further restrict travel or bring in new rules at short notice, for example due to a new COVID-19 variant. Check with your travel company or airline for any transport changes which may delay your journey home.
If you test positive for COVID-19, quarantine is mandatory. You must follow the instructions of the local health authorities. You may also need to seek treatment there.
Plan ahead and make sure you:
can access money
understand what your insurance will cover
can make arrangements to extend your stay and be away for longer than planned

If you think you have COVID-19 symptoms, you should call either of the designated local numbers 0800VIGILAN (0800844526) or 0800COVID19 (08002684319) for a medical assessment and advice on what steps you must take (Spanish only).
You may also seek private medical advice or attention if you consider appropriate. Bear in mind that private medical treatment is extremely costly in Venezuela. Private clinics often require individuals to have valid private medical insurance with sufficient coverage, or to pay costs in advance in order to receive treatment.
COVID-19 testing is mostly handled by private laboratories and costs must be covered privately.
Some COVID-19 testing remains possible, although with very limited availability, within the public health system through CDIs (centros de diagnóstico integral) and a designated network of public hospitals or “hospitales centinela” throughout the country. Testing using the public health system usually takes between 24 and 48 hours. If you test positive you must follow the instructions of the local health authorities.
Your emotional and mental wellbeing is important. Read guidance on how to look after your mental wellbeing and mental health
