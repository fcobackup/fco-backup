Warning
FCDO advises against all travel to Syria.

Your travel insurance could be invalidated if you travel against advice from the Foreign, Commonwealth & Development Office (FCDO).
FCDO advises against all travel to Syria
FCDO advises against all travel to Syria due to the ongoing conflict and unpredictable security conditions.
If you are a British national in Syria, leave the country by any practical means.
If you are affected by the escalated situation in Syria (see ‘Safety and Security’ and ‘Getting help’ pages), shelter in place until you can identify safe means to leave the country. Some curfews have been imposed in affected areas. Follow local advice and exercise caution.
Damascus International Airport remains open and operational. If you are in Damascus, you should leave now if it is safe to do so.
UK government support
Consular support is not available from the British government from within Syria, as all British Embassy services in Damascus are suspended. If you need help, call the FCDO in London on +44 (0)20 7008 5000.
Travel insurance
If you choose to travel against FCDO advice, research your destinations and get appropriate travel insurance. Insurance should cover your itinerary, planned activities and expenses in an emergency.
