Warning
FCDO advises against all travel to parts of Djibouti.

This information is for people travelling on a full ‘British citizen’ passport from the UK. It is based on the UK government’s understanding of the current rules for the most common types of travel. 
The authorities in Djibouti set and enforce entry rules. If you’re not sure how these requirements apply to you, contact the Djibouti Embassy in the UK.
COVID-19 rules
If you’re fully vaccinated
To enter Djibouti, you may need to show evidence of full COVID-19 vaccination, but this is rare.
If you are a foreign resident, you may need to show evidence of full vaccination (or medical exemption) to leave the country, but this is rare.    
You can find your proof of vaccination in your GP health record on the NHS App.
If you’re not fully vaccinated
If you are unable to show evidence of full vaccination, you may need to show a PCR test certificate or take a PCR test on arrival. 
Children and young people
People aged 24 and under do not have to show evidence of vaccination.  
If you’re travelling through Djibouti
If you’re travelling through Djibouti on your way to another country and staying in the airport (airside) or on the plane, there are no COVID-19 entry requirements.
If you pass through immigration (sometimes known as a layover), for example to stay in a hotel for a flight the next day, you must follow the Djibouti COVID-19 entry requirements. 
Exemptions
You do not need evidence of vaccination if you can show you should not have the vaccine for health reasons or if you:
are pregnant
are breast feeding a baby aged 6 months and under
had COVID-19 less than 4 months before date of travel
Passport validity requirements
To enter Djibouti, your passport must have an ‘expiry date’ at least 6 months after the date you arrive.
Check with your travel provider that your passport and other travel documents meet requirements. Renew your passport if you need to.
You will be denied entry if you do not have a valid travel document or try to use a passport that has been reported lost or stolen.
Visa requirements
You must have a visa to enter Djibouti.
Applying for a visa
You can buy a tourist visa when you arrive in Djibouti with payment in cash in US dollars. You can also apply for a visa online before travelling or contact the Djibouti Embassy. You must have evidence of your onward journey.
Vaccine requirements
To enter Djibouti, you must have a certificate to prove you’ve had a yellow fever vaccination if you’re coming from a country listed as a transmission risk.
For full details about medical entry requirements and recommended vaccinations, see TravelHealthPro’s Djibouti guide.
