Strikes, political demonstrations and social protests are a relatively frequent occurrence in Senegal, particularly in Dakar but also other cities. These are normally peaceful, but can sometimes turn violent. Political tensions remain heightened since the unrest at the beginning of March 2021 following the arrest of Ousmane Sonko. You should exercise caution and avoid areas where demonstrations and large gatherings are likely.
Pickpocketing and street crime are common in parts of Dakar, particularly around Place de l’Indépendance, the central area of the Plateau and the Western Corniche, as well as Gorée Island. There is a heightened risk of criminality in the run up to the religious festival of Tabaski on 20/21 July. Be cautious when changing cash given the risk of false money circulating.

Terrorists are likely to try to carry out attacks in Senegal. Attacks could be indiscriminate, including in places visited by foreigners. See Terrorism
You should be vigilant when travelling in Casamance, the region south of The Gambia. Where possible you should avoid travelling at night, stick to main roads and travel in a convoy when you can. The Casamance region has suffered from decades of low intensity separatist violence, largely directed at Senegalese security forces. While the security situation has improved significantly since 2012, there are occasionally violent incidents, including armed attacks on travellers. There are sometimes military operations in the region. There is a lower level of risk in the main tourist areas of the Casamance. See Local travel
Most visits to Senegal are trouble-free.
If you’re abroad and you need emergency help from the UK government, contact the nearest British embassy, consulate or high commission.
The Embassy continues to carry out essential work including providing 24/7 consular assistance and support to British people in Senegal.
