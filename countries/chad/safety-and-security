Political situation
There continues to be potential for instability in Chad, particularly in its border regions and in the run-up to and during major political events, such as during Chad’s ongoing political transition and ahead of elections, due to take place before the end of 2024.
In April 2021, an armed convoy belonging to the rebel group “Le front pour l’alternance et la concorde au Tchad” (FACT) crossed into north-western Chad from Libya, and engaged in fighting with government forces. Following the death of President Idriss Deby Itno, a Transitional Military Council was established to govern Chad. All British nationals were advised to leave the country due to the increased risk of instability. The UK Embassy Office closed temporarily, and reopened in May 2021.
During April-May 2021, tensions remained high, with violent clashes between protesters and security forces in N’Djamena and southern Chad. A number of people were killed, with reports of live ammunition having been used against demonstrators.
In May 2021, there were reports of armed forces entering south-western Chad from the Central African Republic before being repelled by Chadian forces. Chadian rebel groups in neighbouring countries and elsewhere continue to threaten Chad.
Inter-communal clashes in Abéché (eastern Chad) and Sandana (southern Chad) in January and February 2022 respectively led to several deaths.
On 14 May 2022, there were protests in N’Djamena and other towns which included anti-French sentiments; Total petrol stations in N’Djamena were attacked and damaged. Further protests and attacks against perceived French targets could take place.
You should exercise extra vigilance and caution, and avoid any demonstrations or large gatherings of people. If you become aware of any nearby protests leave the area immediately. You should keep informed of developments through local media.
Crime
The number of reports of car-jackings on roads outside N’Djamena has increased, including during daylight hours. You should use a police or military escort when driving outside the capital, and carry working communications equipment.
Armed robberies, particularly from cars, in some residential areas of N’Djamena are common. Foreigners are sometimes targeted.
Be vigilant and take particular care in the capital. Travel by car and not by foot, especially if you are alone, or motorbike. Keep doors locked and windows closed. Do not carry large sums of money, jewellery, or other valuables. Avoid isolated or less developed areas of towns and do not travel alone at night.
Local travel
There are around 1 million displaced people in Chad, including refugees from Sudan, Central African Republic and Nigeria and displaced people in the Lake region. A state of emergency remains in place in the Lake Chad region.
Chad and Sudan have agreed to enhance the role of the joint border force but banditry and violent crime in eastern Chad still exist. The border with Sudan is subject to closure at little notice.
The border between Chad and Central African Republic has been closed and instability in neighbouring Central African Republic remains concerning. In May 2021, there were reports of armed forces entering south-western Chad from the Central African Republic before being repelled by Chadian forces.
The area bordering Libya is heavily land-mined. The northern regions of Borkou, Ennedi and Tibesti remain unsafe.
Road travel
Road travel can be dangerous due to the state of the roads and quality of driving. Accidents involving motorbikes are particularly common. Crowds can quickly gather around the scene of an accident and, while rarely violent, can be intimidating. Try to make contact with the police or other local authority immediately if you’re involved in an accident.
For travel outside the capital, you will need authorisation from the Ministry of the Interior, which is normally granted without difficulty after a few days. Roads are poor and often impassable during the rainy season (July-October), especially in the south. Heavy rains during the rainy season (July-October) can result in major flooding in many areas, particularly in the south and east. You should ensure you have adequate supplies of food and clean water.
You should travel in convoy, keep doors locked and carry spare fuel and supplies. Police checkpoints are common: you may be asked to show your passport, driving licence and vehicle registration documents. Do not travel by road after dark.
You should be careful on the road passing in front of the Presidential Palace in N’Djamena. In three separate incidents in March 2019, 2 motorists were killed, and a motorcyclist shot, by Palace guards. Avoid stopping in front of the Palace and driving close to the guards, and do not use this road at night.
