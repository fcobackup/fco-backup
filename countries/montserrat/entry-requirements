Entry rules in response to coronavirus (COVID-19)
All travel to or from Montserrat is via Antigua. If you are travelling to Montserrat you must comply with Antiguan entry requirements, even when immediately transiting on to Montserrat. Check travel advice for Antigua before booking any flights to or from Montserrat.
Pre-arrival requirements
Resident permit holders, Montserratians (plus dependents) and a few limited other categories of people are allowed to enter Montserrat.
All intended arrivals must submit an Access Declaration Form at least 72 hours prior to booking your travel, and have evidence of a negative COVID-19 test result within 5 days prior to arrival. You should not use the NHS testing service to get a test in order to facilitate your travel to another country. You should arrange to take a private test.
Upon submission of the form you will receive an email reply pre-clearing your entry. You must save this email. The airline might ask for it when you book your flight. You can find the form and other information, including a full list of categories of people who are allowed to enter Montserrat at this time, on the Government of Montserrat website.
Screening on arrival
The Government of Montserrat has introduced enhanced health screening and all new arrivals will need to self-isolate. Individuals who exhibit signs of the virus may face quarantining at the discretion of the Medical Officer. Technicians are required to take a PCR test after 5 days if staying longer than 5 days.
Non-resident technicians are required to be tested on arrival (in addition to providing a negative test before departure).
