New Zealand is located in a seismic zone and is subject to earthquakes. Tsunamis may occur along the coastlines. There are also a number of active volcanoes in New Zealand. Flooding and landslides can occur, resulting in road closures and infrastructure damage. Follow the advice of the local authorities and emergency services in the event of a natural disaster.
As part of your own contingency plans, you should make sure you have easy access to your passport and other important documents such as nationality documents and birth and marriage certificates, as well as any essential medication. You can read our crisis overseas page for further information and advice, including sections on what you can do to prepare effectively, what you should do in the event of a crisis abroad, and how we can help you.
