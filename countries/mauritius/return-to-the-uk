There are currently no regular commercial flights from Mauritius to the UK. The British High Commission is in contact with airlines and local authorities to ensure that British travellers can return to the UK from Mauritius as soon as possible.
Air Mauritius entered into voluntary administration on 22 April. Those with existing Air Mauritius tickets or plans to use the airline in the coming months should look out for announcements from Air Mauritius or the administrator, Grant Thornton.
The Mauritian immigration services have confirmed that foreign nationals in Mauritius on a tourist entry do not need to extend their “leave to stay” period (as stamped in your passport on arrival) if it is due to expire during the current confinement period.
Future travel options
You will need to pay for your return travel to the UK. If departure options are available but you cannot afford the travel costs and have exhausted all other options for getting funds, you may be eligible to apply for an emergency loan from the government. This is a last resort option and you would need to repay the loan when you are back in the UK. For more information, you should contact Corporate Travel Management (CTM). CTM are a commercial partner of the FCO and are authorised to administer such loans on behalf of the FCO.
Your journey home
