The information on this page covers the most common types of travel and reflects the UK government’s understanding of the rules currently in place. Unless otherwise stated, this information is for travellers using a full ‘British Citizen’ passport.
The authorities in the country or territory you’re travelling to are responsible for setting and enforcing the rules for entry. If you’re unclear about any aspect of the entry requirements, or you need further reassurance, you’ll need to contact the Embassy, High Commission or Consulate of the country or territory you’re travelling to.
You should also consider checking with your transport provider or travel company to make sure your passport and other travel documents meet their requirements.
Entry rules in response to coronavirus (COVID-19)
The Fiji government has announced changes to International travel due to COVID-19. The Fiji border remains closed to British tourists. Only residents and Fijian citizens are allowed to return to Fiji.
Returning residents and citizens must:
Present a certificate from a recognised medical institution certifying 14 days of quarantine in Australia or New Zealand, along with proof of a negative COVID-19 test result within 48 hours of your departure to Fiji. Once you arrive, you will then spend another seven days in-home quarantine in Fiji.
If you haven’t completed 14 days quarantine in Australia or New Zealand, but have a negative COVID-test result within 48 hours of travel, then on arrival to Fiji you must spend 14 days in a government-designated quarantine centre. Afterwards, you can go to your home in Fiji, if you are symptom-free.
If you’re a returning Fijian citizen or Fiji resident, you must download the careFIJI app to enter the country. If you don’t have a smartphone, you can buy one upon landing at Nadi airport for $100. This is mandatory.
All foreign nationals who are currently stranded in Fiji have been advised to contact Fiji Immigration Office so that they could be properly guided to maintain their legal status. This applies to all categories of permit holders.
These restrictions supersede the regular entry requirements set out below which refer to Fiji’s requirements that existed before the border was closed.
Further information can be found the Fiji government website.

Customs requirements
Fiji customs enforce strict quarantine regulations and x-ray all in-bound luggage at Nadi airport. Most perishable foodstuffs will be confiscated on arrival, unless arriving from a country with quarantine agreements with Fiji.

Travelling with children
Some countries require documentary evidence of parental responsibility before allowing lone parents to enter the country or, in some cases, before permitting the children to leave the country.
In the case of Fiji, no such documentation is required for visitors. But it is required for those applying for work and/or residency permits. For further information contact the Fiji High Commission in London.
