Crime
Levels of crime against visitors are very low.
Road travel
There are only two metalled roads on Pitcairn. Other roads are dirt tracks. Transport around the island is by quad bike or on foot. All quad bikes are privately owned and therefore most visitors travel on foot. Longer-term visitors who propose using a quad bike are required to pass a short quad bike driving test before a licence will be issued by the island Police Officer.
Sea travel  
Transfer between the island and the ship is by longboat and can be difficult in poor weather, particularly for people with limited mobility. Life jackets are provided and visitors are given full instructions before boarding the longboat and assistance at all stages of the transfer.
