Credit/debit cards and travellers’ cheques aren’t accepted. It’s very difficult to get cash against credit cards at banks or to use them in shops and restaurants. Make sure you have enough cash in US Dollars (clean, unblemished notes dated 2009 onwards). Juba is comparatively expensive; one night’s accommodation in an international standard hotel can be up to $200 and vehicle rental can be from $150 per day.
