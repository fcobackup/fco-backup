Terrorists are very likely to try to carry out attacks in Bangladesh. The threat extends across the country. There have been several IED attacks targeting police and security forces in Dhaka in 2019 and an IED attack against an Awami League office in Khulna city. There is a risk that future attacks could target public gatherings, including religious gatherings and political rallies, crowded areas, places with a police or security presence and locations where foreign nationals are known to gather. You should minimise your exposure to these areas, consider your movements carefully and follow any specific advice of the local authorities. On 23 December 2019, the Dhaka Metropolitan Police issued a security notice for those attending Christmas services in churches, advising that additional security personnel and measures such as searches will be in place.
