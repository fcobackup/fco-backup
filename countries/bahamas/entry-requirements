Visas
British nationals visiting are usually allowed entry into the Bahamas for up to 30 days without a visa. This can be extended up to a maximum of 8 months by applying to the Department of Immigration in Nassau. Penalties for overstaying include fines and detention pending deportation. See more information about visas.
If you require a visitor visa, the Ministry of Foreign Affairs has an electronic visa application process. The official website is: https://mofa.gov.bs/obtaining-official-documents/visitors-visa/. Please email mofaconsular@bahamas.gov.bs for more information on visa processing fees and turnaround times.
For all other types of travel, seek advice from the Bahamian High Commission in London.
If you are travelling via the USA, you may need to apply for an ESTA. The Bahamas counts as part of the ‘contiguous territory and islands’ for US visa waiver purposes and time spent in The Bahamas counts towards the 90 day maximum permitted stay in the US under this waiver. If you travel to The Bahamas via the USA under US visa waiver arrangements and are in any doubt about your US visa status, you should seek advice from either the US Immigration and Naturalisation Service or any US diplomatic mission before starting your return journey.
If you’re concerned about your immigration status (e.g. overstaying a visa) due to the emergency restrictions, contact the Department of Immigration on 225 5337 or immigration@bahamas.gov.bs. Guidance on how to apply for an electronic extension to stay and other COVID-19 related immigration concerns has also been published on the Department of Immigration website.
