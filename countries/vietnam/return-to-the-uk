Commercial flights
There are a small number of scheduled international flight options per week from Vietnam to regional transit hubs, with an established track record of flying and with viable connecting flights to the UK. These include Incheon and Hong Kong. You should check with your travel provider on what flights are currently available.
Transiting other countries
If you are returning to the UK, a transit stop in the journey may require you to self-quarantine on arrival. See guidance on entering or returning to the UK
There are some restrictions on airside transit which you should check in advance to ensure you can transit. For transit via Korea, there is a 24-hour transit restriction at Incheon airport. You are advised to make sure your connecting flight is within this period.
VietJet has flights to Incheon but these flights do not have airside transit facilities and anyone travelling with VietJet would be subject to 14 days of quarantine on arrival in Korea.
For Hong Kong, airside transit can be allowed for connecting flights to the UK if your flight itinerary is contained in a single booking and if transit is no more than 24 hours.
Other options
There are a growing number of other airlines allowing people to book flights from Vietnam online. However, you should check carefully in advance whether these flights are guaranteed to fly.
Due to COVID-19, flights and transit arrangements are still prone to changes and cancellation with little notice. Check with the airlines and/or travel agents for up to date information on flight times and travel requirements, particularly transit times, visa and transit visa requirements and whether your baggage can be transferred airside at transit points.
