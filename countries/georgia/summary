The Foreign and Commonwealth Office (FCO) advise against all travel to the breakaway regions of South Ossetia and Abkhazia, and against all but essential travel to areas immediately adjacent to the Administrative Boundary Lines with Abkhazia and South Ossetia.
The British government does not recognise the unilateral declarations of independence made by the de facto authorities in the breakaway regions of Abkhazia and South Ossetia. Consular support is not available in parts of Georgia where we advise against all travel. See Local travel
Foreign nationals have been detained on arrival in Georgia for possession of medicines that would not normally be problematic in the UK or other countries. See Entry requirements
Take out comprehensive travel and medical insurance before you travel. See Entry requirements
Take care when driving and if possible avoid driving at night. See Road travel
The political situation in Georgia is generally calm, but demonstrations and opposition rallies occasionally take place. Demonstrations are usually policed. Keep well away from all demonstrations.
There is some risk from unexploded ordnance in areas along the Administrative Boundary Lines with South Ossetia and Abkhazia, and near the border with Azerbaijan (Red Bridge area in particular). Areas where unexploded ordnance might be present are not always marked. See Local travel
Terrorist attacks in Georgia can’t be ruled out. See Terrorism
