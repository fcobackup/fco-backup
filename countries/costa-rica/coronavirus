Entry and borders
On 16 March 2020 the Costa Rican government announced a state of emergency and Changes to Migratory Regulations.
From midnight on Wednesday 18 March 2020 until 15 May 2020 only Costa Rican citizens and legal residents will be allowed entry to the country by land, sea or air. These categories of people, entering during this time, will be required to self-isolate for 14-days.
The Costa Rican government has announced that any legal resident who left Costa Rica on or after 24 March would automatically be prohibited from re-entry for a period specified on the date of their leaving and notified to them in writing.
Any foreigner who entered Costa Rica as a tourist after 17 December 2019 will have their visa waiver (usually 90 days) extended until 17 July 2020. There is no need to apply for this to be processed, it is applied automatically.
Current restrictions on the use of private vehicles are as follows: from 5am-7pm, the usual registration plate restriction for San Jose has been extended to the entire country. The authorities have also announced a ban on the use of private vehicles between 7pm and 5am, except those used by officials, diplomats or people categorised as “essential workers”. On weekends, vehicular restrictions are in place according to odd/even license plate number, and only for visits to supermarkets, pharmacies and medical centres. You should check for further details. We advise British nationals in Costa Rica to follow the advice of the local authorities. The supply of hire cars may be reduced as rental companies have been asked to lend their vehicles for deliveries of medical equipment and goods. Public transport is operational from 04:00-23:00. Taxis can circulate at all hours.
