There are currently no regularly scheduled commercial options available to return to the UK from Morocco.
If you cannot leave Morocco at this time, see advice on staying in Morocco during coronavirus.
Flights
The two special commercial flights organised by the British Embassy from Casablanca to the UK on Friday 5 June are now full. We are examining the possibility of bringing in another flight(s), but only if there is demand.
If you are normally resident in the UK and wish to book a seat on a possible flight, please email morocco.britishsupport@fco.gov.uk as soon as possible with the following details:
full name as it appears in your passport
British passport number
other nationality (if applicable) and passport number
date of birth
place of birth
UK residency number (if applicable)
contact telephone number (including country code)
location in Morocco
other relevant information, eg important health condition
If you have already registered your details with the British Embassy, do not send another email. You will be contacted shortly.
Future options
This travel advice will be updated with information on departure options that become available. Sign up for email alerts and follow the British Embassy Rabat on Twitter and Facebook.
You will need to pay for your return travel to the UK. If departure options are available but you cannot afford the travel costs and have exhausted all other options for getting funds, you may be eligible to apply for an emergency loan from the government. This is a last resort option and you would need to repay the loan when you are back in the UK. For more information, please email the British Embassy in Rabat at morocco.britishsupport@fco.gov.uk.
Your journey home
The National Travel Health Network and Centre (NaTHNaC) provides advice on how to stay safe as you travel by air.
If youâ€™re returning home before 8 June, follow the guidance for when you return to the UK on steps you should take to protect yourself and others. From 8 June there will be new rules for entering the UK.
