This page reflects the UK government’s understanding of current rules for people travelling on a full ‘British Citizen’ passport, for the most common types of travel.
The authorities in Italy set and enforce entry rules. For further information contact the embassy, high commission or consulate of the country or territory you’re travelling to. You should also consider checking with your transport provider or travel company to make sure your passport and other travel documents meet their requirements.
If you are travelling to Italy for work, read the guidance on visas and permits as the rules have changed since 1 January 2021.
Entry rules in response to coronavirus (COVID-19)
Entry to Italy from the UK
From 31 August, travellers from the UK can enter Italy without being required to quarantine if they have proof of vaccination and a negative test taken within 48 hours before entering Italy.
If you wish to fly, you must present the airline with a negative COVID-19 rapid antigenic or molecular swab test taken no more than 48 hours before travel.
Before travel, you must complete an online digital form. This will generate a QR code, which should be presented to your travel provider and Border Police if requested. A paper form can be completed if you do not have an electronic device.
Travellers arriving without proof of a negative test and details of where they will self-isolate may be refused entry.
Airport regulations note travellers are required to wear a medical mask whilst on board flights to and from Italy. Masks should be replaced every 4 hours if it is not possible to maintain social distancing. You should check on board requirements with your airline.
Everyone arriving in Italy must also call the COVID-19 helpline for the region you are travelling within 48 hours of arrival, to inform them of your visit.
Exemptions from testing and self-isolation may apply to travellers transiting Italy in a private vehicle for less than 36 hours and those travelling for proven reasons of work, health or absolute necessity, for less than 120 hours. The requirement to complete a passenger locator form will still apply to all travellers (even those exempt from testing and self-isolation). Check the Ministry of Health guidance for details of the exemption process.
You can read more about the requirement to get a COVID-19 test (including when you might be exempt) on the Italian Embassy in London’s COVID-19 update page.
Check Italian Embassy in London guidance, or contact your travel provider, for more information.
If you are a UK national resident in Italy, we advise carrying proof of your residence when entering Italy.
In addition to the above measures, all travellers to Italy should consult the Italian Government’s online questionnaire (in English) for more advice on entry requirements and travel to Italy
Many airlines and airports serving Italy are operating a reduced service and may be subject to change. You are strongly advised to check your airline’s website, as well as the website for the airport you are intending to fly to for the latest information.
Demonstrating your COVID-19 vaccination status
The UK vaccination certificate cannot facilitate entry to Italy whilst the Italian quarantine requirement is in place for UK arrivals, currently in effect to 30 August. Your NHS appointment card from vaccination centres is not designed to be used as proof of vaccination.
Travel via other countries
You should check travel advice for any countries you plan to travel through ahead of your journey.
The requirements set out above may change if you have travelled from, or transited through, a country on Lists D and E. Consult the Italian Government’s online questionnaire (in English) for more advice.
Regular entry requirements
Visas
The rules for travelling or working in European countries changed on 1 January 2021:
you can travel to countries in the Schengen area for up to 90 days in any 180-day period without a visa. This applies if you travel as a tourist, to visit family or friends, to attend business meetings, cultural or sports events, or for short-term studies or training
if you are travelling to Italy and other Schengen countries without a visa, make sure your whole visit is within the 90-day limit. Visits to Schengen countries within the previous 180 days before you travel count towards your 90 days
to stay longer, to work or study, for business travel or for other reasons, you will need to meet the Italian government’s entry requirements. Check which type of visa and/or work permit you may need with the Italian Ministry of Foreign Affairs before booking an appointment through the Italian consulates in London or Edinburgh.
if you stay in Italy with a residence permit or long-stay visa, this does not count towards your 90-day visa-free limit
British Citizens who are unable to return to the UK before the expiry of their visa/permit or the end of their visa-free limit due to COVID-19 restrictions should contact their local immigration office (questura).
Any time you spent in Italy or other Schengen countries before 1 January 2021 does not count towards your 90-day visa-free limit.
At Italian border control your passport may be stamped on entry and exit. You should also be prepared to:
queue in separate lanes from EU, EEA or Swiss citizens.
show proof of your accommodation, for example, a hotel booking confirmation or proof of address if visiting your own property (e.g. second home).
show proof of insurance for your trip. Please check the guidance on travel insurance here.
show a return or onward ticket
you should also be able to prove that you have enough money for your stay. The minimum amount required depends on your accommodation.
Your host must inform the local immigration office (questura) in writing within 48 hours after you arrive at their property. They could be fined if they fail to comply with this Italian immigration law.
If you are entering from a Schengen Area country (e.g. France) you are required to declare your presence to the local immigration authority (questura) within 8 days of arriving (‘dichiarazione di presenza’). The questura will provide a form to complete. This requirement is not applicable if you are staying in a hotel or a B & B property.
Further information is provided on the Italian Ministry of Foreign Affairs website.
There are separate requirements for those who are resident in Italy. If you are resident in Italy, you should carry proof of residence, such as the new ‘carta di soggiorno elettronica’ or your current EU residency document, as well as your valid passport when you travel. For further information on these requirements, see our Living in Italy guide.
Passport validity
Check your passport is valid for travel before you book your trip, and renew your passport if you do not have enough time left on it.
Make sure your passport is:
valid for at least 3 months after the day you plan to leave Italy, or any other Schengen country
less than 10 years old
The 3 months you need when leaving a country must be within 10 years of the passport issue date.
If you renewed your current passport before the previous one expired, extra months may have been added to its expiry date. Any extra months on your passport over 10 years may not count towards the minimum 3 months needed.
UK Emergency Travel Documents
UK Emergency Travel Documents (ETDs) are accepted for entry, airside transit and exit from Italy.
