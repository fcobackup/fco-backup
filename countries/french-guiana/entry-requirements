Visas
French Guiana is an Overseas Department of France (département d’outre-mer) and is part of the European Union.
If you hold a British Citizen passport, you do not need a visa to enter French Guiana for stays of up to three months.
Other British passport holders, and those who plan to stay longer than three months, should check the current entry requirements on the website of the French Ministry of Foreign Affairs and, if necessary, confirm with the nearest French Diplomatic mission.
Passport validity
Travellers should ensure that their passport has at least 3 months of validity after the date you intend to leave French Guiana.
Check your passport is valid for travel before you book your trip. You will need to renew your passport before travelling if you do not have enough time left on your passport.
