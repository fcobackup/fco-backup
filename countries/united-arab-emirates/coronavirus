Travel within the United Arab Emirates
COVID-19 cases continue to be recorded in the UAE and public health measures are in place in response to the outbreak. These can vary between each Emirates and the ease of movement between regions may be affected. The local rules may change, including at short notice. You should check them carefully before you travel and whilst you are in the UAE, and ensure you comply.
The UAE authorities have stated that any violation of instructions and procedures put in place to limit the spread of COVID-19 will be treated as a crime punishable by law.
The rules for entering and remaining in Abu Dhabi may change. You should check the current requirement from the Abu Dhabi Media Office website and on the Emirates News Agency website.
Public spaces and services
Most shops, restaurants, tourist attractions and religious establishments across the UAE are open but there are restrictions and requirements in place to help contain the spread of COVID-19. With effect from 26 February the rules for mask wearing have changed and although mask wearing remains mandatory in public indoor spaces it is now optional when outdoors. Further information is available on the UAE National Emergency Crisis and Disasters Management Authority website.
Most schools across the UAE reopened at the start of the 2021/22 academic year with a number of COVID-19 measures in place. Some schools may close or move to remote learning if there are outbreaks of COVID-19. In Abu Dhabi, students aged 16 years and above are required to be vaccinated to enter school.
Abu Dhabi Emirate has made it mandatory for residents aged 16 years and above and international tourists to have a “green pass” on the “AlHosn” app in order to access public places. A green pass is acquired and maintained by full vaccination and regular negative PCR tests. Medical exemptions from vaccinations and PCR testing may apply. The AlHosn app is the UAE’s official app related to COVID-19.
From 17 March 2022, non-vaccinated visitors to events, tourist attractions and cultural sites in Abu Dhabi may now enter with a negative PCR test received within 48 hours. Further information is available on the Abu Dhabi Media Office website and on the Etihad Airways website.
