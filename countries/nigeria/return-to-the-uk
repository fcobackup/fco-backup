There are currently no commercial options available to return to the UK from Nigeria. All airports in Nigeria are closed to all international commercial flights until at least 23 April.
British Government special flights
The British Government has facilitated special flights from Abuja and Lagos for British travelers to Nigeria to return to the UK.
Flights depart from Abuja on 18 April and from Lagos on 18 and 20 April. Future flights will be arranged if there is sufficient demand.
The cost of the flight is £477.50 from Abuja and £490.50 from Lagos – prices may change on future flights; all passengers will have to pay for their tickets.
To be eligible to take these flights, you must be normally resident in the UK. Eligibility, including your address in UK, will be checked before tickets are issued.
Direct dependents of British travelers are eligible for a space on the flight, providing they are normally resident in the UK.
Vulnerable travelers will be prioritised for these flights.
If you wish to travel from Abuja, book tickets on the CTM website here. If you are unable to complete this online form and want to return to the UK from Abuja, please send a SMS text message with your full name to +44 7860 093 012 and someone from our team will get in touch to assist you. Some international charges may apply.
If you wish to travel from Lagos, book tickets on CTM website here. If you are unable to complete this online form and want to return to the UK from Lagos, please send a SMS text message with your full name to +44 7860 093 012 and someone from our team will get in touch to assist you. Some international charges may apply.
You will be told your travel date when you booking is confirmed; changes will not be possible.
Tickets will not be on sale at the airports. To make a booking, you will need:
(i) full passport and contact details for each traveller you are registering
(ii) your UK home address and postcode
(iii) your means of payment, such as credit or debit card details
What to do after booking your ticket
It is very important that you print and take your ticket with you, and if you are stopped at checkpoints, show that to security personnel and make it clear that you are going to the airport to take a repatriation flight to the UK.
After you book your ticket we will email you with all the details you will need including the time you will need to be at the airport.
Abuja and Lagos is in lockdown until 27 April so you should continue to comply, with the exception of travelling to the airport immediately before your flight. We are co-ordinating with the Federal and State government to help ensure that ttravelers outside of Abuja and Lagos can get to the airports despite the lockdown.
Future options
The Nigerian authorities have not confirmed when commercial flights will start again, so we strongly recommend travelling on one of the special charter flights if you need to return to the UK soon. It is likely that we will be arranging future flights so you are likely to have a further opportunity to return to the UK if you cannot get a ticket for one of the first three flights.
You will need to pay for your return travel to the UK. If departure options are available but you cannot afford the travel costs and have exhausted all other options for getting funds, you may be eligible to apply for an emergency loan from the government. This is a last resort option and you would need to repay the loan when you are back in the UK.
The Nigerian authorities have told us that people who exceed their authorised visa stays as a result of travel restrictions linked to COVID-19 will not be penalised as over-stayers when they depart.
What to do
If you cannot leave Nigeria at this time, you should:
Follow the advice of local authorities, including local measures to help minimise your risk of exposure to coronavirus;
Find accommodation that’s suitable for your needs;
Keep in regular contact with family and friends at home, so they know you are safe and well.
