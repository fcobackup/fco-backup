Most transactions in Bosnia and Herzegovina are in cash. The local currency is the Bosnian Mark. Cashing travellersâ€™ cheques is possible at some banks. ATMs are available in the larger cities. Credit and debit cards may be accepted outside Sarajevo, but you should make sure you have enough cash with you when travelling outside major cities.
