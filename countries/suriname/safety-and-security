Terrorism in Suriname 
Although there is no recent history of terrorism in Suriname, attacks cannot be ruled out.  
Political situation 
Demonstrations can become violent and lead to roadblocks and travel disruption. Be careful when travelling around the country and avoid large crowds. Monitor media and follow the advice of local authorities.  
Crime 
There have been incidents of burglary, armed robbery and violent crime in the capital, Paramaribo, and surrounding areas.  
Pickpocketing and robbery are increasingly common in the major business and shopping areas.  
Protecting yourself and your belongings 
Keep valuables such as your passport, travel documents, driving licence and credit cards secure and keep photocopies in a separate place. 
To reduce your personal risk, avoid: 
wearing expensive jewellery or displaying large amounts of money in public 
remote and secluded areas 
quiet streets and parks 
the Palm Garden (‘Palmentuin’) at night 
walking around Paramaribo at night, apart from the entertainment centre around the Torarica hotels 
Attacks against fishing boats 
There have been reports of attacks against fishing boats in and around the waters of Suriname.   
Robberies while travelling in Suriname  
Tourists have been robbed when travelling in central Suriname, away from the coastal areas. Use a well-established tour company if you intend to travel to these parts of the country. 
Laws and cultural differences  
Illegal drugs penalties 
There are severe penalties for all drug offences. Pack all luggage yourself and do not carry anything through customs for anyone else. 
Money 
Credit cards are not widely accepted outside major hotels. Check with your hotel whether it accepts credit cards. Some cash machines in Paramaribo will accept international credit and debit cards and dispense Surinamese dollars. 
Transport risks  
Road travel  
If you are planning to drive in Suriname, see information on driving abroad. 
You’ll need to have both the correct version of the international driving permit (IDP) and your UK driving licence with you in the car. You cannot buy an IDP outside the UK, so get one before you travel.  
Hire car companies often have stricter requirements for their customers, such as a year of driving experience, a higher minimum age and holding an IDP. 
Some drivers may have poor road sense, and there may be frequent hazards, inadequate lighting and poor road conditions in some areas. When driving at night, take care to avoid cyclists, pedestrians and animals. 
Only use licensed taxis or those on official hotel taxi ranks. Do not hail taxis from the roadside. 
Air travel 
The UK Air Safety List (ASL) lists all known airlines in Suriname that do not meet international safety standards and are banned from operating commercial air services to, from, and within the UK. Check the UK Air Safety List when considering which airlines to fly with. The list is maintained by the Department for Transport, based on advice from the UK Civil Aviation Authority. 
If you’re travelling with a tour operator, check whether they have concerns about airlines in Suriname.
