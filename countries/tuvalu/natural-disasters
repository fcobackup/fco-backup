The tropical cyclone season normally runs from November to April but cyclones can occur throughout the year. During this period there is a greater risk of strong winds and heavy rains flooding, landslides and road closures. In March 2015, Tropical Cyclone Pam caused significant damage to Tuvalu’s coastlines, reconstruction work will take some time.
You should monitor local and international weather updates from the World Meteorological Organisation (WMO), from the Tuvalu Meteorological Service, in local newspapers and on Tuvalu Media Department Radio on 621 AM.
