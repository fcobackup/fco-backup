Criminal justice
If you’re arrested and convicted of a crime in Myanmar you can expect a long prison sentence. Pre-trial detention can also last many months.
The legal process in Myanmar is unpredictable, lacks transparency and is open to interference from powerful political and business interests. The investigation and trial process falls far below the standard expected in the UK. British nationals in Myanmar should be aware that there are limits to the assistance the British Embassy can offer to those with concerns about the fairness of their trial as we are unable to interfere in the legal processes of a host country.
The conditions in Myanmar prisons are extremely poor and overcrowded. Medical facilities in prisons are also extremely poor. The UK has no prisoner transfer agreement with Myanmar, so if you’re found guilty you can expect to serve your full prison term in Myanmar, have your visa revoked and be deported when released.
Sexual abuse against children is a serious crime. The UK and Myanmar authorities are committed to combating travelling child sex offenders. Those who commit sex offences against children abroad can also be prosecuted in the UK.
Penalties for drug trafficking range from a minimum sentence of 15 years imprisonment and can include the death penalty.
Myanmar’s defamation laws give broad scope for individuals to bring potentially arbitrary charges which could result in criminal penalties, including a prison sentence. Foreigners have been subject to criminal investigations for acts such as posting a critical review of a hotel online.
Religious customs
Respect religious customs when visiting Buddhist religious sites. Shorts and sleeveless tops will cause offence. You should remove shoes and socks before entering a pagoda or monastery. The Myanmar government and Myanmar Tourist Federation have published tips for visitors on local customs.
Under Myanmar law, insulting religion is a prosecutable offence. Insulting religion is a broad term, and can include any disrespectful depiction or image (including tattoos) of Buddha or other religious representation, or wearing any tattoo of Buddha anywhere below the waist.
There are currently measures in place for visiting religious sights to prevent the spread of coronavirus. You should check the local rules and regulations before entering.
Photography and drones
Don’t take photographs or videos of the police, any demonstrations, military installations or military personnel.
Importing unmanned aerial systems (drones) without prior government permission and flying them in sensitive areas such as government buildings, famous tourist sites, and religious buildings can result in criminal penalties, including jail time and the permanent confiscation of the drone. As it is rarely clear what constitutes a sensitive area, all recreational use of drones is inadvisable. If you wish to bring a drone to Myanmar, you’re strongly advised to seek official permission from the Myanmar government.
Endangered species
Myanmar is a party to the Convention on International Trade in Endangered Species (CITES). Over 800 species of animals and plants are banned from international trade and a further 30,000 are strictly controlled by CITES and EU legislation. You should consider the restrictions on the export of endangered species under CITES when deciding whether to buy exotic souvenirs, including those made from turtles.
LGBT travellers
Homosexuality is technically illegal in Myanmar, although these laws are rarely enforced in practice. These laws can carry punishments of up to life imprisonment and apply equally to men and women. There have been reports of police using threats of prosecution to extort bribes and allegations of arbitrary arrest and detention, although these have primarily been reported by Myanmar nationals.
LGBT people are rarely open about their sexuality or gender identity publicly, and LGBT communities are more likely tolerated than accepted within Myanmar society. There have nonetheless been increasingly large pride festivals that have taken place in recent years. Public displays of affection, whether heterosexual or LGBT are frowned upon in Myanmar’s conservative culture.
International organisations have reported high rates of HIV prevalence within the LGBT community in Myanmar. See our information and advice page for the LGBT community before you travel.
