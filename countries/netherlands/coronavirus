Local measures
On 15 March, the Dutch government announced further restrictive measures in response to the outbreak. Anyone experiencing any symptoms linked to coronavirus (COVID-19) (specifically a cough, cold, sore throat or fever) must remain at home until the symptoms have cleared. People are advised to stay a recommended distance of 1.5m from each other in public.
All bars, caf√©s and restaurants have been directed to close with immediate effect, although supermarkets remain open. Public events with 100 or more attendees will be cancelled. This includes, but is not limited to, theatres, sports events and church services. Medically vulnerable people and older people should avoid public transport.
These measures will apply until 6 April. The Dutch government has advised that further measures are likely to follow.
