Political situation
The political situation in Georgia is generally calm, but demonstrations and opposition rallies can occur, in particular around Rustaveli Avenue in Tbilisi, as well as in other large towns. Demonstrations are usually policed but tensions can escalate without warning. You should check local media, stay away from any large gatherings and demonstrations and follow the advice of local authorities.
Crime
Crime levels are low. However, take sensible precautious to avoid pick-pocketing particularly in crowded city centres and at public gatherings. Do not leave valuables unattended.
Take appropriate steps to enhance your personal security, remain aware of your surroundings and keep your mobile phone charged and with you at all times.
Although Georgian legislation protects all people’s human rights and equality, ethnic minorities and LGBT+ individuals may face discrimination. There have been reports of harassment and assaults based on race and sexuality. A violent protest against an event in Tbilisi celebrating Pride in July 2023 caused its cancellation.
If you’re the victim of an attempted assault or feel threatened, contact the local police emergency number by dialling 112.
Local travel
The Administrative Boundary Lines with the breakaway regions of Abkhazia and South Ossetia are generally unmarked and away from roads. Take care not to cross the lines inadvertently as you risk arrest by the region’s de facto authorities. The British government does not recognise the unilateral declarations of independence made by the de facto authorities in either region, and consular support is not available there. You may wish to hire a professional guide if you plan to hike close to the Administrative Boundary Lines.
It is illegal under Georgian law to enter Georgia from Russia via South Ossetia or Abkhazia. If you enter Georgia in this way you may face criminal prosecution, which carries the penalty of potentially heavy fines and/or a prison sentence of up to 4 years. If your passport has entry/exit stamps from the de facto authorities, the Georgian authorities may consider this as illegal entry via an unrecognised border crossing.
If you’re considering travelling to Russia via the land borders with the Russian Federation, consult FCDO travel advice for Russia. The FCDO currently advises against all travel to Russia.
There is some risk from unexploded ordnance in areas along the Administrative Boundary Lines with South Ossetia and Abkhazia, and near the border with Azerbaijan (Red Bridge area in particular). Areas where unexploded ordnance might be present are not always marked.
Take extra precautions after dark in unfamiliar areas as you would at home.
Street lighting away from main roads can be poor and pavements uneven. There may be occasional short power cuts, consider carrying a torch.
Taxis
Taxi provision and safety has improved significantly. Do not flag taxies in the street. Be cautious accepting lifts from strangers. It is best to pre-book a taxi via an app. Check that any taxi you use has working seatbelts.
Borders
Land and sea borders are open with the exception of the land border with Azerbaijan.
If you visit the Udabno caves at the Davit Gareja monastery site, take care not to cross the Georgia-Azerbaijan border, which is unmarked in this area and disputed.
Mountaineering and extreme sports
Take appropriate precautions when skiing and ensure your travel insurance includes cover for skiing/winter sports in Georgia.
If you get into trouble while hiking, skiing, or participating in adventure and/or extreme sports, the level of emergency response may be limited.
It can be difficult to get accurate information on mountain conditions, including avalanche risks when off-piste skiing. If you are considering trekking, mountaineering, climbing, off-piste skiing or other extreme sports you might consider contacting companies who can provide specialist guides.
As Georgia’s winter and adventure sports industry develops, the Georgian authorities are working hard to ensure proper safety standards are maintained. However, be aware that, in some instances, safety standards may not be adequately observed. For example, several people were injured when a ski lift at Gudauri malfunctioned in March 2018 and a tourist helicopter crashed near Stepantsminda (Kazbegi) in spring 2019.
Road travel
You can drive in Georgia with a valid UK driving licence for up to one year from your last entry into the country. Beyond this, you will either need an International Driving Permit (IDP), or to apply for a Georgian licence. This is a straightforward process through an application to the Service Agency of the Ministry of Internal Affairs. Holders of a valid UK driving licence do not need to sit a driving exam as part of the application.
If you’re planning to hire a car in Georgia, make sure to check the requirements of the car hire company before you travel. They may require you to have an IDP.
In the UK, International Driving Permits (IDP) are an over the counter service from Post Offices. You will not be able to buy an IDP outside the UK, so get one before you travel. Both 1949 and 1968 versions of the permit are acceptable in Georgia.
Driving is on the right. The speed limit is 60 km/h in towns and cities. In other areas it’s 80 km/h unless indicated.
There’s a zero tolerance policy towards drink driving.
Take care when driving especially at night. Many roads outside central Tbilisi, and other city centres, are badly lit and of poor quality. Stray livestock pose a hazard in many areas. Road markings and the right of way can be confusing. Many cars are poorly maintained and the standard of driving is erratic.
It’s compulsory to wear seat belts in the front seats in Georgia. Children under 12 years of age must sit in the back of the car. Children under 7 years of age must sit in child safety seats.
Heavy rain, flooding and snow at higher altitudes can affect roads and bridges making travel difficult or impossible (particularly in remote areas). Landslides are also common. If you’re travelling outside of Tbilisi, particularly in remote areas, make sure your vehicle is suitably equipped and check locally on current conditions.
See the RAC guide on driving in Georgia.
Rail travel
Exercise normal caution with your personal safety and belongings when travelling by train. Locks for compartments are usually available on sleeper trains. The cross-border train service between Armenia and Georgia is operating but the service between Azerbaijan and Georgia– is not currently running.
