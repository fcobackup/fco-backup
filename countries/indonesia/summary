Mansur - Jalan Jendral Sudirman - Jalan Raya Mataram-Sikur - Jalan Raya Masbagik - Jalan Raya Anjani - Jalan Kooperasi - Jalan Raya Labuhan Lombok).

A 7.4 magnitude earthquake and tsunami hit Central Sulawesi on Friday 28 September 2018. Casualty figures are still being assessed, with rescue and humanitarian relief operations on-going. Communications, buildings and transport infrastructure have been severely damaged. The British Embassy in Jakarta is monitoring the situation closely and liaising with the Indonesian authorities to establish facts. You should be aware of the continued risk of aftershocks. If you are in the area you should exercise caution, stay away from collapsed buildings, monitor the local news and follow the advice of the local authorities.
There were a series of 5 major earthquakes and a significant number of aftershocks to the north-east of the island of Lombok in late July and August 2018, with tremors still being felt in September. The earthquakes resulted in over 500 deaths and significant damage to buildings and infrastructure, most severely in northern and western areas of Lombok, north of the capital Mataram, and in the Gili Islands. If you’re in these areas, you should exercise caution, stay away from collapsed buildings, liaise with your travel company/accommodation provider, and follow the advice of the local authorities. If you have essential upcoming travel in these areas or plan to travel for non-essential reasons against FCO advice, you should plan your journey very carefully, have robust contingency plans in place and check with your travel insurance provider. In other areas of Lombok, check any existing travel plans with your transport and accommodation providers before travelling, ensure you have travel insurance in place and keep up to date with developments, including through this travel advice.
Many aftershocks have occurred, including some of a significant scale and may continue for some time. Risks may be especially elevated in the Gili Islands and areas of northern Lombok closest to the epicentre. In these areas buildings that may appear unaffected could still have been damaged and weakened by the earthquakes and may be vulnerable to aftershocks. Landslides could occur, including in the Mount Rinjani National Park. Consider the safety of your accommodation, your potential exit routes and any other hazards in the vicinity. If you have concerns about the integrity of buildings or accommodation, move to a safe place. More information and advice on safety considerations in an active earthquake zone is available from the International Rescue Corps.

The Foreign and Commonwealth Office (FCO) advise against all travel within 4 kilometres of the Mount Agung crater in east Bali and within 7 kilometres of the Mount Sinabung crater in Kalo Regency, North Sumatra due to ongoing volcanic activity. These are exclusion zones put in place by the local authorities. If you’re in either exclusion zone, you should leave immediately.
There are many active volcanoes in Indonesia, any of which can erupt with little or no warning. This often results in the evacuation of villages within a 3 to 7 kilometre radius and disruption to air travel in the wider region. In the past, repeated eruptions have caused destruction and fatalities. Check media reports before travelling to areas that are prone to volcanic activity. The local alert level may change at short notice. Take extra care and follow the advice of local authorities, including respecting any exclusion zones. See Natural disasters
