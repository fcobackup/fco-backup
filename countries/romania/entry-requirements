Coronavirus guidance is being updated.
Read what you can and cannot do

The information on this page covers the most common types of travel and reflects the UK government’s understanding of the rules currently in place. Unless otherwise stated, this information is for travellers using a full ‘British Citizen’ passport.
The authorities in the country or territory you’re travelling to are responsible for setting and enforcing the rules for entry. If you’re unclear about any aspect of the entry requirements, or you need further reassurance, you’ll need to contact the embassy, high commission or consulate of the country or territory you’re travelling to.
You should also consider checking with your transport provider or travel company to make sure your passport and other travel documents meet their requirements.
Restrictions in response to coronavirus
Direct flights between Romania and the UK have been suspended as of 2300 on Sunday 5 April. From midnight on 3 April all travellers arriving from the UK will be subject to compulsory institutional quarantine for 14 days.
From 22 March all non-Romanians are being refused entry to Romania, except nationals from the UK, EU or EEA countries and Switzerland. There are also exceptions for the following categories of people:
family members of Romanian citizens
family members of citizens of the UK, EU or EEA countries, or Switzerland, with residence in Romania
people with a long stay visa, residence permit or equivalent document issued by the Romanian government or an equivalent document issued by the authorities of another state in accordance with EU law
people who have moved for professional reasons, with a visa, residence permit or equivalent document
diplomatic or consular staff, staff of international organisations, military personnel or those assuring humanitarian aid
passengers in transit, including those who are being repatriated under the grant of consular protection
passengers travelling with urgent need (medical or family)
people who need international protection or for other humanitarian reasons
You should not attempt to travel to Romania if you do not have UK, EU, EEA, or Swiss citizenship, or fall in one of the above exceptions, as you are likely to be refused boarding or entry. Flights and overland transport from the UK and a range of other European countries have been suspended.
Quarantine and self-isolation requirements
All travellers arriving in Romania from the UK will be placed in institutional quarantine for 14 days. Travellers arriving from other destinations will need to either self-isolate or to enter quarantine for 14 days, depending on where they are arriving from. If you are placed in institutional quarantine please contact the British Embassy Bucharest to let us know, so that we can provide consular assistance if required.
Infringements on these procedures are being pursued with fines of up to €4000 and possible criminal charges.
Passport validity
Your passport should be valid for the proposed duration of your stay; you do not need any additional period of validity on your passport beyond this.
The rules on travel will stay the same until 31 December 2020.
Visas
If you hold a British Citizen passport, you don’t need a visa to enter Romania. If you’re planning a stay of longer than 3 months, see our Living in Romania guide and contact the Romanian Embassy if you have further questions. 
The rules on travel will stay the same until 31 December 2020.
Parental consent when travelling with minors
Some British nationals travelling with minors who hold Romanian citizenship (irrespective of whether they hold citizenship of other countries) are prevented from leaving the country without notarised parental consent from the minor’s non-travelling parent/s. While enforcement of this may vary at borders, British nationals travelling with minors who hold Romanian citizenship should obtain notarised parental consent before departure from Romania.
A list of the public notaries can be found on the website of the National Union of Public Notaries from Romania.
