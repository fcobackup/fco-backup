There is an ongoing outbreak of coronavirus. The virus originated in Wuhan City, Hubei Province but cases have been confirmed in other parts of China and in some countries in the region. You should comply with any additional screening measures put in place by the Kiribati authorities. Further advice is available from Public Health England, and the TravelHealthPro website.
Most visits to Kiribati are trouble-free. However, petty theft can occur and you should take care with personal possessions. Women travelling on their own should take care, particularly at night.
The wet season normally runs from November to April. Severe weather may result in flooding, coastal inundation and disruption to essential services and infrastructure. See Natural disasters
There’s no British Consulate in Kiribati. Consular support is limited, however the British High Commission Suva in Fiji can provide some consular support to British nationals.
Although there’s no recent history of terrorism in Kiribati, attacks can’t be ruled out. See Terrorism
