Entry rules in response to coronavirus (COVID-19)
Entry to Lithuania
Lithuania lifted the ban on flights from the UK on 1 January 2021. Travel may still be disrupted so you should check with your travel operator. Check our advice on things to consider, and be prepared to stay overseas longer than planned. British nationals travelling to Lithuania from the UK or any country deemed a high risk for COVID-19, will need to self-isolate for 10 days.
You may leave isolation earlier if you have a negative COVID-19 PCR test, taken no earlier than 48 hours before your arrival, or taken in Lithuania after your arrival. . The list of countries from which arrivals are required to self-isolate is published on KoronaStop.lt. The Lithuanian Government reviews this list regularly.
On 16 December, Lithuania entered nationwide lockdown. Movement within Lithuania will be restricted, including for those arriving in Lithuania who are not require self-isolate. You can find more information on the Coronavirus page.
You can register for a PCR test by calling the COVID-19 hotline on +370 37367 963. The hotline is open daily between 8am and 11pm. The option to shorten isolation does not apply to those who are known to have had contact with a confirmed COVID-19 case in the last 14 days.
You must not use public transportation to travel to the testing centre. If you do not have access to a private vehicle, you will need to travel to the testing centre by taxi. You are advised to check at the time of booking whether the taxi company is able to take you to a testing centre, as some taxis may not have the precautions in place to provide this service.
You will not be required to self-isolate, if you can provide on arrival medical evidence of recovery from COVID-19 in the last three months. The Lithuanian government advises that, even those leaving isolation early, keep face-to-face communication with others to a minimum.
British nationals travelling to Lithuania by air, sea, bus or train from any overseas destination will need to complete an online registration form prior to arrival.
We are aware that some international travel operators have suspended services to and from Lithuania. Please check with your travel company for the latest information. People arriving in Lithuania by private vehicles or on foot must complete the online registration form within 12 hours of arriving in Lithuania.
The movement of goods is not restricted.
Quarantine requirements
While in isolation, you must:
not leave your place of isolation without the permission of a healthcare professional;
not go to shops;
not attend face to face public services;

The Lithuanian Government advises against isolating in properties shared by others who have not travelled from a high risk country. If this is not possible, you should stay in separate, well-ventilated rooms, restrict your movement within the home and minimise use of common spaces.
Those self-isolating on arrival from a country deemed high risk, but who are not known to have had contact with a confirmed COVID-19 case and do not have COVID-19 symptoms, may go for walks within a 1km radius of their place of isolation. You must wear a covering over your face and mouth, avoid contact with other people and not enter shops. If you are contacted by Lithuanian health officials while on a walk, you must return immediately to your place of isolation.
British nationals needing to temporarily break isolation, may submit a request to Lithuanian National Public Health Centre (NVSC) at least 7 days in advance. Individuals registering for a COVID-19 PCR test through the COVID-19 hotline do not require separate permission to attend the test from the NVSC.
British nationals may leave Lithuania before the end of their isolation period in order to return to the UK/their country of residence.
