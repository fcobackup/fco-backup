The information on this page covers the most common types of travel and reflects the UK government’s understanding of the rules currently in place. Unless otherwise stated, this information is for travellers using a full ‘British Citizen’ passport.
The authorities in the country or territory you’re travelling to are responsible for setting and enforcing the rules for entry. If you’re unclear about any aspect of the entry requirements, or you need further reassurance, you’ll need to contact the embassy, high commission or consulate of the country or territory you’re travelling to.
You should also consider checking with your transport provider or travel company to make sure your passport and other travel documents meet their requirements.
Entry rules in response to coronavirus (COVID-19)
Entry to New Zealand
The New Zealand border is currently closed to almost all arrivals.
All travellers from the UK and USA will be also be required to have confirmation of a negative COVID-19 PCR test result in the 72 hours prior to departure.
New Zealand citizens and residents returning to New Zealand may travel to New Zealand and do not need any formal exemption.
There are a small number of additional, limited exceptions to the ban on travelling to and entering New Zealand. The following people should seek approval from Immigration New Zealand (INZ) using the limited exceptions process:
partners, dependent children (aged 24 years and under) and legal guardians of New Zealand citizens and residents
Australian citizens and permanent residents who normally live in New Zealand
essential health workers
other essential workers who are specifically agreed to by the New Zealand government
Samoan and Tongan citizens making essential travel
New Zealand-based partners and dependent children (aged 19 years and under) of a work or student visa holder who is in New Zealand
critical humanitarian travel
maritime crew
On 12 June, the government introduced short term and long-term criteria for “Other Essential Workers” requests. Further information on the criteria, as well as full details of the current border closures and exceptions can be found on the INZ website. The website also includes information on how to submit a request for travel to New Zealand. A request for approval to travel to New Zealand can take up to two days to process.
From 11:59 pm 31 December, anyone travelling to New Zealand from the UK or USA will be required to have a COVID-19 test on ‘day zero’, i.e. within 24 hours of arrival in a managed isolation and quarantine facility. Arrivals from the UK or USA must remain in their managed isolation or quarantine facility room until the results of the test is known. You will then undergo further testing on Day 3 and Day 12 as required for all arrivals, in line with New Zealand’s policy on isolation and quarantine.
From 15 January, all travellers from the UK and USA will be also be required to have confirmation of a negative Covid-19 PCR test result in the 72 hours prior to departure. This will come into force on flights arriving in New Zealand after 11.59pm (local time) on 15 January.
For more information please visit the New Zealand government COVID-19 website.
Quarantine requirements
Anyone entering New Zealand needs to undergo quarantine or managed isolation in an approved facility for a minimum of 14 days. Arrivals must then test negative for COVID-19 before entering the community.
From 5 October, travellers to New Zealand will need to register on the Managed Isolation Allocation System as the first step to securing their place in a managed isolation facility. Before you book your flights, you need to register for a voucher for managed isolation. Your voucher allocates you a place in a managed isolation facility. For more information see Secure your place in managed isolation
Provision of a voucher for managed isolation does not guarantee entry into New Zealand. You must first ensure you qualify to enter the country under New Zealand’s border restrictions. You can apply for your MIQ voucher up to 3 months in advance. Space in managed isolation is extremely limited over the Christmas and New Year period and the New Zealand government is asking prospective travellers to regularly check the Managed Isolation Allocation System website for preferred dates. There are a few exceptional circumstances in which people can apply for an exemption from managed isolation. Visit the New Zealand Ministry of Health website for more information.

On 11 August, the New Zealand government introduced legislation relating to charges for managed isolation for New Zealanders and permanent residents.
You will be liable for a managed isolation charge if you’re currently overseas and return to NZ for a period of less than 90 days; or you leave NZ after the regulations came into effect (12:01am on 11 August 2020) and return at a later date.
Transit via New Zealand
From 20 June, transit visa waiver and visa waiver nationalities, people transiting to or from Australia and people departing a Pacific country or territory to return home, do not need a transit visa as long as they have a confirmed flight out of New Zealand within 24 hours to a port which will accept them.
In most cases, transit passengers must hold an Electronic Travel Authority (ETA) or transit ETA before travel. These are applied for online. See Information about NZeTA for further detail.
If the passport holder is not from a visa-waiver or transit visa-waiver country or territory, or covered by one of the situations listed above, then they will need to apply for a transit visa. Due to COVID-19, Immigration New Zealand is not currently accepting paper applications for transit visas so have put a temporary process in place for submitting applications by email.
The process for applying for a transit visa via email is available on the Immigration New Zealand website - transits.

The New Zealand immigration authorities recommend that applicants allow up to 72 hours for processing.
On arrival in New Zealand, you will also need to satisfy the Immigration Officer that you meet the criteria for visa-free entry, which includes having an onward ticket and sufficient funds to support you during your stay.

UK Emergency Travel Documents (ETDs) are valid for entry into New Zealand when accompanied by a permanent residence, work or study visa. ETDs are accepted for holidaymakers as long as New Zealand is not the final destination. ETDs are also accepted for airside transit and exit from New Zealand.
Quarantine and bio security
New Zealand has very strict bio-security regulations. It is illegal to import most foodstuffs (meat and meat products, honey, fruit, dairy produce) and strict penalties are handed out to those breaking these rules. Take care when importing wood products, golf clubs, footwear, tents, fishing equipment and items made from animal skin. The immigration arrivals card has full details. If in doubt, declare items to a Ministry of Agriculture official or dump them in one of the bins available at the airport. Failure to comply with these regulations can result in a heavy fine of up to $100,000 or imprisonment.
Medication
There are some restrictions on bringing medication into New Zealand. Visit the New Zealand Customs website for more information. If you arrive in New Zealand with any prescription medicines, you must declare it on your passenger arrival card.
From 5 November all codeine-containing products will be classified as prescription only medication (a controlled drug). Codeine is found in many pain relieving medications. You can import controlled drugs for personal use, subject to declaring them on arrival into New Zealand to the Customs Service and demonstrating they have been lawfully supplied for the treatment of yourself or someone under your care. More details on these requirements can be found on the New Zealand Customs website
