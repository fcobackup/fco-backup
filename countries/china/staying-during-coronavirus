This page gives you guidance on how to stay safely in China as a visitor, if you are unable to return to the UK.
Everyone should comply with the measures put in place in China to limit the spread of coronavirus (COVID-19).
Moving around in China
Mandatory requirements to check temperatures and use health apps or scan QR codes to prove travel history are in place at transport hubs, hotels, commercial buildings including restaurants, residential compounds and other locations – such locations are also increasingly requiring use of ‘health kit code’ apps to demonstrate health condition and travel history.
Restrictions on movement and quarantine arrangements remain for travel between different parts of the country. Some cities and provinces require travellers to undergo 14 days of isolation in their place of residence or in centralised observation. Quarantine is enforced at the neighbourhood level, procedures vary, it is recommended to check in advance.
The possibility that local authorities impose mandatory quarantine in response to fresh outbreaks is high. There have been reports of individuals who have frequented bars or restaurants where there have been confirmed cases of COVID-19 being mandated to undergo 14 days of centralised quarantine. You should keep up to date with the latest developments and this travel advice.
There have been reports of discrimination against foreign nationals in China as a result of a perceived risk that they might re-import COVID-19. In Guangzhou, in particular, there are reports of discrimination on the basis of ethnicity, especially of those who are black and minority ethnic, including additional enforced quarantine and testing, as well as hotels and businesses not serving clients.
Health
Medical facilities may come under strain in response to localised outbreaks. Designated hospitals have been established in each province to take patients diagnosed with COVID-19. Emergency medical facilities, except in Hubei, are largely functioning as normal but mandatory health checks and quarantine restrictions may delay or limit access to such care.
