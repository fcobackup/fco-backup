Although homosexuality is not explicitly mentioned in the Guinean Penal Code, Article 274 from 2016 of the Code states that ‘indecent acts and acts against nature committed with an individual of the same sex will be punished by imprisonment from six months to three years and a fine of 500,000 to 1,000,000 Guinean francs. If the act is with a minor of less than 18 years, the maximum sentence will be imposed. If the act is committed with violence or attempted violence the sentence will be 5-10 years’. We have no reports of any attacks on persons linked to their sexuality. However, homosexuality is not widely accepted or understood.
