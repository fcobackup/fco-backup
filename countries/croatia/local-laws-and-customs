Stay at home
Only go outside for food, health reasons or work (but only if you cannot work from home)

Wash your hands as soon as you get home
Do not meet others, even friends or family.
You can spread the virus even if you donâ€™t have symptoms.

We recommend that you carry your passport (or, if a resident your Croatian ID card) at all times. They are the only officially recognised form of identification in Croatia.
Keep a photocopy of the biographical details page in a safe place, including details of your next of kin. If your passport is lost or stolen you should report it to the police and get a police report. You need to do this before applying for an Emergency Travel Document; advice on how to apply can be found here
You should respect local laws and customs at all times. In some Croatian town centres, on the spot fines may be issued for inappropriate behaviour such as walking through towns shirtless or in swimwear; or sleeping in public areas. Most towns have signage to advise about actions that are prohibited by local law. You should take notice of your surroundings, including signage, and take local advice if unsure.
Drug related offences are punishable with fines and jail sentences.
