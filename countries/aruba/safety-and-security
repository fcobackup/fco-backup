Crime
Most visits to Aruba are trouble-free. However, petty theft and street crime occur. There is violent crime in association with drugs, but this rarely affects tourists. The main tourist areas are generally safe, but you should take sensible precautions:
avoid remote areas at night.
don’t take valuables to the beach or leave any valuables in your vehicle.  
make sure purses and handbags are closed and not easy to snatch.  
Local travel
When taking a taxi, always check that it is a registered one and negotiate the price before taking the ride. Most taxis do not have meters.
Road travel
Driving is on the right. Main road conditions are relatively good, but roads can become slippery when wet.
Air travel
Safety concerns have been raised about INSEL Air. The US authorities have prohibited their staff from using the airline while safety checks are being carried out. UK government officials have been told to do the same as a precaution.
Political situation
Aruba is an autonomous country within the Kingdom of the Netherlands. It shares the same status as Curaçao and St. Maarten.
