There is a high threat of terrorist attack globally affecting UK interests and British nationals, including from groups and individuals who view the UK and British nationals as targets. Stay aware of your surroundings at all times.  
UK Counter Terrorism Policing has information and advice on staying safe abroad and what to do in the event of a terrorist attack. Find out how to reduce your risk from terrorism while abroad.
Terrorism in the Republic of Congo
Although there’s no recent history of terrorism in the Republic of Congo, attacks cannot be ruled out.
Political situation
Demonstrations happen occasionally. In the past, demonstrations have become violent. Even when they are peaceful there is a risk of violence. Avoid any areas with demonstrations.
Crime
Reports of crime, particularly opportunistic crime such as pickpocketing, have increased in Brazzaville and Pointe Noire, and criminals target foreigners. You’re at greater risk of crime at night, and also in rural areas.
Protecting yourself and your belongings
Take care of your belongings, particularly in Brazzaville and Pointe Noire. To reduce your personal risk:
avoid walking in the streets after dark
do not carry large amounts of cash or valuables
avoid isolated areas, including beaches
Vehicle crime
Armed gangs may target your car. Take security advice if you intend to travel any distance. Reduce the risk of carjacking and break-ins by:
locking doors and keeping windows closed
not driving away from main routes
always parking in a secure location
Laws and cultural differences
Personal ID
Police may ask you for ID. Always carry a colour copy of your passport, including your visa entry stamp. If you live in Congo, also always carry a colour copy of your residency card.
Transport risks
Road travel
If you are planning to drive in the Republic of Congo, see information on driving abroad.
You can use a UK photocard driving licence to drive in the Republic of Congo. If you still have a paper driving licence, you may need to update it to a photocard licence or get the correct version of the international driving permit (IDP) as well.
Hire car companies often have stricter requirements for their customers, such as a year of driving experience, a higher minimum age and holding an IDP.
Road conditions are generally poor and deteriorate during the wet season from November to May. If you travel overland off the main roads, you’ll need a 4-wheel-drive vehicle.
Checkpoints
There are frequent vehicle checkpoints in the Republic of Congo, which can be poorly marked. If you’re asked for documents at a checkpoint, stay in your vehicle and show them through a closed window.
Air travel
The UK Air Safety List (ASL) lists all known airlines in the Republic of Congo that do not meet international safety standards and are banned from operating commercial air services to, from, and within the UK. Check the UK Air Safety List when considering which airlines to fly with. The list is maintained by the Department for Transport, based on advice from the UK Civil Aviation Authority.
Rail travel
There are currently no rail services between Brazzaville and Pointe Noire. When rail services were running, there were several instances of criminal gangs targeting trains on this route.
Boat travel
The river border crossing between Brazzaville and Kinshasa can close without warning. The ferry stops running in late afternoon, and there is no service on Sundays. Check before travelling.
