Local measures
The Government of Bangladesh have extended the closure of all government and non-essential businesses across Bangladesh until 16 May. Banking services are limited and all shops are closed apart from pharmacies, food markets and other basic necessities. Emergency services including hospitals remain open. Local authorities may lockdown buildings, streets and areas in order to control the spread of coronavirus.
From 10 April the Government has asked people to stay at home from 6 pm until 6 am. Outside these hours the Government has instructed that people should only leave their homes for emergencies. Anyone not complying with this request risks legal action.
Entry and borders
Bangladesh authorities have said passengers arriving from coronavirus-affected countries, including the UK, should complete Health Declaration Forms and Passenger Locator Forms provided by cabin crew. You may be subjected to additional health screening measures at the airport.
On arrival in Bangladesh, all foreign nationals are required to produce a medical certificate issued within 72 hours of travel indicating the passenger is symptom free. Passengers arriving from coronavirus affected countries, including the UK, are also required to quarantine for 14 days. Health officials at the point of entry to Bangladesh will assess whether passengers are able to self-quarantine or need to be taken to a government facility.
On 26 March, the Bangladesh authorities announced particular measures for passengers arriving with a No Visa Required certificate (an arrangement for foreign nationals of Bangladeshi heritage). Such passengers arriving in Bangladesh without a medical certificate indicating the passenger is symptom–free from coronavirus, or such passengers who display symptoms, will be placed into quarantine in a government facility for 14 days. Such passengers who arrive with a medical certificate indicating they are symptom-free are required to self-isolate at home for 14 days.
Transport
Public transport has been suspended until 16 May due to Government restrictions, and all non-essential travel is discouraged.
On 5 May the Civil Aviation Authority of Bangladesh (CAAB) announced an extension of the temporary suspension of scheduled commercial passenger flights from 7 May to 16 May. Scheduled commercial passenger flights departing from the following countries will not be authorised to land at any international airport in Bangladesh: Bahrain, Bhutan, Hong Kong, India, Kuwait, Malaysia, the Maldives, Nepal, Oman, Qatar, Saudi Arabia, Singapore, Sri Lanka, Thailand, Turkey, UAE, and the UK. China Southern and US Bangla airlines are still operating flights to China but these are for Chinese nationals only.
CAAB has also extended the temporary suspension of all commercial domestic flights until 16 May. These restrictions could be extended further at short notice. This includes flights to and from the UK. See Return to the UK
Bangladesh authorities have also suspended train services to and from India until further notice.
Visas
Bangladesh authorities have suspended issuing visas on arrival. Foreign nationals currently in Bangladesh with valid visas have the option of extending their visas by three months.
Running out of medication
If you are running out of medication and need to obtain more, you should visit the nearest pharmacy or ask for assistance from family/friends or your accommodation provider.
You should carry any medical papers or prescriptions and be prepared to answer questions if stopped by law enforcement authorities.
If the same medication you’re on is not available, consult a local doctor for a Bangladeshi alternative or go to the nearest hospital.
In case of any emergency, you can dial the Bangladesh National Emergency Hotline - 999 from your mobile/telephone for any assistance whilst in Bangladesh.
