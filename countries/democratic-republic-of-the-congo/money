Some credit cards are accepted in Kinshasa. The local currency is the Congolese Franc but US Dollars are widely used. US Dollars should be in good condition and issued after 2001 or they will not be accepted or changed at banks. There are a number of ATMs that dispense US dollars in Kinshasa; take normal security precautions when withdrawing money. Western Union and other money transfer agencies are present in most main towns. Make sure you have arrangements in place before leaving the UK to have funds sent to you in case of emergency.
