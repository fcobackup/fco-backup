The information on this page covers the most common types of travel and reflects the UK government’s understanding of the rules currently in place. Unless otherwise stated, this information is for travellers using a full ‘British Citizen’ passport.
The authorities in the country or territory you’re travelling to are responsible for setting and enforcing the rules for entry. If you’re unclear about any aspect of the entry requirements, or you need further reassurance, you’ll need to contact the embassy, high commission or consulate of the country or territory you’re travelling to.
You should also consider checking with your transport provider or travel company to make sure your passport and other travel documents meet their requirements.

Entry rules in response to coronavirus (COVID-19)
Entry to Spain
From 24 May, entry restrictions and testing requirements for arrivals from the UK to Spain no longer apply. However, travellers from the UK should be prepared to present evidence of a negative test if they have travelled to a country on Spain’s list of ‘risk countries’ in the 14 days prior to travel. In some parts of Spain, a negative test is required when checking into tourist accommodation or when travelling to the islands from mainland Spain. See Testing requirements for arrivals from the UK for further information.
All passengers entering Spain will still be required to complete a pre-travel declaration form. Quarantine and testing on return to the UK continues to apply. See Returning to the UK.
Entry restrictions and testing requirements continue to apply for travel to Spain from ‘risk countries’. If you are travelling from a listed country, you should refer to the Spanish Embassy or Consulate in the country you are in for further advice.
Some travel restrictions and testing requirements are in place for international transit through Spanish airports by passengers on flights departing from the UK. See Transiting Spain.
Since 23 November 2020, pre-travel COVID-19 testing requirements have been in place for those travelling by air and sea from ‘risk’ countries (as determined by the European Centre for Disease Prevention & Control). From 24 May, arrivals from the UK are no longer subject to this requirement (unless they are subject to the exceptions listed in ‘Testing requirements for arrivals from the UK’) but will have to complete a pre-travel declaration form.
If you are resident in Spain, you should carry your residence document (the green paper EU residence certificate or the new TIE), as well as your valid passport when you travel. If you are not in possession of a residence document, see Requirements for UK Nationals resident in Spain for further information.
Travellers should follow the advice of the local authorities on how best to protect themselves and others, including any measures that they bring in to control the virus. See the Coronavirus section for further information.
Mandatory pre-travel declaration form for all passengers
Before travel to Spain, all passengers travelling by air or sea must complete and sign an online Health Control Form no more than 48 hours prior to travel declaring any known history of exposure to COVID-19 and giving contact details.
Anyone who has not completed this form electronically via the Spain Travel Health website or app, may submit it in paper format prior to boarding.
Testing requirements for arrivals from the UK
From 24 May, arrivals from the UK are no longer subject to testing requirements unless they have travelled to a country on Spain’s list of ‘risk’ countries in the 14 days prior to travel to Spain.
In some parts of Spain, a negative COVID-19 may be required when checking in to tourist accommodation. This currently applies in the Canary Islands. Children under the age of 6 are exempt from testing. Tests permitted are PCR (RT-PCR for COVID-19), Transcription Mediated Amplification (TMA), and Antigen tests. You should check with your accommodation provider prior to travel.
All arrivals are obliged to present a pre-travel declaration and undergo health checks at the point of entry. See ‘Preparing for arrival’.
Testing requirements for arrivals from mainland Spain
If you are travelling to the Canary or Balearic islands from mainland Spain, you may be required to present a negative COVID test depending on the region you are travelling from. You should refer to your travel operator and the local authorities in your final destination for guidance on domestic entry requirements.
Testing requirements if travelling from a ‘risk country’
All passengers (excluding children under the age of 6 years old) travelling to Spanish airports and ports from ‘risk’ countries (as determined by the European Centre for Disease Prevention & Control), or who have travelled to a risk country within 14 days of travelling to Spain, are required to present a negative PCR, TMA (Transcription-Mediated Amplification) or a LAMP (Loop-Mediated Isothermal Amplification) swab test taken within no more than 72 hours prior to arrival.
A minimum fine of €3000 may be issued to anyone who arrives in Spanish airports or ports from ‘risk’ countries without adequate evidence of a negative PCR, TMA or LAMP test.
Testing requirements for overland travellers
All overland travellers (excluding children under the age of 6 years old) who wish to enter Spain by road or rail from France, are required to present a negative PCR, TMA or LAMP test taken within 72 hours prior to entry. The following groups are exempt from this requirement:
Haulage workers
Frontier workers
Residents of border regions within a radius of 30 km
While these testing requirements don’t apply to overland travellers from Portugal, Andorra and Gibraltar, travel into Spain from all locations is limited.
Testing requirements for travellers transiting by air
If you are transiting Spain by air from the UK you are not subject to testing requirements, however you should check with your travel operator and the authorities at your final destination if a negative test is required on entry.
Preparing for arrival
On arrival into Spanish ports and airports, you may be subject to the following requirements at the point of entry:
Present the QR code (hardcopy or digital) issued on completion of the online Health Control Form prior to travel. See Mandatory pre-travel declaration form for all passengers
Undergo a temperature check
Undergo a visual health assessment
If travelling from a ‘risk country’ be prepared to show evidence certifying you have undertaken a PCR, TMA or LAMP test within no more than 72 hours prior to arrival, and have tested negative for COVID-19. From 24 May, arrivals from the UK are no longer subject to this requirement (unless they are subject to the exceptions listed in ‘Testing requirements for arrivals from the UK’). See Testing requirements
If travelling from a country where Spain has travel restrictions, you should check with the Spanish Embassy in that country before you travel to Spain. Due to current travel restrictions, be aware that you may be questioned on arrival by Spanish border authorities to ensure you meet the legal entry requirements. Spanish border authorities will only grant entry if they are satisfied that you meet the entry requirements and reserve the right to deny passage.
Anyone who presents symptoms or fails to meet one of the above requirements will be required to undergo a test on arrival and will be obliged to observe the COVID-19 protocols in place as determined by the local authorities of your destination in Spain.
Passengers may also be contacted and required to undertake a PCR, TMA or LAMP test at any point up to 48 hours after their arrival in Spain.
Overland transit
Spain’s land borders are open, however travel restrictions, border controls and testing requirements may be in place depending on the country you are travelling from.
All overland travellers (by road or rail) from France are required to present a negative PCR, TMA or LAMP test taken within 72 hours prior to entering Spain. See Testing requirements for further information and exemptions. While these testing requirements don’t apply to overland travellers from Portugal, Andorra and Gibraltar, travel into Spain from all locations is limited.
Border controls at the Portugal land border with Spain have been lifted. See FCDO travel advice for Portugal.
If you are travelling to Spain via Gibraltar, check the latest entry requirements and FCDO travel advice for Gibraltar. Entry requirements and testing requirements are currently in force for travel into Spain, see Testing requirements.
Inter-regional travel is permitted, providing your point of origin and destination do not fall within a confined area where entry and exit restrictions are in place. Transiting confined areas to reach your final destination is permitted, however you should be prepared to show evidence of your onward journey such as train or flight tickets to your final destination. See Coronavirus for further information.
If travelling with people who are not from the same household, all passengers must wear a face mask covering the nose and mouth. Penalties may be imposed if you do not comply. See Use of face-masks.
Regular entry requirements
Visas
The rules for travelling or working in European countries changed on 1 January 2021:
you can travel to countries in the Schengen area for up to 90 days in any 180-day period without a visa. This applies if you travel as a tourist, to visit family or friends, to attend business meetings, cultural or sports events, or for short-term studies or training
if you are travelling to Spain and other Schengen countries without a visa, make sure your whole visit is within the 90-day limit. Visits to Schengen countries within the previous 180 days before you travel count towards your 90 days
to stay longer, to work or study, for business travel or for other reasons, you will need to meet the Spanish government’s entry requirements. You should check with the Spanish consulate in the UK prior to travel regarding what type of visa and/or work permit you may need. If you are unable to return to the UK before the expiry of your visa/permit or visa-free limit due to C-19 restrictions, you should contact your local immigration office (Extranjería) for advice. You can also call 060 from a Spanish phone line. If you are visiting Spain and need to extend your visa-free stay for exceptional reasons, such as a medical emergency, you must apply to the immigration authorities (Extranjería) to do so.
if you stay in Spain with a visa or permit, this does not count towards the 90-day visa-free limit
At Spanish border control, it is likely you will need to use separate lanes from EU, EEA and Swiss citizens when queueing. Your passport may be stamped on entry and exit unless you can demonstrate that you are resident of Spain and are returning to your place of residence (see Requirements for UK nationals resident in Spain section below for further details). You may also need to:
show a return or onward ticket
show you have enough money for your stay
show proof of accommodation for your stay, for example, a hotel booking confirmation, proof of address if visiting your own property (e.g. second home), or an invitation from your host or proof of their address if staying with a third party, friends or family. The Spanish Government has clarified that the “carta de invitation” is one of the options available to prove that you have accommodation if staying with friends or family. More information is available from the Spanish Ministry of Interior.
Requirements for UK nationals resident in Spain
If you are resident in Spain, you should present proof of residence - such as the ‘TIE’ (la tarjeta de identidad de extranjero) - as well as your valid passport when you pass through border control. If the Spanish border authorities are satisfied that you are a resident in Spain, your passport should not be stamped on entry and exit.
Passport validity
Check your passport is valid for travel before you book your trip, and renew your passport if you do not have enough time left on it.
You must have at least 6 months left on an adult or child passport to travel to most countries in Europe (not including Ireland). This applies to the whole of Spain, including the Canary Islands and the Balearic Islands (Majorca, Menorca, Ibiza and Formentera).
If you renewed your current passport before the previous one expired, extra months may have been added to its expiry date. Any extra months on your passport over 10 years may not count towards the 6 months needed.
UK Emergency Travel Documents
UK ETDs are accepted for entry, airside transit and exit from Spain.
Travel between Spain and Gibraltar
Spanish border checks can cause delays when crossing between Spain and Gibraltar. If you are travelling to Spain via Gibraltar, check the latest entry requirements and FCDO travel advice for Gibraltar. Entry requirements and testing requirements are currently in force for travel into Spain, see Testing requirements.
There is no charge to enter or leave Gibraltar. Don’t hand over money if you’re approached by anyone claiming that there is a charge.
