An additional 7 day self-health management period is then required. This applies to all nationalities and is irrespective of the purpose of travel.
The Taiwanese authorities have provided the following information about the quarantine centres:
Quarantine centres are designated locations selected by the Central Epidemic Command Centre (CECC). Designated locations include: Government owned facilities, student dorms and hotels. There are currently a total of 43 quarantine centres located across northern, central and southern Taiwan

Arriving in Taiwan from a low-risk country
The local authorities have announced that from 15 January 2021, there will be tightened quarantine measures in Taiwan, and group quarantine facilities will now be available for passengers travelling from low-risk countries. Passengers who are eligible and choose to quarantine at a private residence rather than a quarantine hotel or a group quarantine facility will be required to declare that their residence complies with quarantine requirements.
Effective from 22 June 2021, all international passengers will be required to undergo a COVID-19 PCR test one day before the end of their mandatory 14 day quarantine. The cost of this test will be covered by the local authorities.

Screening on arrival
All passengers arriving or transiting in Taiwan are required to present a certificate of a negative COVID-19 RT-PCR test in order to be able to board their flight to Taiwan. Any exemption due to exceptional circumstances will require prior approval before departure. This test needs to have taken place within three working days before the date of departure. Test Certificates of a negative COVID-19 RT-PCR must be issued by a recognised medical institution in the country of departure and include the following information:
the passenger’s full name as per their passport,
the date of birth or passport number of the traveller,
specimen collection date and test report date,
the virus name, testing method and the test result.
Test Certificates are required to be produced in either English or Chinese; however, in situations where the passenger provides a certificate in either French or Spanish, if the certificate is in the official language of the place of departure, and ground personnel of the airline are able to assist with the inspection of the content, the certificate may be accepted.
Anyone found to provide false or incorrect test results, or evade or obstruct the quarantine measures, may face a fine of between NT$10,000 to NT$150,000 and further criminal charges.
Refer to the Taiwan Centers for Disease Control for further information regarding Test Exemptions, Test Certificates and COVID-19 test requirements.

If you arrived after 21 March 2020, your maximum stay is determined by your visa. If you wish to stay over 180 days, you may apply to do so if you have a legitimate reason for needing to remain in Taiwan or are unable to leave. Restrictions apply and not all British nationals will be eligible. You cannot apply more than 15 days before the 180 day point.
