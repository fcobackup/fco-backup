Following measures taken by the authorities in Kosovo, there are currently no commercial means of leaving Kosovo to return to the UK.
Following the special commercial flight to London on 6 April, the British Embassy currently has no plans to facilitate further flights. For British nationals still in Kosovo, you should follow the advice of the Kosovan authorities. You should follow the British Embassy in Pristina’s social media accounts for updates on any flights that may become available. See further general advice.
A number of border crossings with neighbouring countries are closed for passenger traffic, and neighbouring countries have also placed restrictions on international travel. You should check FCO travel advice for the relevant country before attempting to cross a border.
