Entry and borders
Slovakia has closed its international airports at Bratislava, Kosice and Poprad to scheduled passenger flights.
As of 13 March, entry to Slovakia is permitted only for Slovak citizens and foreign residents. British nationals with proof of temporary or permanent residence are allowed to enter the country by land border. As of 6 April, it is mandatory for all those travelling to Slovakia from abroad to first pre-register with the Slovak authorities as soon as possible in advance and then on arrival enter mandatory quarantine in a government facility for 14 days. Once people have tested negative, the remainder of the 14 days can be spent in self-isolation at home. There are some exceptions for mandatory quarantine in a government facility, including those with pre-existing medical conditions and those over 75 years old. However they must still self-isolate at home for 14 days or risk incurring a fine of up to €1,659. There are also exceptions for those working less than 30km from the border who have a letter from their employer and for truck drivers bringing essential supplies. For a full list of exceptions and requirements, please see the website of the Slovak government.
The following land border entry points to Slovakia are operational, but this can change at short notice. For the latest information, see the Slovak police Facebook page (in Slovak only). You should also check the FCO Travel Advice for any country you wish to transit on your way to Slovakia:
