Pharmacies
Access to pharmacies and medication is a challenge in Ukraine at this time. Some supply chains are interrupted, so certain medical products are harder to come by. A limited number of pharmacies continue operating. Information on which are operational is provided by local authorities and pharmacy networks.
The Ministry of Health operates a hotline at +380 800 60 20 19 to coordinate access to insulin and other critical medicines for those who need it. The service Tabletki.ua is continuing to operate and attempts to maintain hourly updates about availability of medicines nationwide.
Pharmacies may also close without notice. You should ensure you maintain a stock of essential medication. Pharmacies in smaller towns may not have the same variety of medications available in the bigger cities. They are usually easily identifiable by the presence of a green cross and/or the word “apteka” (аптека). Many drugs that would require a prescription in the UK are available over-the-counter in Ukraine (including, for example asthma inhalers and some antibiotics), but some stronger medications will still require a prescription from a doctor, written in Ukrainian.
Emergency Medical Assistance
If you need emergency medical assistance during your trip, dial 103 and ask for an ambulance. You should contact your insurance/medical assistance company promptly if you are referred to a medical facility for treatment.
Medical Treatment
State medical facilities in Ukraine are generally poor. Private clinics and hospitals offer a better standard of care, though these do not always meet western standards and practices. If you require emergency medical treatment, it is likely that you will be taken to a state hospital unless you can show that you have comprehensive medical insurance cover.
English isn’t widely spoken and British patients may face communication difficulties.
The legal status and regulation of some medicines prescribed or purchased in the UK can be different in other countries. If you’re travelling with prescription or over-the-counter medicine, read this guidance from NaTHNaC on best practice when travelling with medicines. For further information on the legal status of a specific medicine, you’ll need to contact the embassy, high commission or consulate of the country or territory you’re travelling to.
