The Myanmar DCA (Department of Civil Aviation) announced on 30 May 2020 that in order to effectively control the spread of COVID-19 and its variants, the ban on commercial flights will be extended until further notice. The airport however remains open and relief flights are available for those seeking to leave Myanmar. Most of these are commercially bookable, either direct with the airlines or through a travel agent.

The Singapore government announced that from 26 October 2021 travellers with recent travel history to Myanmar within the last 21 days will now be allowed to enter or transit through Singapore. If you are travelling to Singapore you should check with the Singapore government for quarantine restrictions on arrival.
It is important that you book early. From 21 May 2021 the Ministry of Transport and Communication has instructed airlines to send the list of all passengers, leaving overseas by air, to the Ministry of Foreign Affairs 5 days in advance of the flight.
The airport can be very hot so have plenty of water with you. Wi-Fi is often not available. You should complete all paperwork including your Locator form before you go to the airport. Land borders are currently closed to foreign nationals.
All travellers should check with the embassies of respective transit countries for the latest transit, entry and COVID-19 testing requirements before making ticket purchases.
You should ensure that you meet the baggage allowance restrictions for all your flights, as some travellers have found the allowance on the second leg to be lower than that of the first. If you exceed the allowance on any leg of your journey excess baggage charges will be applied and will only be payable in US dollars.
Your journey home: before you leave Myanmar
Entry requirements vary between England, Scotland, Wales and Northern Ireland. You should check whether you need to provide a negative COVID-19 pre-departure test certificate to enter the UK. Some airlines insist on a negative PCR test in order to fly. Where necessary, such tests must be taken no earlier than 3 days before the day you are due to fly. It is important to note that airlines and transit locations may have their own requirements for COVID tests and you should check this in advance of travel.
What you must do when you arrive in England from abroad depends on where you have been in the 10 days before you arrive. It is important that you check the full rules and country listings before you travel on the on the UK government website
You should complete a passenger locator form before going to the airport due to unpredictable WiFi connectivity at the airport. If you are completing your journey to the UK on the same airline that you used to leave Yangon, you will not be able to complete your locator form in transit because a reference number from Yangon is required.
If you do not have a valid British Passport, the British Embassy can issue emergency travel documents or emergency passports should you need to leave the country in the near future. More details can be found on the emergency travel document page.
If you intend to bring a pet back to the UK from Myanmar, you should check the regulations. Your pet will be required to spend four months in quarantine on arrival in the UK due to rabies controls. The only exception to this requirement would be if the pet has been vaccinated against rabies at least three months before travelling and has proof of a positive titre test.
The National Travel Health Network and Centre (NaTHNaC) provides advice on how to stay safe as you travel by air.
