The Government of Australia announced that from 9pm Australia Eastern Standard Time on 20 March, entry to the country will only be permitted to Australian citizens or permanent residents. This follows a similar announcement by New Zealand from 19 March. You may, under certain circumstances, apply for an exemption to transit through Australia.
From 23 March at 2359 local time, no short-term visitors from anywhere in the world can enter or transit through Singapore. If you’re resident in Papua New Guinea, you should be aware of the potential impact of the border closures and flight restrictions on future travel plans.
You will need to pay for your return travel to the UK. If departure options are available but you cannot afford the travel costs and have exhausted all other options for getting funds, you may be eligible to apply for an emergency loan from the government. This is a last resort option and you would need to repay the loan when you are back in the UK. For more information, you should contact Corporate Travel Management (CTM). CTM are a commercial partner of the FCO and are authorised to administer such loans on behalf of the FCO.
