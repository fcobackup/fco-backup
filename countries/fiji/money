There has been an increase in credit card fraud. This may include credit card skimming devices or other types of data theft. Take extra care when paying with credit cards or withdrawing money from ATMs.
Most tourist hotels and many restaurants accept credit cards. But not all ATMs accept the full range of cards issued overseas. The Australian and New Zealand Bank (ANZ) and Westpac ATMs accept cards with the Visa, Mastercard, Maestro and Cirrus symbols.
