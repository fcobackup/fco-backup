Hurricanes
The hurricane season normally runs from June to November. This means tropical storm conditions are possible. You should follow and monitor local and international weather updates from the US National Hurricane Centre and follow the advice of local authorities, including any evacuation orders.
See our Tropical cyclones page for advice about how to prepare effectively and what to do if youâ€™re likely to be affected by a hurricane or tropical cyclone.
Earthquakes
Earthquakes are a potential threat and tremors are felt occasionally in the Caribbean. In the event of an earthquake, you should be directed by the local authorities. To learn more about what to do before, during and after an earthquake, visit the website of the US Federal Emergency Management Agency.
