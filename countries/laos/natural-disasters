Monsoon season
The rainy season in Laos normally runs from May to October, coinciding with the typhoon season in South East Asia. Mountain areas are particularly vulnerable to landslides in the rainy season and flooding may occur along the Mekong river basins and elsewhere. The Mekong River Commission posts official updates on the Mekong River on their website. Travel to some provinces can be seriously disrupted during this time. Monitor local news and weather reports, and international weather updates from the World Meteorological Organisation. See Tropical cyclones
