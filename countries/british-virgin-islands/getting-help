The British Virgin Islands (BVI) is a British Overseas Territory, so there is no British Embassy, and the BVI authorities will support you if you need help.  
Emergency services in the BVI
Telephone:  911  (ambulance, fire and police)
If it is not an emergency you can also contact the police directly on 311.
Emergencies at sea

Contact your travel provider and insurer
Contact your travel provider and your insurer if you are involved in a serious incident or emergency abroad. They will tell you if they can help and what you need to do.

For refunds or changes to travel, contact your travel provider. You may also be able to make a claim through insurance. However, insurers usually require you to talk to your travel provider first.
