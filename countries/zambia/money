Zambia’s currency is the Kwacha and is available at airports, hotels, ATMs and exchange offices. Larger shops, hotels, restaurants and tour operators increasingly accept major credit cards. Use ATMs or banks and bureaux de change to exchange money. It may not be possible to exchange Scottish or Northern Irish bank notes.
