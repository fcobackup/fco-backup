Borders and travel
Commercial flights between Tunisia and all other countries were suspended at 11.59pm on 17 March. All maritime borders are closed. If you are already in Tunisia, and it is not essential that you remain, you should urgently contact your airline or tour operator and arrange to leave as soon as possible.
The British Embassy Tunis is issuing regular updates on Twitter and Facebook with the latest available information on flight departure options for British nationals wishing to leave Tunisia.
Local measures
A countrywide curfew came into effect on 18 March from 6pm to 6am. All schools and nurseries are closed, and cafés and restaurants are closing daily at 4pm. All sporting fixtures, conferences, public prayers and events have been cancelled. An “obligatory confinement period” will come into effect from 22 March. During this period, between 6am and 6pm, people are only expected to leave their house for essential business such as grocery shopping or medical care. The Tunisian government has also prohibited travel between cities and regions and has announced the closure of factories.
