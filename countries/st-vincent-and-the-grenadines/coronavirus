Travel in St Vincent and the Grenadines
Coronavirus related restrictions have increased in recent weeks. Mask-wearing, standard hygiene measures and social distancing is strongly recommended. You may be required to wear face-masks and use sanitizer in taxis and minibuses, shops and in government buildings.
The St Vincent and the Grenadines authorities will seek to prosecute people who breach COVID-19 protocols, including those who break quarantine protocols, which may result in a fine and/or prison sentence.
Accommodation
Not all hotels and private rentals have re-opened or fully re-opened to the public. If making a booking, you should check whether there are any coronavirus restrictions or protocols to observe.
Public places and services
There are no lockdowns or curfews. Physical distancing, including at weddings and funerals, is still recommended but rarely enforced. Otherwise, the few restrictions that there were (e.g. numbers of people allowed to travel on private minibus taxi services and certain businesses or shops only allowing a set number of people in at any one time) are loosening. The amplified music ban, which impacted social gatherings, has now been lifted. Some shops or businesses may still require customers to wear face masks, or to wash or sanitize hands before entry, or adhere to 3-6 feet space markings when queuing.
