This page reflects the UK government’s understanding of current rules for people travelling on a full ‘British Citizen’ passport, for the most common types of travel.
The authorities in Tunisia set and enforce entry rules. For further information contact the embassy, high commission or consulate of the country or territory you’re travelling to. You should also consider checking with your transport provider or travel company to make sure your passport and other travel documents meet their requirements.
Entry rules in response to coronavirus (COVID-19)
Entry to Tunisia
You must complete this Tunisian government short online questionnaire before travelling.
Before 15 February, all travellers over the age of six must take either
a PCR test less than 48 hours before travel;
or a rapid lateral flow test less than 24 hours before travel
and carry dated evidence of a negative result. This result must include a QR code.
If you are vaccinated, you also need to present official evidence of your vaccinations. You must have been vaccinated:
At least 28 days before travelling (Janssen vaccine)
At least 7 days before travelling (all other vaccines)
If you are not fully vaccinated you are required to enter mandatory quarantine in a government-approved hotel for five days on arrival in Tunisia, at your own expense. To be admitted into the country you must provide evidence of a booking reservation for a quarantine hotel and a transport voucher for travel to the quarantine hotel.
A list of approved hotels is available in Arabic and in French
You will also be required to show payment for a test to be taken during the last 24 hours of your hotel quarantine period. If it is positive, your quarantine period will be extended.
You are exempt from the requirement to enter mandatory quarantine if:
you can present official evidence to prove you have been fully vaccinated
you are under the age of 18 and unaccompanied or travelling with vaccinated adults. You will need to self-isolate at your accommodation
you are travelling for medical reasons and have official evidence from the health authority
From 15 February, if you are vaccinated, you will need to present official evidence of your vaccinations, but you will no longer be required to provide a PCR or rapid test to enter the country.
Travellers who have not been vaccinated will no longer be required to isolate. But they must take either:
a PCR test less than 48 hours before travel;
or a rapid lateral flow test less than 24 hours before travel and carry dated evidence of a negative result. This test must include a QR code.
Proof of vaccination must be issued from the national health authority of your country of residence. (See ‘Demonstrating your COVID-19 status’).
Travellers may be subject to random rapid or PCR tests on arrival. If the test is positive, the traveller will be required to self-isolate for five days. If symptoms persist, they will be required to isolate for a further two days.
Demonstrating your COVID-19 status
Tunisia will accept the UK’s proof of COVID-19 recovery and vaccination record. Your NHS appointment card from vaccination centres is not designed to be used as proof of vaccination and should not be used to demonstrate your vaccine status.
Testing on arrival
Travellers may be tested on arrival by the Tunisian authorities. If they receive a positive result they will be obliged to self-isolate for five days. If symptoms persist, this period will be extended to seven days. Before 15 February, travellers from all countries need to provide a dated negative PCR or rapid lateral flow test result on arrival. See the ‘Entry to Tunisa’ section for full details.
Data collection
You must complete this Tunisian government short online questionnaire before travelling.
On arrival in Tunisia, you must also share your contact details and travel information with authorities.
Testing on departure
No testing is available at the airport or sea ports. Passengers travelling from Tunisia, who require a test for the country they are travelling to, should arrange a private test.
There have been some reports of travellers from Tunisia being denied entry to a third country, on suspicion of carrying fake test results. This may affect you if you are transiting in one country before onward travel to the UK.
For verification, travellers are advised to carry the original copy of their negative test result, and ensure this has been signed and stamped by the laboratory, before travelling. A QR code on test results must also be provided.
Transiting Tunisia
Transit flights are operating through Tunisia. If you are transiting through Tunisia, you must comply with sanitary measures and temperature checks.
Regular entry requirements
Visas
British passport holders don’t need a visa for visits of up to three months. On arrival, security checks are sometimes carried out on British passport holders who were not born in the UK. This can take a few hours and you will need to be patient until clearance is given. These types of checks rarely take place on departure.
Overstay fines
If you stay in Tunisia for longer than the authorised period, you will have to pay a fine. This rule may not apply if you are vulnerable and current circumstances oblige you to remain in the country.
Passport validity
For stays of up to 3 months your passport should be valid for the proposed duration of your stay; you don’t need any additional period of validity on your passport beyond this.
UK Emergency Travel Documents
Tunisian authorities accept UK ETDs for entry to and exit from Tunisia. If you’re leaving Tunisia on an ETD, make sure you have a copy of the police report about the loss/theft of your full validity passport to present to the Immigration Officer.
Dual nationals
Dual British-Tunisian nationals should enter and leave Tunisia on their Tunisian passports.
