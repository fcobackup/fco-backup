This is particularly important if you have a health condition or are pregnant.
Emergency medical number
Dial 999 and ask for an ambulance.
Medical help at the scene of an accident is likely to be limited, particularly outside Kampala.
Contact your insurance company quickly if you’re referred to a medical facility for treatment.
