There remain commercial options to return to the UK from the Netherlands.
If you live in the UK and are currently visiting the Netherlands, you’re strongly advised to return now by commercial means. Don’t run the risk of getting stranded. We recommend that UK nationals who wish to leave check the latest travel advice and the most recent updates from their travel operator before travelling.
UK special charter flights will only operate for priority countries where commercial flights are not possible. You should not assume that these flights will become available in countries where commercial routes are operating.
If you are travelling via Belgium or France, please check FCO Travel Advice for those countries.
Flights
KLM, British Airways and Ryanair are operating flights to the UK on a much reduced service. Please check airline websites, including comparison websites for the latest times and information.
You will need to pay for your return travel to the UK. If departure options are available but you cannot afford the travel costs and have exhausted all other options for getting funds, you may be eligible to apply for an emergency loan from the government. This is a last resort option and you would need to repay the loan when you are back in the UK. For more information, you should contact Corporate Travel Management (CTM). CTM are a commercial partner of the FCO and are authorised to administer such loans on behalf of the FCO.
Arrival in the UK
When you arrive back in the UK, follow the guidance for when you return to the UK on steps you should take to protect yourself and others.
