International travel
Peru’s international borders remain closed and there are no international commercial travel options at this time. Repatriation flights depart from Lima’s Jorge Chavez International Airport.
Passengers at the airport will need to follow strict regulations, including the mandatory use of masks and facial protectors (usually a clear plastic full-face covering) and social distancing.
KLM has requested permission for a weekly flight – every Thursday – from Lima to Amsterdam. Tickets will be made available on the KLM Peru and Air France Peru websites (both available in English).
These flights are predominantly for citizens of EU Member States plus passport holders from the UK, Norway, Liechtenstein, Iceland and Switzerland. Citizens of these countries can enter the Netherlands and continue their journey by plane or over land (train, bus, car).
Airlines from France, Spain and the United States have also requested permission for repatriation flights. It is essential to check the rules of every country you pass through on your journey home as rules may vary from country to country and change regularly. Please follow our social media pages and those for The Netherlands, Spain, France and the US for the latest information.

A ban on the use of private cars on Sundays
Lockdown and an extended curfew, between the hours of 8pm and 4am Monday to Saturday, and all day on Sunday until 4am on Monday, starting on 1 October within the Ayacucho region, Huamanga province only; within the Apurimac region, Abancay province only; within the Huanuco region, Huanuco, province only.
An extended curfew all day on Sunday until 4 am on Monday in the regions of Cusco, Puno, Moquegua and Tacna

special measures are in place for those under 12 and over 65, and people at risk.

people over 65 and those who have underlying health conditions must stay at home, with some exceptions; risk groups must not receive visits at home and must avoid the physical contact with people who leave their home
everyone must wear face masks outside of homes
in addition to wearing a face mask, everyone must wear facial protectors (usually a clear plastic full-face covering) when on public transport.
Future changes to curfew rules will be announced by the President.
These restrictions may not apply if you have an internal travel permit (salvo-conducto) from the Peruvian authorities. These are only issued to those who are travelling from or via regions still under lockdown and only for repatriation purposes (for those with confirmed bookings to leave Peru).
If this applies to you, contact the British Embassy who will make a request to the Peruvian authorities. Depending on your destination region, you may have to spend some time (possibly two weeks) in quarantine immediately after arrival. The exact location of the quarantine will be decided by the regional government upon arrival.
You should note before being able to move from one region of Peru to another, the local government may first require you to submit a medical certificate, following a COVID-19 test, stating that you are free from infection.
Relaxing of restrictions
The Peruvian government has approved a four-phase Economic Reactivation Plan, between May and August which involves relaxing some restrictions and reopening some industry sectors such as Industry and Mining, Construction, Trade and Tourism and Services. For Tourism and Services, the plan involves reopening or restarting the following:
first phase (May): Restaurants (via delivery), hotels and storage
second phase (June): Inter-provincial transport and flights, restaurants (restricted service); some malls and commercial centres have re-opened
third phase (July): International flights, restaurants and hotels operating normally
fourth phase (August): Leisure activities, conventions, meetings, gatherings
This planned relaxation of industry restrictions remains under review and continues to change. The government has declared that commercial international travel will start on 5 October within the Latin American region. Commercial internal travel is only permitted in regions that are not under lockdown.
