This page has information on travelling to Lithuania. Check what you must do to return to the UK.
This page reflects the UK government’s understanding of current rules for people travelling on a full ‘British Citizen’ passport from the UK, for the most common types of travel.
The authorities in Lithuania set and enforce entry rules.
All travellers
Lithuania has implemented a three-tier rule system for all arrivals based on the weekly map issued by the European Centre for Disease Prevention and Control (ECDC). This can be viewed on the ECDC website.
You will be required to complete a registration form no earlier than 48 hours prior to arrival in Lithuania and to show the confirmation (QR code) to the carrier when boarding the vehicle, or those travelling by their own transport will have to show it to the NPHC staff or other officials at the border checkpoint or passenger checkpoint.
If you’re fully vaccinated
If you’re fully vaccinated, you can enter Lithuania without needing to test or quarantine.
You are considered fully vaccinated if at least 14 days have passed since you have completed a full course of vaccination against COVID-19, with a vaccine registered in the EU Register of Medicinal Products. The Lithuanian Government considers individuals to be fully vaccinated if you have had:
the second dose of a two-dose vaccination schedule;
one dose under the single-dose vaccination schedule
at least one dose of vaccination, following recovery from COVID-19 in the previous 180 days.
See more information on the Lithuanian National Public Health Centre website.
Proof of vaccination status
To be eligible for quarantine/testing exemptions, vaccinated arrivals must produce a medical document, a country-specific vaccination certificate or an international vaccination certificate confirming that they have gone through the full programme of COVID-19 vaccination with a vaccine registered in the Union Register of Medicinal Products.
Lithuania will accept the UK’s proof of COVID-19 recovery and vaccination record and proof of COVID-19 vaccination issued in the Crown Dependencies. Your final vaccine dose must have been administered within the last 12 months prior to travel. Your NHS appointment card from vaccination centres is not designed to be used as proof of vaccination and should not be used to demonstrate your vaccine status.
If you are not fully vaccinated against COVID-19 and do not have a history of past infection and do not belong to any other exemption group, you will be required to have a COVID-19 test (either PCR or antigen tests). A document evidencing negative testing must be presented to the carrier before the trip. See more information on the Lithuanian National Public Health Centre website.
Seven-day self-isolation is mandatory for unvaccinated arrivals who do not have a valid exemption.
If you’ve had COVID-19 in the past year
You are not required to self-isolate or provide evidence of a negative COVID-19 test on arrival in Lithuania, if you provide proof of your positive diagnosis and proof of recovery from COVID-19 within the previous 180 days.
You may also use the UK’s proof of COVID-19 recovery record to demonstrate proof of COVID-19 recovery when entering Lithuania.
Children and young people
Children under the age of 12 are not required to self-isolate on arrival in Lithuania. Testing and isolation requirements for children aged between 12 and 16 is dependent on the country from which they are travelling. More information can be found on the Lithuanian National Public Health Centre website.

UK nationals are allowed to transit through Lithuania is permitted, regardless of their vaccination status.
Transiting through Lithuania by car
UK nationals transiting Lithuania by car, do not need to self-isolate or have proof of COVID-19 test done, but you do have to fill in a Passenger’s questionnaire (no earlier than 48 hours before entering Lithuania). In the Address line please enter: TRANSIT TO (enter the country you are traveling to), in the Municipality line please choose the first municipality you will enter in Lithuania. See the map of Municipalities.
Transiting through the airport
If transiting through a Lithuanian airport, you must wear a medical facemask for the entirety of your time in the airport, unless you are consuming food or drink. More information on Lithuanian facemask requirements can be found on the Coronavirus page.
Exemptions
If you belong to an exemption group you will not be required to have a COVID-19 test (either PCR or antigen tests).
The seven-day self-isolation requirement is not mandatory for unvaccinated arrivals who have a valid exemption.
Check your passport and travel documents before you travel
Passport validity
If you are visiting Lithuania, your passport should be:
less than 10 years old on the day you enter (check the ‘date of issue’)
valid for at least 3 months after the day you plan to leave (check the ‘expiry date’)
if you are travelling to Lithuania and other Schengen countries without a visa, make sure your whole visit is within the 90-day limit. Visits to Schengen countries within the previous 180 days before you travel count towards your 90 days.
At Lithuanian border control, you may need to queue in separate lanes from EU, EEA and Swiss citizens.
Contact your travel provider or embassy of the country you are visiting if you think that your passport does not meet both these requirements. Renew your passport if you need to.
Visas
The rules for travelling or working in European countries changed on 1 January 2021:
you can travel to countries in the Schengen area for up to 90 days in any 180-day period without a visa. This applies if you travel as a tourist, to visit family or friends, to attend business meetings, cultural or sports events, or for short-term studies or training.
if you are travelling to Lithuania and other Schengen countries without a visa, make sure your whole visit is within the 90-day limit. Visits to Schengen countries within the previous 180 days before you travel count towards your 90 days.
to stay longer, to work or study, for business travel or for other reasons, you will need to meet the Lithuanian government’s entry requirements. Check with the Lithuanian Embassy what type of visa and/or work permit you may need
if you stay in Lithuania with a residence permit or long-stay visa, this does not count towards your 90-day visa-free limit
Any time you spent in Lithuania or other Schengen countries before 1 January 2021 does not count towards your 90-day visa-free limit.
At Lithuanian border control, you may need to queue in separate lanes from EU, EEA and Swiss citizens.
Check your passport is stamped if you enter or exit the Schengen area through Lithuania as a visitor. Border guards will use passport stamps to check you’re complying with the 90-day visa-free limit for short stays in the Schengen area. If relevant entry or exit stamps are not in your passport, border guards will presume that you have overstayed your visa-free limit.
You can show evidence of when and where you entered or exited the Schengen area, and ask the border guards to add this date and location in your passport. Examples of acceptable evidence include boarding passes and tickets.
You may also need to:
show a return or onward ticket
show you have enough money for your stay
If you are resident in Lithuania your passport should not be stamped. You should proactively show your proof of residence as well as your valid passport at Lithuanian border control. For further information see our Living in Lithuania guide.
UK Emergency Travel Documents
UK Emergency Travel Documents (ETDs) are accepted for entry, airside transit and exit from Lithuania.
