Travel to the airport
Travel between Abidjan and the rest of the country is restricted. You will need a permit from the Ivoirian government. If you need help with this please contact british.embassy.abidjan@fco.gov.uk
If you are travelling to Abidjan International Airport for the special flight to the UK, Ivorian police may ask to see your ticket and passport in order to let you pass the checkpoints.
Your journey home
The National Travel Health Network and Centre (NaTHNaC) provides advice on how to stay safe as you travel by air.
If you’re returning home before 8 June, follow the guidance for when you return to the UK on steps you should take to protect yourself and others. From 8 June there will be new rules for entering the UK.
Future options
We do not plan any further UK government special flights from Abidjan after 2 June.
The UK government is liaising closely with airlines and other governments to make sure commercial options for returning to the UK are available as soon as possible.
This travel advice will be updated when departure options become available.
You will need to pay for your return travel to the UK. If departure options are available but you cannot afford the travel costs and have exhausted all other options for getting funds, you may be eligible to apply for an emergency loan from the government. This is a last resort option and you would need to repay the loan when you are back in the UK. For more information, you should contact Corporate Travel Management (CTM). CTM are a commercial partner of the FCO and are authorised to administer such loans on behalf of the FCO.
