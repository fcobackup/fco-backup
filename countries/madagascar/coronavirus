COVID-19 vaccines if you live in Madagascar
Madagascar has joined the COVAX initiative and a domestic vaccination programme will begin in May. As information is available about the national vaccination programme, this page will be updated. Sign up to get email notifications.
The government’s priority categories for the first phase of vaccinations are frontline health workers and public security forces, and persons over 70 years old or at high clinical risk. You should speak to local health authorities or your medical provider for information on eligibility for the vaccination programme.
The Medicines and Healthcare Products Regulatory Agency (MHRA) is the UK authority responsible for assessing the safety, quality and efficacy of vaccines. It has authorised the Pfizer/BioNTech, Oxford/AstraZeneca and Moderna vaccines for temporary supply and use in the UK. Find out more about MHRA approval for these vaccines.
British nationals living overseas should seek medical advice from their local healthcare provider in the country where they reside. Information about vaccines used in other national programmes, including regulatory status, should be available from the local authorities. This list of Stringent Regulatory Authorities recognised by the World Health Organisation may also be a useful source of additional information.
