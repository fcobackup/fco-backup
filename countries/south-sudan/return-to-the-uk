Coronavirus guidance is being updated.
Read what you can and cannot do

There are currently extremely limited and no routine commercial options available to return to the UK from South Sudan. We know this is concerning for British people trying to leave South Sudan. On 24 March, the government of South Sudan announced the closure of all land borders (except for cargo) and suspended all international passenger flights.
Flights
Since 24 March, the South Sudan government has authorised special permission for a limited number of flights, but some of these flights did not happen. No further flights have yet been authorised by the South Sudan government.
We continue to work closely with airlines, the South Sudanese authorities and other embassies to make sure options are available for you to return to the UK as soon as possible. This page will be updated when departure options become available.
What to do
If you cannot leave South Sudan at this time, you should:
follow the advice of local authorities, including local measures to help minimise your risk of exposure to coronavirus.
find accommodation thatâ€™s suitable for your needs
keep in regular contact with family and friends at home, so they know you are safe and well
See more information and advice about staying where you are if you cannot return to the UK.
Future travel options
This travel advice will be updated when departure options become available. Sign up for email alerts and follow the British Embassy Juba on Twitter and Facebook.
You will need to pay for your return travel to the UK. If departure options are available but you cannot afford the travel costs and have exhausted all other options for getting funds, you may be eligible to apply for an emergency loan from the government. This is a last resort option and you would need to repay the loan when you are back in the UK. For more information, you should contact Corporate Travel Management (CTM). CTM are a commercial partner of the FCO and are authorised to administer such loans on behalf of the FCO.
Your journey home
The National Travel Health Network and Centre (NaTHNaC) provides advice on how to stay safe as you travel by air. When you arrive back in the UK, follow the guidance for when you return to the UK on steps you should take to protect yourself and others.
Help and support
If you need urgent consular assistance, you can contact the British High Commission in Nairobi. You can call British High Commission Nairobi on +254 (0) 20 2873000 or +254 (0) 20 2844000. Consular support is severely limited in South Sudan. The British Embassy in Juba does not have a consular section.
