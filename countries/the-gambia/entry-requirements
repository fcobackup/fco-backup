You should also consider checking with your transport provider or travel company to make sure your passport and other travel documents meet their requirements.
Entry rules in response to coronavirus (COVID-19)
Entry to The Gambia

To enter The Gambia, you will need to show a negative PCR COVID-19 test taken no more than 72 hours before you arrived in The Gambia to Ministry of Health officials upon arrival. If arriving from the United Kingdom you will be expected to take a mandatory rapid diagnostic COVID-19 test on arrival. If your results are returned negative you will be allowed to travel on to your destination with advice to report to health authorities if any symptoms develop.
Quarantine requirements
Failure to present a negative PCR COVID-19 test taken no more than 72 hours before you arrive in The Gambia to Ministry of Health officials or a positive test on arrival will result in you being tested and quarantined for 14 days at your own cost.
Screening on arrival
Additional surveillance and detection mechanisms have been put in place at Banjul International Airport and various points of entry along The Gambia’s border.
