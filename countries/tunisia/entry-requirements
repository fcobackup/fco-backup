Coronavirus guidance is being updated.
Read the Prime Minister’s statement for the latest information.

The information on this page covers the most common types of travel and reflects the UK government’s understanding of the rules currently in place. Unless otherwise stated, this information is for travellers using a full ‘British Citizen’ passport.
The authorities in the country or territory you’re travelling to are responsible for setting and enforcing the rules for entry. If you’re unclear about any aspect of the entry requirements, or you need further reassurance, you’ll need to contact the embassy, high commission or consulate of the country or territory you’re travelling to.
You should also consider checking with your transport provider or travel company to make sure your passport and other travel documents meet their requirements.
Coronavirus
The Tunisian authorities have advised that from 27 June entry requirements will vary depending on the prevalence of the epidemic in travelers’ country of residence. The UK has been classified as a “Red” country.
This means that individuals resident in the UK are not permitted to enter Tunisia. The only exceptions to this are for Tunisian nationals and for those with residency in Tunisia. These individuals can travel from the UK to Tunisia subject to:
Having taken a coronavirus PCR test that is negative no more than 72 hours before departure and bringing evidence of this result with you; and
Spending seven days in quarantine then an additional seven days in confinement at home, subject to a negative COVID-19 test; and
Signing a declaration to confirm that you will abide by these rules.
Lists of countries classed as “Green”, with a low prevalence of the epidemic, and “Orange”, with a medium prevalence of the epidemic, are published (in French) on www.santetunisie.rns.tn. The Tunisian authorities have stated that these lists will be reviewed weekly. If and when the classification for the UK changes, this travel advice will be updated accordingly.
Individuals resident in “Green” countries will not be subject to any coronavirus-specific entry requirements and will not need to take a test before departing. Individuals resident in “Orange” countries will need to have taken a coronavirus PCR test that is negative no more than 72 hours before departure. They will also need to self-isolate in their place of residence or a hotel at their own expense for 14 days. If they wish to leave self-isolation they may do so from the sixth day after their arrival, by paying for a PCR test and receiving a negative result.
The Tunisian authorities have also introduced other restrictions in response to the coronavirus (COVID-19) pandemic. See Staying during coronavirus.
Visas
British passport holders don’t need a visa for visits of up to three months. On arrival, security checks are sometimes carried out on British passport holders who were not born in the UK. This can take a few hours and you will need to be patient until clearance is given. These types of checks rarely take place on departure.
Passport validity
For stays of up to 3 months your passport should be valid for the proposed duration of your stay; you don’t need any additional period of validity on your passport beyond this.
UK Emergency Travel Documents
Tunisian authorities accept UK ETDs for entry to and exit from Tunisia. If you’re leaving Tunisia on an ETD, make sure you have a copy of the police report about the loss/theft of your full validity passport to present to the Immigration Officer.
Dual nationals
Dual British-Tunisian nationals should enter and leave Tunisia on their Tunisian passports.
