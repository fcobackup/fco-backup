If you are in Myanmar and able to leave, you should do so.
Exit from Myanmar is now only available to foreigners by air. Flights from Myanmar to the UK are reducing rapidly, and all could stop at any time. Qatar Airlines currently has a few direct flights scheduled between Yangon and Doha. Availability of tickets may be limited, and may be subject to cancellation at short notice. You should confirm with your airline before travel and continue to monitor your flight until you have received your boarding pass at the airport.
Myanmar closed all land borders with its neighbouring countries to foreigners on 19 March. Any foreign national with a valid entry visa may only exit Myanmar at Yangon, Mandalay or Nay Pyi Taw International Airports.
For all travel, you should check the requirements for both the transit country and country of destination.
Travel via Hong Kong
We understand that Hong Kong will end transit from midnight on 24 March.
Travel via Singapore
The Ministry of Health in Singapore has announced that as of 24 March 2020, short-term visitors will not be allowed to enter or transit through Singapore. You should check with your airline in advance of travelling via Singapore.
Travel via Thailand
If youâ€™re travelling to, or through Thailand, there are currently measures in place for all foreign nationals.
At check-in in Myanmar, passengers are required to present a medical certificate signed by a medical professional confirming no evidence of the coronavirus infection in the previous 72 hours, and also present evidence of medical insurance of no less than US$100,000 which covers COVID-19.
Failure to meet these requirements will mean passengers are not permitted to board their flight even if they are transiting airside to another international destination. Precautionary COVID-19 testing is currently not available in Myanmar.
Thai Airways are suspending flights from Yangon to Bangkok from 25 March.
Transiting through Thailand will be difficult from 22 March. From 22 March, Thai authorities implemented additional screening measures that apply to passengers travelling to Thailand from all destinations, including those in transit. You should be aware that some scheduled flights are being cancelled and options may become more limited.
The number of flights and seat availability continues to reduce. Options will become extremely limited if airlines reduce flights further. Check with your airline before you are due to travel as the situation is changing quickly.
