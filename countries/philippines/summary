The Foreign and Commonwealth Office (FCO) advise against all travel to western and central Mindanao and the Sulu archipelago because of terrorist activity and clashes between the military and insurgent groups.

There is an ongoing outbreak of coronavirus. The virus originated in Hubei Province in China, but cases have been confirmed in other parts of China and in other countries, including the Philippines. On 10 February the Philippine government announced temporary entry restrictions for people who have recently been in or travelled via mainland China, Hong Kong, or Macao. See Health
It is estimated that over 200,000 British nationals visited the Philippines in 2018. Most visits are trouble-free.
The lake Taal volcano 60km south of Manila has been experiencing increased volcanic activity since 12 January 2020. On 26 January the Philippines’ authorities reduced the alert level from 4 down to 3. Whilst this indicates a decreased tendency towards a hazardous eruption being imminent, it does not indicate that the threat of a hazardous eruption has disappeared. This reduced the recommended evacuation zone from a 14km radius to a 7km radius. This should not be interpreted that unrest has ceased, or that the threat of a hazardous eruption has disappeared. The volcano is under constant monitoring by Philippine authorities and the alert level will be raised again if an increase in activity is detected. You should follow updates on the PhiVolcs official website.
Terrorists are very likely to try to carry out attacks in the Philippines. Terrorist groups have the intent and capability to carry out attacks anywhere in the country, including in the capital Manila and in places visited by foreigners, such as airports, shopping malls, public transport, including the metro system, and places of worship. You should remain vigilant at all times and report anything suspicious to the local authorities. See Terrorism
