Coronavirus travel health

The Irish Government publishes information on cases at a national and local level on its COVID-19 Data Hub.

Entry and borders
See Entry requirements to find out what you will need to do when you arrive in Ireland.
Returning to the UK
When you return, you must follow the rules for entering the UK.
Be prepared for your plans to change
No travel is risk-free during COVID. Countries may further restrict travel or bring in new rules at short notice, for example due to a new COVID-19 variant. Check with your travel company or airline for any transport changes which may delay your journey home.
If you test positive for COVID-19, you may need to stay where you are until you test negative. You may also need to seek treatment there.
Plan ahead and make sure you:
can access money
understand what your insurance will cover
can make arrangements to extend your stay and be away for longer than planned

COVID-19 vaccines if you live in Ireland
Wherever possible British nationals should aim to be vaccinated in the country where they live. We will update this page when the Government of Ireland announces new information on the national vaccination programme. You can sign up to get email notifications when this page is updated.
Ireland’s national vaccination programme started in December 2020 and is using the AstraZeneca, Janssen (Johnson and Johnson), Pfizer-BioNTech and Moderna vaccines. British nationals resident in Ireland are eligible for vaccination. For information on Ireland’s vaccine programme please go to the Irish Government website.
To register with a GP practice please consult the Irish College of General Practitioners website for a list of GPs with phone contact information.
Find out more, including about vaccines that are authorised in the UK or approved by the World Health Organisation, on the COVID-19 vaccines if you live abroad. If you’re a British national living in Ireland, you should seek medical advice from your local healthcare provider. Information about COVID-19 vaccines used in the national programme where you live, including regulatory status, should be available from local authorities.
If you receive your COVID-19 vaccination in Ireland, you can get an EU Digital COVID Certificate from the national authorities. The Certificate proves that you have been vaccinated against COVID-19, received a negative test result, or recovered from COVID-19. It will help facilitate your travel within the EU and, in some countries, you can use it to demonstrate your COVID-19 status to businesses and other organisations. For further information visit the European Commission’s EU Digital COVID Certificate page.
