It’s illegal to cover your face in public places in the Swiss cantons of Ticino and St Gallen. This does not apply to the mandatory requirement to wear a hygienic face mask on public transport. Failure to comply with the ban is punishable by a fine ranging from 100 CHF to 10,000 CHF. The law doesn’t provide any exemption for tourists.
