For information on entry to Switzerland, see Entry requirements
The Swiss Government have started a phased relaxation of the “extraordinary measures” introduced in response to coronavirus (COVID-19).
All shops, restaurants, markets, museums and libraries are now able to reopen with social distancing measures in place. Restaurants are able to accommodate groups of more than four people. Events of up to 300 people are permitted. All contact with other individuals should be kept to a minimum, and a distance of 2 metres should be maintained at all times.
The public are encouraged to stay at home and employers urged to allow staff to work from home.

Finance
There is a range of financial support from the government that you can access while you are unable to return due to coronavirus restrictions.
If you’re in Switzerland, and have exhausted all other options to cover essential living costs while you wait to return home, you could apply for an emergency loan for your living costs from the UK government. You can only apply if you normally live in the UK and you cannot return home. This last-resort option is for those most in need, and you would need to repay the loan when you are back in the UK. Apply for an emergency loan.
