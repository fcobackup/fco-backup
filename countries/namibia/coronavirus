Cases of coronavirus (COVID-19) have been confirmed in Namibia. The Namibian authorities have introduced new measures to limit the spread of the virus.
Travel
Namibia declared a state of emergency on 17 March and has closed its borders and ports to foreign nationals and non-residents entering the country. All commercial flights in and out of the country have been suspended.
Namibian nationals and permanent residents returning to Namibia from high-risk countries are required to enter supervised quarantine in a government facility for a period of 14 days.
If you need further information about entry requirements, contact the local immigration authorities or the nearest Namibia High Commission. You should also check with your airline or travel company for the latest information.
