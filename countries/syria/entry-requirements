Warning
FCDO advises against all travel to Syria.

This information is for people travelling on a full ‘British citizen’ passport from the UK, who choose to travel against FCDO advice. It is based on the UK government’s understanding of the current rules for the most common types of travel.
The relevant authorities in Syria set and enforce entry rules. 
Passport validity requirements
To enter Syria, your passport must have an ‘expiry date’ at least 3 months after the date you arrive.
Check with your travel provider that your passport and other travel documents meet requirements. Renew your passport if you need to.
You will be denied entry if you do not have a valid travel document or try to use a passport that has been reported lost or stolen.
Previous travel to Israel
If your passport shows previous travel to Israel, you may be refused entry to Syria.
Visa requirements
You must have a visa and relevant security clearance for the area of Syria you want to travel to.
Applying for a visa
If you choose to travel to Syria against FCDO advice, ensure you have the right visa or you may be refused entry. Contact the relevant Syrian authorities for further information.
Penalties for illegal entry
If you enter Syria illegally, you could get a fine of 5 to 10 million Syrian pounds and a prison sentence of 5 to 10 years.
Journalists travelling to Syria
All foreign journalists entering Syria need special permission from the relevant Syrian authorities.
Vaccine requirements
For details about medical entry requirements and recommended vaccinations, see TravelHealthPro’s Syria guide.
