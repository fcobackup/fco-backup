This page has information on travelling to Seychelles.
This page reflects the UK government’s understanding of current rules for people travelling on a full ‘British Citizen’ passport from the UK, for the most common types of travel.
The authorities in Seychelles set and enforce entry rules. If you’re unsure how Seychelles’ entry requirements apply to you, contact its UK embassy, high commission or consulate.
All travellers
All visitors need to have a Health Travel Authorisation and a valid Travel and Health Insurance for entry to Seychelles. You are also required to stay in certified tourism establishments.
Travellers arriving by sea can apply for the Health Travel Authorisation via email. If you are arriving to Seychelles by sea, you must have spent at least 10 days by sea since your last port of call and should be without symptoms of COVId-19 during this period. Clients or crew who wish to disembark before completion of 10 days at sea or on-board must take a PCR test on arrival.
If you’re fully vaccinated
From 15 March 2022, travellers who are fully vaccinated do not need to take any COVID-19 travel tests before flying to Seychelles. You must have received the first two doses of the COVID-19 vaccine including a booster dose after six months since completing the primary series.
Proof of vaccination status
Travellers must present proof of their vaccination status when applying for the Health Travel Authorization for entry to Seychelles.
Seychelles will accept the UK’s proof of COVID-19 recovery and vaccination record and proof of COVID-19 vaccination issued in the Crown Dependencies. Your NHS appointment card from vaccination centres is not designed to be used as proof of vaccination and should not be used to demonstrate your vaccine status.
If you’re not fully vaccinated
Visitors who are not fully vaccinated will be required to present a negative PCR test taken within 72 hours or a rapid antigen test done within 24hrs before departure to Seychelles.
See information on the full entry procedures for all travellers at the Ministry for Foreign Affairs and Tourism website and ‘conditions for entry’ at the Ministry of Health website.
If you’ve had COVID-19 in the past year
If you’ve had a recent past infection (between 2 and 12 weeks before date of departure), you do not need to take any pre-travel COVID-19 tests. However, you must show proof of infection and recovery.
You can use the UK COVID Pass to demonstrate proof of COVID-19 recovery in applying for a Health Travel Authorization.
Children and young people
Visitors aged 12 to 18 years who have received two vaccine doses do not need to take any pre-travel COVID-19 tests.
Asymptomatic children under the age of 12 years are exempted from PCR or Antigen testing requirements.
If you’re transiting through Seychelles
Transiting is when you pass through one country on the way to your final destination.
International passengers wishing to transit through Seychelles to their destination are required to follow the guidelines on the ‘conditions for entry’ at the Ministry of Health website.
Exemptions
There are no exemptions to the entry requirements for Seychelles.
