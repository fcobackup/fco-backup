Warning
FCDO advises against all travel to parts of Jordan.

This section has safety advice for regions of Jordan. It only covers regions where the Foreign, Commonwealth & Development Office (FCDO) has specific advice.
You should also read FCDO’s overall travel advice and safety and security advice.
Border areas
Take care near borders and if you’re crossing into a neighbouring country. Jordanian army and police units patrol the borders with Syria and Iraq and check traffic.
There may be landmines near borders and military installations. Minefields are usually fenced off and marked, but fences and signs may be in a poor state of repair.
Jordan-Syria border
FCDO advises against all travel to within 3km of the border with Syria. The situation in southern Syria is fragile and instability or terrorist activity could start with little or no notice.
In January, 3 US military personnel were killed and others injured in a drone attack against a US military location on the Jordan-Syria border. The Islamic Resistance of Iraq (IRI), an umbrella grouping of Iranian-aligned militia groups, claimed the attack.    
Jordan-Iraq border
FCDO advises against all travel to the provinces in Iraq bordering Jordan. See Iraq travel advice.
Jordan-Israel border
The land borders between Jordan and Israel are currently closed after a security incident at the King Hussein/Allenby Bridge. Please check with the border officials before you travel for the latest information.
Due to the conflict in Israel and the Occupied Palestinian Territories, several Jordanian organisations hold protests near the border on Fridays. Be particularly cautious in areas close to the border.
