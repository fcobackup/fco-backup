To drive on Slovenian motorways, you must buy and display a ‘vignette’. From February 2022, Slovenia moved to an e-vignette system, replacing the previous ‘sticker’ vignette. The e-vignette is linked to the vehicle registration number plate and enforced via automatic number plate recognition cameras. Weekly, monthly and annual e-vignettes can be purchased online on the DARs website or at DARs points of sale, including petrol stations and post offices. If you are buying an e-vignette online you should only do so via the DARs website. You will be asked to provide your vehicle registration and you will be given proof of purchase which you should retain for future reference. Annual e-vignettes are valid for 365 days from the designated start date. Vehicles over 3.5 tonnes must register for an electronic tolling system. Vehicles must be fitted with winter equipment from 15 November to 15 March. See Road travel
Seek advice on weather and safety conditions before travelling into the mountains. Flash flooding and forest fires are a risk. During winter months, off-piste skiing is highly dangerous due to the risk of avalanches. See Skiing/mountaineering.
If you’re abroad and you need emergency help from the UK government, contact the nearest British embassy, consulate or high commission.
