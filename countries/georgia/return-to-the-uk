There are currently extremely limited commercial options available to return to the UK from Georgia.
All Georgian land borders have been closed indefinitely, other than for freight and the return of Georgian citizens. Regular scheduled passenger flights to or from Georgia have been cancelled until further notice. The government has announced that the country will re-open for international tourism from 1 July
Flights, including via a third country
Until the resumption of scheduled flights, flights are being organised by the Georgian Government in co-ordination with Georgian Airways (Airzena) for the purpose of repatriation of Georgian nationals. Georgian Airways is willing to take departing outward passengers on a commercial basis.
There are currently no confirmed flights from Tbilisi International airport on Georgian Airways listed on the official Ministry of Foreign Affairs facebook account.
If travelling via a third country, you will need to check whether you will be able to get an onward connection to the UK from any of these destinations. You should check travel advice for any country that you will transit on the way back to the UK.
You should contact Georgian Airways direct to make a booking. Contact details: Phone: +995 322 485 511 or +995 322 111 220. Office address:
12 Shota Rustaveli Avenue,
Tbilisi
You should be aware that the Georgian Airways on-line booking system may not accept bookings until 24 hours before departure.
If you live in the UK and are currently visiting Georgia, you’re strongly advised to return now by commercial means. Don’t run the risk of getting stranded.
Travelling to the airport
Although there is no public transport, you can get to Tbilisi airport by private car or taxi as long as the social distancing rules are observed (no more than three people in a single vehicle, including the driver, with passengers sitting in the rear).
You will need to pay for your return travel to the UK. If departure options are available but you cannot afford the travel costs and have exhausted all other options for getting funds, you may be eligible to apply for an emergency loan from the government. This is a last resort option and you would need to repay the loan when you are back in the UK.
For more information, you should contact Corporate Travel Management (CTM). CTM are a commercial partner of the FCO and are authorised to administer such loans on behalf of the FCO.
