Warning
FCDO advises against all travel to Burkina Faso.

This information is for people travelling on a full ‘British citizen’ passport from the UK who choose to travel despite FCDO advice. It is based on the UK government’s understanding of Burkina Faso’s current rules for the most common types of travel.
The authorities in Burkina Faso set and enforce entry rules. If you’re not sure how these requirements apply to you, contact the Embassy of Burkina Faso in Brussels.
Passport validity requirements
Your passport must be valid for the duration of your stay and have 2 blank pages for entry stamps.
Check with your travel provider that your passport and other travel documents meet requirements. Renew your passport if you need to.
You will be denied entry if you do not have a valid travel document or try to use a passport that has been reported lost or stolen.
Visa requirements
You must have a visa to enter Burkina Faso.
Applying for a visa
If you live in the UK, apply for a visa online or through the Embassy of Burkina Faso in Brussels. You cannot get a visa for Burkina Faso in the UK.
There are Burkinabe embassies in the West Africa region, including in Accra and Abidjan.
Vaccine requirements
To pass border control in Burkina Faso, you must have a certificate to prove you’ve had a yellow fever vaccination, due to a risk of yellow fever transmission.
For more details about health entry requirements and recommended vaccinations see TravelHealthPro’s Burkina Faso guide.
