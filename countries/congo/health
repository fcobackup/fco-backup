Healthcare in the Republic of Congo  
Medical facilities in the country are limited, particularly in rural areas. Medical evacuation is likely to be necessary for all but the most basic treatments. If you become ill while in the Republic of Congo or straight after leaving the country, get immediate medical advice.
Make sure you have adequate travel and medical insurance to cover the cost of any medical treatment abroad and repatriation; this should specifically include the very high costs of evacuation by air ambulance.
FCDO has a list of medical providers in the Republic of Congo where some staff will speak English.
