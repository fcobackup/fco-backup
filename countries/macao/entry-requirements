During the COVID-19 pandemic, different entry requirements are being applied in Macao. For up-to-date advice on entry requirements and restrictions, please visit the Macao SAR Government webpage.
Travellers who arrive from Hong Kong, Taiwan or foreign countries must provide a negative nucleic acid test result for COVID-19 performed within the past 72 hours. Proof of a negative test result can be presented in the form of a certificate or can be submitted into the Macao Health Code System. You may still enter Macao if you can provide two proofs of positive nucleic test result with CT value of 35 or higher. The test must be performed at least 24 hours apart but not more than 72 hours apart and with the last test performed within the past 72 hours.
Travellers who arrive from Mainland China must hold a certificate of a negative nucleic acid test result for COVID-19 performed within the past 72 hours.
Travellers are required to undergo 5 days of quarantine at home or other self-arranged accommodation on arrival in Macao. Travellers will be restricted from travel out of Macao to Mainland China for an additional 3 days i.e. until midnight on the ninth day after the date of entry.
Testing / screening on arrival
Macao has introduced a three-colour QR health code system, which is used for health declaration needed at border checkpoints and for entering certain venues, including but not limited to government offices, medical facilities and schools.
Travellers who arrive from Hong Kong, Taiwan and foreign countries will have to undergo a PCR test at the border checkpoints. During your 5 day quarantine, you will need to conduct daily rapid antigen tests and upload the result to the Macao Health Code. On the third day, your Macao Health Code will turn yellow, and an appointment for nucleic acid testing at the community testing centre will need to be booked for the same day or your code will turn red. You will be given a green health code upon completion of quarantine and if all tests are negative.
If any nucleic acid test or rapid antigen test after arrival is positive, your Macao Health Code will turn red. Please consult Macao SAR Government guidelines on quarantine for people infected with Covid-19.

Check your passport and travel documents before you travel
Passport validity
Your passport should be valid for a minimum period of one month from the date of entry into Macao. If you are staying longer than one month your passport must be valid for the duration of your visit.
Visas
Although Macao is now part of the People’s Republic of China, it remains a Special Administrative Region with its own immigration controls. You can stay in Macao for up to 6 months without a visa. If you intend to work in Macao you must get a visa before arrival. Contact the Macao Immigration Department.
Visas for mainland China
If you intend to travel to mainland China via Macao using a British passport you must get a Chinese visa before arrival at the border. Failure to do so could result in a fine and possible detention by the mainland Chinese authorities. If you’re entering Macao via mainland China and leaving again via the mainland you’ll need to have a double or multiple entry visa to re-enter mainland China.
There are reports of greater scrutiny from mainland authorities at border crossings into Macao at this time, including checks on travellers’ electronic devices.
UK Emergency Travel Documents
UK Emergency Travel Documents (ETDs) are accepted for entry, airside transit and exit from Macao.
