Be prepared for your plans to change
No travel is risk-free during COVID-19. Countries may further restrict travel or bring in new rules at short notice, for example due to a new COVID-19 variant. Check with your travel company or airline for any transport and/or rule changes that may delay your journey home.
If you test positive for COVID-19, you may need to stay where you are until you test negative. You may also need to seek treatment there.
Plan ahead and make sure you:
can access money
understand what your insurance will cover, including COVID testing and treatment
can make arrangements to extend your stay and be away for longer than planned
Finance
For information on financial support you can access whilst abroad, visit our financial assistance guidance.
