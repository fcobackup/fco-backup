The Gambia remains primarily a cash-based economy. Not all hotels will accept travellers cheques. Check with your tour operator or hotel before travelling. An increasing number of hotels and restaurants will accept Visa debit cards but very few will accept credit cards. Mastercard is generally not accepted. There are several ATMs in the tourist area of Senegambia and in other locations, but ATMs can be unreliable.
