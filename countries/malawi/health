Before you travel check that:
your destination can provide the healthcare you may need
you have appropriate travel insurance for local treatment or unexpected medical evacuation
This is particularly important if you have a health condition or are pregnant.
Emergency medical number
Call 998 and ask for an ambulance.
Emergency numbers are unreliable in Malawi.
There may be other numbers for the areas you visit – ask your hotel or the local police.
Contact your insurance company promptly if you’re referred to a medical facility for treatment.
Vaccinations and health risks  
At least 8 weeks before your trip check:

Read best practice when travelling with medicines on TravelHealthPro.
The NHS has information on whether you can take your medicine abroad.
Healthcare facilities in Malawi
General medical facilities throughout Malawi are unable to provide the same standard of healthcare as in the UK. Facilities in rural areas are basic and emergency services are limited. You should carry basic medical supplies. Many medical facilities expect up-front payment. Make sure you have adequate travel health insurance and accessible funds to cover the cost of any medical treatment abroad, medical evacuation and repatriation.
