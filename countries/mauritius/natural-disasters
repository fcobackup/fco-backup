Tropical cyclones
The cyclone season in Mauritius normally runs from November to May. On 17 March, the Mauritian authorities lifted the Class II cyclone warning for the island of Mauritius, but a Class II warning remains in place for Rodrigues. You are advised to monitor and follow the advice of the Mauritian Meteorological Services.
Cyclones can cause extensive damage to property. There is a well-structured system of phased warnings. You should follow advice issued by the local authorities. During a cyclone you are not allowed to leave your accommodation and car insurance policies often cease to be valid.
See our Tropical cyclones page for advice about how to prepare effectively and what to do if you’re likely to be affected by a tropical cyclone.
Landslides
Some areas are prone to landslides, especially during cyclones and torrential rains. Mauritius Meteorological Services distribute 5-stage landside warnings and local authorities may organise evacuations of threatened areas if necessary.
