This page has information on travelling to Tunisia.
This page reflects the UK government’s understanding of current rules for people travelling on a full ‘British Citizen’ passport from the UK, for the most common types of travel.
The authorities in Tunisia set and enforce entry rules. If you’re unsure how Tunisia’s entry requirements apply to you, contact its UK embassy, high commission or consulate
All travellers
On arrival in Tunisia, you may be asked to share your contact details and travel information with the authorities.
Evidence of a hotel reservation is required to enter the country, and a small number of visitors have been denied entry into Tunisia, or delayed, for not being able to provide sufficient evidence of accommodation. This policy is not applied uniformly, and in most cases, if asked, an explanation of alternative accommodation arrangements will be accepted.
Some British nationals of South Asian descent have been delayed, temporarily detained, or denied entry into the country by Tunisian immigration authorities at airports. This can cause distress and inconvenience. The British Embassy has raised this issue with Tunisian authorities.
Entry to Tunisia is decided by Tunisian authorities, and the British Embassy cannot override decisions to refuse entry. However, if you have been subject to the above practices and wish to report it to us, contact the Consular team at British Embassy Tunis on +216 71 108 700.
Check your passport and travel documents before you travel
Passport validity
If you are visiting Tunisia, your passport should be valid for the full duration of your stay. You don’t need any additional period of validity beyond this.

For stays longer than 90 days, you will need a visa. You should contact the Tunisian Embassy in London for information on how to apply,
If you stay in Tunisia for longer than the authorised period, you will have to pay a fine. This rule may not apply if you are vulnerable or if circumstances oblige you to remain in the country.
