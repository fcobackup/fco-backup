The Egyptian authorities have announced that international flights will be permitted to and from Egyptian airports from 1 July. Some airlines are imposing special requirements, such as the wearing of face masks. You should check with your airline before you travel.
You will need to pay for your return travel to the UK. If departure options are available but you cannot afford the travel costs and have exhausted all other options for getting funds, you may be eligible to apply for an emergency loan from the government. This is a last resort option and you would need to repay the loan when you are back in the UK. For more information, you should contact Corporate Travel Management (CTM). CTM are a commercial partner of the FCO and are authorised to administer such loans on behalf of the FCO.
