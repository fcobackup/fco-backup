Public spaces and services
Taiwan’s Central Epidemic Command Center (CECC) has been updating its guidance on epidemic prevention measures on a continual basis. In line with the CECC’s general guidelines, the Taiwanese authorities have advised that further localised epidemic prevention measures may be introduced in certain cities or counties depending on the COVID-19 situation in each location.
For the month of December, the following measures are now in place:
Starting from 1 December, wearing a face mask will no longer be mandatory outdoors. Nevertheless, people are still required to wear face masks when taking public transport, and onboard aircraft or vessels. The indoor mask mandate will remain in place, with the new exceptions of when exercising, singing, driving, giving a speech or lectures, taking photos and visiting hot springs and saunas.
Travel in Taiwan
Passengers arriving in Taiwan from overseas are now permitted to take public transportation from the airport.
If you suspect that you may have contracted COVID-19, or have experienced any suspected COVID-19 symptoms in the 14 days before your arrival in Taiwan, you should not take public transportation and instead contact airport staff for immediate medical assistance.
Taxis and public transport systems are operating normally in Taiwan. The wearing of face masks is mandatory on all public transport. If you use public transport and are not wearing a face mask, you may be fined up to NT$15,000.
You should refer to the Taiwan Centers for Diseases Control website or contact their helpline on 1922 for further information on the epidemic prevention measures in your area.
Healthcare in Taiwan
If you are in Taiwan and believe you may have been exposed to or may have contracted coronavirus, your first point of contact should be the Taiwan Centers for Disease Control (CDC) helpline which is 1922. If you are unable to speak to anyone at the CDC you can telephone the British Office, Taipei for support.
Quarantine requirements for COVID-19 cases contracted in Taiwan
Individuals who present asymptomatic or mild COVID-19 symptoms are permitted to undergo their mandatory period of quarantine at their residential address (i.e. home address). Individuals with moderate or severe symptoms will be admitted directly to an enhanced hotel/centralised quarantine centre or hospital for treatment. The length of your quarantine period will depend on the seriousness of your COVID-19 infection.
You will not be required to undergo further COVID-19 tests during your quarantine period unless the local authorities have instructed you to do so separately. Starting from 14 November, you can end your mandatory quarantine after 5 days providing that your health condition has improved. After the completion of mandatory quarantine, you are still required to undergo seven days of self-health monitoring unless you test negative at any point starting from the fifth day of quarantine.
If you choose to quarantine at your residential address, monitor your symptoms closely throughout your quarantine period and contact 119 or your local health department if you need medical assistance.
Some hospitals in Taiwan offer a telemedicine service where confirmed COVID-19 cases can schedule a virtual appointment with a doctor. Further information regarding this service can be found on the Taiwan Centers for Disease Control website.
You should refer to the Taiwan Centers for Disease Control (CDC) or contact their helpline on 1922 for further information.
