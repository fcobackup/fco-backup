Read what you can and cannot do

This page gives you guidance on how to stay safely in Bangladesh as a visitor, if you are unable to return to the UK.
Everyone should comply with the measures put in place in Bangladesh to limit the spread of coronavirus (COVID-19).
Moving around in Bangladesh
For information on entering Bangladesh, see Entry Requirements
Curfew
From 10 April the Government has asked people to stay at home from 6 pm until 6 am. Outside these hours the Government has instructed that people should only leave their homes for emergencies. Anyone not complying with this request risks legal action.
Transport
Public transport has been suspended until 30 May due to Government restrictions, and all non-essential travel is discouraged.
The Civil Aviation Authority of Bangladesh (CAAB) has extended the temporary suspension of all commercial domestic flights until 30 May. These restrictions could be extended further at short notice.
Bangladesh authorities have also suspended train services to and from India until further notice.
Businesses
The Government of Bangladesh have extended the closure of all government and non-essential businesses across Bangladesh until 30 May.
Banking services are limited and all shops are closed apart from pharmacies, food markets and other basic necessities. Emergency services including hospitals remain open. Local authorities may lockdown buildings, streets and areas in order to control the spread of coronavirus.
Visas
Bangladesh authorities have suspended issuing visas on arrival. Foreign nationals currently in Bangladesh with valid visas have the option of extending their visas by three months.
Accommodation
You should find accommodation that’s suitable for your needs. Given that many restrictions remain in place and continue to be introduced, moving within Bangladesh may become more difficult. Unless you have an urgent reason to travel within Bangladesh, you may have to stay where you are while the flight suspension and lockdowns remain in place.
Health
If you are running out of medication and need to get more, you should visit the nearest pharmacy or ask for assistance from family/friends or your accommodation provider. If the same medication you’re on is not available, consult a local doctor for a Bangladeshi alternative or go to the nearest hospital.
You should carry any medical papers or prescriptions and be prepared to answer questions if stopped by law enforcement authorities.
In case of any emergency, you can dial the Bangladesh National Emergency Hotline - 999 from your mobile/telephone for any assistance whilst in Bangladesh.

Finance
There is a range of financial support from the government that you can access while you are unable to return due to coronavirus restrictions.
If you’re in Bangladesh, and have exhausted all other options to cover essential living costs while you wait to return home, you could apply for an emergency loan for your living costs from the UK government. You can only apply if you normally live in the UK and you cannot return home. This last-resort option is for those most in need, and you would need to repay the loan when you are back in the UK. Apply for an emergency loan.

Help and support
If you need urgent consular assistance, you should contact your local British embassy, high commission or consulate. All telephones numbers are available 24/7.
