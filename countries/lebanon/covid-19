Cases of coronavirus (COVID-19) have been confirmed in Lebanon. The Lebanese authorities have announced a number of measures and restrictions to limit the spread of the virus.
Travel and borders
On 15 March, the Lebanese authorities announced the closure of Lebanon’s borders, including Beirut Rafic Hariri Airport, effective from March 19. The decision will be reviewed on 29 March.
There are some exceptions to the closure, including for diplomats accredited in Lebanon and those working for international organisations. Those with Lebanese nationality, Lebanese residency or who are a member of a family of a Lebanese national should contact their nearest Lebanese Embassy.
Public measures
The Lebanese authorities have also announced a lock-down in Lebanon. This will be reviewed on 29 March. This means that:
Individuals must remain at home. Public and private gatherings are banned
Public departments, municipalities, unions, universities, public and private schools, and nurseries are closed, with the exception of core institutions, including security agencies, hospitals, pharmacies and banks (though ATMs and electronic transfers are functioning)
Private cars containing more than two people may be stopped and all public transport is suspended. There may be difficulties accessing taxis
All private companies and stores are closed, with the exception of bakeries, supermarkets, and haulage companies.
As of 22 March, it is clear the Government of Lebanon is enforcing strictly restrictions on movement, in line with public health measures it has previously introduced. The issuance of fines, and the establishment of roadblocks, is increasingly widespread. We also understand that violators of the Government of Lebanon’s restrictions are liable to be imprisoned for up to three years. You should only leave home in exceptional circumstances – for example going to supermarkets or pharmacies for essential items, or to access medical care. You should comply with all local restrictions introduced by the Lebanese authorities.
Keep up to date with information from your tour operator, transport or accommodation provider on the impact on any existing travel plans. If you need further information about entry requirements, contact the local immigration authorities or the nearest Lebanese embassy.
