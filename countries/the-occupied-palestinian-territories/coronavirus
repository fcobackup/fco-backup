Travel in Israel or the Occupied Palestinian Territories
There are limited public transport services to Tel Aviv Ben Gurion International Airport, and local taxis and minicabs can be arranged. You will need to comply with social distancing and health regulations when travelling to the airport.
You may face delays or restrictions at Israeli controlled checkpoints around the West Bank, including when attempting to leave the West Bank. Foreign nationals who are currently in the West Bank must leave six hours before their scheduled flight and travel direct to Tel Aviv Ben Gurion Airport. If you are part of an organised tour group, you will travel on an Israeli bus which will be escorted by Israeli police direct to the airport. If you are travelling alone, you can take an Israeli taxi to the airport six hours before your flight. No prior coordination with the Israeli authorities is necessary. You will need to show your passport and flight ticket to authorities at the Israeli controlled checkpoint.

This includes requirements when travelling on public transport, in taxis or in private vehicles, requirements to wear a face covering in public and information on localised lockdowns.

If you think you have COVID-19 symptoms, you should call the Ministry of Health hotline on *5400 (when you hear the Hebrew message dial 2, 1, 2). After a short assessment you will be forwarded to a designated Magen David Adom (MDA) unit. MDA will coordinate a testing location with you. Results for foreign nationals will be sent to the nearest Ministry of Health Unit. You should take note of how your name is spelt in Hebrew in the system as this will help with tracking results.
