The information on this page covers the most common types of travel and reflects the UK government’s understanding of the rules currently in place. Unless otherwise stated, this information is for travellers using a full ‘British Citizen’ passport.
The authorities in the country or territory you’re travelling to are responsible for setting and enforcing the rules for entry. If you’re unclear about any aspect of the entry requirements, or you need further reassurance, you’ll need to contact the embassy, high commission or consulate of the country or territory you’re travelling to.
You should also consider checking with your transport provider or travel company to make sure your passport and other travel documents meet their requirements.
Entry rules in response to coronavirus (COVID-19)
Entry to Lithuania
British nationals travelling to Lithuania must complete an online registration form prior to arrival.
Lithuania lifted the ban on flights from the UK on 1 January 2021. Travel may still be disrupted so you should check with your travel operator. Check our advice on things to consider, and be prepared to stay overseas longer than planned.
British nationals travelling to Lithuania from overseas, including from the UK, are required to self-isolate for 10 days. In addition you must provide evidence of a negative COVID-19 PCR or antigen test result, taken no earlier than 48 hours before arrival in Lithuania, or register for a PCR or antigen test within 24 hours of arrival. Test results must be in English, Russian or Lithuanian.
From 00:01 10 March British nationals arriving in Lithuania from overseas must provide evidence of a negative COVID-19 PCR or antigen test results, taken no earlier than 72 hours before your arrival. It will no longer be possible to book the test after you arrive in Lithuania.
Regardless of the initial PCR/antigen test result, you must remain in isolation.
You may shorten your isolation period, by taking an additional PCR test from day 7 of your isolation period. You may leave isolation once you receive a negative result. You must inform the NVSC of your negative result and intention to end isolation early.
There are a small number of exemptions from self-isolation on arrival from affected countries. Please check the Lithuanian National Public Health Centre (NVSC) website for the latest information on exemptions.
The Lithuanian Government recommends that all individuals arriving from overseas refrain from mixing with other people, as much as possible for 14 days after their arrival, regardless of isolation exemptions.
You can register for a PCR test by calling the COVID-19 hotline on +370 37367 963. The hotline is open daily between 8am and 11pm. Tests booked through the hotline are free of charge.
A list of private clinics offering PCR/antigen tests is available on the NVSC website. The tests booked through these clinics will be charged.
You should note that not all testing centres in Lithuania offer results in English. Should you require your results in English, you should request at the point of booking. English language certificates are likely to incur additional charges.
You must not use public transportation to travel to the testing centre. If you do not have access to a private vehicle, you will need to travel to the testing centre by taxi. You are advised to check at the time of booking whether the taxi company is able to take you to a testing centre, as some taxis may not have the precautions in place to provide this service.
Some international travel operators have suspended services to and from Lithuania. You should check with your travel company for the latest information. People arriving in Lithuania by private vehicles or on foot must complete the online registration form within 12 hours of arriving in Lithuania.
On 16 December, Lithuania entered a nationwide lockdown. Movement within Lithuania is restricted, including for those arriving in Lithuania who are not required to self-isolate. You can find more information on the Coronavirus page.
The movement of goods is not restricted.
Quarantine requirements
British nationals travelling to Lithuania from the UK, or other countries designated as affected by new COVID-19 mutations, must not self-isolate with anyone outside their travelling party. You must self-isolate in a separate apartment/house, or in a well-isolated floor of a private house/apartment, with a separate bathroom.
Unaccompanied minors may self-isolate with a parent/guardian who has not travelled with them. However, the parent/guardian will be required to self-isolate for the full 10 day period with the minor.
While in isolation, you must:
not leave your place of isolation without the permission of a healthcare professional;
not go to shops;
not attend face to face public services;
not have guests/visitors;
organise for essential provisions to be delivered by friends, family or delivery services;
consult with a GP by phone/email to arrange extensions to prescriptions; and
call the Emergency Response Centre on 112, or COVID-19 hotline on +370 37367 963, if you develop symptoms of COVID-19. The hotline is open daily between 8am and 11pm.
While in isolation, you may be contacted by Lithuanian health officials.
British nationals travelling to Lithuania from a country that is not designated as affected by a new COVID-19 mutation may take a walk within 1km of their place of isolation, but must not mix with others outside their travelling party. For more information on the restrictions on social contact in Lithuania, see the Coronavirus page.
British nationals needing to temporarily break isolation, who meet one of the requirements set out by the Lithuanian Government, must notify the NVSC in advance. You do not need to inform the NVSC if you are breaking isolation for a COVID-19 PCR test or for emergency medical treatment.
British nationals may leave Lithuania before the end of their isolation period in order to return to the UK/their country of residence. However, you must register your travels plans with the NVSC at least 24 hours before departure.
Neighbouring countries
There may be restrictions in countries neighbouring Lithuania. Please check country-specific FCDO Travel Advice for details and contact the British Embassy if you need assistance.
You should follow the local quarantine measures of the country that you are in.

Regular entry requirements
Visas
The rules for travelling or working in European countries changed on 1 January 2021:
you can travel to countries in the Schengen area for up to 90 days in any 180-day period without a visa. This applies if you travel as a tourist, to visit family or friends, to attend business meetings, cultural or sports events, or for short-term studies or training.
if you are travelling to Lithuania and other Schengen countries without a visa, make sure your whole visit is within the 90-day limit. Visits to Schengen countries within the previous 180 days before you travel count towards your 90 days
to stay longer, to work or study, for business travel or for other reasons, you will need to meet the Lithuanian government’s entry requirements. Check with the Lithuanian Embassy what type of visa and/or work permit you may need
if you stay in Lithuania with a visa or permit, this does not count towards your 90-day visa-free limit
Any time you spent in Lithuania or other Schengen countries before 1 January 2021 does not count towards your 90-day visa-free limit.
At Lithuanian border control, you may need to use separate lanes from EU, EEA and Swiss citizens when queueing. Your passport may be stamped on entry and exit. You may also need to:
show a return or onward ticket
show you have enough money for your stay
There are separate requirements for those who are resident in Lithuania. If you are resident in Lithuania, you should carry proof of residence as well as your valid passport when you travel. For further information on these requirements, see our Living in Lithuania guide.
Passport validity
Check your passport is valid for travel before you book your trip, and renew your passport if you do not have enough time left on it.
You must have at least 6 months left on an adult or child passport to travel to most countries in Europe (not including Ireland).
If you renewed your current passport before the previous one expired, extra months may have been added to its expiry date. Any extra months on your passport over 10 years may not count towards the 6 months needed.
UK Emergency Travel Documents
UK Emergency Travel Documents (ETDs) are accepted for entry, airside transit and exit from Lithuania.
