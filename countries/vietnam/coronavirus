Visas
Vietnamese authorities have shown flexibility in extending visit visas (or visa waivers for people who have been unable to leave Vietnam due to the COVID-19 situation (e.g. because of hospitalisation or being in quarantine), and who have rebooked to leave Vietnam in the immediate future.
The Embassy and Consulate General will be able to assist British nationals who have been directly impacted by COVID-19 problems (e.g. hospitalisation or being in quarantine) if they are returning imminently to the UK. We will not be able to assist with individual visit visa extensions should you wish to stay in Vietnam. We cannot sponsor individual applications or sign NA5 forms (which has the same effect) as this involves legal and financial obligations.
Quarantine and testing
Widespread quarantine requirements are in place for anyone who may have come in to contact with coronavirus. The Vietnamese government has confirmed that it will cover quarantine costs, but foreign nationals will be personally responsible for paying for any coronavirus hospital treatment costs, and hotel costs from periods of self-isolation.
Vietnamese quarantine centres are basic, and most do not meet Public Health England standards.
If you come in to contact with someone who has tested positive for coronavirus you must expect to undergo quarantine in a government centre. It lasts a minimum of 14 days and longer if you test positive at any point. In addition, if you test positive, you will be treated in a Vietnamese hospital, following which you will be expected to undertake a period of self-isolation. You should expect to be tested at least 5 times prior to release, and will be required to produce 3 consecutive negative tests during quarantine and a further two consecutive negative tests during self-isolation.
Once you have completed quarantine and self-isolation you should receive a document specifying this. Please retain this, as you may need to present it customs/airport officials when you leave Vietnam.
Vietnam’s quarantine requirements are mandate by the Vietnamese Ministry of Health. The British Embassy and Consulate General are unable to intervene in having these requirements waived, shortened or changed. Violations carry strict penalties. Should you have serious reservations about undertaking quarantine in Vietnam, if required for health or other reasons, you are strongly advised to return to the UK as soon as possible.
Vietnam is increasingly using community testing as a means to provide assurance that COVID-19 is not being transmitted undetected. Should you be asked to undertake testing, you should comply. Failure to comply can be an offence with significant punishments.
There have been some instances of British nationals being turned away from, or asked to leave, hotels in Vietnam.
You are strongly advised to familiarise yourself with these risks before travelling.
Local measures
On 22 April, Vietnamese authorities announced plans for a phased relaxation of the partial lock down measures. There may be some variation of relaxation of lock down measures between cities and provinces and also within parts of some cities.
The changes will see a gradual lifting of the strict social distancing policies and shops and services will re-open and re-start. However, the basic principles of social distancing will remain in place. Large gatherings are not allowed inside or outside buildings. Festivals, religious and major cultural activities remain suspended or restricted. People are still required to wear masks in public and maintain a distance of 2 metres between individuals in public places. Internal flights are increasing in number but remain significantly below pre-COVID-19 levels.
British nationals should be alert to local variations, take a precautionary approach and be ready to comply with local authorities.
