The Liberian authorities have introduced a number of measures to limit the spread of the virus. This includes screening measures and travel restrictions for visitors, depending on which countries you have been to (including the UK). See Entry Requirements for travel restrictions.
As of 22 March, Liberian authorities have introduced wide-ranging social distancing and preventative measures for 21 days. Security forces will enforce measures. Measures include mandatory hand washing with soap and clean water at all premises, limits on gatherings and numbers of persons allowed in public premises at any one time. You should adhere to all rules and seek information from local authorities. Details could change and further restrictions be imposed.
Liberian authorities also discourage travel within and outside Montserrado and Margibi counties and have advised community members to report those showing coronavirus symptoms (coughing, fever, and difficulty breathing) by calling 4455.
There is a high risk for British nationals of being put into 14 days of quarantine, either on arrival or during your trip to Liberia. Liberian quarantine centres are basic, and not guaranteed to meet Public Health England standards. You are at risk of being put into quarantine or instructed to self-isolate for 14 days even after you have arrived in Liberia, if you either develop symptoms (fever, cough or respiratory illness), or it is suspected you have been in contact with some who has tested positive for coronavirus. You are strongly advised to familiarise yourself with these risks before travelling.
All travellers arriving in Liberia will be screened for the coronavirus. On arrival at Roberts International Airport or other entry points, staff will check your temperature and you must wash your hands with soap and water. You may be taken to quarantine. See Entry Requirements
Hand washing is also required before entering any government buildings, as well as many offices and local businesses. Some may also require temperature checks.
Further information on coronavirus, including advice on preparing for foreign travel and helping reduce the spread of the virus, is available from Public Health England and on the TravelHealthPro website.
