Restrictions in response to coronavirus
The Bahamian authorities have introduced new measures in relation to coronavirus. See Staying during coronavirus.
If you’re a British national ordinarily resident in The Bahamas but unable to return due to the travel restrictions you should refer to the Ministry of Foreign Affairs for further information on repatriation.
The Bahamas have closed all airports and ports to incoming flights and vessels (including domestic inter-island travel). Outbound flights are allowed and are operating to the USA but are severely disrupted. No direct commercial flights to Europe have been possible since 22 March due to previously announced restrictions and British Airways are suspending services until 2 July.
Several other airlines and hotels have announced they will not operate until the restrictions are relaxed. Commercial international flight departures are severely limited and future flights are not guaranteed. These restrictions also extend to maritime traffic; private vessels; and cruise ships which are not allowed to disembark passengers or crew. They will also not be allowed to restock or refuel during weekend lock down periods, see Return to the UK
Travellers should contact their airlines, travel agents and tour operators. For information on how to return to the UK from The Bahamas, see Return to the UK.
Visas
British nationals visiting are usually allowed entry into the Bahamas for up to 21 days. This can be extended up to a maximum of 8 months by applying to the Department of Immigration in Nassau. Penalties for overstaying include fines and detention pending deportation.
If you require a visitor visa, the Ministry of Foreign Affairs has an electronic visa application process. The official website is: https://mofa.gov.bs/obtaining-official-documents/visitors-visa/. Please email mofaconsular@bahamas.gov.bs for more information on visa processing fees and turnaround times.
For all other types of travel, seek advice from The Bahamian High Commission in London.
