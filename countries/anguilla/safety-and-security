Crime
Crime levels are low. However, you should take sensible precautions such as:
locking doors and windows at night and securing your car when you leave it.
avoid isolated areas, including beaches after dark.
don’t carry large amounts of cash or jewellery.
valuables and travel documents should be left, where possible, in safety deposit boxes and hotel safes.
don’t offer resistance if an armed robbery is attempted.
Road travel
There is no public transport except taxis, but car rental is widely available. You will need to bring your driving licence if you plan to rent a car and obtain a local driving licence from the car rental company at a cost of US $25 (which is valid for 3 months), and car hire costs approximately US$50 per day. Most rental cars are automatic. If you want a manual one, it’s best to order in advance. Driving is on the left, the same as in the UK. Take care when overtaking as most vehicles are left hand drive.  Observe speed limits and do not drink and drive.

Emergency assistance
As Anguilla is a British Overseas Territory there’s no British diplomatic or consular representation. The local authorities deal with all requests for emergency assistance.
Following the impact of the 2017 hurricane, the UK government continues to provide assistance to infrastructure redevelopment, but this won’t impact visitors to the island, which is open for business with levels of security at pre hurricane norms.
In an emergency, dial 911 for a local emergency response.
