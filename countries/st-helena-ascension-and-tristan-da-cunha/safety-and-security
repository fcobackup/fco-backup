Local travel
St Helena
Many roads on St Helena are single lanes. Speed limits are signed across the island but drivers are unlikely to travel at speeds in excess of 30 miles an hour or above third gear. Vehicles travelling downhill must give way to those travelling uphill. Driving is on the left. Drink drive laws are strictly applied with a limit of 50 micrograms of alcohol per 100ml of breath. Public transport on St Helena is very limited but hire cars are available.
UK driving licences are valid on St Helena for three months after which a local (St Helena) licence must be obtained. Licences can be purchased from the Post Office in Jamestown and are valid for one year.
Ascension
There is a public minibus service which operates on Friday and Saturday nights only. There is no other public transport on Ascension Island, but bus tours with a driver can be arranged. There are a limited number of hire cars.
The speed limit is 20mph in Georgetown and Two Boats Village, and when passing the US Base. It’s either 30mph or 40 mph elsewhere. If you’re expecting to stay for more than 3 months, you must apply for an Ascension Island Driving Licence from the Post Office.
Wild sheep, donkeys and land crabs (protected species) can gather on the roads, especially during wet weather.
There are a number of sites which are out of bounds. On arrival to Ascension visitors are briefed where they’re permitted to visit but if you’re unsure it’s always worth checking with either the police station, harbour authorities or Ascension Island Government personnel first.
Tristan da Cunha
Visitors are not allowed to hike up the Base or to Marys Peak unless accompanied by a Tristan guide. Trips to areas away from the main settlement on Tristan, including to Nightingale and Inaccessible Islands, must be made with a guide for safety reasons. A fee is payable and an indemnity declaration must be signed. You need prior approval from the Administrator to visit Gough Island, which is 200 miles away by sea to the south. Permission to land will rarely be granted as Gough is a World Heritage Site. If you intend to hill walk, fish or undertake any pursuit away from the Settlement, seek the advice of a local guide and let others know where you are going and when you intend to return.
Getting to St Helena, Ascension and Tristan da Cunha
St Helena
St Helena airport usually offers weekly flights via Windhoek or Walvis Bay to Johannesburg provided by SA Airlink. These have been temporarily suspended due to restrictions on flights introduced by the South African authorities to limit the spread of Coronavirus.
If you need to travel to St Helena please contact Christina Plato in the St Helena Tourist Office on Tel: +290 22158 or email: christina.plato@tourism.co.sh and register your details.
The Tourist Office is identifying people who need to travel to/from St Helena so that they can be contacted once flight arrangements are confirmed.
Ascension
Due to runway repairs required to the Ascension Island runway, the Ministry of Defence has temporarily rerouted the South Atlantic Airbridge via an alternative location. Monthly flights to Ascension from South Africa via St Helena are suspended. You should contact your travel agent, local tour booking office, or Ascension Island employer for the latest up-to-date information.
There is limited accommodation available to tourists on Ascension Island.
Tristan da Cunha
Travel to the Island is by sea only. Fishing vessels from Cape Town visit the Island nine times a year, and there is one annual visit made by a South African research vessel in September/October. Due to the limited harbour facilities, vessels have to anchor offshore and passengers are ferried by smaller local boats. This can be hazardous in bad weather. Approaching bad weather can mean that you have to return to your ship ahead of schedule. Fishing requirements may mean that ships need to depart Tristan ahead of or behind schedule. Airline bookings should be flexible.
Consular assistance
Ascension
The Ascension Island Police Detachment handles all consular protection services. There is no facility for issuing replacement UK passports or UK entry visas. You can however obtain an emergency passport from the Ascension Island Police.
Tristan da Cunha
If you need consular assistance, contact the local police (telephone 2010). If you need a replacement or emergency passport, contact the Administrator’s office at the Government offices in the Settlement.
