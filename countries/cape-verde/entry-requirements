The information on this page covers the most common types of travel and reflects the UK government’s understanding of the rules currently in place. Unless otherwise stated, this information is for travellers using a full ‘British Citizen’ passport.
The authorities in the country or territory you’re travelling to are responsible for setting and enforcing the rules for entry. If you’re unclear about any aspect of the entry requirements, or you need further reassurance, you’ll need to contact the embassy, high commission or consulate of the country or territory you’re travelling to.
You should also consider checking with your transport provider or travel company to make sure your passport and other travel documents meet their requirements.
Visas
From 1 January 2019, if you have a British Citizen passport you can enter Cape Verde as a visitor for stays of up to 90 days without a visa.
In place of a visa, before travelling you should register with the Cape Verde authorities on the EASE website and, if arriving by air, pay a new Airport Security Tax (TSA) of 3,400 escudos (approximately £30). This does not apply to visitors under 2 years of age or those who are normally resident in Cape Verde. Check with your tour operator or airline what arrangements are in place for your booking, as some tour operators and airlines may complete this on your behalf and have specific registration requirements. You can find more information on the pre-registration process and TSA in this information leaflet.
If you’re travelling on a different type of British passport, are travelling for a purpose other than tourism, or intending to stay longer than 90 days, you should check entry requirements with the nearest Cape Verde Embassy:
