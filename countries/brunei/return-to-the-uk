Coronavirus guidance is being updated.
Read the Prime Minister’s statement for the latest information.

Flights
Royal Brunei have scheduled a special flight to the UK from Brunei on Friday 19 June 2020. You should visit to Royal Brunei Airlines website for full details, flight schedule and online booking.
There are limited commercial options to return to the UK from Brunei. Royal Brunei Airlines have resumed flights to a limited number of countries where onward travel to London may be possible.
Before booking seats on any flights, you should check requirements with your airline and consult travel advice for any entry or transit restrictions in place for countries on your flight route. You should also check with your airline regularly ahead of your flights.
Brunei has introduced an exit travel ban, including for permanent residents, and expatriate workers (green identity card holders), and their dependents. Exceptions will be considered by the Prime Minister’s Office on a case by case basis, through email applications to travelapplication@jpm.gov.bn giving 14 days’ notice of the intention to travel, and setting out reasons why they need to leave the country. Full details are available on the Prime Minister’s Office website.
You will need to pay for your return travel to the UK. If departure options are available but you cannot afford the travel costs and have exhausted all other options for getting funds, you may be eligible to apply for an emergency loan from the government. This is a last resort option and you would need to repay the loan when you are back in the UK. For more information, you should contact Corporate Travel Management (CTM). CTM are a commercial partner of the FCO and are authorised to administer such loans on behalf of the FCO.
