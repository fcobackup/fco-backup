Terrorism in Georgia
Terrorist attacks in Georgia can’t be ruled out. Attacks could happen anywhere and affect western interests and places visited by foreigners, such as tourist sites and cultural events.
Political situation
The political situation in Georgia is generally calm.
Demonstrations
Demonstrations and rallies can occur, particularly:
around Rustaveli Avenue in Tbilisi
in large towns
Demonstrations are usually policed, but tensions can escalate without warning. You should:
check local media
avoid large gatherings and demonstrations
follow the advice of local authorities
Crime
Crime levels are low. You should:
take sensible precautious to avoid pick-pocketing, particularly in crowded places
not leave valuables unattended
stay aware of your surroundings
keep your mobile phone charged and with you at all times
Georgian law protects everyone’s human rights and equality, but ethnic minorities and LGBT+ people may face discrimination. Harassment and assault based on race and sexuality do take place.
If someone attempts to assault you or you feel threatened, call the emergency number 112 and ask for the police.
Laws and cultural differences
Personal ID
You’re advised to carry a copy of your passport at all times. Keep the original in a safe place.
Cultural differences
Tbilisi is a cosmopolitan city. There can be more conservative attitudes in rural areas. When travelling outside cities, be aware of cultural sensitivities around modest dress (particularly in places of worship) and open displays of affection.
Money
Prices may be quoted in US dollars and euros, but goods and services must be paid for in local currency (lari).
Travellers’ cheques are rarely accepted. Outside major towns, you may not find ATMs or be able to use credit and debit cards. Take enough cash in lari if travelling to rural or remote areas.
Illegal drugs and prison sentences
If you use illegal drugs of any kind, you can get heavy fines or long prison terms. Smuggling even very small amounts of drugs carries a prison term of 5 to 25 years and heavy fines.
Using cameras
Do not photograph sensitive sites like military bases and power installations.
Be aware of cultural sensitivities when photographing churches and other religious sites.
Some visitors have been stopped from photographing the Presidential Palace in Tbilisi.
Check for any signs telling you not to take photographs. Always seek permission if in doubt.
LGBT+ travellers
Homosexuality is legal in Georgia, and there are anti-discrimination laws, but same-sex relationships are still not widely accepted.
Showing affection in public may result in discrimination or harassment. Homophobic harassment and assault take place.
Pride marches in 2019 and 2021 were cancelled because the police did not guarantee security. In 2023, a Pride event was cancelled after a violent protest.
Read more advice for LGBT+ travellers.
Disabled travellers
Accessibility standards in Georgia are below UK standards. Very few public or private facilities are accessible.
Most public transport does not accommodate disabled travellers.
There are few pavements outside of main cities and pavements are generally uneven.
Read our general advice for disabled travellers.
Surrogacy
The Georgian government has proposed banning surrogacy for foreign couples from January 2024, with a decision by parliament due in the near future. Keep up to date by signing up to our Georgia travel advice.
If you’re visiting Georgia to arrange an international surrogacy, consider the risks and challenges involved. Surrogacy is a complex, lengthy process. You should:
make sure you’re aware of the facts and well-prepared before starting the process
get specialist legal advice on Georgian and UK laws before making any arrangements
read FCDO and Home Office guidance on surrogacy overseas
research clinics and hospitals thoroughly to make sure they are safe and reputable
The British Embassy cannot get involved in surrogacy arrangements or recommend hospitals or clinics.
Commissioning a surrogacy will not automatically mean that the child holds British citizenship. To bring your child born through surrogacy from Georgia to the UK, you must apply for a full British passport. You need a Georgian birth certificate for this. Check the Public Service Hall and Service Development Agency websites and research the rules for leaving the country with children (some legal details are in Georgian only). You can stay visa-free in Georgia for a continuous period of up to one year. The Ministry of Foreign Affairs of Georgia has more information.
Trade with South Ossetia and Abkhazia
Anyone trading with Abkhazia and South Ossetia needs a licence issued by the Georgia government. This includes buying and selling property and most financial transactions. Anyone trading without a licence may face penalties under Georgian civil and criminal law.
Outdoor activities and adventure tourism
Make sure your travel insurance covers your activities.
If you get into trouble during hiking, skiing, adventure travel or extreme sports, the emergency response may be limited.
Off-piste skiing is very dangerous. It can be difficult to get accurate information on mountain conditions, including avalanche risks. Read our information on staying safe during skiing and winter sports.
If you’re trekking, mountaineering, climbing, off-piste skiing or doing other extreme sports, consider going with specialist guides. Many insurance policies will not cover damage to rental equipment or skiing off-piste without a guide.
Be aware that safety standards in Georgia may not be as high as those in the UK. For example, several people were injured when a ski lift at Gudauri malfunctioned in 2018 and a tourist helicopter crashed near Stepantsminda (Kazbegi) in 2019.
If you plan to hike close to the administrative boundary lines, consider hiring a professional guide.
Transport risks
Take usual precautions after dark in unfamiliar areas.
Street lighting away from main roads can be poor and pavements uneven. There may be occasional short power cuts – consider carrying a torch.
Taxis
Taxi provision and safety has improved significantly. To stay safe using taxis:
do not flag taxis in the street
try to pre-book taxis through an app
check the taxi has working seatbelts
Road travel
If you’re planning to drive in Georgia, see information on driving abroad and read the RAC Georgia guide.
You can drive in Georgia with a UK driving licence for up to one year (from when you last entered Georgia). To drive for longer, you need a 1949 or 1968 international driving permit (IDP) or Georgian driving licence. If you’re hiring a car, check the rules with the car hire company before you travel. They may require you to have an IDP.
You cannot buy an IDP outside the UK, so get one before you travel. You can buy an IDP in person from some UK post offices – find your nearest post office branch that offers this service.
Drink driving punishments can be severe. Georgia has a lower blood alcohol content limit than the UK, so avoid alcohol if driving.
Driving conditions
Take care when driving, especially at night. Be aware that:
roads outside city centres are often badly lit and poor quality
stray livestock can be a hazard
road markings and the right of way can be confusing
many cars are poorly maintained
driving can be erratic
heavy rain, flooding and snow at higher altitudes can affect roads and bridges making travel difficult or impossible (particularly in remote areas)
landslides are common
If you’re travelling outside Tbilisi, particularly in remote areas, make sure your vehicle is equipped and check weather conditions locally.
Rail travel
Take usual precautions with your personal safety and belongings. Compartments on sleeper trains usually have locks.
There is currently no train service between Azerbaijan and Georgia.
Extreme weather and natural disasters
There are frequent small earthquakes in Georgia. The most recent significant earthquake took place in 2022 – an earthquake measuring 6.2 struck 104km south-west of Tbilisi. Read the US Federal Emergency Management Agency advice on what to do before, during and after an earthquake.
Lightning and wildfires are a risk in summer, particularly in the mountains.
