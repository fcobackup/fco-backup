There was a suicide bombing targeting a police patrol near the US embassy in Tunis on Friday 6 March. If you’re in Tunis, you should remain vigilant and follow the advice of the local security authorities.
A state of emergency is in effect in Tunisia, imposed after a suicide attack on a police bus on 24 November 2015. It’s been extended a number of times, most recently on 31 January 2020 effective through 29 April 2020.
Since the terrorist attack in Sousse in June 2015, which targeted tourists, the UK government has been working closely with the Tunisian authorities to investigate the attack and the wider threat from terrorist groups. The Tunisian government has improved protective security in major cities and tourist resorts.
But terrorists are still very likely to try to carry out attacks in Tunisia, including against UK and Western interests. Security forces remain on a high state of alert in Tunis and other places. You should be vigilant at all times, including around religious sites and festivals. Crowded areas, government installations, transportation networks, businesses with Western interests, and areas where foreign nationals and tourists are known to gather may be at higher risk of attack. You should be particularly vigilant in these areas and follow any specific advice of the local security authorities. In more remote areas of the country, including tourist sites in southern Tunisia, security forces’ response times to an incident may vary. Follow the advice of the Tunisian security authorities and your travel company if you have one. See Terrorism
Demonstrations often occur in Tunisia and the majority are peaceful. However, you should avoid all areas of demonstrations, and exercise caution if in the vicinity of any large gatherings or protests. See Political situation
Following the attack on the coalition base at Taji in Iraq on 11 March, and subsequent US airstrikes, tensions may be raised across the region. There is a possibility of an increased threat against Western interests, including against UK citizens. You should remain vigilant and keep up to date with the latest developments, including via the media and this travel advice.
You can contact the emergency services by calling 197 (police - when in cities and towns), 193 (national guard - when in rural areas or small villages), 190 (ambulance) or 198 (civil protection - for assistance at incidents, such as car accidents, to provide medical assistance and response to fire).
If you’re abroad and you need emergency help from the UK government, contact the nearest British embassy, consulate or high commission. Consular support may be limited in parts of Tunisia.
Take out comprehensive travel and medical insurance before travelling.
