Hurricane Beryl
A major hurricane passed Jamaica in early July.
In its aftermath, power, communications and water supplies have been disrupted. The Ministry of Health and Wellness have warned of the risks of water contamination and of water-borne and mosquito-borne diseases after the heavy rainfall.
While most larger hotels with generator power have remained open and fully functional, some parts of Jamaica still have no or intermittent access to power, water and mobile phone connectivity. This may remain the case for some rural areas for some time. Check the situation with your accommodation provider before travel.
