There are still commercial options to return to the UK from Greece, transiting in other countries.
You will need to pay for your return travel to the UK. If departure options are available but you cannot afford the travel costs and have exhausted all other options for getting funds, you may be eligible to apply for an emergency loan from the government. This is a last resort option and you would need to repay the loan when you are back in the UK. For more information, you should contact Corporate Travel Management (CTM). CTM are a commercial partner of the FCO and are authorised to administer such loans on behalf of the FCO.
Flights
Direct commercial flights between the UK and Greece (in both directions) are currently suspended until 16 May. This suspension may be extended further in future, including at short notice. It is possible to travel indirectly between Greece and the UK (and vice versa). Options include travelling via Paris, Brussels, Zurich and Belgrade, though some itineraries are likely to require an overnight stay between flights or between flights and Eurostar connections. Itineraries departing on weekends, Fridays or Mondays tend to involve shorter times between connecting flights, but schedules continue to change at short notice. You should check travel advice for any country you plan to transit through. You should contact airlines or travel operators directly for more information.
If you’re trying to get back to the UK and need financial help, see the FCO’s guide on financial assistance.
Travelling to the airport
Public transport continues to operate in Greece, though services may be reduced or changed. You should check with operators in advance of travel.
Taxis are permitted to operate, but may carry only one passenger, except for in cases of an adult accompanying children, or a companion accompanying another passenger for medical reasons. Passengers must wear facemasks.
Domestic flights continue to operate within Greece. Travel to the Greek islands is restricted. To purchase a ticket to travel to an island, you will need to provide proof of permanent residence (via a tax certificate) on the island to which you wish to travel. One-way travel from islands to the mainland is not restricted.
Road, rail and ferry travel
Travel between the UK and Greece by road, rail or ferry is likely to be difficult at this time.
Ferry services between Greece and Italy, and Greece and Albania, are currently suspended.
Greece’s borders with neighbouring countries Turkey, Albania and N Macedonia are closed to passenger traffic. Albania, Bulgaria, Italy, North Macedonia, Turkey have also introduced restrictions, including closing land borders and suspending of rail and ferry links. Check FCO Travel Advice pages for details if you are planning to travel via these countries, and speak to your travel operator in case of disruption.
