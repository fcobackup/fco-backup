The Foreign and Commonwealth Office (FCO) advise against all but essential travel to:
the districts of Nangade, Quissanga, Ibo, Macomia, Mocimboa da Praia and Palma in Cabo Delgado province, due to attacks by groups with links to Islamic extremism.
Coastal areas have a risk of tropical cyclones during the rainy season (November to April). Cyclone Kenneth made landfall on Thursday 25 April. Cabo Delgado and Nampula continue to experience rain and flash flooding. Travel to and through the affected region is likely to be extremely difficult for some time. You should monitor local and international weather updates from the World Meteorological Organisation and follow the advice of local authorities.
Tropical Cyclone Idai made landfall at the port city of Beira on Thursday 14 March 2019. The cyclone devastated critical infrastructure in the provinces of Sofala, Zambezia, Manica and Tete, including electricity, communication and road networks. Since then the situation has improved. The extent of the floods is now reducing. The airport is open. Major roads and communication lines have been restored. If you’re travelling to the affected areas, take extra care and follow the advice of the local authorities. There’s an increased risk from malaria and cholera. You should familiarise yourself with the symptoms and follow the advice of the National Travel Health Network and Centre.
Terrorists are very likely to try to carry out attacks in Mozambique. There has been an increasing intensity of attacks in Cabo Delgado since May 2018, with attacks reported in the districts of Palma, Mocimboa da Praia, Macomia, Nangade, Quissanga, Muidumbe, Meluco and Ibo. Insurgents have used machetes and firearms to conduct lethal attacks, as well as burning vehicles and homes. There are reports of an increased security presence in the province, including road blocks, and there are regular clashes between insurgents, armed vigilante groups and Mozambican security forces. If you’re planning to travel to the area, you should check local and social media for updates before you travel and follow the advice of the local authorities. See Terrorism
