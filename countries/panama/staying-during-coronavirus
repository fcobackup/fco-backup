This page gives you guidance on how to stay safely in Panama as a visitor, if you are unable to return to the UK.
Everyone should comply with the measures put in place in Panama to limit the spread of coronavirus (COVID-19).
Moving around in Panama
For information on entering Panama, see Entry Requirements
Panama is currently under a state of emergency, and quarantine measures are in place.
From 1 April 2020, unless you fall under one of the quarantine exemptions, only women are permitted to leave their homes/accommodation on Mondays, Wednesdays and Fridays and only men are permitted to leave their homes/accommodation on Tuesdays, Thursdays and Saturdays.
No one should leave their homes/accommodation on Sundays (although please note that since Easter weekend, Panama has had a total curfew on weekends, including on Saturday).
On those days, you are allowed to leave your homes/accommodation to shop for food and medication during one hour (with a half hour grace period either side) according to the last digit of your passport. You should not leave your accommodation outside of these times unless it is an emergency or you fall under one of the limited exemptions.
Details of the times you can leave your accommodation can be found on the British Embassy Twitter account.
In Panama City, the wearing of masks outside one’s accommodation is compulsory. Elsewhere, members of the public have been urged to wear masks when leaving their accommodation. Some pharmacy and supermarket chains require customers to wear masks.
On 25 March the distribution, sale and consumption of alcoholic drinks was banned for the duration of the national state of emergency. The Panamanian government began relaxing this ban on 8 May, with permission granted initially for domestic personal consumption only. Limits per person are imposed on the sale of alcohol. However, different local authorities across the country are maintaining the total ban.
Transport
Ubers are no longer in circulation for passenger travel. Yellow taxis have a reduced presence, and do not operate on Sundays.
The police and security forces are empowered to enforce restrictions on movements and events due to the current state of emergency. You should follow their instructions.
Business
Commercial businesses have been ordered to close, except for supermarkets, pharmacies, health clinics, fuel stations and other key businesses. Supermarkets can have no more than 50 people inside.
Medical care
On 15 March, Panamanian authorities announced new restrictions on access to medical services for routine care, as well as widespread closures of commercial and leisure establishments. Further restrictions were announced on 20 March.
Due to government measures imposed to contain the spread of the novel coronavirus, routine healthcare – including elective surgeries and consultations with doctors – in both hospitals and other clinics has been restricted to people with chronic illness, children and those who are pregnant.
Health
The authorities have set up a hotline (169) to answer any questions or receive information regarding a suspected case of coronavirus. If you are concerned that you may be unwell as a result of the coronavirus, you should call the national hotline on 169, or use the Panamanian Government’s “R.O.S.A” (virtual clinic) using this link to send a WhatsApp message, and follow their advice.
British nationals who are in Panama will be able to access the Panamanian public healthcare system on the same terms as Panamanians. Coronavirus tests in the public system for those who meet the clinical requirement to be tested will be free of charge.
