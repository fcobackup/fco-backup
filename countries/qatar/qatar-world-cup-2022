The FIFA World Cup will take place in Qatar from 20 November to 18 December 2022.
If you are travelling to attend the World Cup you should sign up for email alerts to the Qatar Travel Advice page, so that you stay up to date on the latest developments. You should also monitor the official Qatar World Cup and FIFA websites for more information.
For further detail about what the FCDO can do to support British nationals abroad, see this guide.
Before you go
Entry requirements
You must apply for a Hayya Card. This is a form of Fan ID, which you will need to be able to enter the country during the tournament period. It will also give you access to free public transport on match days.
You should apply early to avoid delays. At this stage, only match ticket holders can apply. See the Hayya portal website for the latest information.
You will also need to hold a Hayya card to enter Qatar from 1 November 2022 onwards even if you are not intending to attend a World Cup match. This requirement may continue up until 23 January 2023 and applies to all visitors.
If you are planning to travel elsewhere in the region during the tournament, you should check the Travel Advice page for every country you plan to visit or transit through. Entry requirements, and local laws and customs, will likely be different for other countries.
If you are arriving in Qatar before the tournament, or staying on afterwards, different procedures will be in operation. See entry requirements for non-World Cup period information.
Health
Ensure you have appropriate travel insurance, and follow the latest COVID-19 requirements, before travelling to Qatar.
Before travelling to the tournament, you should make sure that you have a travel insurance policy that will cover you for your trip and any planned activities. Emergency medical treatment in Qatar is of a high standard but can be expensive.
See Health for more information, including what to do if you need to bring prescription or over-the-counter medication into Qatar.
See Coronavirus for information about Qatar’s current COVID-19 requirements. Authorities are encouraging anyone travelling to the World Cup to familiarise themselves with these requirements, including on testing, masks and the Ehteraz app.
At present all visitors travelling to Qatar aged 6 and above, regardless of vaccination status, must bring a PCR test certificate with a negative result valid for 48 hours or a Rapid Antigen test certificate valid for 24 hours ahead of the scheduled departure time of the flight to Qatar.
These are liable to change with little warning. Monitor Qatari Ministry of Public Health advice for the latest updates ahead of the World Cup, and stay in contact with your travel provider.
Match tickets
You should check the FIFA website for ticket information and only purchase match tickets from official providers. Match tickets bought through unofficial means may not be valid.
Accommodation
You must arrange your accommodation for your stay before you travel to Qatar.
Booking accommodation for the period of the World Cup will be different to the current situation regardless of whether you are planning to attend a match. Qatar’s World Cup Accommodation Agency website will be the main booking platform, but some alternative options are also available.
If you plan to stay in Qatar for more than 24 hours, you will need to have your accommodation booking validated during your application for the Hayya Card. You will need an approved Hayya Card to enter the country.
If you plan to stay with friends or family in Qatar during the tournament then your host will need to register your accommodation within the Hayya portal website.
If you are an international fan making a match day visit of less than 24 hours you will not need to arrange accommodation. You will still need to apply for a Hayya Card and register your travel details.
When you travel to the tournament
Local laws and customs
Familiarise yourself with, and respect, local laws and customs.
Qatari laws and customs are very different to those in the UK. Be aware of your actions to ensure that they don’t offend, especially if you intend to visit near mosques or religious areas. There may be serious penalties for doing something that might not be illegal in the UK, such as the importation of certain goods. This includes pork products, e-cigarettes/vapes or anything that can be perceived as pornography.
See local laws and customs for more information.
Drugs
Don’t become involved with drugs. You can expect a severe penalty for possession of even residual amounts.
There is zero tolerance for drugs in Qatar. The penalties for the use, trafficking, smuggling and possession of drugs (even residual amounts) are severe. Punishment can include lengthy custodial sentences, heavy fines and deportation.
For information on bringing prescription or over-the-counter medication into Qatar see Health.
Alcohol
Qatari authorities are still finalising the policies relating to the sale and consumption of alcohol during the World Cup. Its availability, and associated laws, will be different to previous tournaments.
Alcohol is currently only available to visitors at licenced hotel restaurants and bars. The legal drinking age in Qatar is 21. It is an offence to drink alcohol or be drunk in a public place. See local laws and customs for more information.
The importation of alcohol into the State of Qatar is illegal. You will not be able to purchase alcohol from duty free in airports to take into Qatar.
LGBT
Homosexuality is illegal in Qatar. Private life in Qatar is largely respected but any intimacy between persons in public can be considered offensive, regardless of gender, sexual orientation or intent.
Host authorities have stated that “everyone is welcome” at the World Cup. They have publicly confirmed that there will be no restrictions on non-married friends or couples (including LGBT) staying in the same room.
See our LGBT information and advice page before you travel.
Travelling around Qatar
The football stadiums which will be used for the World Cup are within a compact area and transport routes will be very busy for the duration of the tournament. Make sure you plan your journey and leave plenty of time, particularly on match days.
A Hayya Card will give you free access to public transport on match days, including bus, metro and tram.
If you’re planning to hire a car or use taxis, see Safety and security for more information. Road discipline is very poor; speeds are high and accidents are common, including those involving pedestrians.
If you are planning to travel elsewhere in the region during the tournament, you should check the Travel Advice page for every country you plan to visit or transit through. Entry requirements, and local laws and customs, will likely be different for other countries.
Details on whether there will be tournament-specific restrictions for entering or leaving Qatar through the land border are yet to be announced.
