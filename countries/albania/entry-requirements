This page has information on travelling to Albania.
This page reflects the UK government’s understanding of current rules for people travelling on a full ‘British Citizen’ passport from the UK, for the most common types of travel.
The authorities in Albania set and enforce entry rules. If you’re unsure how Albania’s entry requirements apply to you, contact its UK embassy, high commission or consulate.
Keep up to date with information from your tour operator, transport or accommodation provider on the impact on any existing travel plans. If you need further information about entry requirements, contact the local immigration authorities or the nearest Albanian Embassy/Consulate. You should also check with your airline or travel company for the latest information.
All travellers
As of 1 May 2022, all COVID-19 related travel requirements have been lifted.
Travellers no longer need to show proof of vaccination against COVID-19 or a negative PCR test in order to enter Albania.
All passengers who are allowed to enter the territory of the Republic of Albania, in addition to complying with international airline standards and protocols, must also adhere to the rules listed below:
only travelling passengers can enter the airport building
passengers must maintain social distancing of 1.5 meters during their entire time in the airport
priority is given to the elderly, people in need and families with children (minors)
for more information, see the Tirana International Airport website.
Transiting Albania if you’re travelling to neighbouring countries
You can transit Albania on your way to another country without showing proof of vaccination against COVID-19 or a negative PCR test.
All land borders are open. Neighbouring countries may have different entry and exit restrictions on their side of the border. Check FCDO travel advice for the countries you plan to visit before travelling.
Regular entry requirements
Visas
British citizens can enter and remain in Albania for a maximum of 90 days in every 6-month period without a visa. The Albanian authorities require anyone staying longer than 90 days to apply at a local police station for a residence permit.
As of 9 September 2021, British citizens who have a valid residence permit in the Republic of Albania can apply to be issued with a Biometric Card for foreign citizens. The design of this card is very similar to the National ID Card issued to Albanian citizens.
Holding this card enables registration on the e-Albania platform, providing access to the services that the platform offers for foreign citizens.
In order to apply you should buy a coupon at the nearest Albanian Post Office and visit the ALEAT office located at the Border and Migration Directorate (the same office which issues residence permits) to submit your application in person.
You can find further information on the Albanian Ministry of Interior website.

Your passport should be valid for a minimum period of 3 months from the date of entry into Albania.
