The economic situation is deteriorating in Sri Lanka with shortages of basic necessities including medicines, fuel and food because of a shortage of hard currency to pay for imports. There may be long queues at grocery stores, gas stations, and pharmacies. Local authorities may impose the rationing of electricity, resulting in power outages.
There have been a number of recent protests. One in Colombo on 31 March resulted in a curfew being temporarily imposed. There are reports that there will be further protests across the island in the next few days. On 1 April the Government of Sri Lanka declared a public emergency. Local restrictions, including curfews could be imposed at short notice. You should be vigilant, avoid any demonstrations or large gatherings, and follow the advice of the local authorities.
Due to a prevalence of COVID-19 cases in the community, there could be changes to flights and airport operations at short notice. Lockdowns could be imposed in affected areas, and travel restrictions may also be imposed at short notice.
