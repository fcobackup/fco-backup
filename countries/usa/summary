A number of unprecedented large-scale wildfires are burning across the West Coast states of the USA. California, Oregon and Washington have been particularly badly hit and currently are under a state of emergency. See the Californian Department of Forestry and Fire Protection website for a detailed fire incident map. Incident maps for Oregon and Washington can be found on the Northwest Interagency Coordination Centre website. Fires are also burning in Montana, Idaho and Alaska on a smaller scale. Those in affected areas should monitor local media and weather reports and follow the advice of local authorities, including any evacuation orders and guidance to remain indoors due to poor air quality.
