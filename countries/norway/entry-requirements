This page reflects the UK government’s understanding of current rules for people travelling on a full ‘British Citizen’ passport, for the most common types of travel.
The authorities in Norway set and enforce entry rules. For further information contact the embassy, high commission or consulate of the country or territory you’re travelling to. You should also consider checking with your transport provider or travel company to make sure your passport and other travel documents meet their requirements.
If you are travelling to Norway for work, read the guidance on visas and permits as the rules have changed since 1 January 2021.
Entry rules in response to coronavirus
Your ability to enter Norway will depend on your personal circumstances.
If you are planning a trip to Norway, check the latest travel rules before you travel. You should also check with your airlines for any additional travel requirements.
New entry requirements from 26 November 2021
From 26 November, all travellers to Norway (regardless of departure country) will need to complete an online registration form, within 72 hours prior to arrival. Travellers under the age of 16 are exempt.
Demonstrating your COVID-19 status
Norway will accept the UK’s proof of COVID-19 recovery and vaccination record that contains a verifiable QR code at the border. Scottish travellers must have the latest version of the Scottish certification, which includes the verifiable QR code. If you are travelling with a printed PDF proof of vaccination status, it must date from 1 November to ensure that the certificate can be scanned successfully. Your NHS appointment card from vaccination centres is not designed to be used as proof of vaccination and should not be used to demonstrate your vaccine status.
For those with QR coded UK NHS Covid Pass
Norway has reduced entry restrictions for those who have a UK NHS COVID Pass that contain a verifiable QR code or for those who can prove they have recovered from COVID-19 during the past six months.
Travellers with a valid QR coded UK NHS COVID Pass will not be required to provide evidence of a negative test on arrival, be tested at the border or quarantine after arrival. You will need to register in advance from 26 November.
For those without a QR coded UK NHS COVID Pass
From 26 November, travellers from the UK without a valid QR coded UK NHS COVID Pass are required to complete the online registration form within 72 hours prior to arrival and have proof of a negative COVID-19 test taken less than 24 hours before arrival. This will apply regardless of which country the person has travelled from, but will not apply to travellers under the age of 18.
In addition, travellers without a valid QR coded NHS COVID Pass will be subject to testing on arrival in Norway. This test can be taken at a test centre at the border. If it is not possible to take the test at the border, you will have 24 hours from your arrival to take a test at a local test centre in the municipality you are staying in.
Travellers from a dark red country (which currently includes the UK), without a valid QR coded UK COVID Pass are required to self-quarantine in a suitable location e.g. hotel or home, for 10 days. If no suitable location is available, you will be required to stay at a quarantine hotel. A negative PCR test taken no earlier than three days after entry will allow you to end quarantine early. There are no quarantine requirements for children under 18.
For guidance on what the Norwegian authorities regard as a ‘suitable location’ and how to quarantine, see the FHI website. You may be asked for evidence that your planned place of quarantine meets the requirements.

Regular entry requirements
Visas
The rules for travelling or working in European countries changed on 1 January 2021:
you can travel to countries in the Schengen area for up to 90 days in any 180-day period without a visa. This applies if you travel as a tourist, to visit family or friends, to attend business meetings, cultural or sports events, or for short-term studies or training.
if you are travelling to Norway and other Schengen countries without a visa, make sure your whole visit is within the 90-day limit. Visits to Schengen countries within the previous 180 days before you travel count towards your 90 days.
to stay longer, to work or study, for business travel or for other reasons, you will need to meet the Norwegian government’s entry requirements. Check with the Norwegian Embassy what type of visa and/or work permit, you may need
if you stay in Norway with a residence permit or long-stay visa, this does not count towards your 90-day visa-free limit
Any time you spent in Norway or other Schengen countries before 1 January 2021 does not count towards your 90-day visa-free limit.
At Norwegian border control, you may need to queue in separate lanes from EU, EEA and Swiss citizens.
Check your passport is stamped if you enter or exit the Schengen area through Norway as a visitor. Border guards will use passport stamps to check you’re complying with the 90-day visa-free limit for short stays in the Schengen area. If relevant entry or exit stamps are not in your passport, border guards will presume that you have overstayed your visa-free limit.
You can show evidence of when and where you entered or exited the Schengen area, and ask the border guards to add this date and location in your passport. Examples of acceptable evidence include boarding passes and tickets.
You may also need to:
show a return or onward ticket
show you have enough money for your stay
If you are resident in Norway your passport should not be stamped. You should proactively show your proof of residence as well as your valid passport at Norwegian border control. For further information, see our Living in Norway guide.
Passport validity
Check your passport is valid for travel before you book your trip, and renew your passport if you do not have enough time left on it.
Make sure your passport is:
valid for at least 3 months after the day you plan to leave Norway, or any other Schengen country
less than 10 years old
The 3 months you need when leaving a country must be within 10 years of the passport issue date.
If you renewed your current passport before the previous one expired, extra months may have been added to its expiry date. Any extra months on your passport over 10 years may not count towards the minimum 3 months needed.
Svalbard
You’ll need your passport with you to travel to and enter Svalbard. For more information on visiting Svalbard, including coronavirus-related restrictions, see Visit Svalbard’s website.
UK Emergency Travel Documents
UK ETDs are accepted for entry, airside transit and exit from Norway.
Pets
Check with the Norwegian Embassy in London before travelling with pets.
