If you bring medicines with you, make sure they are in their original containers and clearly labelled.

Dengue Fever is common to Latin America and the Caribbean and can occur throughout the year. Rain and flooding can lead to an increase in dengue carrying mosquitoes, leaving affected areas more vulnerable to dengue breakouts. Malaria is also common in lowland tropical areas (Beni and Pando) and the area known as Chaco in the south (Yacuiba, Paracari).
Some areas have been designated as ‘high risk’ for yellow fever. When outbreaks occur, the government sets up vaccination points at police checkpoints. At each of these, you may be vaccinated if you do not hold a valid yellow fever vaccination certificate.
Local authorities have declared a health alert in the department of Santa Cruz due to a number of confirmed cases of Chikungunya virus. You should take steps to avoid being bitten by mosquitoes.
