As from Monday 4 May, the Lao Government has eased some of the ‘lockdown’ measures that were previously in place.
Some cafes, markets, restaurants, shopping centres and offices may open, but entertainment venues such as gyms and large gatherings will remain closed for now. All people residing in Laos must continue to practice physical distancing, including while exercising, and remember to wear masks and regularly wash hands.
Supermarkets, pharmacies and shops selling foodstuffs remain open.
Bars and clubs, and educational institutions are closed.
Travel between provinces remains controlled except for essential purposes. Public transport (including domestic flights and buses) remain suspended.
Further measures may be introduced at short notice. You should follow the advice of the Lao authorities.
Visas
The Department of Immigration reopened on 4 May and foreigners are required to maintain valid visas for the period of their stay in Laos. If your visa expired during the lockdown period, you will be required to pay the regular fee for any days without a visa since 9 April in addition to the cost of any extension. Immigration departments will re-impose overstay fines after Friday 8 May.
