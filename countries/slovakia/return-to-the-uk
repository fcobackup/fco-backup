There are limited, but increasing commercial options to return to the UK from Slovakia via Austria, Hungary and the Czech Republic, but check any entry requirements for these countries before you travel.
If you live in the UK and are currently visiting Slovakia, you are strongly advised to return now by commercial means.
You should also check what you need to do on arrival in the UK.
Flights
Slovakia’s international airports at Bratislava, Kosice and Poprad are closed to regular scheduled passenger flights until further notice.
See below for information on indirect commercial options to fly to the UK from Vienna airport via other European destinations as well as direct flights to the UK from Budapest Airport.
You will need to pay for your return travel to the UK. If departure options are available but you cannot afford the travel costs and have exhausted all other options for getting funds, you may be eligible to apply for an emergency loan from the government. This is a last resort option and you would need to repay the loan when you are back in the UK.
For more information, you should contact Corporate Travel Management (CTM). CTM are a commercial partner of the FCO and are authorised to administer such loans on behalf of the FCO.
Road and rail
There are currently no international rail and bus services out of Slovakia, but these are expected to resume in June with connections to Austria, Hungary and the Czech Republic.
Exit by road is currently permitted, but you should check the entry requirements for the country you plan to enter.
Travel via bordering countries
There are restrictions on entry for most British nationals at the borders with Slovakia’s neighbouring countries, however it is possible to enter or transit those countries under certain circumstances.
You should check the FCO Travel Advice for Austria, Hungary, Poland and the Czech Republic for more information. There is also regularly updated information about border crossings on the Slovak Police Facebook page (in Slovak only).
There are indirect scheduled commercial flights to the UK from Vienna Airport via Frankfurt, Amsterdam and other European cities, but these may be subject to cancellation at short notice and flight schedules may mean you need an overnight stay.
There are direct scheduled commercial flights to the UK from Budapest Airport. You should contact the airlines directly.
Since 4 June, if you can demonstrate that you have legal residence in either Slovakia, Austria, Hungary or the Czech Republic, there are no restrictions on crossing borders between those countries.
If you are not resident in one of these countries, you can apply for permission to transit Hungary, Poland and the Czech Republic in order to return to the UK.
UK nationals transiting through Austria without a stopover do not require a medical certificate to enter Austria, if they can prove they are transiting.
To plan your route by road or air, check the FCO travel advice for all the countries you plan to travel through, including for any special documentation or permission you may need in order to transit.
Travelling to Vienna airport
Until international rail and bus services from Bratislava to Vienna resume, you can reach Vienna or the border with Austria either by car or by taxi. There is a list of Slovak car rental companies on the local English language Slovak Spectator website.
If you are only able to travel as far as the border between Slovakia and Austria, it is possible to cross into Austria on foot and arrange a taxi or car hire to meet you or take public transport to Vienna Airport from Kittsee or Wolfsthal.
Your journey home
The National Travel Health Network and Centre (NaTHNaC) provides advice on how to stay safe as you travel by air.
If you’re returning home before 8 June, follow the guidance for when you return to the UK on steps you should take to protect yourself and others. From 8 June there will be new rules for entering the UK.
Help and support
