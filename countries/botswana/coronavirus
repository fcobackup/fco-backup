Cases of coronavirus (COVID-19) have been confirmed in Botswana. The Government of Botswana declared a State of Public Emergency on 31 March, which has since been extended to six months. A number of other measures in response to the coronavirus pandemic, including a lockdown starting at midnight on 2 April for 28 days initially have also been introduced. Everybody in Botswana must stay at home, except to buy essential supplies such as food, medicine or power/fuel, which requires a travel permit. Only certain categories of key workers are exempt. You should comply with this requirement wherever you are staying in Botswana and continue to follow the advice of the Government of Botswana and local authorities; you can find the latest updates and travel permit forms Government of Botswana’s Facebook page.
International travel
There are currently no commercial flights in to or out of Botswana. Medical evacuation flights remain possible. The Botswana authorities have also closed land border posts with neighbouring countries. Only citizens and residents will be allowed entry. Returning residents, including from the UK, will be subject to a 14-day mandatory quarantine period in government facilities.
If you need further information about entry requirements, contact the local immigration authorities or nearest Botswana Embassy or High Commission. You should also check with your airline or travel company for the latest information.
The South African Government announced on 25 March the closure of South African airspace to commercial airlines from midnight on 26 March until at least 16 April, as part of further efforts to contain the spread of coronavirus. This has affected flights in to and out of Botswana.
