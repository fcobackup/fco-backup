The Finnish authorities have declared a state of emergency, with legislation introducing a number of measures to limit the spread of the virus. These measures include more stringent controls on people arriving from abroad. See the Finnish Government website for more details. Restaurants, cafes and bars will be gradually reopened from 1 June, subject to some restrictions.
Entry and borders
Finnish borders will be closed to all non-resident foreign nationals entering the country, with some limited local exemptions. British residents should display an ID card or other proof of residence when arriving in Finland.
From 14 May, Finnish restrictions will be lifted for cross-border traffic with other states in the Schengen area for commuter and other essential traffic. See the Finnish Border Guard website for more information.
Non-resident British nationals are permitted to enter Finland for limited essential or compassionate reasons with evidence for their travel. See the Finnish Border Guard website for more information. Passengers are allowed to transit through Helsinki Airport as long as they can verify acceptance at their final destination. Finavia strongly recommend that passengers use facemasks as they travel round airports in Finland, and Finnair have made the wearing of facemasks mandatory for passengers aged seven or over on their flights. Please check your carrier’s requirements before travelling.
