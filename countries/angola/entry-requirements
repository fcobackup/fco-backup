Entry rules in response to coronavirus (COVID-19)

There are a number of indirect commercial flights to Angola from the UK operated by TAP Air Portugal, Lufthansa and Air France. Passengers connecting via Frankfurt are required to show proof of a negative COVID-19 test completed no more than 48 hours before arrival in Germany. For more information, visit FCDO Travel Advice for Germany.
Advance passenger information requirement

All passengers are required to complete an Advance Passenger Information form (FRV form) 72 hours before travel to Angola. Several travel documents must be uploaded in PDF format to be accepted before entry to Angola.
Testing prior to arrival and departure
From 16 January, all air passengers are required to undergo a rapid COVID-19 test immediately on disembarking the plane. This is currently free of charge, which is undertaken in a hangar at the airport, but can take time. Passengers arriving in Angola, should carry water and a refreshment in case there is a long wait.
Those receiving a negative result will be allowed entry and can continue through immigration. You will need to undertake compulsory self-quarantine for 10 days before undergoing a further COVID-19 test. Those receiving a positive COVID-19 result will go immediately into mandatory quarantine at a government facility for observation and further testing.
All passengers are required to show evidence of negative COVID-19 test completed 72 hours before departure from Angola.
Quarantine requirements
All air passengers arriving in Angola will need to undertake compulsory self-quarantine for at least 10 days once tested for COVID-19 on arrival. If you test negative, returning residents can quarantine in their own homes. Non-resident essential workers have to quarantine in a government or government-approved facility. The Angolan authorities will release you from quarantine once you have tested negative for coronavirus. You must spend at least 10 days in quarantine before being tested.
If you receive a positive COVID-19 test result on arrival in Angola, you will be required to enter mandatory quarantine in a government facility for observation and further testing.
On arrival, passengers with short-term and visitor visas can expect to have their passports retained by the Angolan authorities at the Immigration desk. Passports can be recovered at the end of the 10 day quarantine period, on presentation of a negative COVID-19 test certificate (test to be taken on day 11) at the SME Department in the Departures lounge.
Regular entry requirements
Visas
You must apply for a valid visa and/or work permit before travelling to Angola, otherwise you will be detained at the airport and then deported. The process can take a long time. You should check all entry requirements with the Angolan Embassy in London well in advance.
If you’re applying for a tourist visa, you can submit documentation online in advance of travel and be granted a pre-approval within 72 hours. This allows you to receive your physical visa on entry into Angola, subject to a fee equivalent to USD $120, paid in cash, Visa or MasterCard. Further information can be found on the online application portal.
You’ll be fined 15,000 Kwanzas (Angolan currency) per day if you overstay your visa. You won’t be allowed to leave the country until your fine has been paid. Legal action will be taken against you if you don’t pay your fine. This may include being detained, deported or not being allowed to re-enter Angola.
Fines are in place for a wide range of visa offences including working, studying or residing without the correct visa, changing employment without notifying the authorities, employing staff with incorrect visas, failing to renew residence cards, or changing address without notifying the authorities.
Passport validity
Your passport should be valid for a minimum period of 6 months from the date of entry into Angola.
