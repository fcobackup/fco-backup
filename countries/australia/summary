Over 670,000 British nationals visit Australia every year. Most visits are trouble-free.
Australia is a vast country. You should plan journeys carefully, particularly if you’re travelling to remote areas, bushwalking or going swimming. See Local travel
Australia is prone to seasonal natural disasters including tropical cyclones, flash flooding, dust storms and bushfires (forest fires). Tropical Cyclones occur, mainly in Queensland, Northern Territory and Western Australia between November and April. You should monitor the progress of approaching storms and follow the advice of the local authorities. See Natural Disasters.
The England women’s and men’s cricket teams will be touring Australia between 22 October 2017 and 10 February 2018. See our information and advice page for travelling supporters.
You’ll need to get a visa before you travel. See Entry requirements
If you’re on a working holiday visa you should be aware of your rights as employees in Australia and how to report any concerns about unfair or unlawful treatment. See Entry requirements
Terrorists are very likely to try to carry out attacks in Australia. On 26 November 2015, the Australian government changed its national terrorism threat advisory system. Australia’s current national terrorism threat level is ’probable’. Attacks could be indiscriminate, including in places visited by foreigners. You should be vigilant and take sensible precautions. See Terrorism.
Take out comprehensive travel and medical insurance before you travel. Make sure this covers you for all activities you plan to do while in Australia, including manual labour if you’re backpacking; and adventure sports like bungee jumping, diving and paragliding.
If you’re abroad and you need emergency help from the UK government, contact the nearest British embassy, consulate or high commission.
