Moving around in Chile
For information on entering Chile, see Entry Requirements.
Chilean President Sebastian Piñera announced a 90-day ‘National State of Catastrophe’ on Wednesday 18 March 2020. A nationwide curfew (10pm to 5am) has been in place since 22 March.
Quarantine and sanitary cordons
Quarantine orders and sanitary cordons are in place in Santiago and in other parts of the country.
Chile is deploying a flexible approach to bringing municipal areas in and out of quarantine/sanitary cordons. New measures can be announced by the government at any time, and come into force shortly after, although changes are typically announced every Tuesday and are applied from Thursdays onwards.
Quarantine orders are in force in 25 of Santiago’s 32 municipalities:
Central Santiago, Cerrillos, Quilicura and Recoleta (until at least 12 May inclusive)
Cerro Navia, Conchalí, El Bosque, Estación Central, Independencia, La Cisterna, La Florida, La Granja, La Pintana, Lo Espejo, Lo Prado, Macul, Pedro Aguirre Cerda, Peñalolén, Puente Alto (Poniente), Quinta Normal, Renca, San Bernardo (Norte), San Joaquí, San Miguel and San Ramon (Sur) (until at least 15 May inclusive)
Full quarantine is in place (until at least 15 May) in the following cities:
Arica
Antofagasta
Mejillones
Angol
Victoria
The quarantine order for Punto Arenas will end at 10pm on 8 May.
Sanitary cordons are in place in Chiloé, Temuco (Araucanía), Osorno (Los Lagos).
Information on zones in quarantine is available on this Google interactive map.
In those areas in quarantine, people are allowed to leave their residences only under certain circumstances, including for medical reasons, basic services, and public services. If you need to leave your residence for food supplies or medical reasons, you must get a permit from the Comisaria Virtual.
Foreigners may use their passport number to access the system. The pages are only in Spanish. It is not possible to leave or enter a sanitary cordon without a “salvoconducto” (police authorization), also obtained via the Comisaria Virtual.
Checkpoints for health inspections are in force at various points around Santiago and elsewhere. In addition to checking the health of persons passing through, these checkpoints will be used to confirm that specific individuals who have been ordered to quarantine by medical authorities are not violating their quarantine. You will need to get a “Health Passport” prior to travel and present it at any checkpoint.
