At least 8 weeks before your trip, check the latest country-specific health advice from the National Travel Health Network and Centre (NaTHNaC) on the TravelHealthPro website. Each country-specific page has information on vaccine recommendations, any current health risks or outbreaks, and factsheets with information on staying healthy abroad. Guidance is also available from NHS (Scotland) on the FitForTravel website.
General information on travel vaccinations and a travel health checklist is available on the NHS website. You may then wish to contact your health adviser or pharmacy for advice on other preventive measures and managing any pre-existing medical conditions while you’re abroad.
The legal status and regulation of some medicines prescribed or purchased in the UK can be different in other countries. If you’re travelling with prescription or over-the-counter medicine, read this guidance from NaTHNaC on best practice when travelling with medicines. For further information on the legal status of a specific medicine, you’ll need to contact the embassy, high commission or consulate of the country or territory you’re travelling to.
While travel can be enjoyable, it can sometimes be challenging. There are clear links between mental and physical health, so looking after yourself during travel and when abroad is important. Information on travelling with mental health conditions is available in our guidance page. Further information is also available from the National Travel Health Network and Centre (NaTHNaC).
Coronavirus
The Danish authorities have introduced a number of measures in response to the coronavirus (COVID-19) pandemic. Cases have been confirmed in Denmark (including the Faroe Islands). Denmark’s Health Authority (Sundhedssytrelsen) has opened a coronavirus hotline on +45 70 20 02 33, operators speak English and Danish. There is also a coronavirus website with all the latest information in English.
From Friday 13 March day care centres, schools, universities, public cultural institutions (e.g. libraries) and religious institutions will be closed for two weeks.
From Saturday 14 March, 12 noon, the Danish border will temporarily be closed for foreign nationals who do not have a recognised purpose for entering Denmark. All Danish citizens will be allowed to continue to cross the border. Foreign nationals normally living (temporary or permanent residents) and working in Denmark will still be able to enter the country. In addition, those who need to transit through Denmark in order to return to their place of residence will be able to. However, tourists and those the Danish authorities say cannot demonstrate a recognised purpose (residence, work, delivery/collection of goods, transit) to enter Denmark will not be allowed to cross the border. There may be further updates to how these policies take effect as the Danish and local authorities implement this ruling over the coming days.
Border checks will be implemented at all entry points. The measures are set to run until at least 13 April. Travellers from the UK will continue to be able to leave Denmark. Airports remain open at present. We recommend that UK travellers contact their airline operators to arrange return to the UK.
Companies have been advised to cancel any public indoor events of 100 attendees or more. Cafés, bars and nightclubs have been advised to close.
The Danish authorities have issued recommendations for travellers using public transport, including avoiding travelling during rush hour. Airports remain open.
Further information on coronavirus, including advice on preparing for foreign travel and helping reduce the spread of the virus, is available from Public Health England and on the TravelHealthPro website.
Healthcare
The rules on access to healthcare will stay the same until 31 December 2020.
You should get a free European Health Insurance Card (EHIC) before leaving the UK. After 31 December 2020, your UK-issued EHIC might not be valid.
The EHIC entitles you to state provided medical treatment that may become necessary during your trip. Any treatment provided is on the same terms as Danish nationals. If you don’t have your EHIC with you or you’ve lost it, you can call the Department of Health Overseas Healthcare Team (+44 191 218 1999) to get a Provisional Replacement Certificate.
It is important to take out comprehensive travel insurance that includes cover for emergency medical treatment and associated costs. The existing EHIC arrangements are not an alternative to travel insurance, as some health-related costs, including for medical repatriation, ongoing medical treatment and non-urgent treatment, are not covered. Read more about what your travel insurance should cover.
If you’re living in Denmark, you can also find more information on healthcare for residents in our Living In Denmark guide.
If you need emergency medical assistance during your trip, dial 112 and ask for an ambulance. If you are referred to a medical facility for treatment you should contact your insurance/medical assistance company immediately.
Faroe Islands and Greenland
As non EEA members, the EHIC scheme is not directly applicable for use in Greenland or the Faroe Islands. However, if you travel to Greenland or the Faroe Islands, you should still take your EHIC with you. The UK has reciprocal agreements with Greenland and the Faroe Islands under which British nationals can receive medical treatment equivalent to that which an EHIC would offer. You’ll need to provide proof of identity, including proof of nationality. Like the EHIC, this arrangement isn’t a substitute for travel insurance.
