This page reflects the UK government’s understanding of current rules for people travelling on a full ‘British Citizen’ passport from the UK, for the most common types of travel.
The authorities in Monaco set and enforce entry rules. If you’re unsure how Monaco’s entry requirements apply to you, contact its UK embassy, high commission or consulate.
All travellers

If you’re transiting through Monaco
Transiting is when you pass through one country on the way to your final destination. Transiting through Monaco is permitted for travellers from the UK in line with the entry requirements set out above.
Check your passport and travel documents before you travel
You should check with your travel provider to make sure your passport and other travel documents meet their requirements.
Passport validity
If you are planning to travel to an EU country (except Ireland), or Switzerland, Norway, Iceland, Liechtenstein, Andorra, Monaco, San Marino or Vatican City, you must follow the Schengen area passport requirements.
Your passport must be:
issued less than 10 years before the date you enter the country (check the ‘date of issue’)
valid for at least 3 months after the day you plan to leave (check the ‘expiry date’)
You must check your passport meets these requirements before you travel. If your passport was issued before 1 October 2018, extra months may have been added to its expiry date.
Contact the embassy of the country you are visiting if you think that your passport does not meet both these requirements. Renew your passport if you need to.
Visas
France handles immigration and customs matters for Monaco. If your passport describes you as a British Citizen you will not need a visa to enter France or Monaco. Other British passport holders should check the current entry requirements on the website of the French Foreign Ministry and if necessary confirm with the nearest French Diplomatic mission.
UK emergency travel documents
UK emergency travel documents are accepted for entry, airside transit and exit from Monaco.
