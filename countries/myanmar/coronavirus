International travel
As of 1 February Myanmar’s airports have been shut to regular commercial air services until the end of May. Several relief flights however continue to operate and can be booked commercially. Neighbouring countries have also closed their land borders to Myanmar. For further information, see Return to the UK.
Residents of the United Kingdom, or those who have visited the United Kingdom within the previous 14 days, are currently unable to enter Myanmar. Those not travelling from the United Kingdom, including British Nationals, should check the requirements for travel from that country to Myanmar with the relevant Myanmar Embassy or Consulate General.
The DCA (Department of Civil Aviation) announced on 30 May that in order to effectively control the spread of COVID-19 and its variants, the ban on commercial flights will be extended until end June 2021 (from end May). The airport however remains open and relief flights are available for those seeking to leave Myanmar. Most of these are commercially bookable. These availability of flights may decrease quickly if the situation deteriorates.
It is important that you book early. From 21 May 2021 The Ministry of Transport and Communication has instructed airlines to send the list of all passengers, leaving overseas by air, to the Ministry of Foreign Affairs 10 days in advance of the flight.
Please note the airport can be very hot so have plenty of water with you. Wi-Fi is often not available so it is recommended that you complete all paperwork before you go to the airport. See Flights for more information on options for leaving Myanmar. Land borders are currently closed to foreign nationals.
Entry and borders
See Entry requirements to find out what you will need to do when you arrive in Myanmar.
Travel in Myanmar
A limited schedule of domestic flights is operating, though the rules for access to these is not clear. You are advised to stay home at night, and minimise movement during the day, avoiding crowds. If you do still attempt to travel domestically, please note that you may encounter checkpoints on your journey. You should contact individual airlines for details, and should comply with all the relevant guidance and regulations while travelling.
In some areas there may be local requirements for visitors from other parts of the country, including the requirement to take a COVID-19 test in advance of travel, and to quarantine on arrival. You should check with local authorities for information on possible local preventative measures.
Some areas in Myanmar are under a state of martial law, whilst others have curfews and ‘Stay at Home’ orders in place. You should ensure you are aware of local rules and restrictions before you travel.
Since 13 May 2020 it has been compulsory for anyone going out in public in Myanmar to wear a facemask. Failure to wear one will result in a fine.
It is recommended that foreigners carry:
passport
Form C (immigration document)
Foreigner’s Registration Certificate
Myanmar Driver’s Licence (if you own a car)
a copy of your passport information page
a copy of your Myanmar visa
a copy of your immigration stamp showing when you last entered Myanmar.
Accommodation
There have been reports that some local authorities are carrying out checks to make sure all foreign visitors are staying in registered hotels and guest houses, not in private apartments. This is a requirement under Myanmar law and is a condition of your visa.
Some hotels have reopened but many tourist resorts remain closed.
Public places and services
Some restaurants, bars and shops have reopened. Many that are open have temperature checks and social distancing measures in place, with some shopping centres requiring customers to register their details upon entry. You must wear a face mask in all public places.
The NLD government ordered all schools, including private ones, to close from 26 August. The date for re-opening has not yet been announced.
Healthcare
If you’re currently in Myanmar and are displaying symptoms of coronavirus, you should consult your healthcare provider. You may then be asked to notify the Myanmar National Hotline for Coronavirus (+95 67 3420268) and be transferred to a public health facility for testing.
If you test positive for the virus, you’re highly likely to be transferred to a government quarantine hospital until you have recovered. Patients are obliged to use a government facility even if they have private insurance. Patients in government hospitals are expected to make their own arrangements for bringing in food and other essential supplies. Lone travellers will not be allowed out of isolation to buy food or make phone calls.
The coronavirus pandemic is expected to put significant pressure on Myanmar’s medical facilities. They may not be able to offer routine care.
It may be difficult for you to travel to a neighbouring country for medical attention. You should check your personal arrangements with your healthcare provider.
Prescriptions from the UK are not accepted in Myanmar. Most hospitals, both government and private, have their own pharmacies. A government hospital will provide a prescription for collection at their pharmacy once a patient has been assessed. To attend a private hospital or clinic you must first register, following an assessment any prescription can be collected at the pharmacy on their premises. Pre-COVID, specific foreign medicines unavailable in Myanmar, could be ordered from Bangkok but suppliers are currently unable to transport these medicines due to COVID restrictions. Medication is sourced locally with supplies from India and Europe. It is therefore recommended that anyone on regular medication brings sufficient supplies with them or is able to have their medication couriered from the UK.

COVID-19 vaccines if you live in Myanmar
Information about the vaccine programme in Myanmar is currently quite limited, and the wider political and security situation may affect any planned rollout. As more information becomes clear, this page will be updated.
The Medicines and Healthcare Products Regulatory Agency (MHRA) is the UK authority responsible for assessing the safety, quality and efficacy of vaccines. It has authorised the Pfizer/BioNTech, Oxford/AstraZeneca and Moderna vaccines for temporary supply and use in the UK. Find out more about MHRA approval for these vaccines.
British nationals living overseas should seek medical advice from their local healthcare provider in the country where they reside. Information about vaccines used in other national programmes, including regulatory status, should be available from the local authorities. This list of Stringent Regulatory Authorities recognised by the World Health Organisation may also be a useful source of additional information. Find out more information about the COVID-19 vaccines on the World Health Organization COVID-19 vaccines page.
