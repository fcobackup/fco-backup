Entry and borders
See Entry requirements to find out what you will need to do when you arrive in Cape Verde.
Returning to the UK
When you return, you must follow the rules for entering the UK.
You are responsible for organising your own COVID-19 test, in line with UK government testing requirements. You should contact local authorities for information on testing facilities.
From 8 June, direct flights can arrive in England from Cape Verde, but they must arrive at dedicated terminals at Heathrow and Birmingham airports. Different requirements may apply for arrivals into Scotland, Wales and Northern Ireland.
Be prepared for your plans to change
No travel is risk-free during COVID. Countries may further restrict travel or bring in new rules at short notice, for example due to a new COVID-19 variant. Check with your travel company or airline for any transport changes which may delay your journey home.
If you test positive for COVID-19, you may need to stay where you are until you test negative. You may also need to seek treatment there.
Plan ahead and make sure you:
can access money
understand what your insurance will cover
can make arrangements to extend your stay and be away for longer than planned
Travel in Cape Verde
Inter-island travel
Internal inter-island flights and passenger ferries are operational. If you’re travelling between islands, you’ll need to complete an online health surveillance form and for most of the islands you’ll need to present a COVID-19 (rapid antigen test) done in the last 72 hours before you travel.
You can check the testing requirements between inter-island flights and ferries in the FAQs on the Cabo Verde Safe site. Children under the age of 7 are not required to present a test.
You can have a COVID-19 (rapid antigen test) done in a local municipal health facility or in a certified private laboratory no later than 72 hours prior to travel. You can book your test online on some of the islands.
You’ll need to pay 1,000 CV Escudos (around £8-£10) for the COVID-19 (rapid antigen) test, a health declaration and result certificate. You need to ensure that the fee you pay includes the health declaration and test result.
International travel
For international travel out of Cape Verde, you’ll need to present a COVID-19 test (RT-PCR or Ag-RDT) done in the last 72 hours before you travel. You can book your test online on some of the islands. This does not apply to children under the age of 12.
Tests are available at health centres and cost 6500CV Escudos (around £55). You can find a list of health centres online.
If you are travelling to or from Cape Verde and transiting other countries, you will need to check the travel advice pages of that country. You should also check with your airline or travel provider about entry requirements when transiting other countries.
Accommodation
Find accommodation that is suitable for your needs. Some hotel accommodation is open and there is self-catering accommodation available. Look for hotels that have been awarded the “Cabo Verde – Secure Tourism” certification.
Public places and services
Until further notice all the islands in the Cape Verde archipelago are in a ‘state of calamity’. There are 4 ‘states’ under civil protection rules: state of emergency (highest), state of calamity (2nd highest), state of contingency (3rd highest) and state of alert (lowest). Each ‘state’ has its own restrictions.
Face coverings are mandatory in enclosed spaces and outdoors where it is not possible to maintain social distancing.
Confinement is mandatory for 14 days if you’re suffering from or infected with coronavirus symptoms. You must observe the rules on social distancing and hygiene:
keep a social distance of at least 2m
wash your hands regularly
respect the rules on maximum occupancy in shops and service, restaurants, cafés and on public transport
The use of a face covering is mandatory in enclosed spaces, e.g. supermarkets, shops, health centres, banks, schools, public services, airports and port, restaurants and cafés and on public transport. Face coverings are also mandatory outdoors where social distancing cannot be maintained. This applies to everyone over the age of 10. You may be exempt from using a face mask on medical grounds if so authorised by the health authorities.
All cultural, recreational, sporting, leisure and entertainment facilities are closed, including those which had re-opened earlier. Most nightclubs, dance halls, event venues and facilities, sporting academies and gymnastics and martial arts clubs remain closed.
Parties and social gatherings are banned. Attendance at religious services and ceremonies is limited to one third capacity and subject to social distancing, temperature checking, hand hygiene and the use of a face mask.
Beaches on islands may be closed. You’ll need to check with your local authority.
Bars, and open air cafés selling alcohol, close at 9pm. Restaurants and snack bars close at 11pm.
Lounge bars close at 9pm on weekdays, weekends and bank holidays.
Shops and stores close at 8:30pm, with the exception of pharmacies and bread shops which close at 9pm.
Healthcare in Cape Verde
If you’ve got COVID-19 symptoms you must self-isolate for 14 days. The government of Cape Verde has set up a free helpline, which you can call if you have any concerns about coronavirus: +238 (0)800 1112. This helpline is only available in Portuguese.
If you need medicine, you will only be able to buy it from a pharmacy. Unlike in the UK, non-prescription medication is not available in supermarkets or other shops. There are a limited number of Pharmacies on each island and they are usually identified by a green cross. Find a pharmacy near you on the Pharmacy Network website.
If you have a UK prescription, take it to a pharmacy and ask the pharmacist whether they can dispense your medication for you. Remember the pharmacist will have to apply national rules so may not be able to give you the same strength or dosage. Some medicines may not be available or may not be authorised for sale in Cape Verde. In some cases, the medicine might not be in stock so they will need to order it. This can take up to a week or more.
If you need a repeat prescription, go to the nearest health centre or hospital A&E.
