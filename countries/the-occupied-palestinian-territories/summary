Conflict in Israel and the Occupied Palestinian Territories
There was a large scale terrorist attack by Hamas in southern Israel. Hamas continues to launch rockets into Israel. There are Israeli air strikes into Gaza.
The Israeli military announced on 13 October that the entire population of Gaza north of Wadi Gaza should relocate to southern Gaza within the next 24 hours.
We advise following this advice issued by the Israeli authorities. We recognise this a fast-moving situation that poses significant risks.
Events in Israel/OPTs are fast moving and the situation has potential to deteriorate quickly and without warning. This could disrupt air and road links out of the country. If your reason to remain in Israel and the OPTs is not essential you should consider leaving if it is safe to do so.
If you are in an area affected by the fighting, follow the instructions of Israeli Home Front Command. To find these:
visit the Israeli Home Front Command website (available in Israel only)
call 104 if you are in Israel
The Israeli government has declared a state of emergency across the whole country. International borders (air and land) in Israel and the Occupied Palestinian Territories (OPTs) could close at short notice. You should check our Travel Advice for any neighbouring country that you are planning to travel to or through.
Before travelling within Israel/OPTs you should check the local measures in place, that roads are open and, where appropriate, that scheduled train and bus services are operating before you travel.
Due to the security situation, some family members of staff at the British Embassy in Tel Aviv and British Consulate in Jerusalem have been temporarily withdrawn. The Embassy and Consulate continue with essential work including services to British nationals.
Monitor this travel advice and other media as the situation is changing fast. Follow and contact FCDO travel on Twitter, Facebook and Instagram. You can also get email notifications when this travel advice is updated.

The booking portal for HMG assisted flights from Ben Gurion Airport has now closed.  Commercial International flights continue to operate from Ben Gurion Airport in Tel Aviv and Ramon Airport in Eilat but are limited and may be cancelled at short notice.
Travel within or out of Israel or the OPTs is at your own risk.  You are encouraged to follow the advice of local authorities, for example on which routes are open or when to take shelter, and monitor this Travel Advice, which is regularly updated. Register your presence to receive important updates, including information on support to leave the country.
Travelling to Egypt from Gaza 
If you are a British national in Gaza who wants to enter Egypt, check the status of the Rafah crossing into Egypt before you travel. Movement to the Rafah crossing and beyond is at your own risk.
