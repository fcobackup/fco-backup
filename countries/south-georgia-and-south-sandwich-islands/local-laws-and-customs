Prohibited areas
On South Georgia access is prohibited to all historic buildings at the former whaling stations of Prince Olav Harbour, Leith Harbour, Stromness and Husvik. This is due to the buildings being in a dangerous state of disrepair or because of the asbestos content. Wind-blown debris including asbestos dust presents a significant health risk at all times. You are prohibited from entering or approaching within 200 metres of the former whaling stations, unless directed otherwise by the Commissioner’s Office or the Government Officer at King Edward Point.
