This section has safety advice for regions of Cyprus. It only covers regions where the Foreign, Commonwealth & Development Office (FCDO) has specific advice.  
You should also read FCDO’s overall travel advice and safety and security advice.
Travel to the north of Cyprus
The Republic of Cyprus is a full EU member, but the country is divided by the ‘Green Line’. The British government does not recognise the self-declared ‘Turkish Republic of Northern Cyprus’.
Consular assistance in the north of Cyprus
FCDO can only provide limited consular support if you are visiting areas in the north that are not under control of the Republic of Cyprus. The authorities in the north of Cyprus do not share information with the British High Commission regarding the location, wellbeing or treatment of British nationals. This means you may be more vulnerable and at greater risk.
Recognition of documents from the north of Cyprus
The Republic of Cyprus does not recognise residence permits issued in the north of Cyprus.
