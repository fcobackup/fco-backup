At least 8 weeks before your trip, check the latest country-specific health advice from the National Travel Health Network and Centre (NaTHNaC) on the TravelHealthPro website. Each country-specific page has information on vaccine recommendations, any current health risks or outbreaks, and factsheets with information on staying healthy abroad. Guidance is also available from NHS (Scotland) on the FitForTravel website.
General information on travel vaccinations and a travel health checklist are available on the NHS website. You may then wish to contact your health adviser or pharmacy for advice on other preventive measures and managing any pre-existing medical conditions while you’re abroad.
The legal status and regulation of some medicines prescribed or purchased in the UK can be different in other countries. If you’re travelling with prescription or over-the-counter medicine, read this guidance from NaTHNaC on best practice when travelling with medicines. For further information on the legal status of a specific medicine, you’ll need to contact the embassy, high commission or consulate of the country or territory you’re travelling to.
On 1 August 2018, the DRC Government confirmed an outbreak of the Ebola virus in North Kivu province, originating in Béni territory. New cases continue to be reported across the affected areas, the latest updates can be found on World Health Organisation website.
Public Health England’s Returning Workers Scheme provides guidance for British Nationals travelling to the areas affected by the outbreak who will be returning to the UK. The RWS is for any business or organisation that has staff who travel to the UK from areas affected by Ebola. This includes humanitarian and healthcare organisations, as well as media and other organisations that are sending workers to situations where they might be directly exposed to Ebola.
Travel to an Ebola affected area may restrict your ability to obtain travel insurance. If you intend to travel to Ebola affected areas of DRC, you’re advised to speak to your travel insurance provider and discuss any exclusions that may arise.

If you become ill during or immediately after travelling to the country, seek medical advice immediately. Medical care is extremely limited. The Centre Prive d’Urgence (CPU) clinic in Kinshasa is able to cope with basic health problems and to stabilise a patient after most serious accidents. Outside Kinshasa, western standard medical facilities are almost non-existent. Medical evacuation to South Africa (or elsewhere) is often necessary. Make sure you have adequate travel health insurance and accessible funds to cover the cost of any medical treatment abroad and repatriation; this should specifically include the very high costs of evacuation by air ambulance. If you take medication regularly, bring in a properly-marked supply, sufficient for the time you will be in the DRC, with you.
