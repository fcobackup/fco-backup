The information on this page covers the most common types of travel and reflects the UK government’s understanding of the rules currently in place. Unless otherwise stated, this information is for travellers using a full ‘British Citizen’ passport.
The authorities in the country or territory you’re travelling to are responsible for setting and enforcing the rules for entry. If you’re unclear about any aspect of the entry requirements, or you need further reassurance, you’ll need to contact the embassy, high commission or consulate of the country or territory you’re travelling to.
You should also consider checking with your transport provider or travel company to make sure your passport and other travel documents meet their requirements.
Entry rules in response to coronavirus
Entry to Slovakia
You may enter Slovakia without restrictions if you have spent all of the previous 14 days in a country listed on the Slovak Ministry of Foreign Affairs website. From 20 July, this has included the UK.
If you have spent any of the previous 14 days in a country not on this list, you must self-isolate on arrival and register with your regional Public Health Authority office over the phone or online at the Slovak Government’s Coronavirus website. You must register in advance of travel or immediately after arrival. Once registered, the authorities will contact you after at least 5 days to arrange a free RT-PCR test for COVID-19. If you are self-isolating at a private residence, anyone living in the same household must also self-isolate. After you receive a negative test result, you may end your self-isolation. If you arrive from an EU country which is on Slovakia’s list of high-risk countries, you may end your self-isolation after 10 days without waiting for your negative test result, if you have no symptoms. For other countries on the list, you must complete 14 days of self-isolation if you do not receive a negative test result.Failure to comply with these requirements may result in a fine of up to 5,000 euros.
Alternatively, you may enter Slovakia from an EU country with a negative PCR test which is no older than 72 hours. You must carry your test results with you during your stay in case the authorities ask for it.
This information applies to UK nationals arriving by air or across land borders with Austria, Czech Republic, Hungary and Poland.
You can enter Slovakia from Ukraine but you must pre-register ahead of your arrival on the Slovak Government’s Coronavirus website and show evidence of your registration to the border official on arrival. For more information, see the Slovak Government’s Coronavirus website.
Transiting Slovakia
Exemptions on transit for EU nationals continue to apply equally to UK nationals. If you have spent any of the previous 14 days in a country not listed as “low risk” by the Slovak government, you may transit Slovakia in order to return to your country of residence without the need for self-isolation, testing or permission from the Slovak authorities but you must complete your transit within eight hours.
Transport
Slovakia’s international airports at Bratislava, Kosice and Poprad have resumed flights to certain permitted destinations. Flights to and from the UK resumed on 20 July.
Border crossings
All land border crossings between Slovakia and Austria, Hungary, Poland and the Czech Republic are operational but there may be random border checks. Full border checks remain in place with Ukraine. See the Slovak Ministry of Foreign Affairs and the Slovak Interior Ministry website (in Slovak only) for the latest information on border crossings.
Regular entry requirements
Visas
If you hold a British Citizen passport, you don’t need a visa to enter Slovakia. If you’re planning a stay of longer than 3 months, see our Living in Slovakia guide and contact the Slovak Embassy if you have further questions.
The rules on travel will stay the same until 31 December 2020.
Visas from 1 January 2021
The rules for travelling or working in Europe will change from 1 January 2021:
You will be able to travel to countries in the Schengen area for up to 90 days in any 180-day period without a visa for purposes such as tourism. This is a rolling 180-day period.
Therefore, if you’re travelling to Slovakia, previous visits to the Schengen area within the 180 days before your date of travel would count against the 90-day limit.
If you are travelling visa-free to Slovakia and to other countries in the Schengen area, make sure your whole visit is within the limit.
To stay for longer, to work or study, or for business travel you will need to meet the entry requirements set out by Slovakia. This could mean applying for a visa or work permit. You should check with the Slovak Embassy what type of visa, if any, you will need.
Periods of stay authorised under a visa or permit will not count against the 90-day limit.
The European Commission has not yet set out how the limit of 90 days in any 180-day period for visa-free travel will be implemented for those who are already travelling in the EU or Schengen Area on 31 December 2020.
If you are travelling to Slovakia before 31 December 2020 and will stay until 1 January 2021 or later, you should check with the Slovak Embassy for information on how the 90-day visa-free limit will apply to you. This also applies if your stay includes travel to other Schengen area countries.
At border control for Slovakia, you may need to:
show a return or onward ticket
show you have enough money for your stay
use separate lanes from EU, EEA and Swiss citizens when queueing
Your passport may be stamped on entry and exit.
Passport validity  
The rules on travel will stay the same until 31 December 2020.
Your passport should be valid for the proposed duration of your stay; you do not need any additional period of validity on your passport beyond this.
Make sure your passport is in a presentable state before you travel. The Slovak authorities can refuse entry if your passport is worn or damaged, or looks as if it’s been tampered with.
Passport validity from 1 January 2021
From 1 January 2021, you must have at least 6 months left on an adult or child passport to travel to most countries in Europe (not including Ireland).
If you renewed your current passport before the previous one expired, extra months may have been added to its expiry date. Any extra months on your passport over 10 years may not count towards the 6 months needed.
Check your passport is valid for travel before you book your trip. You will need to renew your passport before travelling if you do not have enough time left on your passport.
Registering with the Slovak authorities
If you plan to stay in Slovakia for a longer period of time, you should register with the police within 3 days of arrival. You’ll need your passport, 2 photographs and proof of accommodation. You’ll have an option to apply for a Slovak ‘green card’, which can be used as proof of your ID, while your passport is kept in a safe place. Visit the website of Ministry of Interior of the Slovak Republic for further information.
UK Emergency Travel Documents
UK Emergency Travel Documents (ETDs) are accepted for entry, airside transit and exit from Slovakia. They are also accepted for a return to Slovakia if you normally live there.
