The Foreign and Commonwealth Office (FCO) advise against all travel to the Parc du W and the contiguous hunting zones of Meêkrou and Djona. The Parc is tri-national and shares an open border with Burkina Faso and Niger. There is a risk of terrorist attacks throughout the Parc. See Terrorism
The FCO advise against all but essential travel to the area between the Interstate Highway (RNIE) 2 (Tchaourou to Malanville) and the Nigerian border, due to increasing criminality in that area.
Terrorist attacks in Benin can’t be ruled out. Attacks could be indiscriminate. You should be vigilant, especially in places visited by foreigners. See Terrorism.
If you’re abroad and you need emergency help from the UK government, contact the nearest British embassy, consulate or high commission. Consular support is limited in Benin. The Honorary Consular Agent in Benin can offer limited consular assistance. British nationals should contact the British High Commission Accra in Ghana who can provide consular support.
Take out comprehensive travel and medical insurance before you travel.
