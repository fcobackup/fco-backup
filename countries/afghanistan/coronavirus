Travel in Afghanistan
Travel in Afghanistan is dangerous. We advise all British nationals to leave Afghanistan.
Healthcare in Afghanistan
Healthcare in Afghanistan is very limited. Medical facilities, including those in Kabul, do not have the capacity or capability to effectively deal with the COVID-19 outbreak. The supply of ICU beds and ventilators is low. There are areas which have no medical facilities with ICU beds and ventilators.
There is no guarantee that any local health care will be available in the current security situation.
Whilst an estimated 30 per cent of the population had been exposed to COVID-19 by June 2020, WHO warns that widespread complacency and failure to follow public health advice is creating grave risks in the community with people generally not observing physical distancing or mask-wearing protocols.
