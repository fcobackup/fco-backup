Cases of coronavirus (COVID-19) have been confirmed in Nigeria. The Nigerian authorities have introduced a number of measures to limit the spread of the virus.
Entry and travel restrictions
All airports in Nigeria are closed to all international commercial flights until 23 April. You should urgently contact your airline or tour operator if you are due to travel to or from Nigeria. For information on returning to the UK from Nigeria, see Return to the UK
Local measures
On 29 March the Federal Government (FG) announced that, with effect from 11pm (22:00GMT) on Monday 30 March, there would be a restriction to movement in Abuja and Lagos for 14 days in an attempt to curb the spread of the coronavirus. The directive will also come into effect in Ogun state with effect from 3 April. All citizens in these areas are to stay in their homes.
The FG also ordered that all businesses and offices within these locations should be closed during this period. The restriction will not apply to hospitals and related medical establishments, including pharmacies. Supermarkets and food stores are exempt and allowed to open daily between 10am to 4pm, with social distancing safeguards in place. Fuel stations and banks will also remain open offering core services. Check the Nigerian State House website for further detail on the exemptions.
The FG also advised that travel to or from other states should be postponed.
Only government operated isolation centres can treat coronavirus related issues.
The Nigerian Immigration Service has announced the temporary suspension of passports and migrant registration due to the outbreak of coronavirus until April 23.
Some states are also introducing their own restrictions in movement. So far Imo, Osun, Niger, Kaduna, Kano, Rivers, Kwara and Ekiti have made such announcements. All travellers and residents in Nigeria are encouraged to monitor announcements by federal and state governments on further restrictions, which are likely to be introduced with little advance notice.
You are also advised to follow the advice of local authorities, including local measures to help minimise your risk of exposure to coronavirus (COVID-19).
Medical
Pharmacies are classified as an essential service, and will remain open. Most medicines that require a prescription from a doctor in the UK will require one in Nigeria. If necessary, you should obtain an electronic prescription from your medical practitioner to enable a local doctor to write one.
