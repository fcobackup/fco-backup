This page reflects the UK government’s understanding of current rules for people travelling on a full ‘British Citizen’ passport, for the most common types of travel.
The authorities in Luxembourg set and enforce entry rules. For further information contact their embassy, high commission or consulate. You may also check with your transport provider or travel company to make sure your passport and travel documents meet their requirements.
If you need further information about entry requirements, contact the local immigration authorities or the nearest Luxembourg embassy/consulate. You should also check with your airline or travel company for the latest information.
If you are travelling to Luxembourg for work, read the guidance on visas and permits as the rules have changed since 1 January 2021.
Entry rules in response to coronavirus (COVID-19)
Entry to Luxembourg
UK nationals are not permitted entry to Luxembourg for non-essential purposes due to EU-wide COVID-19 restrictions on non-EU and EEA nationals. Essential travel is still permitted and a list of exemptions for entering Luxembourg can be found on the Luxembourg government website (under ‘I am a third country national. Am I allowed to visit the Grand Duchy, and what conditions apply to travelling to the Grand Duchy?’).
If you are eligible to travel to Luxembourg you must:
Have proof of a negative PCR test (carried out less than 72 hours before departure) or proof of a negative antigen COVID-19 test (carried out less than 48 hours before departure) for all passengers aged twelve and over. You should not use the NHS testing service in order to facilitate travel to another country. If arriving by air, complete a passenger locator form while on the plane
Further details can be found on the Luxembourg government’s website.
Regular entry requirements
Visas
The rules for travelling or working in European countries changed on 1 January 2021:
you can travel to countries in the Schengen area for up to 90 days in any 180-day period without a visa. This applies if you travel as a tourist, to visit family or friends, to attend business meetings, cultural or sports events, or for short-term studies or training
if you are travelling to Luxembourg and other Schengen countries without a visa, make sure your whole visit is within the 90-day limit. Visits to Schengen countries within the previous 180 days before you travel count towards your 90 days
to stay longer, to work or study, for business travel or for other reasons, you will need to meet the Luxembourg government’s entry requirements. Check with the Luxembourg Embassy what type of visa and/or work permit you may need
if you stay in Luxembourg with a residence permit or long-stay visa, this does not count towards your 90-day visa-free limit
Any time you spent in Luxembourg or other Schengen countries before 1 January 2021 does not count towards your 90-day visa-free limit.
At Luxembourg border control, you may need to use separate lanes from EU, EEA and Swiss citizens when queueing. Your passport may be stamped on entry and exit. You may also need to:
show a return or onward ticket
show you have enough money for your stay
There are separate requirements for those who are resident in Luxembourg. If you are resident in Luxembourg, you should carry proof of residence as well as your valid passport when you travel. For further information on these requirements, see our Living in Luxembourg guide.
Passport validity
Check your passport is valid for travel before you book your trip, and renew your passport if you do not have enough time left on it.
Make sure your passport is:
valid for at least 3 months after the day you plan to leave Luxembourg, or any other Schengen country
less than 10 years old
The 3 months you need when leaving a country must be within 10 years of the passport issue date.
If you renewed your current passport before the previous one expired, extra months may have been added to its expiry date. Any extra months on your passport over 10 years may not count towards the minimum 3 months needed.
UK Emergency Travel Documents
UK Emergency Travel Documents are accepted for entry and exit from Luxembourg.
