Cases of coronavirus (COVID-19) have been confirmed in Paraguay. The Paraguayan authorities have introduced measures to limit the spread of the virus.
These regulations are subject to change and the situation is changing rapidly. Please follow the instructions of the Paraguayan authorities as new measures may be brought in with short notice.
Borders and travel
The Paraguayan government announced on 24 March that all passenger flights have been suspended until further notice. Borders will remain closed until at least 19 April.
This information may change at short notice. You must check flights / connecting flights with your travel agent / insurers before booking.
Those who arrive in Paraguay must comply with the self-isolation requirement for 14 days.
If you present symptoms, you should contact the Paraguayan Ministry of Health at 154 / 911 or INERAM hospital at (021) 290 838. British nationals in Paraguay should follow the advice of the Paraguayan authorities.
Local measures
Paraguayan authorities have declared a nationwide health-related State of Emergency.
There will be a ban on public transport services to the countryside from 5 to 12 April, as a measure to prevent the spread of the virus. However, normal public transport services within the metropolitan area will not be affected.
There is a ban on all non-essential movement nationwide until 19 April. There are exceptions to buy food, go to the pharmacy or hospital and for key workers. You should, therefore, stay in your accommodation unless absolutely necessary to go out.
Wearing facemasks in public, including on public transport, is now mandatory throughout Paraguay.
From 13 April, new restrictions for private vehicles apply nationwide:
Vehicles with plates ending in 0, 2, 4, 6, 8 can only use the road on Tuesdays, Thursdays and Saturdays.
Vehicles with plates ending in 1, 3, 5, 7, 9 can only use the road on Mondays, Wednesdays, Fridays and Sundays.
People who have tested positive for COVID-19 and do not need to be admitted to hospital, will stay in specialised shelters. This includes the following:
Those who would like to do so voluntarily
Those in vulnerable situations whose accommodation is not suitable for self-isolation (because it is crowded and/or small)
Those who have broken self-isolation
Those who have come from abroad and tested positive during their quarantine period
Further details can be found on the Paraguayan Ministry of Interior’s website (in Spanish).
The Paraguayan authorities have implemented measures such as the temporary closure of schools, universities and public parks. This measure also includes the cancellation of mass events (public and private) such as concerts, religious, sports, leisure and political activities plus gatherings in closed theatres such as cinemas and conventions.
All British nationals in Paraguay should follow the advice of the Paraguayan authorities.

Further information is also available on the Paraguayan Ministry of Interior’s website or the official Twitter channel (both in Spanish).
