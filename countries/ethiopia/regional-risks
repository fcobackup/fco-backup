The situation in Tigray is still fragile and there may still be isolated armed incidents. There may be restrictions on travel between towns and cities in Tigray, and on travel outside of Tigray.
Amhara region
FCDO advises against all travel to all of Amhara regional state.
There have been violent protests and clashes between security forces in Amhara since April 2023, resulting in an unknown number of deaths including of 11 aid workers.
Violence has increased due to conflict between local militia groups (Fano) and the security forces. Since spring 2023 there has been significant conflict in Amhara region, between Amhara militia groups (Fano) and the Ethiopian authorities, as well as opportunistic crime and banditry. Movement is heavily restricted, arbitrary detention is a risk and the security situation is very volatile.
There have been reports of incidents along the Addis Ababa to Bahir Dar (A3) road, including armed men attacking vehicles. Attacks usually take place in the early hours when visibility is poor. Be highly cautious and avoid travelling when visibility is poor. The A3 road can be subject to increased checkpoints and closure by the Ethiopian National Defense Force (ENDF).
Some flights across northern Ethiopia could be suspended or cancelled at short notice. Domestic and international land borders may be closed. Mobile networks and internet connections may be disrupted. You should monitor local media for further information and comply with local authority instructions.
There have been sporadic, violent clashes between armed groups in Amhara and in areas bordering Oromia region, including in urban centres. As these are not contained to specific areas, be cautious when travelling throughout Amhara. Situations can escalate quickly.
Political disputes in the districts (‘woredas’) of Tsegede, Mirab Armacho and Tach Armacho have previously turned violent. Clashes have occurred around Chilga Woreda and Central Gondar zone, with reports of fatalities including civilians. While attacks are mostly related to inter-ethnic disputes and foreigners have not been targeted, attacks can occur at any time with significant risk of being caught up in violence. If you’re travelling in the area, monitor local media and follow the advice of local authorities and your tour operator.
There has been an increase in roadblocks across Amhara region.
Afar region
FCDO advises against all travel to the parts of Afar region within 10km of the border with Eritrea.
There are irregular armed clashes between ethnic groups in Afar region and Somali Regional State, in particular along the main Addis Ababa to Djibouti road (A1) and the surrounding areas. Attacks are sporadic and infrequent, but may involve roadblocks and vehicles being targeted.
Danakil desert
If you plan to visit the Danakil desert area, be aware of the risk of excessive heat and difficult terrain in some areas, including around the Erta Ale volcano. Facilities are basic, with no running water and limited medical options.
Tourism in the area has been targeted by armed groups in 2007, 2012 and 2017. Only travel to this area with a recognised tour company. When booking, check that your group will be supported by an armed police or military escort.

There were reports in October 2023 of air strikes against armed groups in West Shewa. These could take place in a range of locations without notice. You should be extremely cautious when travelling in the West Shewa zone, particularly in rural areas.
There have been repeated and serious instances of violence in West Wollega, East Wollega, Kellem Wollega and Horo Gudru Wollega. This has included clashes between armed groups and security forces, violent crime and roadside attacks.
There are increased tensions and violence between armed groups and the security forces across Oromia region, particularly Shewa, Haraghe and Guji zones. Avoid military, police and security installations. Be extremely cautious and follow advice of local authorities.
Since late 2022, there has been an increase in incidents between armed groups in Oromia. These have mainly been reported in rural areas and areas bordering Amhara region. Incidents are not contained to specific areas. Be cautious when travelling, particularly between urban centres. The situation can escalate quickly.
Some protests have turned violent and resulted in casualties. There has also been severe disruption to road travel including major roads to and from Addis Ababa.
Protests and demonstrations occur periodically in towns across Oromia region. Towns in the Wollega and Shewa zones, and West Arsi zone, including Ambo, Wolissa, Nekemte and Shashemene, have been particularly affected.
