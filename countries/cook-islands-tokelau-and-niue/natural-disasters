Tropical cyclones
The South Pacific cyclone season begins on 1 November and runs until 30 April each year. A number of severe storms can be expected across the region in each cyclone season, although the precise risk varies between countries, as well as from season to season. On average there are around nine tropical cyclones each season, some of which will be classified as ‘severe’ (category 3 or higher).
You should monitor local and international weather reports and follow the advice of local authorities, including any evacuation orders. If you’re staying in a hotel, you should also follow the guidance of hotel management or your tour operator.
See our tropical cyclones page for advice about how to prepare for travel during cyclone season and what to do ahead of a storm.
Tsunamis
While all oceanic regions of the world can experience tsunamis, there is a heightened risk for low-lying island countries in seismically active regions, such as in the Pacific. You should follow any instructions issued by the local authorities in respect of tsunami threats.
