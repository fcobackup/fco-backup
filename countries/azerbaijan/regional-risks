Warning
FCDO advises against all travel to parts of Azerbaijan.

This section has safety advice for regions of Azerbaijan. It only covers regions where the Foreign, Commonwealth & Development Office (FCDO) has specific advice.
You should also read FCDO’s overall travel advice and safety and security advice.
Nagorno-Karabakh and surrounding areas
FCDO advises against all travel to:
Nagorno-Karabakh
the districts (‘rayons’) of Zengilan, Jabrayil, Qubadli, Lachin and Kelbajar on the Azerbaijan-Armenia border
western areas of the rayons of Khojavand, Fuzuli and Aghdam
Support from the British Embassy is severely limited in areas of Nagorno-Karabakh region.   
It is illegal to enter Nagorno-Karabakh without the permission of the Azerbaijani authorities. Anyone who has previously visited areas of Nagorno-Karabakh without the permission of the Azerbaijani authorities could be refused entry to Azerbaijan.
The Nagorno-Karabakh area is the subject of a continuing dispute between Azerbaijan and Armenia. Although a ceasefire was signed on 10 November 2020, tensions remain. On 19 September 2023, there was military action in Nagorno-Karabakh where civilian areas were hit, resulting in deaths and casualties. Further military activity cannot be ruled out.   
Several other civilian areas to the east of Nagorno-Karabakh were affected by the conflict and could also contain unexploded weapons and landmines. These areas include, but are not limited to, the towns and rayons of Barda, Tartar, Ganja, Beylagan and Aghjabadi. The Azerbaijani authorities are working to remove unexploded weapons and landmines. 
If you come across an unexploded weapon or landmine do not approach it or touch it. Make a note of where you saw it and notify the authorities on 102 or 112. Beware of more unexploded weapons or landmines nearby.

The FCDO also advises against all travel to within 5km of the rest of the border with Armenia. 
Borders with Iran and Georgia
The land borders between Iran and Azerbaijan, and Georgia and Azerbaijan are temporarily closed.
