This page has information on travelling to Ecuador. Check what you must do to return to the UK
This page reflects the UK government’s understanding of current rules for people travelling on a full ‘British Citizen’ passport, for the most common types of travel.
The authorities in Ecuador set and enforce entry rules.
All travellers
If you are a British passport holder visiting Ecuador for up to 90 days, you do not need a visa. If you plan to stay longer, you should consult the nearest Ecuadorean Embassy before travelling. On entry, you may be asked about your reason for travel, and asked to provide evidence of a return or onward flight/bus ticket.
All passengers are required to complete a Health Declaration Form with their itinerary and local contact details.
The land border with Peru remains closed. However, Ecuadorean nationals and foreign residents may be allowed to enter Ecuador, via the Huaquillas southern border checkpoint. The land border with Colombia opened in December 2021 to all travellers, but only through the ‘Rumichaca’ international checkpoint, from 8am to 5pm.
Most ports remain closed for travel/tourism activities. As of October 2021, international cruise ship operations are permitted in Esmeraldas, Guayaquil, Manta and Puerto Baquerizo ports.
International commercial flights are operating to and from Ecuador. However, we highly recommend you to contact your airline/travel company to check your travel itinerary, in case of any last minute COVID-19-related changes.
As of October 2021, international cruise ship operations are authorised at the following ports: Esmeraldas, Manta, Guayaquil and Puerto Bolivar. However, there are strict guidelines and measures to comply with to obtain the relevant permissions.
Testing / screening on arrival to Ecuador
Travellers over 3 years old have the option to either present their full COVID-19 vaccination certificate (i.e. both doses for those vaccinations which consist of two doses), received at least 14 days prior the flight date, or a negative RT-qPCR test , taken up to 72 hours prior to boarding their flight.
There are no requirements for travellers under 3 years old.
Passengers arriving from countries whose regulations state that COVID-19 vaccination is available only after 6 months of having been infected, and who are thus unable to show their full vaccination certificate, will be required to present together with their COVID-19 infection certificate, an official document proving the above dispensation and regulation (valid for 6 months).
Quarantine requirements
If, on arrival, a passenger presents COVID-19 related symptoms, they will be evaluated by a Ministry of Public Health (MSP) representative, prior to entering the immigration control area. Suspected cases of COVID-19 will be required to take a rapid antigen test. If the result is positive, the passenger will be instructed to self-isolate for 10 days.
Non-residents must self-isolate in a hotel at their own expense. If self-isolation is required, the passenger must include the contact number and full address where they will self-isolate on the Health Status Declaration Form. Compliance with the isolation requirement and the passenger’s state of health will be monitored via telephone calls.
Local residents can self-isolate at their homes.
The Ministry of Public Health has published more information on coronavirus protocols and direct contact options (Spanish only).
The Government will monitor the situation in other countries with high risk of contagion to prevent incoming flights.
If you’re fully vaccinated
If you are fully vaccinated, you can enter Ecuador. At least 14 days must have passed since your second dose of the vaccine, and the vaccine must be approved by the World Health Organisation.
Proof of vaccinated status
Travellers over 3 can present proof that they have been fully vaccinated to enter Ecuador. Alternatively they can show a negative RT-qPCR test result, taken up to 72 hours prior to boarding the flight.
Airline crew members and children under 3 years old are exempt from these requirements.
Ecuador will accept the UK’s proof of COVID-19 recovery and vaccination record and proof of COVID-19 vaccination issued in the Crown Dependencies. Your NHS appointment card from vaccination centres is not designed to be used as proof of vaccination and should not be used to demonstrate your vaccine status.
If you’re not fully vaccinated
If you are not fully vaccinated you must present a, RT-qPCR test, taken up to 72 hours prior to boarding your flight, in order to enter Ecuador.
Airline crew members and children under 3 years old are exempt from these requirements.
If you’ve had COVID-19 in the past year
If you are not fully vaccinated but have tested positive for COVID-19 in the last year, you can enter Ecuador. You will need to show evidence of a positive PCR test (taken more than 14 days and less than a year ago).
You can use the UK’s proof of COVID-19 recovery and vaccination record to demonstrate proof of COVID-19 recovery when entering Ecuador.
Visitors previously diagnosed with COVID-19 and who continue to test positive with an RT-PCR test after a month, should present a medical certificate issued in the country of origin which indicates that they are non-infectious. This will be accepted as long as they are no longer showing symptoms.
Residents of Ecuador
Travellers over 3 years old must present either their full COVID-19 vaccination certificate (i.e. both doses for those vaccinations which consist of two doses), received at least 14 days prior the flight date, or an RT-qPCR test, taken no more than 72 hours prior to boarding their flight.
If you are resident in Ecuador your passport should be stamped on entry. For further information, see our Living in Ecuador guide.
Children and young people
Children between 3 and 16 years old must submit either their full COVID-19 vaccination certificate, with at least 14 days validity, or a negative RT-qPCR test taken 72 hours before the flight.
See the requirements for travelling with children.
Travel to and from the Galapagos Islands
Travellers over 3 years old must present a full COVID-19 vaccination certificate or a negative RT-qPCR test taken 72 hours before their flight to the Galapagos.
Any passengers presenting COVID-19 related symptoms will be denied entry to the Islands. National and foreign tourists must also present evidence of a return flight, as well as the Galapagos Transit Control Card, to be filled out online at least 24 hours before the flight. Travel health insurance is mandatory for foreign tourists.
For inter-island travel, all passengers over 12 years must present their complete vaccination certificate.
If you are transiting through Ecuador
If you are transiting through Ecuador, you are subject to the same COVID-19 requirements as for entering Ecuador, such as a fully vaccination status.
Ecuador’s land border with Peru remains closed until further notice.
Exemptions
Airline crew members and children under the age of 3 are exempt from Ecuador’s current entry requirements (presenting the COVID-19 vaccination certificate and/or negative PCR test).
Check your passport and travel documents before your travel.
Passport validity
Both visitors and residents must have a minimum of 6 months’ validity on their passport from the date of entry.
This is a strict legal requirement from the Ecuadorean government. If your passport does not meet this requirement, you will be denied entry to Ecuador.
Check with your travel provider to make sure your passport and other travel documents meet their requirements.
Visas
On arrival in Ecuador, you will be allowed to remain in the country for up to 90 days within a 12 month period.
You can extend your 90 days (only once) online by a further 90 days by paying a fee. If you wish to extend your stay, you must begin the extension process before the first 90 day period expires. For general immigration information, please visit the Ecuadorean Migration website. For general enquiries contact: servicios.migratorios@ministeriodegobierno.gob.ec.
If you wish to stay longer, you should consult the nearest Ecuadorean Embassy before travelling. For further details on visa applications in Ecuador, check the Ministry of Foreign Affairs website.
The MFA is encouraging customers not to approach their offices across the country without a confirmed appointment (including for residence visa renewals and other services). For general guidance contact: consejeria@cancilleria.gob.ec citasvisas@cancilleriga.gob.ec
Get the relevant emails for other MFA’s Coordinaciones Zonales here.
The penalty for overstaying is a fine. As with other immigration offences, if the fine is not paid, you will not be able to return to Ecuador for 1 year and your name will remain on immigration records. If the fine is paid, you can return with an official visa issued by an Ecuadorean Embassy overseas.
If you wish to work or study in Ecuador, check visa requirements with the Ecuadorean Embassy in London before travelling.
As of January 2019, permanent and temporary resident visas are issued electronically. Ecuadorean visas are no longer stuck in passports. The online visa is sent by email.
If you enter Ecuador via the border with Peru (currently closed) or Colombia, you must ensure you get an official entry stamp at the border showing the date of your arrival. There have been cases of buses not stopping at the border, which has caused great difficulties for foreign visitors for failing to comply with immigration regulations. Travellers may be requested to return to the border entry point to get the required stamp and entry registration. If there is no exit stamp from the country you are coming from, the Ecuadorean immigration officials cannot give you an entry stamp, thus you will be denied entry.
Although local regulations may not always be implemented, all visitors to the Galapagos Islands should provide a copy of their hotel booking. Likewise, visitors staying with local residents in the islands should have an invitation letter from their host available. The maximum stay in the Galapagos Islands as a tourist is 60 days.
UK Emergency Travel Documents
UK Emergency Travel Documents (ETD) are also accepted for entry, airside transit and exit from Ecuador. Your emergency travel document must be valid for a minimum period of 6 months from the date of entry into Ecuador.
Yellow fever certificate requirements
Check whether you need a yellow fever certificate by visiting the National Travel Health Network and Centre’s TravelHealthPro website. Please check if you will be required to present a yellow fever certificate to travel to your next destination from Ecuador. See Health.
Travelling with children
Under Ecuadorean law, children under the age of 18 born in Ecuador are automatically considered as Ecuadorean citizens, even if travelling on a British passport (dual nationals).
They, along with British minors who have resident status in Ecuador, will need notarised written consent from the non-accompanying parent(s) to be allowed to leave the country. In non-straightforward situations due to a legal dispute, the child will need a judicial written permission (Autorización de Viaje Judicial) issued by a judge (Juzgado de la Niñez y Adolescencia). If one of the parents is deceased, the other parent would need to submit the death certificate to a public notary, so that an indefinite notarial permit to travel with the child is issued. The immigration authorities are responsible for checking all the above legal documents.
British children (or British-Ecuadorean dual nationals) who have tourist status in Ecuador do not need these permissions.
