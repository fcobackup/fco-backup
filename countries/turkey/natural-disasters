Earthquakes
Many parts of Turkey are subject to earthquakes and tremors.
You should familiarise yourself with safety procedures in the event of an earthquake and follow any advice given by the local authorities.
The US Federal Emergency Management Agency has information about what to do before, during and after an earthquake.
Forest Fires
Forest fires occur frequently in Turkey during the summer months, when temperatures can reach over 40ºC. Take care when visiting or driving through woodland areas.
Imprisonment and judicial fines are imposed for lighting a fire of any kind in forbidden areas including barbecues, leaving a fire without extinguishing it, or throwing burning cigarette butts into the forest.
Check on the outbreak of fires with the local authorities. If there is a forest fire in your area, you may be told to vacate your accommodation by local police, gendarme, fire fighters and/or the Disaster and Emergency Management Authorities (AFAD). Follow the direction of the local authorities.
If you see a forest fire, call the emergency services on 112.
Floods
Severe rainstorms can cause flooding and landslides across Turkey. This can hamper overland travel and reduce the provision of essential services. Roads may become impassable and bridges damaged.
If you’re in an affected area:
monitor local media for the latest information
follow the instructions of local authorities, including evacuation orders
