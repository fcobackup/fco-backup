There have been large gatherings of people in Barcelona and other areas of the Catalonia region in relation to political developments there. Further gatherings and demonstrations are likely to take place. You should exercise caution in the vicinity of demonstrations as they may occur with little or no warning. Demonstrations intended to be peaceful can escalate and turn confrontational.
Demonstrations may cause disruptions to transport including access to airports, roads and the railway and metro systems. Barcelona Tourism has launched a telephone line for those tourists that have missed their flight or couldn’t make it to their hotel: +34 93 285 3834.

The extreme weather alert issued by Spain’s meteorological office (AEMET) has now been lifted. Damage caused by flash flooding continues to affect some areas in the south of the Alicante and Murcia regions, causing some disruption to local transport and secondary road closures. If you are in these areas you should follow the advice of the local authorities.
Temperatures regularly reach over 40ºC in Spain during the summer months. These temperatures bring an increased risk of forest fires. Make sure cigarettes are properly extinguished and don’t leave empty bottles behind in woodland areas. Causing a forest fire is treated as a criminal offence in Spain even if unintentional. There are strict regulations across much of Spain against lighting outdoor barbecues in forest areas and penalties imposed include heavy fines. You should be aware that some regions prohibit the use of outdoor barbecues in public picnic areas during the summer months. Check on the outbreak of fires with the local civil protection authority and report any you see immediately to the emergency services on 112. See Natural disasters
