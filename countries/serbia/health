Before you travel check that:
your destination can provide the healthcare you may need
you have appropriate travel insurance for local treatment or unexpected medical evacuation
This is particularly important if you have a health condition or are pregnant.
Emergency medical number
Dial 194 and ask for an ambulance.
Contact your insurance or medical assistance company promptly if you’re referred to a medical facility for treatment.
Vaccinations and health risks
At least 8 weeks before your trip check:
the latest information on vaccinations and health risks in TravelHealthPro’s Serbia guide
where to get vaccines and whether you have to pay on the NHS travel vaccinations page
Medication
The legal status and regulation of some medicines prescribed or bought in the UK can be different in other countries.
Read best practice when travelling with medicines on TravelHealthPro.
The NHS has information on whether you can take your medicine abroad.
Healthcare facilities in Serbia
You can view a list of English-speaking doctors in Serbia.
There is a reciprocal healthcare agreement for British nationals visiting Serbia, which entitles you to free emergency treatment. To get treatment you must show:
a British passport
evidence of registration with the local police (if you’re not staying in a hotel)
a certificate confirming entitlement to benefit under the UK Social Security Acts – you can get the certificate from HM Revenue & Customs before you travel or contact the British Embassy if you need assistance
You may need to pay cash for non-emergency treatment or treatment that is not covered under the reciprocal agreement. Make sure you can access money to cover medical treatment.
Some private clinics in Serbia offer treatment for addiction which may not meet UK standards. Seek advice from your local GP or health provider in the UK before undertaking any treatment.
Travel and mental health
Read FCDO guidance on travel and mental health. There is also mental health guidance on TravelHealthPro.
