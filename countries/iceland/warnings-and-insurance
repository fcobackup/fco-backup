Volcanic eruption and earthquakes
Iceland is volcanic and seismically active. Recently there have been a series of volcanic eruptions on the Reykjanes peninsula in south-west Iceland, the latest occurring on 14 January. These have affected the town of Grindavik and area to the north of it. All roads to Grindavik and surrounding area are closed and you should stay away from this area. Keflavik International Airport has been unaffected and is operating as normal. The capital city, Reykjavik, and the rest of Iceland has not been impacted by these eruptions. It is likely there will be further eruptions in this location. You should monitor local media for updates and follow the authoritiesâ€™ advice on travel to the area.
