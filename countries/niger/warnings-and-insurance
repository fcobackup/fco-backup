FCDO advises against all travel to Niger, including the capital city of Niamey, for security reasons.
Security situation in Niger
There has been a military takeover in Niger, which has led to protests and unrest.
These protests may be violent and the security situation could change quickly without warning.
Travel within or out of Niger is at your own risk. The FCDO cannot offer advice on the safety of travelling to any departure point within Niger. 
Nigerien airspace has reopened, however there could be disruptions to commercial flights from Niamey’s Diori International Airport at short notice.
