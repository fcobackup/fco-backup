Crime
Most visitors to the Maldives stay in “resort hotels” where crime levels are relatively low. Nevertheless petty crime, including the theft of goods left unattended on the beach or in hotel rooms, does occur. You should take care of your valuables and other personal possessions, especially when travelling in Male’. Use safe deposit boxes on island resorts.
Away from the exclusive resort islands, gang related violence including knife crime does occur, including in the capital Male’ and in Hulhumale’. There is no evidence that British nationals are being targeted by criminal groups. You should be vigilant when travelling to areas outside of resort islands.
Local travel
Most visitors to Maldives spend their time on resort islands and would only visit the capital island, Male’, if they choose to go on a specific excursion there. The international airport is on a separate island within the larger Male’ atoll.
Travel between islands is by boat or seaplane, and many of these services stop before sunset.
Sea travel
The threat of piracy related activity and armed robbery in the Gulf of Aden and Indian Ocean remains significant. Reports of attacks on local fishing dhows in the area around the Gulf of Aden and Horn of Africa continue. The combined threat assessment of the international Naval Counter Piracy Forces remains that all sailing yachts under their own passage should remain out of the designated High Risk Area or face the risk of being hijacked and held hostage for ransom. For more information and advice, see our Piracy and armed robbery at sea page.
Swimming
The sea around the Maldives can have strong tidal currents and a number of tourists drown every year. You should always take local advice before entering the sea.
Political situation
Political protests in the capital Male’ take place occasionally. You should exercise caution and avoid any protests or rallies. Outlying islands, resorts or Male’ International Airport are not usually affected by protests or rallies.
