Crime
The general security situation is unpredictable, and crime levels remain high. There has been an increase in violent robberies and muggings, targeting pedestrians and cars, some of which have resulted in fatalities, in areas popular with foreign residents, such as Petionville and Peguy Ville.
You should seek advice from local contacts or established organisations and make arrangements for your safety and security throughout your stay in Haiti. You should avoid travelling alone. Travel with others, especially those with reliable local knowledge. You should avoid displaying expensive items of jewellery and other valuables, and carrying large sums of money.
Avoid parking your car on the street. Park inside secure car parks at venues such as restaurants, and avoid leaving alone if possible. Avoid travelling at night. Extra care should be taken when visiting downtown Port au Prince. See Local travel
There is a threat of kidnapping in Port-au-Prince (including Petionville). Kidnappers target those who are perceived to be wealthy, and both Haitians and foreign nationals have been victims of kidnapping. The long-standing policy of the British government is not to make substantive concessions to hostage takers. The British government considers that paying ransoms for the release of hostages increases the risk of further hostage taking.
Avoid using banks or withdrawing money at cash points where you may be observed and the target of criminals. If necessary, make withdrawals from cash machines in supermarkets or hotels with security guards. Always be aware of your surroundings and who might be watching you. Gangs, often on motorbikes, target people making cash withdrawals or leaving banks, particularly those travelling on foot.
Security guards are recommended at residential properties.
Local travel
The FCO advise against all but essential travel to the Carrefour, Cite Soleil, Martissant and Bel Air neighbourhoods of Port au Prince, due to the high risk of criminal activity. UK government officials use an armoured vehicle when travelling to, and through, these areas.
If you visit low income or slum areas you may attract unwanted attention from people who assume you can help them. If you do enter these areas, don’t travel on foot, take sensible precautions and go with someone who has local knowledge and can speak Kreyol.
You should avoid using taxis. TapTaps and Cyclotaxis are both unsafe and often not roadworthy.
Be vigilant when travelling around and take the following precautions:
avoid travelling at night
always travel with a knowledgeable and reliable guide
avoid all public transport and only use rented cars with a local driver from a reliable agency (Avis, Budget, etc)
make sure you have all the supplies you might need for your stay; fuel, food and water shortages are likely
be aware that the security situation in Haiti can change at short notice, so monitor local news and follow the advice of the local authorities
Travelling to and from Toussaint Louverture International Airport
There have been reports of violent robberies targeting people as they arrive at Toussaint Louverture International Airport and as they travel by road to and from the airport. Be especially vigilant when travelling from the airport to your accommodation, including at your end destination.
You should avoid using taxis (see Local Travel). Arrange secure transport in advance and exercise caution when parking. You should avoid displaying expensive items of jewellery and other valuables, and carrying large sums of money.
Road travel
Take extra care on the road between Haiti and the Dominican Republic. There have been armed robberies in the Dominican Republic on roads close to the border with Haiti, including by criminals dressed as police officers.
Frequent blockades at border routes, often by disaffected drivers and traders, can make crossing difficult and can turn violent. ‘Route Nationale’ roads are subject to sudden and improvised blockades, such as burning tyres. In April 2017, Route Nationale 1, which heads north from Port-au-Prince, was subject to daily, and sometimes violent, demonstrations at Archaie. You should monitor the local news and follow the advice of the local authorities before setting out on any journeys.
If you’re crossing the border by land, be prepared for long queues at the 4 crossing points. Make sure you have all the correct vehicle documentation and cash to pay exit and entry fees. Long stretches of the route are isolated, and without mobile phone reception. Aim to complete your entire journey during daylight.
Most main routes in and between towns and cities are in good or reasonable condition, but there are exceptions – especially in remote areas where some roads can only be travelled in 4x4 vehicles and with great care.
Research your journey carefully and consult those with reliable local knowledge. You should monitor local news, and follow the advice of the local authorities.
Drainage is poor and flooding is common after rainfall. Roads are often unlit and it is not uncommon after dark to encounter cars, trucks and motorcycles driving without lights. Pedestrians also walk in the middle of unlit roads. You should drive cautiously at all times. Research your journey carefully before you set out and have back up options if needed. A UK driving licence is only valid for 3 months in Haiti. For longer stays, you should get an International Driving Permit.
A number of coach lines operate daily services between Cap Haitien and Santo Domingo, and between Petionville and Santo Domingo. The journey takes between 6 –to 8 hours.
Air travel
A list of recent incidents and accidents can be found on the website of the Aviation Safety network.
The FCO can’t offer advice on the safety of individual airlines. However, the International Air Transport Association publishes a list of registered airlines that have been audited and found to meet a number of operational safety standards and recommended practices. This list is not exhaustive and the absence of an airline from this list does not necessarily mean that it is unsafe.
In 2012 an audit by the International Civil Aviation Organisation (ICAO) found that the level of implementation of the critical elements of safety oversight in Haiti was well below the global average. In light of the significant safety concerns identified by ICAO in respect of Haiti’s ability to provide oversight of its airlines, no Haitian airline is permitted to operate commercial services to/from the UK or its overseas territories. UK government officials are advised not to use Haitian registered airlines.
Safety concerns have been raised about INSEL Air. The US and Netherlands authorities have prohibited their staff from using the airline while safety checks are being carried out. UK government officials have been told to do the same as a precaution.
Political situation
Jovenel Moise was inaugurated as president of Haiti on 7 February 2017 following elections in November 2016.
The political situation in Haiti is extremely fluid and unpredictable and demonstrations have become increasingly violent. While most common in Port au Prince, other main cities, and border crossings, they can occur anywhere and for seemingly innocent reasons, and can spiral out of control.
You should avoid political rallies, demonstrations and crowds.
Demonstrations may often be accompanied by improvised road blocks (also see Road travel). Curfews and new security regulations can be announced at short notice. You should avoid all demonstrations, monitor local news and follow the advice of the local authorities.
Demonstrations and protest marches often take place in Port-au-Prince and other cities, especially Cap Haitien, Les Cayes and Jeremie. Most recently these have centred around food and aid distribution and, since the 2016 elections, socio-economic challenges such as pay and the increased price of food, fuel and basic commodities.
The UN Mission for Justice Support in Haiti (MINUJUSTH) was established on 16 October 2017. MINUJUSTH, which replaced the UN Stabilization Mission in Haiti (MINUSTAH), focusses on assisting the Government of Haiti to strengthen rule of law institutions, and further support and develop the Haitian National Police (HNP). On 10 April 2018, the UN Security Council agreed to extend MINUJUSTH’s role in Haiti for 12 months, until April 2019.
Communications
Mobile telephones are widely used and mobile data is available from some service providers (Digicel, Natcom). Signal reception varies greatly but is generally acceptable around Port-au-Prince and other cities. You can buy local SIM cards and prepaid cards widely across the country.
