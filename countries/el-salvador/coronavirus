Cases of coronavirus (COVID-19) have been confirmed in El Salvador. The Government of El Salvador have introduced a number of precautionary measures including banning entry to foreigners. Only Salvadorans, foreign residents and accredited diplomats are permitted to enter the country, and even then under strict conditions.
On the 14 March, a state of emergency was declared in response to the threat to public health related to the coronavirus (COVID-19) pandemic. This suspends some freedoms of assembly and movement. On 21 March the Government imposed a 30 day 24/7 national curfew, with exceptions only for designated essential workers. British nationals should comply with this and other emergency measures. Key services (including supermarkets, pharmacies, banks, petrol stations and take away/home delivery food outlets) will operate, and one individual per household can go out to buy essential supplies. Schools and universities and many other businesses and organisations are closed.
Following confirmation of the first COVID-19 case on 18 March, President Bukele announced that anyone diagnosed with COVID-19 would be required to receive care in a Government designated facility, to reduce the risk of transmission.
You should comply with any additional screening measures put in place by the authorities. For further information, please check with the Salvadoran General Directorate of Migration and the Ministry of Health webpage.
El Salvador International Airport has suspended passenger flight operations until at least 31 March, and will only receive air cargo and humanitarian missions in the meantime.
The closure of the airport is the part of a series of restrictions introduced by the Government with little to no advance warning. British Nationals remaining in El Salvador should be prepared for further measures to be introduced at short notice.
