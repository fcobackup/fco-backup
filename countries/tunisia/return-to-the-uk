A limited number of flights from Tunisia to European destinations are currently operating. Tunisia’s borders will officially reopen on 27 June for international travel.
Air France has flights throughout June, which are available to book online. Advice on requirements for transiting France, or other countries, is available on the Travel Advice pages for each country.
Other airlines are operating irregular flights to other destinations. The British Embassy Tunis consular team is issuing regular updates about departure options from Tunisia by email (subscribe at tunisconsular.enquiries@fco.gov.uk).
You will need to pay for your return travel to the UK. If you cannot afford the travel costs and have exhausted all other options for getting funds, you may be eligible to apply for an emergency loan from the government. This is a last resort option and you would need to repay the loan when you are back in the UK.
For more information, you should contact Corporate Travel Management (CTM). CTM are a commercial partner of the FCO and are authorised to administer such loans on behalf of the FCO.
