Entry rules in response to coronavirus
Rules to enter Thailand change frequently. You should keep up to date with the latest information on the websites of the Ministry of Foreign Affairs, Royal Thai Embassy London, Civil Aviation Authority of Thailand, and the Ministry of Public Health.
You can still apply to enter Thailand under the Alternative Quarantine scheme. If you are fully vaccinated you can also use the Phuket Sandbox.
The Thailand Pass scheme is now closed for all new Test and Go and Sandbox applications, except for the Phuket Sandbox.
If you have already received your Thailand Pass QR code, you can still enter Thailand under the scheme you registered for
If you registered to enter Thailand before 22nd December but have not yet received your QR code, you must wait for your application to be processed. Once approved, you can enter Thailand under the scheme you registered for
If you are already in Thailand or are due to arrive in Thailand under the Test and Go and Sandbox scheme, you must undergo your second RT-PCR test at a government-designated facility (ATK self-testing not accepted). The test will be free of charge
Travellers from South Africa, Namibia, Zimbabwe, Botswana, Lesotho, Eswatini, Malawi or Mozambique are currently unable to enter Thailand. If you need to travel urgently, contact your local Thai Embassy. Travellers from other countries in Africa must quarantine for 14 days on arrival in Thailand. See the Thailand Pass website for more information.
When you arrive
Foreigners arriving in Thailand will be tested for COVID-19 on entry and again during quarantine – see Entry section above.
Travelling with children
Children can enter Thailand under the same scheme as their parents. You may be separated from your children if they test positive for covid-19. If this happens and you need help, you can call the Embassy on +66 (0)2 305 8333. For further information on healthcare in Thailand, please see the Coronavirus section.
If you’re fully vaccinated
Fully vaccinated people can enter Thailand under the Phuket Sandbox and Alternative Quarantine schemes – see Entry section above. You must take a PCR test before you leave the UK and when you arrive in Thailand. If you use the Alternative Quarantine scheme you must stay in approved accommodation for 7 days. More information on entry requirements are on the Tourism Authority of Thailand website.
Demonstrating your COVID-19 status
If you received your vaccine in the UK you can use your NHS vaccine record as proof of vaccine status in Thailand. You must have received your final vaccine dose at least 14 days before your date of travel. Your NHS appointment card from vaccination centres is not designed to be used as proof of vaccination and should not be used to demonstrate your vaccine status.
If you’re not vaccinated or partially vaccinated
Travellers from all countries who are not fully vaccinated must quarantine at a State Quarantine or Alternative State Quarantine (ASQ) facility for 10 days. You cannot use the Phuket Sandbox.
You may be required to download the Thai Chana COVID-19 tracking app when you arrive.
If you usually live in Thailand
If you have a Thai resident visa and usually live in Thailand but you cannot return within the required year, the Thailand authorities will grant you an extension to your compulsory return deadline. You must return to Thailand as soon as you can.
Visas
You need a valid visa to stay in Thailand. If you do not have a valid visa you will have to pay overstay penalties. You should speak to your local Immigration Office or visit the Thai Immigration website.
You are legally required to have a valid passport in Thailand. If your passport expires, your visa will become invalid . If you need to renew or apply for a new British passport, see Overseas British passport applications.
If you cannot renew or change your visa and are not able to travel to the UK (because the border is closed, for example) contact the British Embassy in Bangkok.
If you have queries about visas or entry requirements, check with the Royal Thai Embassy, Thai Immigration Authority and Thai Ministry of Foreign Affairs.
Thai authorities may introduce further measures in response to COVID-19. You can monitor the latest updates from Thailand’s Ministry of Public Health website.
Regular entry requirements
Passport validity
Your passport must have at least 6 months’ validity remaining from your date of entry into Thailand. You may be refused entry to Thailand if your passport is damaged or has pages missing.
If you’re a dual national, you must leave Thailand on the same passport you used to enter. If you don’t, you may experience difficulties as you pass through immigration.
Visas
For current information on entry and visa requirements refer to Entry rules in response to coronavirus.
Under normal circumstances, British passport holders arriving by air or land can enter Thailand for 30 days without a visa (a ‘visa exemption’). If you need to stay longer, you can extend your stay once for up to 30 days. You must apply for the extension before your visa exemption period ends.
You can enter Thailand through a land border using the 30-day visa exemption 2 times in one year. If you need to enter by land more than this, you’ll need to get the appropriate visa before you travel. For more information, contact the nearest Thai embassy or consulate.
If you plan to stay for more than 30 days or you will work in Thailand. you must get the appropriate visa before you travel
The only legal way to get a new visa, entry permit or extension of stay is from a Thai Embassy or Consulate, an Immigration Officer when you enter Thailand, or one of the Immigration Offices around the country. Visas issued by visa shops, travel agents or by any other means are likely to be illegal and lead to criminal proceedings.
If you stay beyond the period of your visa (‘overstay’), you’ll be fined 500 baht per day up to a maximum of 20,000 baht. You also risk being held in detention, fined, deported at your own expense and banned from re-entering Thailand. The enforcement of penalties for overstaying is strict and conditions in detention centres can be harsh. Deportation by the Thai authorities can be a lengthy process and you will also be banned from re-entering Thailand for up to 10 years.
If you’re living or staying in Thailand on a long-term visa, immigration rules can be complex and are subject to change. It is your responsibility to ensure you meet the requirements of your visa. Stay informed and contact your local immigration office for more information.
If you have any queries about visas or entry requirements, check with the Royal Thai Embassy or Thai Immigration Authority.
Proof of onward travel and funds
Immigration officials in Thailand may ask you for proof of onward travel (eg a return or onward air ticket). You should make all reservations before travelling to Thailand. Some airlines have refused to board passengers without evidence of onward travel.
Immigration officials may also ask for evidence of adequate finances and have refused entry to people who could not show this. This is not defined in law and can be interpreted in a number of ways.
Employment
To work in Thailand you will need a work permit or business visa. Failure to follow this rule can lead to arrest and deportation.
Yellow fever certificate requirements
Check whether you need a yellow fever certificate by visiting the National Travel Health Network and Centre’s TravelHealthPro website.
UK Emergency Travel Documents
UK Emergency Travel Documents (ETDs) are accepted for entry, airside transit and exit from Thailand. If you’re planning to enter Thailand using a UK ETD, you should contact the nearest Thai Embassy or Consulate before you travel to seek advice about whether a visa is required. If you’re requesting a 2-way ETD from Thailand, you must provide proof that you have a non-immigrant visa.
