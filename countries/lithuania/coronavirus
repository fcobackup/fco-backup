If you have symptoms of COVID-19 or have been in contact with a confirmed case within the previous 14 days, call the 1808 Lithuanian public health hotline to request a test.
Individuals testing positive for COVID-19 will be required to self-isolate for at least 14 days.
If you do not have access to a private vehicle, you will need to travel to the testing centre by taxi. You are advised to check at the time of booking whether the taxi company is able to take you to a testing centre, as some taxis may not have the precautions in place to provide this service.
