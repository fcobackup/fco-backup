Cases of coronavirus (COVID-19) have been confirmed in Chad. The Chadian authorities have introduced a number of measures to limit the spread of the virus.
Protective measures are being implemented at N’Djamena international airport. Those arriving may be asked to undergo additional screening, in particular if you are arriving from China, South Korea, Iran, Italy and France.
You should comply with any additional screening measures put in place by the authorities. It is possible that the Chadian authorities may escort you to medical facilities located in the capital, or to self-isolate and/or embark departing flights from N’Djamena within 24 hours.
If you need further information about entry requirements, contact the local immigration authorities or the nearest Chadian Embassy. You should also check with your airline or travel company for the latest information.
