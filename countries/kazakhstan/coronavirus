The Kazakh authorities have introduced a number of precautionary measures in response to the coronavirus (COVID-19) pandemic.
Entry and borders
Most foreign nationals, including those from the UK, are currently prevented from travelling to Kazakhstan. Those who do arrive are subject to 24 hours mandatory quarantine while testing for COVID-19 takes place. All travellers to Kazakhstan are then subject to health monitoring and mandatory follow-up measures aimed at preventing the spread of coronavirus. These measures may vary according to the severity of the outbreak in the country of origin, and could include: daily health monitoring by telephone call after arrival; health monitoring at the travellerâ€™s place of residence, or quarantine in a hospital for 14 days. You should carry additional supplies of necessary medication and toiletries in carry-on luggage.
If you need further information about entry requirements, contact the local immigration authorities or the nearest Kazakh embassy. You should also check with your airline or travel company for the latest information.
