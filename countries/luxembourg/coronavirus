Travel in Luxembourg
In response to a sharp rise in the number of COVID-19 cases in Luxembourg, additional measures have been put in place to limit the spread of the virus.
The Luxembourg government has introduced a curfew, and people are required to remain at home from11pm to 6am. Outings during these hours are only permitted in certain specified circumstances; these can be accessed with further details on the Luxembourg government website.
Other restrictions include the ‘rule of four’, limiting the number of people allowed to gather at home or in bars and restaurants. Gatherings of 4 to 10 people in a public space are allowed, subject to wearing of a mask. With some exceptions, gatherings of 10 to 100 people are allowed on condition that people are assigned seating, observe 2 metre distancing and wear a mask. Eating and drinking is not allowed at gatherings of more than four people. To find out more about local restrictions, please refer to the Luxembourg government website.
You must wear a face covering and observe the standard social distancing requirement when travelling through Luxembourg Airport (Findel). Your mask should not be removed during security control. Hand sanitiser is available throughout the terminal where hand washing is unavailable.

Breaches of regulations can result in fines of up to €500.
