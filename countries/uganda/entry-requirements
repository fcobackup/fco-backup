Regular entry requirements
Visas 
You’ll need a visa to enter Uganda. You can apply for a visa at the Ugandan High Commission in London or apply online for an ‘e-visa’. You can find full details of how to apply on the website of the Ugandan High Commission in London. You should give yourself sufficient time to apply for a visa and make sure when applying that the start date and validity covers the period you wish to travel.
You can also apply for an East African Tourist Visa. This is valid for 90 days and allows multiple entry into Kenya, Rwanda and Uganda. You can apply for this visa on the ‘e-visa’ website.
Ugandan immigration officers decide how long travellers are permitted to stay in Uganda when they enter the country. This is usually between 2 weeks and 3 months, and the immigration officer will normally enter a handwritten note of this period next to the entry stamp in your passport. You can usually be fined and/or imprisoned for overstaying your visa. However Immigration offices in Uganda are closed until further notice. The Ministry of Internal Affairs have advised that fines accrued for overstaying visa/permits from the 18 March to 17 May 2020 are waived. They have also advised that foreign nationals who are in Uganda with expired visas/permits will not be arrested.
