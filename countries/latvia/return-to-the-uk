There are currently no commercial options available to return to the UK from Latvia. On 14 March, the Latvian Government announced a number of measures to limit the spread of the virus. This means that:
British nationals are permitted to exit Latvia at designated land border crossing points, but there is no guarantee of onward travel.
The international transit of passengers through airports and ports, by bus and rail, is suspended.
The movement of passengers and vehicles through border crossing points at airports and ports, on road and railway lines at the external border of the European Union is prohibited. This also applies to border crossing points intended for local border traffic, with the exception of the carriage of goods.
We know this is concerning for British people trying to leave Latvia. The UK government is working closely with airlines, the Latvian authorities and other governments to make sure options are available for you to return to the UK as soon as possible.
