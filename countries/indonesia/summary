The Foreign and Commonwealth Office (FCO) advise against all travel to:
within 4 kilometres of the Mount Agung crater in east Bali
within 7 kilometres of the Mount Sinabung crater in Kalo Regency, North Sumatra
These are exclusion zones put in place by the local authorities due to ongoing volcanic activity. If you’re in either exclusion zone, you should leave immediately. See Mount Agung and Mount Sinabung
The FCO advise against all but essential travel to:
the city of Palu and the districts of Donggala, Mamuju Utara, Sigi and Parigi Moutong in Central Sulawesi, following a 7.4 magnitude earthquake and tsunami on 28 September 2018
A 7.4 magnitude earthquake and tsunami hit Central Sulawesi on 28 September 2018, affecting the Donggala, Palu, Mamuju, Utara, Sigi and Parigi Moutong regions and causing a significant number of casualties and widespread damage. Communications, water and electricity supplies, buildings and transport infrastructure were all severely damaged. Information and advice on safety considerations in an active earthquake zone is available from the International Rescue Corps. If you have essential upcoming travel in these areas or plan to travel for non-essential reasons against FCO advice, you should plan your journey very carefully, have robust contingency plans in place and check with your travel insurance provider.
There were a series of major earthquakes and a significant number of aftershocks to the north-east of the island of Lombok in late July, August and September 2018. The earthquakes resulted in over 500 deaths and significant damage to buildings and infrastructure, most severely in northern and western areas of Lombok, north of the capital Mataram.
The Gili Islands (Gili Trewangan, Gili Meno and Gili Air) were also significantly affected by the earthquakes. However, they have recovered rapidly, with utilities and transport connections restored.
The FCO no longer advise against all but essential travel to these areas. However, if travelling to Lombok or the islands you should exercise caution, particularly around damaged buildings.
There are many active volcanoes in Indonesia, any of which can erupt with little or no warning. This often results in the evacuation of villages within a 3 to 7 kilometre radius and disruption to air travel in the wider region. In the past, repeated eruptions have caused destruction and fatalities. Check media reports before travelling to areas that are prone to volcanic activity. The local alert level may change at short notice. Take extra care and follow the advice of local authorities, including respecting any exclusion zones. See Natural disasters

Terrorist groups continue to plan attacks and have the capacity and intent to carry out these attacks at anytime and anywhere in the country.
