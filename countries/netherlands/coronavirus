Travel in the Netherlands
The latest information on Dutch domestic coronavirus measures can be found on the Dutch government website (in English).
Non-medical face masks must be worn on public transport if you are aged 13 and over. If you do not wear a face mask on public transport you can be fined €95. In stations, on platforms and at bus and tram stops face masks are not required, but you must stay 1.5 metres away from others. Buses, trains, trams and metros can now operate at full capacity. However, you should avoid using public transport during peak hours.
For other shared forms of transport, such as taxis, passenger vans and coaches, reservations should be made in advance and you must wear a non-medical face mask.
If you’re travelling in a car or other private vehicle, you are advised to wear non-medical face masks if there are two or more people in the vehicle who belong to different households.
On other forms of transport, you must stay 1.5 metres apart.
Schiphol, Eindhoven and Rotterdam Airports
All passengers and staff aged 13+ are urged to wear face masks in all areas of these airports. The terminals are only open for passengers and staff. You must not be accompanied into the airport, unless absolutely necessary for a traveller with reduced mobility.
Ferries
The wearing of face masks is mandatory on board ferries and in ferry terminals. Check with your operator for details before travelling.
DFDS
All travellers must wear face coverings at check-in, whilst boarding, and during disembarkation. This applies for both foot- and car passengers, as well as freight drivers. DFDS also highly encourages travellers to wear face coverings whilst moving around the ship. Face coverings do not need to be worn when travellers are in their cabins, seated in a socially distanced manner or whilst social distancing on outside decks.
P&O
All travellers must wear a face mask during their journey.
Public Spaces and Services
New measures came into effect on 20 September to address a rise in the number of coronavirus infections. These measures apply to the six regions that are currently seeing the sharpest rise in the number of infections - Amsterdam-Amstelland, Rotterdam-Rijnmond, Haaglanden (The Hague), Utrecht, Kennemerland and Hollands Midden. Three general measures apply to all six regions:
Bars, restaurants and other establishments will not admit new guests after midnight, and guests must leave by 1:00 AM.
Groups of more than 50 people are banned. This restriction applies both indoors and outdoors. There are some exceptions, such as demonstrations, religious gatherings, funerals, and dance and theatre.
Organisers of gatherings of more than 50 people must notify the authorities beforehand.
More information on these measures can be found on the Dutch government website (in English). These regions and others in the Netherlands may also have additional local requirements. You should check the latest local information before travelling.
You must stay 1.5 metres away from other people. This applies to everyone over the age of 18: in the street, in shops and other buildings. It does not apply to family members or other people that you live with and it does not apply if you are providing assistance to someone, for example pushing a wheelchair. If you notice that it is becoming difficult to keep a distance of 1.5 metres, you should leave. Avoid busy places in general, as if a gathering poses a safety or public health risk, enforcement officers can take action. In your own home or accommodation you may receive no more than 6 guests, excluding children under 13.
The Dutch government requires the use of non-medical mouth/nose masks on public transport. More information on visiting the Netherlands as a tourist can be found here and more information on Dutch coronavirus measures can be found here.
Reservations must be made (either in advance or at the door) for restaurants, cafés and bars. All places must carry out pre-entry health checks and have assigned seating for customers (at either a table or the bar). This applies both outdoors and indoors and regardless of the size of the establishment. Customers must also provide their names and contact details so that the municipal health service Gemeentelijke Gezondheidsdienst (GGD) can contact them if an outbreak is traced to that establishment.
