Local laws reflect the fact that Algeria is a Muslim country. Respect local traditions, customs, laws and religions at all times and be aware of your actions to ensure that they do not offend, especially during the holy month of Ramadan or if you intend to visit religious areas. See Travelling during Ramadan.
The weekend is on Friday and Saturday. Most restaurants do not serve alcohol and alcohol is not served anywhere during Ramadan.
Women dress in a wide variety of styles in Algeria, including European, and don’t have to cover their head unless visiting a mosque. To avoid unwelcome attention, women may wish to dress modestly, particularly outside of the main towns.
Possession, use and trafficking of controlled drugs are all serious criminal offences in Algeria and carry custodial sentences.
You don’t have to carry your passport at all times, but take it with you if you are making a longer journey. You will need your passport if travelling internally by air. Keep a photocopy somewhere safe.
Homosexuality is illegal in Algeria. Sexual acts between people of the same sex are punishable by imprisonment. See our information and advice page for the LGBT community before you travel.
Don’t attempt to take photos of any government building or security installation. This includes police and police checkpoints.
Smuggling antiquities is a criminal offence in Algeria that carries a custodial sentence. If you purchase any souvenirs during your stay in Algeria, you should obtain appropriate documentation for anything that looks old or antique; otherwise you may be held at the airport when departing and prevented from leaving the country with it.
