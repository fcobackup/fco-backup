The rainy season runs from November to April. Heavy rainfall can make roads harder to pass, and make some areas impassable.
A tropical Storm (Cyclone Freddy) is expected to bring high winds, heavy rainfall and the risk of flash flooding to southern and eastern areas of Zimbabwe from the evening of Thursday 23 February. This could cause disruption to travel and communication in affected areas. Monitor local reports and international weather updates from the World Meteorological Organisation, check your routes before travelling, and follow the advice of the local authorities.
