See Support for British Nationals Abroad for detailed advice on what the British High Commission can do to help you.
On-the-spot fines are common and can be given for a wide range of behaviours which are tolerated in the UK. You can be fined for littering and for smoking in some public places. It’s also illegal to import chewing gum into the country, except for certain medical chewing gums.
Arrests and detentions
If you’re arrested, you may be detained for up to 48 hours. You won’t be allowed to speak with anyone, not even a lawyer, during this period.
The Singapore Constitution allows for access to a lawyer, but timeframes are not defined.
See our guide on Singapore’s legal and criminal system. See Arrested Abroad to find out how we can help if you’ve been arrested or detained.
Passports confiscated by police during investigations
If you’re under police investigation, your passport will be taken from you. It will be returned once the investigation is over. If you’re convicted, the passport will be handed back after you have served your sentence.
There is no set timeline for investigations. In most cases, you will not be allowed to leave Singapore while the case is open. You must be able to support yourself financially during this period.
The British High Commission cannot interfere in the criminal and legal process in Singapore. For more on Singapore’s legal and criminal system, see our Prisoner Pack.

being found drunk and incapable in public
fighting and becoming a nuisance in public
resisting arrest, assaulting or hurting a public servant
touching someone inappropriately (whether resulting from drunken behaviour or not)
driving while drunk
drinking beyond the prescribed hours and the allowed areas

Liquor Control Zones
It’s illegal to drink alcohol in a public place (besides restaurants, bars and licenced entertainment venues) between 10:30pm and 7am.
Geylang and Little India are ‘Liquor Control Zones’. Drinking in these areas is banned all weekend, on public holidays and on the eve of public holidays.
Offenders could be fined up to S$1,000 (approximately £500); repeat offenders could be fined and imprisoned.
E-cigarettes and smoking
You cannot bring vaporisers like e-cigarettes, e-pipes, e-cigars and refills into the country. These items are likely to be confiscated, and you could be fined or sent to prison.
The minimum age for the purchase, use, possession, sale and supply of all tobacco products in Singapore is 21 years old. You could be fined if you don’t comply.
Orchard Road is a No Smoking Zone. You can smoke at designated areas only.
Visa overstay
Penalties for overstaying your visa include fines, imprisonment, corporal punishment (caning) and deportation depending on how long you’ve overstayed.
LGBT
Male homosexual acts are illegal in Singapore. However, in a statement to Parliament in 2007, Singapore’s Prime Minister said that ‘the government does not act as moral policemen’ and that ‘we do not proactively enforce’ the law on this issue. Openly gay and lesbian support groups and social venues exist. See our information and advice page for the LGBT community before you travel.
Outrage of modesty
You should avoid any action that could be interpreted as molestation. Scams involving false claims of molestation are thought to exist. Penalties for convicted offenders include a fine, imprisonment, and/orcaning.
Death penalty
The death penalty exists for certain offences, including murder and drug trafficking. Trafficking is defined by possession of drugs above a certain amount (500g in the case of cannabis). There are severe penalties for all drug offences in Singapore, including possession. The Misuse of Drugs Act sets out the definitions.
Dual nationals and Permanent Residents
Singapore doesn’t recognise dual nationality beyond the age of 21. The following are liable for National Service:
all male Singapore citizens (including dual citizens below 21)
all male children granted Permanent Resident (PR) status as part of their parents’ PR application
Specific questions on National Service can be put to Singapore’s Central Manpower base: contact@ns.sg

The public display of national flags or national emblems is illegal except where a specific exemption has been granted.
