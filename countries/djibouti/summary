the remainder of Djibouti based on the current assessment of COVID-19 risks
Travel to Djibouti is subject to entry restrictions
Whether arriving by air, land or sea, you will be required to provide a PCR test certificate from the country where you started your journey. The test must be taken within 72 hours before you leave your point of departure and within 120 hours of your arrival in Djibouti
Also, on arrival at all entry points, you will be tested for COVID-19 at your expense. If your result is negative, you will be free to go to your accommodation. If the result is positive you will be taken to a government designated quarantine hotel or hospital until you test negative – you will cover accommodation costs
See Entry requirements for more information before you plan to travel.
