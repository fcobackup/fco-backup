There are currently only occasional charter flights which allow a return to the UK, via third countries. The UK government is working closely with airlines to make sure options are available for you to return to the UK.
Flights
Vientiane Lockdown – While travel into and out of the capital has been banned until 4 June, we understand that international flights from Vientiane will continue. The countrywide suspension of internal flights and public transport means British nationals who need to travel to Vientiane to depart on these flights will need to make arrangements for travel by private vehicle and carry evidence of a flight booking. Please check with Lao authorities for details of local requirements.
The British Embassy is aware that applications for international flights from Laos are being submitted: decisions on approval are expected from the Lao government in the near future. The Embassy will continue to post updates about new commercial routes as soon as they become known to us. If flights are fully booked, consider registering an expression of interest for future flights.
The Embassy is aware of the following additional proposed charter flights from Vientiane, which are subject to sufficient reservations and Lao government approval. You should review all terms and conditions including refund policy before committing to any flights.
If your return journey to the UK transits another country, you should check whether it is subject to a travel ban or any other additional requirements, before committing to flights. Restrictions are liable to change and therefore you should stay up to date with our travel advice for countries that you will be transiting.
