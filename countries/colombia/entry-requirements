Warning
FCDO advises against all but essential travel to parts of Colombia.

This information is for people travelling on a full ‘British citizen’ passport from the UK. It is based on the UK government’s understanding of Colombia’s current rules for the most common types of travel.  
The authorities in Colombia set and enforce entry rules. If you’re not sure how these requirements apply to you, contact the Colombian Embassy in the UK (for English choose ‘Ingles’ from the drop down menu).
Passport validity requirements 
To enter Colombia, your passport must be valid on entry. However, Colombian immigration authorities recommend your passport has an ‘expiry date’ at least 6 months after the date you plan to leave.  
Check with your travel provider that your passport and other travel documents meet requirements. Renew your passport if you need to.  
You will be denied entry if you do not have a valid travel document or try to use a passport that has been reported lost or stolen. 
Dual nationals  
If you’re a British-Colombian dual national, you must enter and leave Colombia using your Colombian passport and Colombian identification card (Cedula). 
Visa requirements 
You can visit Colombia for up to 90 days without a visa for business or tourism, at the discretion of the Colombian immigration officer on arrival.  
You must be able to show an onward or return ticket valid within the 90-day period. 
Applying for a visa
Check the latest entry requirements and how to apply for a visa with the Colombian Consulate General in London before you travel.
If you have a Colombian visa with more than 90 days of validity, you must register the visa at a Migración Colombia office (in Spanish) or register the visa online (in Spanish) within 15 days of arrival in Colombia. If you do not register, you may get a fine.
You may be able to extend your stay once you are in Colombia by up to 120 days by applying at the immigration office Migración Colombia (in Spanish). As a visitor, you cannot remain in Colombia for more than 180 days in any 12-month period.
If you overstay your visa, you could get a fine, or be deported at your own cost. 
Checks at border control 
Colombian authorities advise that you can speed up your entry to the country by completing the ‘Check-Mig’ form on Migración Colombia, although this is not mandatory. You can complete the form between 72 hours and one hour before you travel to Colombia. You will receive a confirmation email that you will need to show to immigration officials when you arrive.
Make sure you get your passport stamped. 
If you enter Colombia by land, sea or river, make sure the immigration authorities stamp your passport. If it is not stamped, you could get a fine when you leave. If the immigration office on the border is closed, go to the nearest office of Migración Colombia (in Spanish). 
Travelling with children 
Children aged 17 and under who have resident status in Colombia and who are travelling on a British passport need a notarised letter of permission from any non-accompanying parents or parent (in Spanish). The letter must be authenticated by a notary or by a Colombian consulate. You can get more information from Migración Colombia (in Spanish) or by contacting the Colombian Consulate in the UK (in Spanish). 
San Andres Archipelago 
If you’re travelling to the islands of San Andres, Providencia or Santa Catalina, you must buy a tourist card from the boarding gate, on the day of the flight. You do not need one if you’re staying less than 24 hours. 
Departure tax 
Departure tax is usually included in the price of the airline ticket, but check with your airline.  
Vaccine requirements  
To enter Colombia, you must have a certificate to prove you’ve had a yellow fever vaccination if you are arriving from certain countries with a transmission risk. You may also be asked to show it if you are travelling to areas in Colombia which are considered high risk. Carry your vaccination certificate at all times.
For full details about medical entry requirements and recommended vaccinations, see TravelHealthPro’s Colombia guide.
Customs rules 
There are strict rules about goods you can take into or out of Colombia (in Spanish). You must declare anything that may be prohibited or subject to tax or duty. 
Taking money into Colombia 
You can bring up to 10,000 US dollars-worth of any currency into Colombia. You must declare anything above this amount with the National Tax and Customs Directorate (DIAN) (in Spanish).
