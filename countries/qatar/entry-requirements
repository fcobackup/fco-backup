The information on this page covers the most common types of travel and reflects the UK government’s understanding of the rules currently in place. Unless otherwise stated, this information is for travellers using a full ‘British Citizen’ passport.
The authorities in the country or territory you’re travelling to are responsible for setting and enforcing the rules for entry. If you’re unclear about any aspect of the entry requirements, or you need further reassurance, you should contact the embassy, high commission or consulate of the country or territory you’re travelling to.
You should also consider checking with your transport provider or travel company to make sure your passport and other travel documents meet their requirements.
Entry rules in response to coronavirus
Entry to Qatar
British nationals holding a Qatar residence permit no longer require prior approval to return to Qatar. Registration for return to Qatar using the Ehteraz app is optional for those already holding a residence permit. You may be asked to undertake a further PCR test within 36 hours of arrival in Qatar at your own expense (QAR300) when returning from a red listed country, such as the UK. The test must be carried out at a PHCC.
All residents returning to Qatar will be exempt from quarantine provided they have completed a vaccination course as recognised by Qatar’s Ministry of Public Health (namely Pfizer/BioNTech, Moderna, AstraZeneca or Johnson & Johnson), their last vaccination dose having been administered 14 days prior to entry to Qatar and are able to provide a negative PCR test certificate recognised by the Health Department in the departing country.
For those returning to Qatar from the UK who are not fully vaccinated, quarantine is still required. To book your quarantine package visit Qatar Airways Quarantine Booking. Further information on Qatar’s entry and arrival requirements can be found on the Ministry of Public Health website.
Arriving from the Abu Samra border crossing
Following the opening of the air, land and sea borders between Qatar and Saudi Arabia, all arrivals to Qatar from the Abu Samra border crossing are required to undergo a COVID-19 test and obtain a virus-free certificate no more than 72 hours before travel. Further information can be found from the Government Communications Office statement here.
Demonstrating your COVID-19 vaccination status
Qatar has not yet confirmed that it will accept the UK solutions for demonstrating your COVID vaccination status. You should follow guidance for alternative entry requirements. Your NHS appointment card from vaccination centres is not designed to be used as proof of vaccination.
Transiting Qatar
Transit passengers travelling on to another destination can still transfer through Qatar, and many flights continue to operate. You should check with your airline or travel company for the latest information if you are planning to leave or transit through Qatar. Flights are subject to change or cancellation at short notice.
Whilst in transit at Hamad International Airport, you will receive regular thermal screening and temperature checks.
You should contact your tour operator, transport or accommodation provider for information on the impact on any existing travel plans.
Testing on arrival
Thermal screening and temperature checks will take place on arrival.
Quarantine requirements
All residents returning to Qatar will be exempt from quarantine provided they have completed a vaccination course as recognised by Qatar’s Ministry of Public Health (namely Pfizer/BioNTech, Moderna, AstraZeneca, or Johnson & Johnson), their last vaccination dose having been administered 14 days prior to entry to Qatar, and are able to provide a negative PCR test certificate recognised by the Health Department in the departing country.
Residents returning from the UK who are not fully vaccinated will need to quarantine for 10 days in a government-approved hotel, at their own expense. This must be booked through the Discover Qatar website. For further guidance please refer to the Ministry of Public Health website.
Data collection
Downloading Qatar’s track and trace app, Ehteraz, is mandatory for everyone in Qatar. You will be asked to show the app upon arrival.
Regular entry requirements
Visas
You can get a free 30-day tourist visa-waiver on arrival in Qatar. If you’re travelling for any purpose other than tourism, and/or hold one of the other types of British passport, you must get a visa before you travel.
If you need to stay longer than 30 days, you must extend your visa waiver before it expires through the Ministry of Interior. If you fail to do so, you may receive an overstay fine, which must be paid before leaving Qatar.
You can find further information on visa requirements and extensions on the Qatar Ministry of Interior website
Passport validity
Your passport should be valid for a minimum period of 6 months from the date of entry into Qatar.
UK Emergency Travel Documents
UK Emergency Travel Documents (ETDs) are not valid for entry into Qatar. However, ETDs are accepted for airside transit and exit from Qatar. If you are exiting Qatar on an ETD because your full validity passport has been lost or stolen, you must obtain a police report in order to exit Qatar. These reports can be obtained at any police station in Qatar. You should allow sufficient time to collect this report as they can take up to 2 days to be processed. Without this report you may experience difficulties at the airport. If the holder of the ETD is a new-born child with no previous passport or identification, an exit permit is required before exiting Qatar. These can be obtained from the Immigration Office in Al Gharrafa.
Living and working in Qatar
If you’re applying for a residence permit, you will have to undergo a medical test including blood tests and a chest X-ray. The tests screen for diseases including, but not restricted to, HIV/AIDS, Tuberculosis, Hepatitis B and C. Testing positive may lead to further tests and possible deportation.
