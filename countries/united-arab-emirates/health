Healthcare in the UAE 
FCDO has a list of medical providers in the UAE where some staff will speak English. 
Healthcare facilities in the UAE are similar to those in the UK, but you may be stopped from using them without travel insurance or without the means to pay medical fees. You may be prevented from leaving the UAE if you are unable to pay your medical bill. Make sure you have adequate travel health insurance and accessible funds to cover the cost of any medical treatment abroad and repatriation.  
There is guidance on healthcare if you’re living in the UAE.
