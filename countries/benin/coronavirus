Be prepared for your plans to change
No travel is risk-free during COVID-19. Countries may further restrict travel or bring in new rules at short notice, for example due to a new COVID-19 variant. Check with your travel company or airline for any transport changes which may delay your journey home.
If you test positive for COVID-19, you may need to stay where you are until you test negative. You may also need to seek treatment there.
Plan ahead and make sure you:
can access money
understand what your insurance will cover
can make arrangements to extend your stay and be away for longer than planned

Healthcare in Benin
Unlike in the UK, you will need to go to a pharmacy to obtain most over-the-counter medicines. Pharmacies are widely available and are usually identified by a green cross. They will accept prescriptions from the UK although the specific prescribed brand will most probably be replaced by a generic or other brand equivalent. Benin has not yet forced a total lockdown and in the event that this occurs, pharmacies will remain open.
You should contact local authorities for information on COVID-19 testing facilities (available in French only).
