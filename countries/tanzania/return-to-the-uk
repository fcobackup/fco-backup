You should print and send your confirmed itinerary from CTM with you to the airport. A copy on a smart phone or similar is also sufficient.
You will be notified if you have not been allocated a seat, and will need to request a refund from CTM, which you should receive within 14 days.

Financial support for a flight
If you have exhausted all other options available to you for getting funds, you may be eligible to apply for an emergency loan from the government to cover the cost of the ticket.
This is a last resort option and you would need to repay the loan when you are back in the UK.
Our partner CTM is also authorised to administer such loans on behalf of the FCO and details will be available when you are asked to pay.
