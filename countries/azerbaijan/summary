Around 30,000 British nationals visit Azerbaijan every year, mainly on business. Most visits are trouble free. See Safety and Security
Consular support is not available in the Nagorno-Karabakh region. Tensions between Azerbaijan and Armenia over Nagorno-Karabakh continue. There are regular ceasefire violations along the Line of Contact separating the opposing forces and elsewhere on the inter-state border between Azerbaijan and Armenia periodically resulting in deaths and casualties. Anyone who has visited Nagorno-Karabakh without the permission of the Azerbaijani authorities will be refused entry to Azerbaijan. See Local travel
Terrorists are likely to try to carry out attacks in Azerbaijan. See Terrorism
If you’re abroad and you need emergency help from the UK government, contact the nearest British embassy, consulate or high commission.
Given the rapidly changing situation, we have temporarily withdrawn a limited number of UK staff and dependants from our Embassy. The Embassy continues to carry out essential work, including providing 24/7 consular assistance and support to British people in Azerbaijan.
