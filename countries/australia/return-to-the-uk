Flight options from Australia to the UK are becoming increasingly restricted following the tightening of entry restrictions for Australia and for countries through which flights transit.
A number of airline operators have announced that international flights to/from Australia have been suspended or will be suspended shortly.
British nationals who live in the UK and are currently in Australia should seek to make arrangements to return to the UK now, where and while there are still commercial routes available. You should contact your airline, travel provider or tour operator and insurance company now to make arrangements to do so as soon as possible. You may otherwise find you are not able to leave Australia when you had planned to.
The British High Commission in Canberra is issuing regular updates on Twitter and Facebook with the latest available information on flight departure options for British nationals wishing to leave Australia.
If you are unable to leave Australia and your visa is nearing expiry, you should contact the Australian authorities as soon as possible. See the Department of Home Affairs website.
