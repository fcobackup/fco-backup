Contagious diseases spread quickly, particularly during Hajj and Ramadan. There is an increased risk of heat stroke and dehydration during the summer months. Bring basic medicines with you and consume adequate liquids and salts.
Medication  
The legal status and regulation of some medicines prescribed or bought in the UK can be different in other countries. In Saudi Arabia some prescribed or over-the-counter medicines are controlled substances. You may need approval from the Saudi authorities to bring some prescription drugs. See rules on bringing prescription drugs to Saudi Arabia. 
If you need to bring controlled or prescription medication, make sure you have an official prescription, hospital note or a letter from your GP, which includes: 
the amount prescribed
details of the drug and dosage
your doctor’s signature
a stamp from the clinic or hospital
See narcotics and psychotropic substances information from the Saudi government. 
UK prescriptions are not accepted in Saudi Arabia. Only doctors registered and licensed by the Saudi Commission for Health Specialities may issue prescriptions.
Pharmacies are common and easy to find, particularly in the big cities. All hospitals have a dispensing pharmacy. Shopping malls and plazas sell international brands.
