Flights continue to operate between Greece and the UK. Overall airline capacity between Greece and the UK remains good. Some airlines have begun to reduce their flight schedules to and from Greece, due to reduced demand. You should keep up to date with the latest advice from your airline, and contact them directly in case of disruption.
Countries neighbouring Greece (Albania, Bulgaria, Italy, North Macedonia, Turkey) have also introduced restrictions. Check FCO Travel Advice pages for details if you are planning to travel via these countries.
