The information on this page covers the most common types of travel and reflects the UK government’s understanding of the rules currently in place. Unless otherwise stated, this information is for travellers using a full ‘British Citizen’ passport.
The authorities in the country or territory you’re travelling to are responsible for setting and enforcing the rules for entry. If you’re unclear about any aspect of the entry requirements, or you need further reassurance, you’ll need to contact the embassy, high commission or consulate of the country or territory you’re travelling to.
You should also consider checking with your transport provider or travel company to make sure your passport and other travel documents meet their requirements.
Restrictions in response to coronavirus
The ban on entry to foreign nationals was lifted on 12 August. Arrivals are subject to self-isolation and/or testing requirements (see following section). Face-masks must be worn in all public spaces.
Testing / screening on arrival
You can now enter Armenia with a negative PCR test certificate issued a maximum of 72 hours prior to arrival. You should not use the NHS testing service to get a test in order to facilitate your travel to another country. You should arrange to take a private test
If you arrive without a certificate, and have no symptoms, you can pay for a PCR test at Zvartnots airport or the land border crossing from Georgia. You must then isolate until you receive a negative result.
More information on the process for taking a PCR test, and a list of COVID-19 testing laboratories in Armenia, is available on the Zvartnots International Airport website.
