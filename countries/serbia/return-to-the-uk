Commercial flights between London and Belgrade have resumed, though schedules are likely to remain subject to change at short notice. All border crossings for road, rail and river transport are formally closed, but it is possible to enter by road under certain conditions (including freight traffic). See Entry Requirements.
Leaving by road using private transport is possible at some major border crossing points though may involve delays, and is subject to entry requirements in neighbouring countries. Some restrictions remain in place and smaller border crossings remain closed.

You will need to pay for your return travel to the UK. If departure options are available but you cannot afford the travel costs and have exhausted all other options for getting funds, you may be eligible to apply for an emergency loan from the government. This is a last resort option and you would need to repay the loan when you are back in the UK.
