This page has information on travelling to Estonia. Check what you must do to return to the UK.
This page reflects the UK government’s understanding of current rules for people travelling on a full ‘British Citizen’ passport from the UK, for the most common types of travel.
The authorities in Estonia set and enforce entry rules.
All travellers
All travellers entering Estonia from UK are required to complete a traveller’s questionnaire prior to their arrival in Estonia. This can be filled out electronically on the portal of the Estonian Health Board 3 days or less before arrival in Estonia. It is also possible to present the completed questionnaire on paper, if absolutely necessary. Travellers who fall within an entry restriction exemptions category are not required to complete the traveller’s questionnaire. See Exemptions.
If you’re fully vaccinated
If you are travelling to Estonia from the UK, you will need:
proof of being fully vaccinated no more than 9 months ago and the maximum immunity for the vaccine (usually 14 days) has to be achieved prior to arrival. See ’Proof of vaccination status’.
You will not need to self-isolate. Estonia accepts all vaccines that have received the approval of the European Medicines Agency, as well as those that have not received an EU marketing authorisation but are recognised in the country of departure.
Find out if you qualify as fully vaccinated in Estonia on the Estonian crisis portal.
Proof of vaccination status
You must present proof that you have been fully vaccinated to enter Estonia. Find out what information can be accepted as proof of your vaccination status on the Estonian crisis portal.
Estonia will accept the UK’s proof of COVID-19 recovery and vaccination record and proof of COVID-19 vaccination issued in the Crown Dependencies. Your final vaccine dose must have been administered within the last 12 months prior to travel. Your NHS appointment card from vaccination centres is not designed to be used as proof of vaccination and should not be used to demonstrate your vaccine status.
If you’re not fully vaccinated
If you are not fully vaccinated you can enter Estonia from UK, but will need to self-isolate for 7 days. Visit the Estonian crisis website for full details.
If you’ve had COVID-19 in the past year
If you’re not fully vaccinated but have tested positive for COVID-19 within last six months, you can enter Estonia without the need to self-isolate. You’ll need to show evidence that you have recovered from COVID-19 within the past six months. Find out information of what can be accepted as proof of your recovery status on the Estonian crisis portal.
You can use the UK’s proof of COVID-19 recovery record to demonstrate proof of COVID-19 recovery when entering Estonia.
Children and young people
Children up to the age of 12 arriving in Estonia from UK are not required to self-isolate.
Children aged between 12 and 18 who have received full vaccination and no more than 9 months has passed since the vaccination date or who have recovered from COVID-19 within last 6 months are not required to self-isolate.
Children aged between 12 and 18 who are not fully vaccinated and have not recovered from COVID-19 within past six months and are arriving with a parent or a legal representative who is vaccinated or has recovered from COVID-19 within past six months are not required to self-isolate if they present a negative PCR test result done no earlier than 72 hours before arrival in Estonia. They can choose to do a test at a health care service provider immediately after arrival in Estonia, but must remain in isolation until they receive the test result. If the test result is negative, they can leave self-isolation.
See full information on the Estonian crisis portal. More information on testing providers in Estonia is on the official Estonian COVID-19 testing website.
If you’re transiting through Estonia
Transit through Estonia is permitted for all travellers.
Exemptions
See the full list of travellers who are exempt from completing the traveller’s questionnaire and self-isolation restrictions on the website of Estonian Health Board.
Check your passport and travel documents before you travel
You should check with your transport provider or travel company to make sure your passport and travel documents meet their requirements.
Passport validity
If you are planning to travel to an EU country (except Ireland), or Switzerland, Norway, Iceland, Liechtenstein, Andorra, Monaco, San Marino or Vatican City, you must meet the Schengen area rules.
Your passport must meet 2 requirements. It must be:
less than 10 years old on the day you enter (check the ‘date of issue’)
valid for at least 3 months after the day you plan to leave (check the ‘expiry date’)
We are asking the European Commission to clarify the 10-year rule. Their guidance for Schengen border guards may not be updated until the spring of 2022. Until then, for some Schengen countries your passport may need to be less than 10 years old during your whole visit, and the 3 months at the end of your visit may need to be within 10 years of your passport’s issue date.
Check both the issue date and the expiry date in your passport. If you renewed your passport early, extra months may have been added to its expiry date. This could affect the requirement for your passport to be less than 10 years old.
Contact your travel provider or embassy of the country you are visiting if you think that your passport does not meet both these requirements. Renew your passport if you need to.
Visas
You can travel to countries in the Schengen area for up to 90 days in any 180-day period without a visa. This applies if you travel as a tourist, to visit family or friends, to attend business meetings, cultural or sports events, or for short-term studies or training.
If you are travelling to Estonia and other Schengen countries without a visa, make sure your whole visit is within the 90-day limit. Visits to Schengen countries within the previous 180 days before you travel count towards your 90 days.
To stay longer, to work or study, for business travel or for other reasons, you will need to meet the Estonian government’s entry requirements. Check with the Estonian Embassy what type of visa and/or work permit you may need.
If you are travelling to Estonia for work, read the guidance on visas and permits.
If you stay in Estonia with a residence permit or long-stay visa, this does not count towards your 90-day visa-free limit.
Passport stamping
Check your passport is stamped if you enter or exit the Schengen area through Estonia as a visitor. Border guards will use passport stamps to check you’re complying with the 90-day visa-free limit for short stays in the Schengen area. If relevant entry or exit stamps are not in your passport, border guards will presume that you have overstayed your visa-free limit.
You can show evidence of when and where you entered or exited the Schengen area, and ask the border guards to add this date and location in your passport. Examples of acceptable evidence include boarding passes and tickets.
You may also need to:
show a return or onward ticket
show you have enough money for your stay.
If you are resident in Estonia, read our Living in Estonia guide for passport stamping information.
UK Emergency Travel Documents
UK Emergency Travel Documents (ETDs) are accepted for entry, airside transit and exit from Estonia.
