Warning
FCDO advises against all travel to parts of Sudan.

Before you travel check that: 
your destination can provide the healthcare you may need 
you have appropriate travel insurance for local treatment or unexpected medical evacuation 
This is particularly important if you have a health condition or are pregnant. 
Healthcare in Sudan 
The current conflict has severely affected health services and many may be unavailable, including hospitals for British nationals in Khartoum. 
Medical facilities in the country are limited and medical evacuation is likely to be necessary for all but the most basic treatments. Make sure you have adequate travel and medical insurance to cover the cost of any medical treatment abroad and repatriation. 
There is a particular risk to public health in areas of conflict where immunisation coverage is poor. 
Emergency medical number 
Call 999 and ask for an ambulance.  
Emergency services in Sudan have been severely impacted by the conflict and are often unresponsive.  
If you need emergency medical treatment you should make your own way to hospital, if you can. 
Contact your insurance company quickly if you’re referred to a medical facility for treatment. 
Vaccine recommendations and health risks 
At least 8 weeks before your trip: 
check the latest vaccine recommendations for Sudan 
see where to get vaccines and whether you have to pay on the NHS travel vaccinations page 
See what health risks you’ll face in Sudan, including:
cholera
malaria
yellow fever

Other health risks 
There are regular outbreaks of chikungunya, dengue, measles and other diseases in Sudan, particularly in refugee camps. There is a lack of clean water and the inability to remove dead bodies means Sudan is at high risk from various diseases.
