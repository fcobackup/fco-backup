Healthcare in Sri Lanka 
Emergency medical treatment outside main cities is not readily available and you may have to be brought to Colombo for treatment. Treatment in private hospitals can be expensive and the options for repatriation to the UK or neighbouring countries in an emergency are limited and very expensive. Make sure you have adequate travel health insurance and accessible funds to cover the cost of any medical treatment abroad and repatriation.
