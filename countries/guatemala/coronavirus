Entry and borders

Many states and local communities are imposing additional measures, including movement restrictions in response to the coronavirus (COVID-19) pandemic. Roadblocks have been reported more frequently, particularly in the States of Chiapas and Oaxaca. If you are driving in these states, travel during daylight hours and use toll roads where possible, although you may still encounter disruptions. Where possible, we recommend you travel by air.
Mexico-Guatemala border
There have been reports of disruptions and tensions at the Mexico-Guatemala border. Periodic closures are possible and you are advised to check with local authorities before attempting to cross the land border. There have been reports of foreign nationals being held up in the neutral zone between both countries, after leaving Guatemala by land. Once foreign nationalss leave Guatemala, they are not allowed re-entry. Although Mexico’s border remains open, local communities at the border with Guatemala have been blocking foreigners from entering the country and passing through their towns. We currently do not recommend attempting to cross the land border between Guatemala and Mexico.
