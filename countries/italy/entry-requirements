This page reflects the UK government’s understanding of current rules for people travelling on a full ‘British Citizen’ passport, for the most common types of travel.
The authorities in Italy set and enforce entry rules. For further information contact the embassy, high commission or consulate of the country or territory you’re travelling to. You should also consider checking with your transport provider or travel company to make sure your passport and other travel documents meet their requirements.
If you are travelling to Italy for work, read the guidance on visas and permits as the rules have changed since 1 January 2021.
Entry rules in response to coronavirus (COVID-19)
Demonstrating your COVID-19 status
Italy will accept the UK’s proof of COVID-19 recovery and vaccination record as the equivalent to a green pass. From 1 February you must have had your final vaccine within 180 days for your vaccination certificate to be valid when visiting Italy. Your NHS appointment card from vaccination centres is not designed to be used as proof of vaccination and should not be used to demonstrate your vaccine status.
Regardless of your vaccination status (see below) anyone arriving in Italy by air, land or by sea may be subject to random COVID testing on arrival until 31 January. All arrivals from the UK into Sicily will need to undertake a rapid lateral flow test on arrival (administered by the local health authorities free of charge).
If you can demonstrate that you are fully vaccinated
If you travel from the UK and can demonstrate that you are fully vaccinated, you can enter Italy without needing to self-isolate. In addition:
you must fill in the passenger locator form (EU PLF) before you enter Italy to get a QR code to show to your travel provider and Border Police. You can ask for paper form if you do not have an electronic device
you must show evidence of a negative PCR test taken within 48 hours before entering Italy OR a negative antigen test taken within 24 hours before entering Italy.
If you are not vaccinated, exempt from vaccination or cannot demonstrate that you are fully vaccinated
If you are not fully vaccinated, to enter Italy from the UK you must:
fill in the passenger locator form (EU PLF) to get a QR code to show to your travel provider and Border Police. You can ask for paper form if you do not have an electronic device
show evidence of a negative PCR test within 48 hours before entering Italy or a negative lateral flow test taken within 24 hours before entering Italy
notify the Prevention Department of the local health authority of your entry into Italy. See COVID-19 regional telephone numbers for the contact details of local Italian health authorities
travel to your final destination in Italy by private transport only
remain in self-isolation for 5 days
take another PCR or lateral flow test at the end of the 5 days’ self-isolation
Children
Children aged 17 and under do not need to quarantine if they are travelling with a fully vaccinated parent and (for those over the age of 6) have a negative PCR or lateral flow test.
Children aged 5 and under are exempt from testing.
Exemptions
Exemptions from testing may apply if you are transiting Italy in a private vehicle for less than 36 hours or travelling for proven reasons of work, health or absolute necessity, for less than 120 hours. Check the Ministry of Health website (in English). You must still complete a passenger locator form.
You can read more about the requirement to get a COVID-19 test on Italian Embassy in London’s COVID-19 update page.
Further information
Check Italian Embassy in London guidance, or contact your travel provider, for more information.
If you are a UK national resident in Italy, we advise carrying proof of your residence when entering Italy.
Check the Italian Government’s online questionnaire (in English) for more advice on entry requirements and travel to Italy.
Travelling to Italy from or through other countries
Land borders are open.
You should check travel advice for any countries you plan to travel through ahead of your journey and should ensure that you have the necessary tests for each country you transit as well as Italy.
Transiting Italy by Air
If you are transiting through Italy, you need to provide proof of a negative PCR or lateral flow test – see ‘Entry Requirements’. Passengers who remain within the airport transit area are exempt from completing a Passenger Locator Form for transit through Italy.
If the airport does not have transit facilities or you have booked connecting flights with different airlines, you will need to pass through Immigration. You may be asked to show proof of onward travel or proof of accommodation and funds if you intend to break your journey in Italy – see ‘Regular Entry Requirements’ below. You should complete a Passenger Locator Form from Italy to the country of your final destination.
Transiting Italy by Land or Sea
If you are transiting Italy by ferry, bus or train you need to provide proof of a negative PCR or lateral flow test – see ‘Entry Requirements’.
Travellers transiting Italy by private means for less than 36 hours are exempt from testing and do not need to complete a Passenger Locator Form. You should follow the rules of the country of your final destination.
Consult the Italian Government’s online questionnaire (in English) for more advice and the Re-open Europe website for transit regulations.
Regular entry requirements
Visas
The rules for travelling or working in European countries changed on 1 January 2021:
you can travel to countries in the Schengen area for up to 90 days in any 180-day period without a visa. This applies if you travel as a tourist, to visit family or friends, to attend business meetings, cultural or sports events, or for short-term studies or training
if you are travelling to Italy and other Schengen countries without a visa, make sure your whole visit is within the 90-day limit. Visits to Schengen countries within the previous 180 days before you travel count towards your 90 days
to stay longer, to work or study, for business travel or for other reasons, you will need to meet the Italian government’s entry requirements. Check which type of visa and/or work permit you may need with the Italian Ministry of Foreign Affairs before booking an appointment through the Italian consulates in London or Edinburgh.
if you stay in Italy with a residence permit or long-stay visa, this does not count towards your 90-day visa-free limit
British citizens who are unable to return to the UK before the expiry of their visa/permit or the end of their visa-free limit due to COVID-19 restrictions should contact their local immigration office (questura).
Any time you spent in Italy or other Schengen countries before 1 January 2021 does not count towards your 90-day visa-free limit.
At Italian border control, you may need to:
queue in separate lanes from EU, EEA or Swiss citizens
show proof of your accommodation, for example, a hotel booking confirmation or proof of address if visiting your own property (e.g. second home)
show proof of insurance for your trip. Please check the guidance on travel insurance here
show a return or onward ticket
you should also be able to prove that you have enough money for your stay. The minimum amount required depends on your accommodation
Your host must inform the local immigration office (questura) in writing within 48 hours after you arrive at their property. They could be fined if they fail to comply with this Italian immigration law
Check your passport is stamped if you enter or exit the Schengen area through Italy as a visitor. Border guards will use passport stamps to check you’re complying with the 90-day visa-free limit for short stays in the Schengen area. If relevant entry or exit stamps are not in your passport, border guards will presume that you have overstayed your visa-free limit.
You can show evidence of when and where you entered or exited the Schengen area, and ask the border guards to add this date and location in your passport. Examples of acceptable evidence include boarding passes and tickets.
If you are entering from a Schengen Area country (e.g. France) you are required to declare your presence to the local immigration authority (questura) within 8 days of arriving (‘dichiarazione di presenza’). The questura will provide a form to complete. This requirement is not applicable if you are staying in a hotel or a B & B property.
Further information is provided on the Italian Ministry of Foreign Affairs website.
British nationals resident in Italy
If you are resident in Italy, your passport should not be stamped. You should proactively show your proof of residence, such as the new ‘carta di soggiorno elettronica’ or your current EU residency document, as well as your valid passport at Italian border control. For further information, see our Living in Italy guide.
Passport validity
If you are planning to travel to an EU country (except Ireland), or Switzerland, Norway, Iceland, Liechtenstein, Andorra, Monaco, San Marino or Vatican City, you must meet the Schengen area rules.
Your passport must meet 2 requirements. It must be:
less than 10 years old on the day you enter (check the ‘date of issue’)
valid for at least 3 months after the day you plan to leave (check the ‘expiry date’)
We are asking the European Commission to clarify the 10-year rule. Their guidance for Schengen border guards may not be updated until the spring of 2022. Until then, for some Schengen countries your passport may need to be less than 10 years old during your whole visit, and the 3 months at the end of your visit may need to be within 10 years of your passport’s issue date.
Check both the issue date and the expiry date in your passport. If you renewed your passport early, extra months may have been added to its expiry date. This could affect the requirement for your passport to be less than 10 years old.
Contact your travel provider or embassy of the country you are visiting if you think that your passport does not meet both these requirements. Renew your passport if you need to.
UK Emergency Travel Documents
UK Emergency Travel Documents (ETDs) are accepted for entry, airside transit and exit from Italy.
