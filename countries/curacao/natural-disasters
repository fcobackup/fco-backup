The hurricane season in the Dutch Caribbean normally runs from June to November. You should monitor local and international weather updates from the Meteorological department of Curaçao and the National Hurricane Centre, and follow the advice of the local authorities. See our Tropical cyclones page for advice about what to do if you are caught up in a hurricane.
Most hurricanes pass well to the north of Curaçao, which has no record of a recent major hurricane; there are occasional tropical storms.
