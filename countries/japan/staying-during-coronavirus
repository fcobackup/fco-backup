This page gives you guidance on how to stay safely in Japan as a visitor, if you are unable to return to the UK.
Everyone should comply with the measures put in place in Japan to limit the spread of coronavirus (COVID-19).
Moving around in Japan
The State of Emergency was lifted across all of Japan on 25 May. Many non-essential businesses that were closed are beginning to open. However, measures encouraging social distancing, avoiding unnecessary travel (including other prefectures) and closed spaces, and exercising other basic precautions may remain in place. Controls may also be strengthened in the event of renewed outbreaks. You should follow the instructions of your local authority
Local authorities may also put in place special measures for natural disaster response, including additional evacuation locations and medical procedures. See Natural disasters for more information on general disaster preparedness in Japan.
The situation is changing rapidly. You should continue to follow the advice of local authorities.

Visas
If you are already in Japan and your visa has expired or due to expire before the end of July 2020, Japan’s Immigration Service Agency has introduced a three-month grace period for renewing an expired visa without penalty. This includes short-term tourist visas, subject to proof that you were not able to easily leave Japan. The three-month period starts from the date the visa expires – you must visit an immigration centre to renew your visa during this time. You will need to present a valid visa when leaving Japan.
You may wish to contact Japan’s Immigration Services Agency on +81 570 013 904 or +81 357 967 112 and check what evidence you will need to provide when applying for your extension.

Finance
There is a range of financial support from the government that you can access while you are unable to return due to coronavirus restrictions.
If you’re in Japan, and have exhausted all other options to cover essential living costs while you wait to return home, you could apply for an emergency loan for your living costs from the UK government. You can only apply if you normally live in the UK and you cannot return home. This last-resort option is for those most in need, and you would need to repay the loan when you are back in the UK. Apply for an emergency loan.
