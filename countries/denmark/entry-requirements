The information on this page covers the most common types of travel and reflects the UK government’s understanding of the rules currently in place. Unless otherwise stated, this information is for travellers using a full ‘British Citizen’ passport.
The authorities in the country or territory you’re travelling to are responsible for setting and enforcing the rules for entry. If you’re unclear about any aspect of the entry requirements, or you need further reassurance, you’ll need to contact the embassy, high commission or consulate of the country or territory you’re travelling to.
You should also consider checking with your transport provider or travel company to make sure your passport and other travel documents meet their requirements.
Entry rules in response to coronavirus (COVID-19)
Entry to Denmark
The new variant of COVID-19 in the UK has led the Danish Government to introduce tighter restrictions for UK residents entering Denmark.
Until at least 17 January those resident in the UK will not be able to enter Denmark, unless you have a special worthy purpose:
If you are a primary caregiver for a child under 18
If you are a family member or partner of someone seriously ill or dying in Denmark
If you are transporting freight to ensure security of supply in Denmark or the EU
In addition to proof of a special worthy purpose, all travellers must present proof of a negative COVID-19 test taken no more than 24 hours before entry. Children aged 12 and under are exempt.
Danish citizens, UK nationals or persons currently in the UK resident in Denmark will continue to be able to enter Denmark. You will also need proof of a negative COVID-19 test taken no more than 24 hours before entry.
The Danish authorities strongly encourage Danish citizens, UK nationals or other persons residing in Denmark who enter Denmark from the UK also to take a free rapid test on arrival.
The Danish health authorities strongly recommend avoid using public transport from the airport and self-isolation for 10 days (with an option of test to release after 4 days).
You can check with the Danish authorities on their helpline (+45 7020 6044) for advice on the conditions of entry for foreign nationals.

Face masks at Danish airports
It is now compulsory to wear face masks on flights with several airlines. You should check with your airline before travel. Passengers are responsible for providing their own face masks. It is compulsory to wear a mask throughout terminals in Danish airports. You should wear a medical mask from the moment you enter the terminals, on board the plane, and until you leave again upon arrival. It is recommended by the Danish health authorities to change the mask every 3 to 4 hours.
Travel to the Faroe Islands
All travellers from the UK to the Faroe Islands must have a ‘worthy purpose’ to enter in line with the Danish government’s entry requirements for ‘banned’ countries.
You should check the latest guidance on entry requirements for travel to the Faroe Islands before departure.
You will be tested for COVID-19 on arrival. A follow up test on the sixth day of the visit is strongly recommended. Children younger than 12 do not need to be tested. Travellers will have to pay for the test. Each test costs approximately DKK 390-500.
You should expect long waiting times upon arrival.
Travellers from banned countries should immediately proceed to ‘home’ quarantine for 10 days. You should read the guidelines for home quarantine before you travel.

Regular entry requirements
The Danish authorities increased border controls at the land border with Germany in January 2016. Border controls were also introduced in November 2019 for travellers from Rønne, Helsingør, Frederikshavn, Grenaa and those using the Øresund Bridge, including all train traffic from Sweden. These checks are temporary but will be in place for an unspecified period of time.
If you’re travelling using the land border, or by rail, road, or ferry you should make sure you have your passport with you. Allow additional time, be vigilant and follow the instructions of local authorities. Check with local media, your carrier, ferry operator or Danish State Railways (DSB) for more information.
When crossing from Denmark to Sweden various forms of ID are accepted, but must include a photograph, the holder’s full name, social security number or date of birth, holders signature, a stated validity and information on the issuing authority. Children under 18 accompanied by an adult with the appropriate ID are not required to carry ID themselves.
Visas
Greenland and the Faroe Islands aren’t members of the European Union. You don’t need a visa to enter for tourism, but you should get a work and residence permit before entry if you intend to live and work there.
The rules for travelling or working in European countries changed on 1 January 2021:
you can travel to countries in the Schengen area for up to 90 days in any 180-day period without a visa. This applies if you travel as a tourist, to visit family or friends, to attend business meetings, cultural or sports events, or for short-term studies or training
if you are travelling to Denmark and other Schengen countries without a visa, make sure your whole visit is within the 90-day limit. Visits to Schengen countries within the previous 180 days before you travel count towards your 90 days
to stay longer, to work or study, for business travel or for other reasons, you will need to meet the Danish government’s entry requirements. Check with the Danish Embassy what type of visa, if any, you will need
if you are in Denmark with a visa or permit, this does not count towards your 90-day visa free limit
Any time you spent in Denmark or other Schengen countries before 1 January 2021 does not count towards your 90-day visa-free limit.
At Danish border control, you may need to use separate lanes from EU, EEA and Swiss citizens when queueing. Your passport may be stamped on entry and exit. You may also need to:
show a return or onward ticket
show you have enough money for your stay
Passport validity
Check your passport is valid for travel before you book your trip, and renew your passport if you do not have enough time left on it.
You must have at least 6 months left on an adult or child passport to travel to most countries in Europe (not including Ireland).
If you renewed your current passport before the previous one expired, extra months may have been added to its expiry date. Any extra months on your passport over 10 years may not count towards the 6 months needed.
UK Emergency Travel Documents
UK Emergency Travel Documents (ETDs) are accepted for entry, airside transit and exit from Denmark. Your ETD must be valid for the proposed duration of your stay.
