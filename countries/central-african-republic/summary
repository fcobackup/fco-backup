Consular support is severely limited in CAR as there is no British Embassy. However, the British Embassy Kinshasa, in the Democratic Republic of Congo can provide limited remote consular support to British nationals.
Elections in late 2020 and early 2021 were mired in violence and led to a 6-month state of emergency, which has now expired. President Faustin Archange Touadéra was re-elected and formed a new government in June. A national curfew is in place which comes into effect at 10pm and ends at 5am. You should follow the government’s instructions and avoid travel around Bangui during these hours.
Tensions remain high and there is potential for further violence across the country. Attacks on individuals and groups, including car-jackings, are likely and unpredictable. There are armed patrols that have set up several roadblocks across the country. Detention by police forces and armed groups is a common occurrence, primarily for CAR nationals, but also for expatriates. You should take extreme care, and take personal security precautions, if possible.
Terrorist attacks in the CAR cannot be ruled out. See Terrorism
UK health authorities have classified CAR as having a risk of Zika virus transmission. For information and advice about the risks associated with Zika virus, visit the National Travel Health Network and Centre website.
Areas bordering Democratic Republic of Congo (DRC) are at risk from outbreaks of Ebola. Further information and updates on Ebola can be found on the WHO website and the Public Health England (PHE) website. See Health
