Visas
British nationals don’t need a visa to enter Gibraltar.

Passport validity
You must hold a valid passport to enter Gibraltar. Your passport must be valid for the proposed duration of your stay. No additional period of validity beyond this is required.
If you plan to travel between Gibraltar and Spain, you should be aware that entry requirements for Spain may change after Brexit. See FCO travel advice for Spain for more information.
UK Emergency Travel Documents
UK Emergency Travel Documents are accepted for entry, airside transit and exit from Gibraltar.
Customs
Gibraltar is not part of the EU Common Customs Territory. The amount of goods (e.g. tobacco and alcohol) that you can take into and out of Gibraltar is more limited than for visits between the UK and other EU countries.
Check the Gibraltar Customs website for more information on duty free allowances when arriving in Gibraltar.
If you regularly enter or return to Gibraltar (more than once per calendar month), you are not entitled to duty free imports.
If you travel to Spain from Gibraltar, you should declare any duty free goods to Spanish customs officers.
If you’re returning directly to the UK from Gibraltar, see information on bringing goods into the UK.
