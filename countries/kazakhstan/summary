The Kazakh authorities have introduced severe restrictions on people entering the country and most foreign nationals are currently not allowed to enter Kazakhstan. There are very few international flights out of Nur-Sultan or Almaty, but we are aware of one to Frankfurt on 11 May with Air Astana. See Return to the UK for further details.
Most visits to Kazakhstan are trouble-free, but crime against foreigners does sometimes occur. See Crime
Residents of Kazakhstan are currently restricted from travelling within the country as several major cities, including Nur-Sultan and Almaty, are in lock-down due to coronavirus restrictions. Travel to any closed area requires advance permission from the Kazakh government. Some military/restricted areas are not clearly marked. Take care when travelling away from normal routes. The borders between Kazakhstan and its neighbours are currently closed to traffic, due to coronavirus restrictions. See Local travel
A visa is now required to enter Kazakhstan. These can be obtained from Kazakh Embassies around the world. See Visas
