The act defines reef-toxic sunscreens as ‘skin-care products, sold for topical application, which contain oxybenzone (BP3), octyl methoxycinnamate (EHMC), octocrylene (OC), 4-methyl-benzylidene camphor (4MBC), triclosan, methyl paraben, ethyl paraben, butyl paraben, benzyl paraben, or phenoxyethanol, or other chemical ingredients prohibited by the Minister pursuant to regulation.’
