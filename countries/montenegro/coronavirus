Quarantine restrictions
All those entering Montenegro from abroad should expect to be subject to a mandatory 14 day quarantine period at a government-run facility, followed by a mandatory 14 days self-isolation. Individuals who have had contact with someone diagnosed with coronavirus, or suspected to be infected with coronavirus will be subject to quarantine. Those over 65 years old are recommended to self-isolate.
All those who were quarantined or self-isolating and who test positive for the coronavirus and are unable to continue self-isolation in their place of residence will be subjected to compulsory institutional isolation. The same rule applies for those who are receiving hospital treatment and are considered as recovered patients but still do not have two sequential negative coronavirus results; and to those who travelled from abroad and tested positive for the coronavirus.
