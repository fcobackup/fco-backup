This section has safety advice for regions of Honduras. It only covers regions where FCDO has specific advice.
You should also read FCDO’s overall travel advice and safety and security advice.
Borders with Guatemala, El Salvador and Nicaragua
Armed robbers have targeted travellers after they cross the Honduran border into El Salvador. It is often better to cross borders in the morning as they sometimes close in the early evening and remain closed at night.
There are unmarked minefields in and around the border with Nicaragua. Avoid walking on unmarked paths or off main roads in these areas.
You may experience delays at the land border crossings between Honduras and Guatemala due to the passage of migrant caravans.
Bay Islands and north coast
The Bay Islands are generally safer than mainland Honduras, but there have been several attacks by criminals on visitors, including on the ferries to and from mainland Honduras. If you are visiting Roatán, travel with a reputable guide. If you are driving a car or scooter, avoid side roads in remote areas, particularly Palm Beach Road close to Milton Bight.
Take care on beaches in Tela and the north coast towns after dark. There have been attacks on foreigners on beaches after dark.
There is a risk of criminal attacks and carjackings in and around Tela, La Ceiba, Trujillo and El Progreso.
