South African airspace is closed to commercial airlines from midnight on 26 March until at least 30 April, as part of further efforts to contain the spread of coronavirus (COVID-19). No scheduled commercial flights will depart from South Africa until at least 1 May.
Future options
A programme of ten special flights operated between 9 and 17 April, based on demand from British nationals wanting to return to the UK. No further special flights are currently planned from South Africa.
The South African authorities have not confirmed when commercial flights will start again. We will announce any resumption of commercial flights here and you should continue to follow our Travel Advice for the latest information about returning to the UK. In the meantime, you should continue to follow any guidelines set out by the South African government during the lockdown.
You will need to pay for your return travel to the UK. If departure options are available but you cannot afford the travel costs and have exhausted all other options for getting funds, you may be eligible to apply for an emergency loan from the government. This is a last resort option only available to British nationals and you would need to repay the loan when you are back in the UK. For more information, you should contact contact Corporate Travel Management (CTM) CTM are a commercial partner of the FCO and are authorised to administer such loans on behalf of the FCO.
Accommodation
Those hotels which still have international guests should remain open until their guests are able to leave South Africa. You should ensure you have accommodation for the duration of the lock down, or until you have a confirmed ticket on a special charter flight.
We have published a list of hotels that have told us they can accept British people. We will keep this list up to date.
You can also ring a national hotline: +27 (0)800 029 999 to speak to a professional who will assess your individual need and advise on next steps.
If you are staying in the Western Cape, you can contact the Western Cape provincial government who may be able to assist in identifying new accommodation, using the following numbers:
