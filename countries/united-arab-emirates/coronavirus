Cases of coronavirus (COVID-19) have been confirmed in UAE. The UAE authorities have introduced a number of measures to limit the spread of the virus.
You should comply with any additional measures put in place by the local authorities. The UAE authorities have stated that any violation of instructions and procedures put in place to limit the spread of coronavirus (COVID-19) will be treated as a crime punishable by law.
Information about the UAE’s approach can be found on the website of the Ministry of Health and Prevention through its COVID-19 Information Centre

Entry and borders
From 19 March, only UAE Citizens are allowed to enter the UAE.
On 2 April the UAE Government announced its decision to renew for a further 2 weeks the suspension of entry of all UAE Residents who are currently abroad. This period could be extended. The UAE Ministry of Foreign Affairs and International Cooperation (MOFAIC) has provided a hotline for holders of valid UAE Residence visas who wish to return to the UAE: +971 (0)9 208 3344.
Anyone entitled to enter the UAE must self-isolate for a period of 14 days. Further follow-up health measures and restrictions are possible. You should be aware that public health measures and restrictions in the UAE may change quickly and may be significant.

Cruise ships
We understand that passenger cruises are currently not allowed to dock in the UAE as a result of measures taken to combat COVID-19. A UAE-wide notice to mariners has issued.
Vessels already in port have been allowed to disembark passengers at the end of cruises.
The Cruise Line International Association (CLIA) has adopted an enhanced member health policy which all CLIA ocean member cruise lines are required to follow to address COVID-19.
If you are planning to travel on an international cruise that is due to call at any port in the UAE, contact your travel company for the latest information.
Local measures
The authorities have introduced strict measures to limit the spread of COVID-19.
You should keep up to date with local public health measures and comply with instructions. If you fail to do so you risk being fined or imprisoned. The authorities have advised that the public should remain at home unless they need to buy food, basic essentials or medicine, and maintain social distancing when doing so. Since 6 April Dubai residents must apply for a permit if they need to leave their homes for essential purposes (such as for food, medicine or medical assistance). You can apply for a permit through the Dubai permits website.
Malls, restaurants, tourist and cultural sites have been closed temporarily. Pharmacies and supermarkets remain open.
All schools in the UAE are now closed for the remainder of this academic year. Many events have been cancelled. If you are planning to attend a specific event in the UAE, check with the organisers.
