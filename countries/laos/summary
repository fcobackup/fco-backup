The FCO advise against all but essential travel to:
Xaisomboun province, due to armed clashes and attacks on infrastructure by anti-government groups reported as recently as November 2019.
The Lao authorities have introduced precautionary measures in response to the coronavirus (COVID-19) pandemic. See Coronavirus
If you’re in Laos and intend to leave, you should do so as soon as possible. See Return to the UK
The monsoon season in Laos runs from May to October. You should be aware of elevated risks of flooding and landslides during this period, particularly if travelling by road as maintenance and repair standards differ to the UK, you should take additional care and undertake research. See Natural disasters
Unexploded ordnance in rural areas is a real and ongoing danger. Take care when travelling around Laos. See Local travel
Although there’s no recent history of terrorism in Laos, attacks can’t be ruled out. See Terrorism
Carry an ID document or passport at all times. You will receive a heavy fine if you don’t present ID on request. See Local laws and customs
UK health authorities have classified Laos as having a risk of Zika virus transmission. For information and advice about the risks associated with Zika virus, visit the National Travel Health Network and Centre website
If you’re abroad and you need emergency help from the UK government, contact the nearest British embassy, consulate or high commission. Consular support is limited in parts of Laos where we advise against all but essential travel.
Take out comprehensive travel and medical insurance before you travel.
