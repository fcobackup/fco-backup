Donâ€™t become involved with drugs of any kind: possession is considered a serious crime in Belize and can lead to a fine and/or imprisonment.
A Supreme Court ruling in 2016 decriminalised homosexual activity between consenting adults, however being open about being LGBT is generally considered to be socially unacceptable. There are no openly gay bars or clubs. See our information and advice page for the LGBT community before you travel.
You are not required to carry identification whilst in Belize, but it can be useful to carry a picture ID.
