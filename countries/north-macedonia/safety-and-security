Crime
Personal attacks against foreigners are extremely rare. Organised criminal groups are active, particularly in northern areas the border with Kosovo. Shooting incidents, including in Skopje do sometimes occur, but are not targeted at foreigners. Gunfire can also be heard as part of a celebration. You should be vigilant at all times.
There have been several cases of pick pocketing by gangs of children and bag snatches in the main shopping and entertainment areas late at night. Foreign nationals appear to have been specifically targeted. Make sure your personal possessions are secure.
In the event of civil disorder, stay indoors as much as possible, especially after dark, and avoid crowds and demonstrations.
