Travel to Jordan is subject to entry restrictions
Jordan’s international airport reopened to scheduled flights on 10 September. Commercial flights are operating from a limited number of countries.
Four land borders: Sheikh Hussein Bridge, Al Mudawwarah, King Hussein Bridge and Al Omari have been partially reopened since 29 October. There are restrictions on the number of travellers limited between 100 and 150 from each of the four border crossings each day.
Passengers travelling by land and air must register to travel on the Gateway 2 Jordan website and have PCR tests before departure and on arrival.
All passengers arriving in Jordan should self-isolate in their accommodation for seven days on arrival whether they test positive (and are asymptomatic) or negative. If you have severe symptoms you will be asked to go to a COVID-19 designated hospital.
There are additional PCR testing requirements in place for travellers arriving in Jordan. Check the requirements listed on the Gateway 2 Jordan website.
See Entry requirements for more information before you plan travel.

Around 95,800 British nationals visited Jordan in 2019. Most visits are trouble free.
The political situation in Jordan is stable. However, protests and demonstrations sometimes occur, and feelings are running higher because of the pandemic. The majority of demonstrations are peaceful, but you should take sensible precautions and avoid all political gatherings and demonstrations. Follow the advice of local authorities and stay informed of the security situation through the media and this travel advice.
Terrorists are very likely to try to carry out attacks in Jordan. There have been a number of incidents since 2016, some serious. Attacks could be indiscriminate including in places visited by foreigners, particularly hotels, shopping malls and tourist sites. You should take extra care, and in the event of an incident, follow the advice of the Jordanian authorities. See Terrorism
Local laws reflect the fact that Jordan is a predominantly Islamic country. You should respect local traditions, customs, laws and religions at all times and be aware of your actions to ensure that they don’t offend.
You can contact the emergency services by calling 911.
If you’re abroad and you need emergency help from the UK government, contact the nearest British embassy, consulate or high commission. Consular support is limited in the border areas of Jordan where the FCDO advise against all but essential travel, as set out above.
