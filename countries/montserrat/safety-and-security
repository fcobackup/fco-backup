Crime
Crime levels are low, but you should take the same sensible precautions as you would at home. If your hotel does not have a safe, you may need to keep valuables with you.
Air travel
There are two companies offering flights from Antigua’s VC Bird International Airport to the John A. Osborne Airport in Montserrat: FLY MONTSERRAT and SVG Air. Between them they offer 6 flights per day in each direction on 9-seater aircraft. Baggage space is limited. Oversized bags can’t be carried due to the small baggage hold.
Road travel
Minibuses are available along a number of routes in Montserrat (fares range from EC$3 to EC$5 per journey), but with no regular schedules. Taxis are available and can be booked throughout the day and night. Taxis aren’t metered. Agree the fare in local currency before you set off.
To drive in Montserrat, you’ll need to get a temporary visitor’s driving licence from any police station on production of a valid driving licence and payment of a fee of EC$50. The temporary licence is valid for 3 months. Driving is on the left, as in the UK. There is a speed limit of 20 mph due to multiple hairpin bends. Don’t drink and drive.
Sea travel
A ferry service runs between Port Little Bay in Montserrat and the Bryson’s Pier, Heritage Quay in Antigua 5 days a week. For more information see the Visit Montserrat website. If you’re considering using the ferry you are encouraged to pre-book your journey with the Montserrat Ferry Service.
Sea conditions at various times of the year can severely disrupt the operation of the ferry and it may not be able to dock in Montserrat. Passengers may be held up in Antigua for several days while the seas calm down. If you’re travelling by ferry you should keep in touch with the ferry company and look out for any changes to the service.
Political situation
The last general elections were held on 11 September 2014. The People’s Democratic Movement won 7 out of 9 seats in the Legislative Council and formed a Government.
Emergency assistance
As Montserrat is a British Overseas Territory there’s no formal British diplomatic or consular representation. The local authorities deal with all requests for emergency assistance.
On arrival, you should be given a leaflet called ‘Welcome to Montserrat. A Visitor’s Guide to Consular Services’. If you’re not given one, you should ask. Alternatively, download one before you travel.
