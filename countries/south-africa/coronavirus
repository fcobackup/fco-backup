Cases of coronavirus (COVID-19) have been confirmed in South Africa. The South African authorities have introduced a number of measures to limit the spread of the virus.
The South African authorities have published coronavirus advice.
Travel Restrictions
Visitors from a number of countries affected by coronavirus, including the United Kingdom, will not be permitted to enter South Africa from 18 March 2020 without a visa.
The United States, Italy, Iran, South Korea, Spain, Germany, and the United Kingdom are considered high risk countries for coronavirus. Travellers who have visited these countries in the last 20 days will be denied a visa to enter South Africa.
The South African authorities have told us that travellers wishing to transit South African international airports may do so without a visa unless they have been in the UK, China, Germany, Iran, Italy, the Republic of Korea, Spain or the USA since 15 March 2020.
All ‘non-essential domestic travel’ is discouraged. In response to this, some domestic airlines, including South African Airways and SA Express, have made changes to their schedules. If you have a domestic flight booked, you should check with your airline before travel.
A number of land borders to neighbouring countries have been closed.
Cruise liners will not be permitted to dock in South African ports, after 18 March 2020.

Visas
The South African government has said that the cancellation of visas announced by President Ramaphosa on 15 March 2020 does not apply to British Nationals already in South Africa. The South African government has indicated that those who are currently in South Africa having received a stamp on arrival allowing them to stay for 90 days do not need to apply for a visa. The South African government has indicated that those who are currently in South Africa on a work, study or other visa may remain under the terms of that visa. It is not clear whether they will be permitted to re-enter South Africa under the same visa, were they to leave. Ask your nearest South African Embassy or High Commission if you are unsure if this affects you.
The South African government has indicated that British nationals wishing to leave the country will still be able to do so after 18 March. However, you should speak to your airline or tour operator promptly for further information regarding return flights to the UK.

If you need further information about entry requirements, contact local immigration authorities or the nearest South African High Commission. You should also check with your airline or travel company for the latest information.
Health screening at Ports and Airports
Screening processes have been introduced at all major ports of entry, including airports, for arrivals, departures and transit passengers. You should comply with any additional screening measures put in place by the authorities. Screening may include temperature measurements and checks on recent travel to affected areas.
If port health officials believe you should be tested for coronavirus, you will be taken to a nearby hospital designated for receiving and testing suspected cases. If tested positive, you may be placed into quarantine or asked to self-isolate depending on your circumstances.
If you are identified as in need of testing, or if quarantine or further treatment is required, you should contact your insurer, and speak to health officials, to understand where the quarantine or treatment should take place. Private hospitals in South Africa are prepared to treat coronavirus, and the standard of care may be higher than in government hospitals. See Local medical care
Our experience suggests that only people who are showing symptoms of coronavirus are able to get a test, at both private and public hospitals. If you need to leave South Africa and you are not experiencing coronavirus symptoms, you are free to do so.
Further information on coronavirus, including advice on preparing for foreign travel and helping reduce the spread of the virus, is available from Public Health England and on the TravelHealthPro website.
