Crime
St Martin and St Barthélemy are French overseas territories and French law applies. Most trips to the French Caribbean are trouble-free, crime rates are low but you should take sensible precautions. Avoid isolated areas, including beaches, after dark. Don’t carry large amounts of cash or jewellery with you. Put valuables and travel documents in safety deposit boxes and hotel safes.
