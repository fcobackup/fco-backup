Coronavirus travel health
See the TravelHealthPro website for further advice on travel abroad and reducing spread of respiratory viruses during the COVID-19 pandemic.
Travel in Ukraine
You require a vaccine certificate or negative PCR or express-test taken within 72 hours of travel, if travelling inter-city (by train, bus or plane) to or from a “yellow”, “orange” or “red” zone.
Quarantine measures
Coronavirus measures are in place until 31 March 2022, but may be extended further. Ukraine is operating a colour-coded adaptive quarantine system on a regional (oblasts and Kyiv city) basis. Quarantine measures may be imposed, and change, at short notice. You should check which restrictions apply to the places you intend to visit, and be ready to prove your vaccination status.
In all zones, the following rules apply:
you must carry ID with you at all times
when in public buildings (including restaurants, hotels and shops) you must maintain a minimum distance of 1.5 m.
when in public buildings, and while travelling on public transport and in taxis, you must wear a protective mask covering your nose and mouth
Failure to comply with restrictions may result in a fine or, in more serious cases, a prison sentence. Before taking public transport, you should consider whether you will be able to maintain social distancing.
In regions classified as “green” zones, there are minimal restrictions beyond mask-wearing and distancing.
In “yellow” and “orange” zones, mass events are prohibited unless all staff and participants have one of the following: a certificate of full vaccination (within the last 365 days), a certificate of recovery from Covid-19 (within the last 105 days) or a certificate of a negative PCR or rapid-antigen test (within the last 72 hours). The same restrictions apply to the opening of indoor hospitality venues, entertainment and cultural institutions, fitness centres and swimming pools, hostels and guesthouses.
In “red” zones, these measures additionally apply to shopping malls and non-essential retail.
Ukraine will accept the UK’s proof of COVID-19 recovery and vaccination record. If you are travelling with a printed PDF proof of vaccination status, it must date from 1 November to ensure that the certificate can be scanned successfully, if domestic certification is required. Your NHS appointment card from vaccination centres is not designed to be used as proof of vaccination and should not be used to demonstrate your vaccine status.
Accommodation
Hotel accommodation remains open under the present quarantine rules, but hostels may only open in yellow, orange or red zones if all staff and customers are vaccinated. Hotel restaurant facilities are subject to the same rules as other restaurants, and will require a vaccinate certificate or negative Covid test for all customers. When staying in a hotel, you must adhere to the overall rules regarding masks and minimum distancing. If possible, check in online in advance to avoid check-in queues at the hotel.

Visas
The State Migration Service has published advice that there will be no penalties for foreigners who were staying in Ukraine legally when restrictions on leaving the country were introduced and who have not been able to leave, to apply to extend the period of their stay and/or to exchange their resident permits. This measure is limited to the period in which national quarantine measures are in force.
Where the restrictions on travel and availability of government services mean that foreigners stay in Ukraine beyond the period permitted by their visa-free limit or visa validity, or that they are unable to extend residence permits, there will be no penalties imposed. However, anyone who has overstayed their 90 day visa-free regime during quarantine will not be able to return to Ukraine for 90 days after leaving the country. See Entry requirements

If you have COVID-19 symptoms, such as a dry cough, respiratory difficulties, and a high temperature, you should:
if you have insurance or a private medical provider in Ukraine, seek assistance from them in the first instance
if you do not have insurance or your symptoms are more severe, call an ambulance on 103. Please note that the ambulance service may not have English-speaking operators available. In this case, please enlist the help of a Ukrainian or Russian-speaking friend, family member, hotel worker etc to help you call the ambulance
In both cases, you are likely to be advised to self-isolate, or be taken to a hospital where you will be tested for coronavirus. In case of a positive diagnosis, please inform the British Embassy Office in Lviv by calling +380 44 490 3660 or by completing this web contact form, or ask a friend or relative to contact us on your behalf.
If taken to hospital, you are likely to be tested for coronavirus. The choice of hospital will depend on your location and the availability of hospitals and/or beds.
If you come into contact with someone who is confirmed to have COVID-19, or has COVID-19 symptoms, you must self-isolate for 14 days. Contact your insurer or private medical provider, or call an ambulance on 103, should you develop symptoms yourself. Failure to comply with these restrictions may result in a fine or, in more serious cases, a prison sentence.

COVID-19 vaccines if you live in Ukraine
Ukraine’s national vaccination programme started in February 2021 and is using the AstraZeneca, Coronavac, Moderna and Pfizer vaccines. The Government of Ukraine has stated that British nationals resident in Ukraine are eligible for vaccination if they choose to join the programme. Further information on the vaccination programme is available on the Government of Ukraine’s dedicated vaccination website.
Find out more, including about vaccines that are authorised in the UK or approved by the World Health Organisation, on the COVID-19 vaccines if you live abroad.
If you’re a British national living in Ukraine, you should seek medical advice from your local healthcare provider. Information about COVID-19 vaccines used in the national programme where you live, including regulatory status, should be available from local authorities.
