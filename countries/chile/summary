Following civil unrest in October and November across Chile you may see a police presence in major cities. There is potential for further demonstrations with a risk of violence in Santiago, Valparaiso, Antofagasta, Concepcion and other major cities.
In Santiago, protests largely took place in Plaza Baquedano/Plaza Italia and in Las Condes, Providencia and Vitacura districts. If protests take place, you should follow the instructions and advice of the local authorities, remain vigilant, monitor local media for updates and avoid protests and demonstrations. Under Chilean law, foreign nationals visiting or living in Chile could be deported for involvement in protests and demonstrations. See Local laws and customs
