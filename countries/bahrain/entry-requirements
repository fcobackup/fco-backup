Additionally all arrivals who have visited or transited Iran, Iraq and Lebanon within 14 days prior to their arrival in Bahrain will be subject to enhanced testing procedures and quarantine at Government facilities.

Visas
Make sure you check the latest entry requirements with the Embassy of the Kingdom of Bahrain before you travel.
The Government of Bahrain has suspended visas on-arrival across the Kingdom’s entry points until further notice, effective 03h00 on Wednesday, 18 March 2020. Those travellers that qualify must get a visa in advance, either online or from the Embassy of the Kingdom of Bahrain in the UK.
The Nationality, Passports and Residence Affairs Authority (NPRA) announced the validity of all valid and expired visit visas will be automatically extended for three months, starting from 23 April. Individuals can enquire about their individual circumstances by visiting the NPRA website.
Visitors can be issued visas for various lengths up to 6 months, depending on their need and at the discretion of the Immigration Officer. You may be asked to provide evidence of onward or return travel. If you enter as a visitor you must not take up employment.
In Bahrain you can apply to renew your visa at the NPRA at the Ministry of Interior. You can apply for residency through the Labour Market Regulatory Authority (LMRA).
Business visitors should bring a letter of invitation.
If you’re currently a resident of Qatar you require a visa to enter the Kingdom of Bahrain. Visas can be applied for online. You should attach a copy of your Qatari residency card to the application. Failure to obtain a visa in advance will result in a refusal of entry into Bahrain.
The causeway to Saudi Arabia currently remains closed.
Passport validity
Your passport should be valid for a minimum period of 6 months from the date of entry into Bahrain.
UK Emergency Travel Documents
UK Emergency Travel Documents (ETDs) are not valid for entry into Bahrain. However, ETDs are accepted for airside transit and exit from Bahrain.
Yellow fever certificate requirements
Check whether you need a yellow fever certificate by visiting the National Travel Health Network and Centre’s TravelHealthPro website.
Exit requirements
You must have legal status in Bahrain when you leave. You may be prevented from leaving Bahrain if you are subject to a travel ban, involved in legal proceedings, have unpaid debt, or are a child subject to a custody dispute. You can be fined if you overstay or fail to extend your legal residency.
Previous travel to Israel
Evidence of a previous visit to Israel like an Israeli entry/exit stamp in your passport doesn’t normally cause any difficulties when entering Bahrain. It is, however, for the Bahraini authorities to determine the right of entry into the country. If you have any concerns, you should contact the Embassy of the Kingdom of Bahrain in London.
