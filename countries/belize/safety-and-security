Crime
There have been incidents of violent crime and physical assaults including armed robbery and rape targeted at tourists. Armed criminal gangs from Guatemala have been known to operate in the past around densely forested areas of Belize and close to some tourist sites. These incidents are now uncommon and the Belize Defence Force patrols these areas.
The majority of muggings are in Belize City, but crime occurs in all districts including tourist spots like San Pedro, Caye Caulker and Placencia. Avoid dark alleys, keep valuables out of sight and don’t wear jewellery. If possible travel in groups and use a qualified guide for trips off the beaten track.
In some areas of Belize City there is a risk of gang related violence. The areas around George Street and Kraal Road are particularly dangerous. Take carewalking in the city
You should report all incidents of assault, robbery, theft or other crimes to the police. The police will take a statement and investigate the matter. This may take several weeks. You can pay a fee at any point during the process to receive a copy of the report when it is completed.
Local travel
There have been a number of injuries and fatalities resulting from adventure sports activities including snorkelling and diving. Severe weather and inadequate safety precautions are the main causes. Check local weather forecasts and only use registered and licensed operators.
Take particular care in the Belize/Guatemala border area because of the ongoing dispute between the two countries. Only use officially recognised border crossings.
You can find more information on local travel on the  Belize Tourism Board’s website.
Road travel
You can drive using your UK Driving Licence or an International Driving Permit for up to 3 months. For longer stays, you’ll need to get a Belize driving permit from the Department of Traffic in the district you’re in.
Road accidents are common and local driving standards are poor. Take great care when driving, particularly during rainy conditions when roads can become slippery. In southern parts of the country, particularly in Stann Creek and Toledo, temporary bridges and causeways in low-lying areas may flood during severe weather.
Political situation
Political demonstrations can occur in Belize City and Belmopan, often at short notice. Most are peaceful, although some have resulted in civil disorder.
Follow local media and avoid large gatherings of people or demonstrations.
