This page gives you guidance on how to stay safely in Tunisia as a visitor, if you are unable to return to the UK.
Everyone should comply with the measures put in place in Tunisia to limit the spread of coronavirus (COVID-19).
Moving around in Tunisia
On 4 June, Tunisia removed or reduced a number of its confinement measures:
Travel restrictions between cities and regions have been lifted
Cafes, hotels, restaurants and places of worship are permitted to reopen
Public transport has resumed at 50% capacity
Public administrations, businesses and services can return to operating at full capacity.
While the majority of restrictions have been lifted, the Tunisian authorities have announced that wearing a face mask in public places and the workplace is mandatory.

Finance
There is a range of financial support from the government that you can access while you are unable to return due to coronavirus restrictions.
If you’re in Tunisia, and have exhausted all other options to cover essential living costs while you wait to return home, you could apply for an emergency loan for your living costs from the UK government. You can only apply if you normally live in the UK and you cannot return home. This last-resort option is for those most in need, and you would need to repay the loan when you are back in the UK. Apply for an emergency loan.

If you need urgent consular assistance, contact your nearest British embassy. All telephone numbers are available 24/7.
