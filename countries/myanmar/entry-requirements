The information on this page covers the most common types of travel and reflects the UK government’s understanding of the rules currently in place. Unless otherwise stated, this information is for travellers using a full ‘British Citizen’ passport.
The authorities in the country or territory you’re travelling to are responsible for setting and enforcing the rules for entry. If you’re unclear about any aspect of the entry requirements, or you need further reassurance, you’ll need to contact the embassy, high commission or consulate of the country or territory you’re travelling to.
You should also consider checking with your transport provider or travel company to make sure your passport and other travel documents meet their requirements.
Entry rules in response to coronavirus
Entry to Myanmar
The government of Myanmar has suspended all international commercial passenger flights from any of its airports until 31 January 2021 at the earliest. It will then review the situation.
Residents of the United Kingdom, or those who have visited the United Kingdom within the previous 14 days, are currently unable to enter Myanmar.
New tourist visa applications are currently suspended.
At present Myanmar authorities can offer business visas to foreign nationals with a compelling case. You or your employer must make your case to your nearest Myanmar Embassy and obtain permission.
These arrangements are subject to change and at short notice.
Testing/Screening on arrival
There are temperature checks for all arrivals. Arrivals must provide evidence of a negative COVID-19 test result. You should not use the NHS testing service to get a test in order to facilitate your travel to another country. You should arrange to take a private test.
Testing requirements ahead of entry to Myanmar are subject to change. Confirmation should be sought from the Myanmar Embassy in London well in advance of your departure.
Quarantine requirements
Arrivals in Myanmar must enter government-arranged quarantine. You will be allotted your quarantine facility on arrival. You may have no choice but will be placed in the same government quarantine facility or hotel as all the other people on your flight. You will be provided with food, for which you will be charged.
Foreign nationals arriving in Myanmar will need to undergo a quarantine period. The exact length will depend on your travel history. You should confirm your quarantine requirements with the relevant Myanmar Embassy before you travel.
Those arriving in Myanmar may need to abide by the following quarantine requirements:
complete 7 days home quarantine prior to the date of travel. This must be verified by an employer’s or doctor’s declaration, or a self-declaration. During these 7 days you may only leave your place of quarantine to take a COVID test
provide evidence of a negative COVID test result
complete 7 days quarantine in a government facility or government approved hotel on arrival in Myanmar (allocated on arrival)
undertake a COVID test after 7 days (through the National Health Laboratory, at a cost is MMK 200,000). If you test negative, you must complete a further 7 days of home quarantine, and will then be able to leave quarantine. If you test positive, you will be transferred to a designated government hospital for COVID patients. You will need to remain for 28 days in hospital, after which you can leave if you have tested negative for COVID for two consecutive weeks prior
These rules are subject to change at short notice, and the government of Myanmar can extend quarantine periods for a number of reasons, even for those who have been granted permission to undergo a shorter quarantine period. This includes if any person on a flight you might have used tests positive for COVID-19, or in response to the situation in a country you might have recently visited.
If hospitalised with coronavirus, patients are obliged to use a government facility even if they have private insurance. Patients in government hospitals are generally expected to make their own arrangements for bringing in food and other essential supplies. Lone travellers will not be allowed out of isolation to buy food or make phone calls.
These arrangements are subject to change and at short notice. Confirmation should be sought from the Myanmar Embassy in London well in advance of your departure.

Yellow fever

UK Emergency Travel Documents
UK Emergency Travel Documents (ETDs) are not valid for entry into Myanmar. They are accepted for exit from Myanmar but a valid visa has to be added to the ETD once the document is issued. You will need a passport photo for Immigration. Please ensure you check with the relevant Embassy if you propose to transit through another country and also with your airline. A visa can take several days to issue and some countries may not allow them on an ETD.
