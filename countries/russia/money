The currency in Russia is the Russian rouble (RUB).
Most hotels, restaurants and larger shops accept credit cards, and there are ATMs in most major cities. However, it is advisable to have the cash equivalent of around £200 in roubles with you to meet any cash expenses. Taxi drivers are unlikely to accept card payments.
Let your credit/debit card provider know where you’re going to avoid your card being blocked for anti-fraud reasons.
Most major high street banks and currency exchange providers in the UK can pre-order roubles. If you plan to buy roubles in Russia, you should take US dollars or euros to exchange, and only change money at banks, hotels and airport exchange bureaux. It is an offence to change money from street traders.
It is illegal to pay directly for general transactions with dollars or euros.
Travellers’ cheques are not widely accepted.
