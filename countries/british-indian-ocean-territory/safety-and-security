Coronavirus guidance is being updated.
Read the Prime Ministerâ€™s address for the latest information.

Crime
Crime levels are low. There is no permanent population in BIOT, but Diego Garcia, the largest of the 58 islands, hosts a joint UK-US military facility.
Sea travel
International Naval Forces present in the Gulf of Aden/Indian Ocean are successfully suppressing Pirate activity in the region. However, previous attempted piracy attacks off the coast of Somalia and in the Gulf of Aden highlight that the threat remains. Reports of attacks on local fishing dhows in the area around the Gulf of Aden and Horn of Africa continue. The combined threat assessment of the international Naval Forces remains that all sailing yachts under their own passage should remain out of the designated High Risk Area or face the risk of being hijacked and held hostage for ransom.
