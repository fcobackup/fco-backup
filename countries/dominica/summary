The hurricane season in the Caribbean normally runs from June to November. You should monitor local and international weather updates from the US National Hurricane Center and follow the advice of local authorities, including any evacuation orders. See Natural disasters.
Hurricane Maria passed over Dominica on 19 September 2017, causing widespread damage to communications, buildings and infrastructure. Life in Dominica continues to return to a state of normality. Water and electricity has been restored, but many homes remain damaged. Communications can be intermittent in some parts of the island. All the main roads have been cleared, although heightened care is needed when navigating roads that were badly damaged by the hurricane and in the more remote areas of the island.
Consular support may be limited in Dominica as there is no British High Commission office.  However, the British High Commission in Bridgetown, Barbados, can provide consular support.
UK health authorities have classified Dominica as having a risk of Zika virus transmission. For more information and advice, visit the website of the National Travel Health Network and Centre website.
