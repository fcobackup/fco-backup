Demonstrations and other forms of protest, are subject to various restrictions. However, different types of protests occur frequently and can take place at short notice throughout the country, particularly on Tuesdays and Fridays. You should take precautions for your personal safety by avoiding political gatherings and demonstrations. See Political situation
Terrorists are likely to try to carry out attacks in Algeria, including kidnappings. Terrorist attacks have focused on the Algerian state, but attacks could be indiscriminate and include foreigners. There’s also a risk that lone actors could target foreigners. You should be vigilant at all times and take additional security precautions, especially in towns and cities; the southern, Libyan and Tunisian border areas; rural and mountainous areas in the north; and the Sahara. See Terrorism
The Algerian authorities devote considerable resources to the safety of foreign visitors. If you’re travelling independently, you should notify the Ministry of Foreign Affairs or local authorities of your plans. See Local travel
When moving around Algiers and the other main cities, avoid areas that you don’t know, especially after dark. Travelling in rural areas and at night is particularly risky and it’s always advisable to travel with a reputable guide or companion in these areas. Avoid travel by road at night outside the major cities and motorways. See Crime and Local travel
You will need to get a visa before you travel. See Visas
If you’re abroad and you need emergency help from the UK government, contact the nearest British embassy, consulate or high commission. Consular support is severely limited in parts of Algeria where the FCDO has existing advice against all travel, and limited where the FCDO has existing advice against all but essential travel (see above).
