If you plan to pass through another country to return to the UK, check the travel advice for the country you’re transiting.
Be prepared for your plans to change
No travel is risk-free during COVID. Countries may further restrict travel or bring in new rules at short notice, for example due to a new COVID-19 variant. Check with your travel company or airline for any transport changes which may delay your journey home.
If you test positive for COVID-19, you may need to stay where you are until you test negative. You may also need to seek treatment there.
Plan ahead and make sure you:
can access money
understand what your insurance will cover
can make arrangements to extend your stay and be away for longer than planned
Travel in Honduras
Restrictions are in place due to COVID-19. This includes a daily curfew from 10pm to 5am throughout the country for non-vaccinated people. Anyone ignoring the curfew will be detained by local authorities unless they are carrying evidence that they have been vaccinated. Visit the website of the Honduran Police for more information on present restrictions related to COVID-19.
British nationals should respect the curfew. It is mandatory to use facemasks and hand sanitiser, and maintain social distancing in public. Ensure you have the documents for your hotel, car rental, tour or ticket reservations with you at all times. Local authorities may stop you and ask for documents confirming your travel plans.
You can keep up to date with the COVID-19 situation in Honduras and any current restrictions by visiting the official website of the Honduran Government.

If you think you have COVID-19 symptoms you should seek medical advice and visit this official page for guidance from the Honduran authorities.
The public health system has limited capacity for handling severe and critical cases of COVID-19.
Some private hospitals are accepting patients with COVID-19, but it will cost 1,000,000 Lempiras (over £30,000) to be admitted, with the final medical bill potentially higher.
Small clinics can provide testing, basic medical attention and medication to COVID-19 patients with mild symptoms who do not require special medical care.
British-issued prescriptions cannot be used locally. To find a pharmacy (“farmacia”) look for one of the big national chains such as Farmacias Siman, Farmacias Kielsa or Farmacia El Ahorro, among others; a quick search online should help you to identify the nearest one open.
Your emotional and mental wellbeing is important. Read guidance on how to look after your mental wellbeing and mental health during the COVID-19 pandemic

COVID-19 vaccines if you live in Honduras
Wherever possible British nationals should aim to be vaccinated in the country where they live. We will update this page when the Government of Honduras announces new information on the national vaccination programme. You can sign up to get email notifications when this page is updated.
The Honduras national vaccination programme started in February 2021 and is using AstraZeneca, Pfizer/BioNTech, Moderna and Sputnik V vaccines. British nationals resident in Honduras are eligible for vaccination, if they choose to join the programme. People who meet the criteria as advertised by the Health Department (Secretaria de Salud) can follow them on their website and their social media pages (Twitter and Facebook) for information on the nearest vaccination center.
Find out more, including about vaccines that are authorised in the UK or approved by the World Health Organisation, on the COVID-19 vaccines if you live abroad page. If you’re a British national living in Honduras, you should seek medical advice from your local healthcare provider.
