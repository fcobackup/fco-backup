Departing Lesotho via South Africa
The Ministry of Foreign Affairs has advised that foreign visitors are permitted to leave Lesotho to catch flights out of South Africa if flights resume. However, visitors to Lesotho must travel through, or transit via, South Africa.
South Africa has put in place travel restrictions and visa requirements for individuals from countries affected by coronavirus (COVID-19), including the United Kingdom. Special permission from the South African authorities is required to return to the UK via South Africa. If you wish to return to the UK, you should contact the British High Commission in Pretoria on +27 12 421 7500 and keep up to date with FCO travel advice for South Africa.
The South African High Commission Maseru is temporarily closed but may still issue visas in emergency situations.
Your journey home
The National Travel Health Network and Centre (NaTHNaC) provides advice on how to stay safe as you travel by air.
When you arrive back in the UK, follow the guidance for when you return to the UK on steps you should take to protect yourself and others.
Help and support
You will need to pay for your return travel to the UK. If departure options are available but you cannot afford the travel costs and have exhausted all other options for getting funds, you may be eligible to apply for an emergency loan from the government. This is a last resort option and you would need to repay the loan when you are back in the UK. For more information, you should contact Corporate Travel Management (CTM). CTM are a commercial partner of the FCO and are authorised to administer such loans on behalf of the FCO.
If you need urgent consular assistance, you can contact the British High Commission Pretoria, (which provides consular support to British nationals in Lesotho) on +27 12 421 7500
The High Commission cannot provide further information or advice about departure options over the phone. This page will be updated when departure options become available. To get the latest information, sign up for travel advice email alerts.
