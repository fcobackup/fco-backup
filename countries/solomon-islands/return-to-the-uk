Coronavirus guidance is being updated.
Read the Prime Minister’s statement for the latest information.

On 27 March, the Government of Solomon Islands announced the closure of the country’s borders. All international flights in and out of the country are suspended until further notice. If you hold a ticket for an outbound flight, stay in touch with your airline or travel provider for any updates.
No passenger flights from the Solomon Islands, chartered or scheduled, are currently planned.
Future travel options
Travel via Australia
From 20 March, entry to Australia is only permitted to Australian citizens or permanent residents. This follows a similar announcement by New Zealand from 19 March.
The Australian Border Force has confirmed that British nationals can transit Australia from Pacific Island airports but must secure an exemption as soon as possible. You should have onward connections within 8 hours of your arrival. This need not be on the same calendar day as long as the airport is open 24 hours (Brisbane is).
If you’re planning to travel via Australia, you should complete the exemption process and then email the following details to the British High Commission in Honiara:
your passport details, including full name, date of birth and passport number (or attach a photograph of your passport details page)
your contact details
when you completed the online exemption process (and any reference number)
which flight to Australia you intend to travel on
The British High Commission will pass your details to Australian authorities. However, please note that exemptions are a matter for the Australian authorities and cannot be guaranteed.
Help and support
You will need to pay for your return travel to the UK. If departure options are available but you cannot afford the travel costs and have exhausted all other options for getting funds, you may be eligible to apply for an emergency loan from the government. This is a last resort option and you would need to repay the loan when you are back in the UK. For more information, you should contact Corporate Travel Management (CTM). CTM are a commercial partner of the FCO and are authorised to administer such loans on behalf of the FCO.
Your journey home: re-entering the UK
When you return, you must follow the rules for entering the UK. You:
need to provide your journey and contact details up to 48 hours before you’re due to arrive in the UK
are not allowed to leave the place you’re staying for the first 14 days you’re in the UK except in very limited situations (known as ‘self-isolating’)
See also the list of people who are exempt from the border rules.
The National Travel Health Network and Centre (NaTHNaC) also provides advice on how to stay safe as you travel by air.
