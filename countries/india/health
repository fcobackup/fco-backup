Air pollution
Severe air pollution is a major health hazard, especially during the winter months from October to February. North Indian cities are most affected by extremely high levels of pollution. Children, the elderly and those with pre-existing medical conditions may be especially affected. If you’re pregnant or have a respiratory or heart condition you may wish to consult a medical practitioner before you travel.

Healthcare in India
Medical facilities differ from those in the UK, especially in more remote areas. Specialised treatment may not be available outside major cities. In major cities, government and more expensive private medical care is available 
FCDO has a list of medical providers in India where some staff will speak English.
Transplant surgery
If you’re travelling to India for organ transplant surgery, check in advance with the hospital what proof they need about your circumstances in the UK. You may need to submit evidence of your marriage and birth of your children before the operation can take place. You can get copies of marriage and birth certificates from the General Register Office in the UK. You may want to get your documents legalised before travelling. The British High Commission cannot provide guarantees and certificates on your behalf.
