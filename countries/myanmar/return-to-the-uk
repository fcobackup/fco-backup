Myanmar has suspended all scheduled commercial passenger flights in and out of the country, and sealed off all of its land borders to foreigners. International airports will not re-open to scheduled commercial inbound flights to Myanmar before 31 July.
We know this is concerning for British people trying to leave Myanmar. The UK government is working closely with airlines, the Myanmar authorities and other governments to make sure options are available for you to return to the UK as soon as possible.
If you cannot leave Myanmar at this time, see advice on staying in Myanmar during coronavirus.
Flights
There are limited options for British nationals looking to return to the UK.
Myanmar Airways International and Korean Air are operating some relief flights from Yangon to Seoul in July. You should visit the Myanmar Airways International website and Korean Air website for updated information and to book tickets. From Seoul connections to the UK are available.
Your temperature will be checked on arrival and if high, a COVID test will follow. A positive result will lead to hospitalisation in South Korea. You will not need a COVID-free certificate prior to travel, but you will need a confirmed onward ticket.
You will need to pay for your return travel to the UK. If departure options are available but you cannot afford the travel costs and have exhausted all other options for getting funds, you may be eligible to apply for an emergency loan from the government. This is a last resort option and you would need to repay the loan when you are back in the UK. For more information, you should contact Corporate Travel Management (CTM). CTM are a commercial partner of the FCO and are authorised to administer such loans on behalf of the FCO.
