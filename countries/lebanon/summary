On 25 February 2019 the UK Government announced that it will ask Parliament to proscribe the political wing of Hizballah under the 2000 Terrorism Act. Hizballah is a Lebanese political party and armed group. Following the announcement, you should avoid large crowds, gatherings, and any related protests or demonstrations, check local media and keep up to date with Travel Advice.

There’s a heightened risk of terrorism against aviation. Additional security measures have been in place on flights departing from Lebanon to the UK since March 2017. You should co-operate fully with security officials. Restrictions on carrying large electronic devices in the aircraft cabin, introduced as part of these measures, have now been lifted for airlines operating from airports in Lebanon. For more information and advice about what items you can take into the cabin on your flight from Lebanon to the UK, contact your airline or travel company.
You can contact the emergency services by calling 112.
If you’re abroad and you need emergency help from the UK government, contact the nearest British embassy, consulate or high commission. Consular support is severely limited in parts of Lebanon where we advise against all travel and limited where we advise against all but essential travel.
The Overseas Business Risk service offers information and advice for British companies operating overseas on how to manage political, economic, and business security-related risks.
