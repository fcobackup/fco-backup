This page gives you guidance on how to stay safely in Costa Rica as a visitor, if you are unable to return to the UK.
Everyone should comply with the measures put in place in Costa Rica to limit the spread of coronavirus (COVID-19).
Moving around in Costa Rica
Using private vehicles is currently restricted: from 5am to 10pm, the usual registration plate restriction for San Jose has been extended to the entire country. The authorities have also announced a ban on the use of private vehicles between 10pm and 5am, except those used by officials, diplomats or people categorised as ‘essential workers’.
On weekends, vehicles are restricted according to odd/even license plate number, and only for visits to supermarkets, pharmacies and medical centres. You should check vehicle guidance for further details.
We advise British nationals in Costa Rica to follow the advice of the local authorities. The supply of hire cars may be reduced, as rental companies have been asked to lend their vehicles for deliveries of medical equipment and goods. Public transport is operational from 4 am to 11pm. Taxis can operate at all hours.

Visas
Any foreigner who entered Costa Rica as a tourist after 17 December 2019 will have their visa waiver (usually 90 days) extended until 17 July 2020. There is no need to apply for this to be processed, it is applied automatically.
Accommodation
You should find accommodation that’s suitable for your needs. The Costa Rican authorities ordered the closure of all hotels, except those providing accommodation to foreign tourists and some essential workers, until 30 April.

Finance
There is a range of financial support from the government that you can access while you are unable to return due to coronavirus restrictions.
If you’re in Costa Rica, and have exhausted all other options to cover essential living costs while you wait to return home, you could apply for an emergency loan for your living costs from the UK government. You can only apply if you normally live in the UK and you cannot return home. This last-resort option is for those most in need, and you would need to repay the loan when you are back in the UK. Apply for an emergency loan.
