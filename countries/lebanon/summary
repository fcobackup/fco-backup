Protests started on the evening of 17 October in response to new tax measures proposed by the Government. Demonstrations are ongoing across the country and you should stay away from large groups. Protests have been generally peaceful, but there has been sporadic violence, including clashes between protestors and security forces, vandalism and looting. Banks remain closed, and there are reports of some ATMs being low on cash. All major roads in and out of Beirut are blocked. Where possible, road travel to and from Beirut should be avoided.
The roads to and from Beirut Rafic Hariri International Airport were blocked by protestors and could become blocked again without notice. This could lead to you being unable to leave the airport if arriving, and unable to access the airport if departing. If travelling to or from Beirut you should contact your airline before departure as some flights have been cancelled, ensure that you have sufficient cash and mobile phone charge at all times, and ensure that you have adequate medical supplies if required. If you are unable to leave Beirut airport, you should remain there until the authorities confirm the access roads are open. If you require urgent consular assistance, please contact the Embassy on 00 961 1 960 800.
On 1 September 2019 there was an exchange of fire between the militant group Hizballah and the Israeli Defence Force, across the Blue Line with material damage but no reported injuries on either side. A conflict with Israel could spark with little warning with a rapid escalation in violence - you should keep up to date with the news and this travel advice while travelling.
The security situation in parts of Lebanon can deteriorate quickly. Keep up to date with developments, be vigilant, follow local advice and avoid any protests or demonstrations. Roads can become blocked due to protests, this could potentially include the main airport road connecting the airport with central Beirut. In the event of widespread disturbances or a deterioration in the security situation, there may be limits to the assistance that the British Embassy is able to provide.

Terrorists are very likely to try to carry out attacks in Lebanon. You should be vigilant at all times, avoid crowds and crowded places and follow the advice of the Lebanese authorities. On 3 June 2019, 3 Lebanese security personnel were killed in Tripoli by a suspected militant. Be particularly vigilant at this time. See Terrorism
There’s a heightened risk of terrorism against aviation. Additional security measures have been in place on flights departing from Lebanon to the UK since March 2017. You should co-operate fully with security officials. Restrictions on carrying large electronic devices in the aircraft cabin, introduced as part of these measures, have now been lifted for airlines operating from airports in Lebanon. For more information and advice about what items you can take into the cabin on your flight from Lebanon to the UK, contact your airline or travel company.
There are unexploded ordnance and land mines in many places. You should avoid travelling away from established paths, especially when hiking. This is particularly a concern in southern Lebanon.
Groups within Lebanon, including Hizballah, are proscribed under the Terrorism Act 2000. Offences committed under the act – including funding and supporting proscribed organisations – may be liable to prosecution in the UK.
You can contact the emergency services by calling 112.
If you’re abroad and you need emergency help from the UK government, contact the nearest British embassy, consulate or high commission. Consular support is severely limited in parts of Lebanon where we advise against all travel and limited where we advise against all but essential travel.
The Overseas Business Risk service offers information and advice for British companies operating overseas on how to manage political, economic, and business security-related risks.
Take out comprehensive travel and medical insurance before you travel.
