There are currently extremely limited commercial options available to return to the UK from Romania.
UK special charter flights will only operate for priority countries where commercial flights are not possible. You should not assume that these flights will become available in countries where commercial routes are operating. Please do not contact the contracted travel management company if no flight is advertised here.
Flights
Direct flights between Romania and the UK have been suspended by the Romanian Government. We know the suspension of flights is concerning for British people trying to leave Romania. The UK government is working closely with airlines, the Romanian authorities and other governments to make sure options are available for you to return to the UK as soon as possible.
Travelling to the airport
Due to movement restrictions in place, when travelling to the airport make sure you carry:
your passport
a Romanian movement declaration form, if you are moving between towns, cities, or counties in order to reach the airport, either electronically or in paper form
your flight ticket
Overland travel and transit
Limited passenger transit across or through Romania is possible. To transit by land across Romania cross at any open border post, and fill in a Romanian movement declaration form with details of your route across Romania. Carry this declaration and your passport at all times.
Your journey home
The National Travel Health Network and Centre (NaTHNaC) provides advice on how to stay safe as you travel by air.

You will need to pay for your return travel to the UK. If departure options are available but you cannot afford the travel costs and have exhausted all other options for getting funds, you may be eligible to apply for an emergency loan from the government. This is a last resort option and you would need to repay the loan when you are back in the UK.
For more information, contact Corporate Travel Management (CTM). CTM are a commercial partner of the FCO and are authorised to administer such loans on behalf of the FCO.
