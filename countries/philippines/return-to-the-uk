Commercial options to return to the UK have been running throughout the lockdown period. However the airport authorities have announced a temporary suspension of commercial passenger flights beginning on 3 May. You should check whether your flight has been affected with your airline before travelling to the airport.
Commercial flights
There remains widespread disruption to international travel routes, and domestic flights are currently suspended.
The following airlines have been operating international flights from Manila Ninoy Aquino International Airport, with connections to the UK:
Qatar Airways to London Heathrow, Manchester and Edinburgh, via Doha
Korean Air to London Heathrow, via Seoul Incheon
Gulf Air to London Heathrow, via Bahrain
You will need to pay for your return travel to the UK. If departure options are available but you cannot afford the travel costs and have exhausted all other options for getting funds, you may be eligible to apply for an emergency loan from the government. This is a last resort option and you would need to repay the loan when you are back in the UK. For more information, you should contact Corporate Travel Management (CTM). CTM are a commercial partner of the FCO and are authorised to administer such loans on behalf of the FCO.
Travel to departure airports for commercial flights
Resolution No.15 of the Philippines Inter-Agency Task Force grants that all stranded foreign nationals can travel to and from national government facilities such as airports, ferries, bus terminals etc.
If you plan to take a commercial flight but are experiencing difficulty travelling to the airport due to community quarantine restrictions, the British Embassy can provide a letter to facilitate your passage through checkpoints.
Contact the British Embassy Manila at ukinthephilippines@fco.gov.uk. You can also seek assistance from your local Department of Tourism office, which may be able to offer advice on transport options or hotels.
Visa and Immigration Considerations when leaving the Philippines
If your tourist visa expired during the ECQ period:
You can apply for an extension, without penalty, up to 30 days after the lifting of the Enhanced Community Quarantine (ECQ). If you have overstayed and are trying to leave the country, you can arrange a visa extension at international airports. There may be a standard fee in order to extend the visa but no penalty fee will be applied.
If your visa expired before the ECQ and you have been in the Philippines for more than 12 months:
Any fines and penalties will need to be settled in a Bureau of Immigration (BI) sub-port office. The list of BI sub-port offices may be found at the Bureau of Immigration website
If your visa expired before the ECQ and you have been in the Philippines for less than 12 months:
Any fines and penalties may be settled at the airport before your departure.
Emigration Clearance Certificate (ECC):
You should refer to the Bureau of Immigration website to check if you are required to pay for an ECC. Instructions and a checklist can also be found at the Bureau of Immigration website. You can settle this at the airport before your departure.
Other important points:
All ACR I cardholders are generally required to pay for the ECC upon departure.
Those with approved visas but who are yet to receive their ACR I cards can show their receipt at the airport.
Foreigners with approved visa applications which have not yet been issued can present their valid passport, DOJ endorsement or Certification from the approving office and receipt.
