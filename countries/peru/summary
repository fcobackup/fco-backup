In response to the continuing widespread protests following a change of government on 7 December, the Peruvian Government has declared a 30 day nationwide state of emergency. The political situation is volatile. Protests are escalating quickly and include violence, with protests continuing to take place in different parts of the country, including Apurimac, Arequipa, Cusco, Ica, along the Panamericana Highway and elsewhere. This has resulted in the disruption of local travel, with several road blockades, train disruptions and some airport closures, including the suspension of PeruRail train services to/from Machu Picchu and the closure of Arequipa, Juliaca (Puno) and Cusco airports. For information on airport closures, please visit the Lima airport website.
See the safety and security page for more information.
If you’re in need of emergency assistance, contact the nearest British embassy, consulate or high commission. The Peruvian tourist authority i-Peru has separately created an online form for any stranded foreign nationals to complete, to help them understand who may be affected by the current situation and inform the work of local authorities. This is not a UK Government registration scheme and we will not be contacting those who complete the form.
You should follow the local authorities’ advice and monitor local media closely. Avoid large gatherings and protests. See Safety and Security pages.
Before you travel, check the ‘Entry requirements’ section for Peru’s current entry restrictions and requirements. These may change with little warning. Monitor this advice for the latest updates and stay in contact with your travel provider.
