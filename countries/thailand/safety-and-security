Political situation
The political situation in Thailand is unpredictable and sometimes volatile. Over recent years there have been instances of civil and political unrest resulting in large demonstrations and in some cases violence. You should avoid any protests, political gatherings, demonstrations or marches.
On 13 October 2016, the death of His Majesty King Bhumibol Adulyadej was announced. His cremation took place on 26 October 2017.
On 1 December 2016, the Crown Prince acceded to the throne and was pronounced His Majesty King Maha Vajiralongkorn Bodindradebayavarangkun, or His Majesty King Rama X. There’s currently no date set for his coronation.
On 22 May 2014, the military took control of government. Article 44 of the interim constitution gives wide powers to General Prayuth Chan-o-cha, Prime Minister and head of the National Council for Peace and Order (NCPO). Restrictions remain on freedom of assembly and expression. A number of media outlets, including international media, have been taken off air and some internet sites remain blocked. People have been prosecuted for criticising the 2014 military coup and calling for new elections. You should be wary of making political statements in public. Lèse-majesté, (criticism of the monarchy in any form) is a crime, which can be interpreted broadly and carries a long jail sentence. Some foreign (including British) and Thai journalists, human rights defenders and members of the public face criminal charges, including for defamation and sedition, for raising concerns and making political comments.
Crime
Be on your guard against pickpockets and bag snatchers. Foreigners have had items snatched by thieves on motorbikes when walking along busy streets or travelling in open transport like tuk tuks. If you travel by bus or rail, make sure passports, cash and valuables are kept securely and out of sight. Passengers have had items taken from bags while asleep.
Don’t hand over your passport to third parties as a guarantee (eg to motorcycle or jet ski rental businesses). Unscrupulous owners have been known to hold on to passports against claimed damage.
Violent sexual assaults and unprovoked attacks have been reported in popular tourist destinations, including in the Koh Samui archipelago and Krabi province. These are particularly common during the monthly Full Moon parties and generally occur late at night near bars.
Drink spiking has been reported in tourist destinations around Thailand, with both male and female victims. Be careful about taking drinks from strangers and at clubs and parties, or leaving your drinks unattended, particularly in Koh Samui, Pattaya and at the Full Moon party on Koh Phangan, where date rapes have been reported.
Alcohol and drugs can lead to you being less alert, less in control and less aware of your environment resulting in accidents, injuries, robbery, assaults and lost travel documents. If you drink, know your limit. Drinks served in bars overseas are often stronger than those in the UK. Some British nationals in Thailand have suffered severe psychiatric problems because of drug use, resulting in some suicides.
Be aware of the possibility of credit card fraud. Don’t lose sight of your card during transactions. There have been incidents of ATM skimming in Thailand. Where possible use an ATM within a bank and always protect your PIN.
Be careful to observe demarcation lines between shops and stalls, particularly in market areas and at Suvarnabhumi Airport. Taking items from one shop’s area to another may be treated as suspected theft.
Gem scams are common. There have been reports of visitors buying gems for inflated prices from seemingly respectable establishments then later finding out the stones are worth a tiny fraction of the purchase price.
Buying a property in Thailand isn’t straightforward and you should be aware of the risks before making any financial commitments. Foreign nationals have been caught up in property scams. Several British nationals also face criminal defamation charges for alleging fraud and malpractice. The legal process can take a long time and is expensive.
You should report any incidents of crime to the Thai police before leaving the country.
Burmese border
There are occasional clashes between the Thai security forces, armed criminal groups and drug traffickers along the Thai/Burma border. Outside the main towns, police and military checkpoints are actively manned and travellers may be asked to produce ID. See the Tourism Thailand website and seek advice locally before you travel to this part of the country.
Only cross into Burma at an official border checkpoint, and after obtaining any relevant permissions/visas from the Burmese and Thai authorities.
Cambodian border
The line of the international border near the Preah Vihear temple was disputed by Cambodia and Thailand. The exact border is still being delineated.
You should take extra care in border areas and follow the instructions of the local authorities. Due to the ongoing risk of unexploded landmines in the border region, you should stay on marked paths if you visit this area, especially around Ta Krabey where there have been reports of unmarked mines.
Remain alert to the local situation when travelling anywhere near to the border with Cambodia, and at land crossings between the two countries.
Laos border
Not all land border crossings into Laos are open to foreigners and you may need to get a Laos visa before you arrive to cross the border.
Air travel
There are two airports in Bangkok. Suvarnabhumi International Airport is the city’s main international airport. Don Mueang Airport handles mainly domestic and regional flights. Due to roadworks on the route from central Bangkok to Don Mueang airport, the Thai Immigration Bureau have advised travellers to allow more time than usual to reach the airport, especially around long weekends. The roadworks are estimated to last until September 2018.
Rail travel
There have been a number of train derailments in Thailand. Some have resulted in deaths and injuries.
Road travel
You must have an International Driving Permit or Thai driving licence to drive a car or ride a motorcycle in Thailand.
If you use a motor vehicle without the correct licence, your travel insurance may be invalidated in the event of an injury arising from an accident.
There are a high number of road traffic accidents in Thailand. The risk of death or injury on the road increases if you travel at night.
With motorcycles so widely used in Thailand, most road traffic accidents involve motorcycles The World Health Organisation (WHO) rates Thailand as the world’s deadliest country for fatalities on motorcycles, citing an average of 5,500 motorcyclist deaths annually. If you’re riding a motorcycle take extra care and make sure you have appropriate insurance and the correct licence. According to the law, safety helmets must be worn.
Serious accidents involving other vehicles including cars, coaches and mini-buses also occur. Many accidents are due to poor vehicle and driver safety standards. There have been a number of accidents involving overnight coach travel. Seek local advice if you are in any doubt about the safety of your transport provider.
Motorcycles or scooters for hire in beach resorts are often unregistered and can’t be used legally on a public road. Before you hire a vehicle, make sure you’re covered by your travel insurance and check the small print of the lease agreement. Don’t hand over your passport as a guarantee against returning a motorcycle or scooter. Unscrupulous owners regularly hold on to passports against payment for claimed damage to the motorcycle or scooter.
Riding ‘Quad-bikes’ can also be dangerous. It is illegal to drive these on the roads in Thailand even though they’re available to hire on the roadside. If you do ride one, make sure you’re insured.
Sea travel
There are numerous passenger boat services operating between the mainland and islands in Thailand. There have been some sinkings and collisions which have resulted in fatalities, including British nationals. These incidents are usually due to overloading and/or poor maintenance, but also due to rough seas, particularly during local monsoon season.
During the Full Moon parties, speedboats to and from Koh Phangan are often overloaded. Take care at all times and avoid travelling by sea when conditions are rough or on vessels that are clearly overloaded or in poor condition. Make sure life jackets are available and check local weather conditions before travelling.
Adventurous activities and swimming
Check that your insurance covers you for any adventure activities.
Bungee jumping can be dangerous and accidents occur. If you undertake this activity you should satisfy yourself that the company is using the most up-to-date equipment and safety features, and that they are fully licensed and insured.
If you’re considering jungle trekking use a reliable, licensed tour guide. Elephant treks and rides can be dangerous, especially when the elephants are mistreated or not handled properly. Foreign tourists, including British nationals, have been killed and seriously injured when handlers have lost control of their elephants.
Take particular care when swimming off coastal areas, especially during monsoon season. Strong riptides have drowned people in several areas including Phuket, Koh Chang, Hua Hin, Cha-am, Rayong, Pattaya and the Koh Samui archipelago. Always comply with warning signs, especially red flags, and only swim from approved beaches.
Jellyfish can swim close to the shore, particularly during the rainy season. Their sting can be fatal. If in doubt take local advice from hotel management and dive centres.
Take care when swimming, diving, kayaking or white water rafting in rivers or close to waterfalls, particularly in the rainy season. Currents can be extremely strong.
If you rent jet skis or water sports equipment, satisfy yourself that adequate safety precautions are in place. Rent only from reputable, licensed and insured operators, thoroughly check for damage before use and insist on training.
The standards maintained by diving schools and rescue services are not always as high as in the UK. Check a dive operator’s credentials carefully before using them and make sure you’re covered by your insurance. If you’ve had no previous diving experience ask your dive operator to explain what cover they offer before signing up for a course. Make sure safety equipment is available on the boat, particularly oxygen.
You should also ask about contingency plans which should include the ability to call for help while at sea and to evacuate divers to the nearest hyperbaric chamber if necessary.
Travellers with Limited Mobility
There are many interesting places in Thailand that are accessible to all people. But wheelchair access is often limited due to uneven paving, street furniture and a lack of lifts, ramps, etc. This includes buses, public transit systems, and may taxis have limited storage space for wheelchairs. See our general information on planning a safe trip for disabled travellers.
