Travel in Brazil
Restrictions vary from city to city. The use of face masks in public, including on public transport and in taxis and in shops (where open) is now compulsory in various cities including São Paulo, Rio de Janeiro, Belo Horizonte and Brasília. Localised lockdowns continue to varying degrees. You should refer to official guidance in your location for details of what preventative measures are in place and how you can comply with them. Failing to comply with these rules may result in a fine.
Accommodation
Some accommodation options remain open such as hotels, hostels and private rentals but this varies area by area. Some popular beach areas remain closed to non-residents. Check with your accommodation provider what facilities, including restaurants, are available.
Public spaces and services
Set out any local regulations on shops, restaurants, bars, beaches, other leisure activities, large gatherings, particularly focused on actions BNs will need to take and steps that local authorities may take e.g. closing beaches
The situation varies around Brazil with many non-essential services that were closed (i.e. restaurants, shops and bars) now starting to reopen. Tourist attractions, cinemas and theatres many remain closed and in Rio de Janeiro access to the beach is restricted to exercise only. In practice this means that you can now go to the beach, but that the barracas which rent out umbrellas and chairs are not operating.
Healthcare in Brazil
If you think you have COVID-19 symptoms, you should self isolate for 14 days. You should only go to hospital if you are feeling breathless.
The public healthcare system in some states in Brazil are reaching their full capacity which might affect services such as accident & emergency care. Some private hospitals are no longer accepting credit card payments for admissions and only accepting patients with valid health insurance.
Check if your travel or health insurance has comprehensive cover for coronavirus and refer to official channels in your location for further details.
