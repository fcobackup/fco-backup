Entry rules in response to coronavirus (COVID-19)
Entry to Seychelles
To enter Seychelles, passengers must provide proof of a negative COVID-19 test performed within the 48 hours prior to boarding your flight.
Commercial flights are expected to resume from 1 August.
The Department of Health in Seychelles has published a list of originating countries considered low to medium risk. Travellers originating in countries that are considered high risk will not be permitted entry until further notice. You should check Department of Health public information and contact your airline if you intend to travel to Seychelles.
Cruise ships from any country worldwide will not be permitted to berth in Seychelles until further notice.
Seychelles International Airport may allow private jets and commercial charter flights to land if they are carrying passengers who will then be transferred to authorised yachts, or to specifically authorised tourist facilities. All passengers must have proof of a negative coronavirus test performed in the 48 hours prior to boarding. You should contact your airline and the Seychelles Department of Health to understand when and if you will be permitted entry to Seychelles.
Permission for yachts to enter Seychelles waters may be granted by the Public Health Commissioner. Permission for crew to disembark will not be granted until the vessel has spent at least 14 days at sea. If you intend to enter Seychelles waters and if you wish to disembark from a vessel, you are required to contact the Seychelles Department of Health before attempting to do so.
Screening on arrival
All passengers will be temperature checked at all ports of arrival. If symptoms of COVID-19 are found to be present, tests will be conducted. Those found to be positive will be quarantined and re-checked.
Quarantine requirements
Any passengers arriving in Seychelles will be subject to a 14 day mandatory isolation or quarantine. All entry to the country must be approved by the Public Health Commissioner.
Regular entry requirements
The Government of Seychelles is reviewing its policies on Gainful Occupational Permits (GOPs) for foreign nationals. Following the economic impact of the coronavirus, it is a possibility that GOPs for some foreign nationals will not be renewed. You should speak to your employer and contact the Government of Seychelles Department for Immigration and Civil Status if you hold a GOP and are concerned about your employment status in Seychelles.

Visas are not required for British passport holders.
Passport validity
Your passport should be valid for the proposed duration of your stay. No additional period of validity beyond this is required.
