Coronavirus travel health
Check the latest information on risk from COVID-19 for Peru on the TravelHealthPro website.
See the TravelHealthPro website for further advice on travel abroad and reducing spread of respiratory viruses during the COVID-19 pandemic.
International travel
Passengers at the airport will need to follow strict regulations, including the mandatory use of masks and facial protectors (usually a clear plastic full-face covering) and social distancing.
Commercial airlines are operating to and from Peru and the wider Americas (up to 10 hours journey time). If travelling via another country, it is essential you check the Travel Advice for that country, as some currently do not permit transit to/from the UK.
KLM and Air France have requested permission for a weekly flight – every Thursday from Lima to Amsterdam and every Friday to Paris. Tickets are made available on the KLM Peru and Air France Peru websites (both available in English). Airlines from Spain have also obtained permission for special humanitarian flights.
These flights are predominantly for citizens of EU Member States plus passport holders from the UK, Norway, Liechtenstein, Iceland and Switzerland. Citizens of these countries can enter the Netherlands and continue their journey by plane or over land (train, bus, car).

Travel in Peru
On 15 March 2020, Peru announced a national State of Emergency, which has now been extended until 31 December 2020. The regulations are:
a nationwide curfew between the hours of midnight and 4am
social and family gatherings and visits are prohibited
special measures are in place for those under 12 and over 65, and people at risk
when outside, children must be accompanied by an adult who lives with them and maintain a two-meter social distance. Children can go to parks but cannot visit commercial establishments
it is recommended that people over 65 and those who have underlying health conditions must stay at home, with some exceptions; risk groups must not receive visits at home and must avoid the physical contact with people who leave their home
everyone must wear face masks outside of homes
in addition to wearing a face mask, everyone must wear facial protectors (usually a clear plastic full-face covering) when on public transport
there are several restrictions on the use of beaches around the country. In Lima and Callao people will be able to access beaches from Monday to Thursday, while respecting social distance and wearing masks. From Friday to Sunday, access will only be for non-contact aquatic sports, e.g. surfing, sailing. Food and beverages will not be allowed on beaches, only water.
Future changes to curfew rules will be announced by the government.
If you are leaving Peru on a repatriation or commercial flight and your approved period of stay in Peru has expired during the state of emergency, your visa fine should be waived by the Immigration authorities.
Relaxing of restrictions
The Peruvian government has approved a four-phase Economic Reactivation Plan, between May and August which involves relaxing some restrictions and reopening some industry sectors such as Industry and Mining, Construction, Trade and Tourism and Services.
This planned relaxation of industry restrictions remains under review and continues to change.
Accommodation
Accommodation in Peru is available. IPERU, the Peruvian Tourism Information Agency, is offering details of suitable accommodation if you need them.
Public places and services
Public places and services have started to open gradually following the relaxation of restrictions set out by the government.
