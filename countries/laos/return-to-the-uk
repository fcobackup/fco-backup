There are currently only occasional charter flights which allow a return to the UK, via third countries. The UK government is working closely with airlines to make sure options are available for you to return to the UK.
The Embassy is not currently aware of any confirmed international flights for the general public.
You MUST inform us if you are departing on any flights by emailing BritishEmbassy.Vientiane@fco.gov.uk. Due to new regulations issued by the Lao government it is now a legal requirement for the Embassy to inform the Lao Ministry of Foreign Affairs.
The British Embassy Vientiane is issuing updates on the UKinLaos Facebook page with the latest available information on departure options for British nationals wishing to leave Laos.
Air travel
All international flights into Bangkok, are currently suspended until 30 June 2020. You should check any future bookings with your airline and monitor our Thailand travel advice.
Flights via China will not be permitted in the near future, as China has effectively stopped non-Chinese nationals from entering the country. You should check with the airline for the latest information on transit arrangements in China. You should also monitor our China travel advice for updates.
You should keep checking airline websites for the latest information, and to book any available flights directly. Not all third party providers will have up to date information for new flight options.
You will need to pay for your return travel to the UK. If departure options are available but you cannot afford the travel costs and have exhausted all other options for getting funds, you may be eligible to apply for an emergency loan from the government. This is a last resort option and you would need to repay the loan when you are back in the UK. For more information, you should contact Corporate Travel Management (CTM). CTM are a commercial partner of the FCO and are authorised to administer such loans on behalf of the FCO.
Travel via Thailand
An Emergency Decree is currently in force until the end of June. All foreign nationals are barred from entering or transiting Thailand except in certain limited circumstances. If you do not meet these criteria you should not try to enter or transit Thailand. Please check the Thailand travel advice for further details.
The Thai Government has announced that all Thai-Lao border crossings are closed until further notice, including the Thai-Lao Friendship Bridge between Vientiane and Nong Khai. Only commercial goods are permitted to cross at present.
