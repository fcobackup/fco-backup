Coronavirus travel health
See the TravelHealthPro website for further advice on travel abroad and reducing spread of respiratory viruses during the COVID-19 pandemic.
Entry and borders
See Entry requirements to find out what you will need to do when you arrive in Singapore.
Returning to the UK
When you return, you must follow the rules for entering the UK.
You are responsible for organising your own COVID-19 test, in line with UK government testing requirements. Information on local testing facilities is available.
Be prepared for your plans to change
No travel is risk-free during COVID. Countries may further restrict travel or bring in new rules at short notice, for example due to a new COVID-19 variant. Check with your travel company or airline for any transport changes which may delay your journey home.
If you test positive for COVID-19, you may need to stay where you are until you test negative. You may also need to seek treatment there.
Plan ahead and make sure you:
can access money
understand what your insurance will cover
can make arrangements to extend your stay and be away for longer than planned
Travel in Singapore
See the Singapore Government website for the latest on the COVID-19 situation and measures in place to curb its spread.
If you do not comply with these measures you could be fined, imprisoned, or both, then deported. Repeat offenders will face further fines and/or prosecution. Be aware that restrictions and penalties are subject to change at short notice.
Public spaces and services
Face masks
You must wear a face mask in public. Some exceptions are: children under 6 years old; anyone eating, drinking or taking medication; or anyone engaged in strenuous exercise. You could be fined, imprisoned, or both if you are found not wearing a face mask without a valid reason.
The Health Sciences Authority’s guide on face masks recommends that masks have at least 2 to 3 layers of fabric.
Trace Together and Health Alerts via SMS
You’ll need to scan in and out of many places using the Trace Together phone app or token:
public buildings
shopping centres and malls
schools
workplaces
places of worship
If you happen to visit a ‘hotspot’ on the same day as someone infected by the virus or been near an infected person you may receive a health alert via SMS and may need to be tested, stay at home for a period or be placed into quarantine. It is a legal requirement to follow the instructions given to you by the Singapore government.
Quarantine in a government facility
If you test positive, or are considered a close contact of a person who has tested positive, you will likely be placed in hospital or a government quarantine facility for a period possibly up to several weeks. If a minor (someone under 21 years of age) or vulnerable person is placed in quarantine an appropriate carer is permitted to quarantine with them. Those considered to have possibly been exposed to the virus may also be required to be tested, or additionally to stay at home for a period and be monitored. There is a pilot scheme to allow some fully vaccinated people who test positive to serve some of their quarantine at home, provided they are not considered seriously unwell, do not belong to an ‘at risk’ group and have appropriate facilities to isolate at home away from other people.
Dining out if you’re fully vaccinated
You are considered fully vaccinated 14 days after you’ve completed the required doses of these vaccines: Pfizer, Moderna, AstraZeneca (CoviShield), Janssen (Johnson and Johnson), Sinovac or Sinopharm.
Dining out is allowed in groups of up to five people if everyone in the group is fully vaccinated.
Unvaccinated children may be included in the group of five if they are aged 12 years or below and are from the same household as the other diners.
The TraceTogether app or token can be used as proof of vaccination status. A paper copy proof of vaccination can also be used.
Dining out if you are not vaccinated
If you are not vaccinated, you can be part of a group of five when dining out if:
you’ve taken a pre-event test (PET) and tested negative 24 hours prior
you’ve recently recovered from COVID-19
Up to two persons in a group can eat at a hawker centre regardless of vaccination status.
Indoor gyms
Exercise indoors without a mask is permitted in groups of up to five fully vaccinated people and for classes of up to 30 vaccinated participants. Mask-on indoor exercise is permitted for up to five people regardless of vaccination status and up to 50 people can attend mask-on exercise activities. For further guidance, visit the Singapore government website. You should follow the safe distancing measures in place.
Outdoor exercise
You can exercise outdoors without a mask alone or in a groups of up to five regardless of vaccination status.
Work
Working from home is still the default. If you must go to work, wear a face mask and keep a distance of one metre from others. Social gatherings at work are not allowed.
Workplaces can allow up to 50% of their staff (who can work from home) to return to work.
Social gatherings
When meeting up with friends or family:
keep group size to a maximum of five people
five different people (‘unique visitors’) can visit you at home in one day
you are advised to limit social gatherings to one per day, whether at home or in a public place
keep a distance of one metre from each other
If safe distancing is not possible, while on public transport, for example, avoid speaking or talking on the phone.
For guidelines on measures, visit the Singapore government website.
Healthcare in Singapore
For contact details for English speaking doctors see our list of healthcare providers. English is almost universally spoken in Singapore, so all hospitals – whether private or public – will have English-speaking medical staff.
For a complete list of healthcare institutions in Singapore, see the HCI directory.
Anyone requiring a COVID-19 polymerase chain reaction (PCR) test can get it from one of the clinics approved by the Ministry of Health or at a regional testing centre. These clinics issue digital test result certificates. You should have these digital certificates notarised before you travel.
Antigen Rapid Tests are available to purchase from retailers for those who wish to conduct a self-test.

COVID-19 vaccines if you live in Singapore
Wherever possible British nationals should aim to be vaccinated in the country where they live. We will update this page when the Government of Singapore announces new information on the national vaccination programme. You can sign up to get email notifications when this page is updated.
Vaccination programme eligibility
The Singapore national vaccination programme started in December 2020 and is using the Pfizer-BioNTech and Moderna vaccines. The following foreigners are part of the government’s vaccination programme:
permanent residents (PR)
employment pass (EP) holders
S Pass holders
work permit holders
foreign domestic workers
dependant’s pass holders
long-term visit pass (LTVP) holders
student pass holders
Certain categories of short-term pass holders can now also be vaccinated. You should check the guidelines to see if you qualify and to find out how you can register.
Vaccination using Pfizer-BioNTech (also known as Comirnaty) and Moderna is free of charge. Vaccination with other vaccine brands may be possible at private clinics for a fee.
Third dose booster shots are being made available for those over 60 years old, those in care homes and the immunocompromised. More information, including on registration, can be found at Singapore’s COVID-19 vaccination website.
A Vaccine Injury Financial Assistance Programme exists to cover any vaccine related impacts on health. This is available for residents and long-term pass holders who were vaccinated in Singapore with Pfizer or Moderna.
Updating your vaccination status in Singapore
If you were vaccinated abroad, you can update your records in Singapore if:
you’re a resident or long-term pass holder
you were vaccinated outside of Singapore with one of these vaccines: Pfizer (Comirnaty), Moderna, AstraZeneca (Covishield), Janssen (Johnson & Johnson), Sinovac, or Sinopham
you agree to pay for and undertake a serology test in Singapore
Once confirmed, you’ll be recognised as vaccinated on Singapore’s TraceTogether app/token. See the Ministry of Health’s FAQs page for more information.
The local authorities have warned that vaccine-related scams exist.
For any questions about vaccination in Singapore, you should see the Ministry of Health website or call their hotline on 1800-333-9999.
Find out more, including about vaccines that are authorised in the UK or approved by the World Health Organisation, on the COVID-19 vaccines if you live abroad.
If you’re a British national living in Singapore, you should seek medical advice from your local healthcare provider. Information about COVID-19 vaccines used in the national programme where you live, including regulatory status, should be available from local authorities.
Proof of vaccination
Once vaccinated in Singapore, your vaccination status is recorded in the national ‘TraceTogether’ app/token. This can be shown at venues or events which require your vaccination status to enter.
There are two other ways to get proof that you have been vaccinated:
a physical card issued to you after each vaccination
a downloadable version from the Health Hub website or app
You may want to keep a hard copy of the certificate from Health Hub with you, especially when leaving Singapore. For any questions about vaccination certification in Singapore, you should see the Ministry of Health website or call their hotline on 1800-333-9999.
