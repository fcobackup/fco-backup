Be prepared for your plans to change
No travel is risk-free during COVID-19. Countries may further restrict travel or bring in new rules at short notice, for example due to a new COVID-19 variant. Check with your travel company or airline for any transport changes which may delay your journey home.
If you test positive for COVID-19, you may need to stay where you are until you test negative. You may also need to seek treatment there.
Plan ahead and make sure you:
can access money
understand what your insurance will cover
can make arrangements to extend your stay and be away for longer than planned
Public spaces and services
All visitors must comply with social distancing and sanitisation regulations. You will also be required to wear a face mask on public transport, in all indoor public spaces, and in outdoor spaces where it is not possible to maintain 1 metre social distancing.
Bars and restaurants are open with no restriction on opening hours. Theatres, museums and cinemas remain open, and religious ceremonies, including weddings and funerals are allowed.
Gatherings (groups over 10 people where social distancing cannot be maintained) in public or private places are strictly forbidden.
San Marino will accept the UK’s proof of COVID-19 recovery and vaccination record. Your NHS appointment card from vaccination centres is not designed to be used as proof of vaccination and should not be used to demonstrate your vaccine status.
