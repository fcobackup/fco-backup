The Foreign, Commonwealth & Development Office (FCDO) advise against all travel to Afghanistan. You should not travel to Afghanistan
Commercial flights are not currently operating. We are contacting British nationals, who have registered their details with us, with information about flights departing Kabul for the UK. If you are able to leave Afghanistan safely by other means, you should do so immediately.
If you are in need of assistance, you should call +44 (0)1908 516666 and select the option “Consular services for British nationals”.
We have suspended all non-essential operations at the British Embassy in Kabul in response to the deterioration in the security situation. The Embassy has relocated. The FCDO is only providing consular assistance remotely and is extremely limited.
Travel by road throughout the country is extremely dangerous. There have been allegations of people being mistreated on their way to Kabul International Airport.
The UK Home Office phone line for vulnerable people in Afghanistan who wish to apply for resettlement in the UK through the Afghan Citizens’ resettlement scheme is +44 (0)2475 389980.
