Travel in Argentina
Free movement is allowed within each jurisdiction as long as social distancing rules are adhered to.
Night-time curfews may be introduced in jurisdictions deemed high risk by the authorities. The use of public transport within jurisdictions may be restricted to essential workers and those in need of medical treatment. The decision lies with each jurisdiction. In the City of Buenos Aires the use of public transport is no longer restricted. You should make sure you understand and comply with the measures in place in the province/jurisdiction you are in.
Movement between jurisdictions is permitted, provided you meet the requirements of the specific jurisdiction/province you plan to visit. Requirements might include taking a COVID-19 PCR test and applying for a permit to circulate (Certificado Único de Circulación) or a permit for tourism purposes (Certificado Turismo).
You should check what measures apply in your location and any other location you might qualify to travel to or transit through on the Ministry of Health website (in Spanish). You could be subject to a financial penalty if you do not abide by local regulations.

In Argentina, measures to control the spread of COVID-19 are ongoing. The entire country is in a phase of mandatory social distancing. Additional restrictions may vary between jurisdictions.
In all parts of Argentina you must cover your nose and mouth with a face mask or other garment in shared spaces, both indoors and outdoors.

Make sure to check what rules apply in your jurisdiction.
