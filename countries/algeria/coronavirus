As indirect routes to the UK can require an overnight stay, you should consult FCDO Travel Advice for further information on entry and transit requirements.
Many airlines continue to show an online schedule of flights which appear bookable but are cancelled at very short notice with replacements at greater cost. We advise that for any flights, individuals who wish to make a booking should contact the airline directly and receive confirmation from them that the schedule will be running.
Some airlines are requiring passengers to present a printed hard copy of their PCR test certificate before allowing individuals to board. Please ensure you bring a printed certificate.

Entry and borders
See Entry requirements to find out what you will need to do when you arrive in Algeria.
You should contact local authorities for information on testing facilities (only available in French).
Be prepared for your plans to change
No travel is risk-free during COVID-19. Countries may further restrict travel or bring in new rules at short notice, for example due to a new COVID-19 variant. Check with your travel company or airline for any transport changes which may delay your journey home.
If you test positive for COVID-19, you may need to stay where you are until you test negative. You may also need to seek treatment there.
Plan ahead and make sure you:
can access money
understand what your insurance will cover
can make arrangements to extend your stay and be away for longer than planned
Travel in Algeria
Travel between provinces is now permitted.
Since 1 July 2020, local authorities nationwide have powers to enact additional measures in cluster areas, with the approval of central authorities. As a result, localised lockdowns are possible, and markets and other areas with a high concentration of shops could be shut down with limited notice for at least 15 days.
All security services and local authorities have been instructed to rigorously monitor and enforce compliance with preventive and other social distancing measures. Penalties include fines up to the equivalent of £600, and 6 months imprisonment.
The wearing of facemasks became mandatory on 24 May 2020 in all public spaces, including when using public transport, and within taxis.
