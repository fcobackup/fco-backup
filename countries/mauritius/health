At least 8 weeks before your trip, check the latest country-specific health advice from the National Travel Health Network and Centre (NaTHNaC) on the TravelHealthPro website. Each country-specific page has information on vaccine recommendations, any current health risks or outbreaks, and factsheets with information on staying healthy abroad. Guidance is also available from NHS (Scotland) on the FitForTravel website.
General information on travel vaccinations and a travel health checklist is available on the NHS website. You may then wish to contact your health adviser or pharmacy for advice on other preventive measures and managing any pre-existing medical conditions while youâ€™re abroad.
You can bring common medicines for your own personal use but you must carry a copy of the prescription and the drugs must have been obtained legally from a pharmacy. Other drugs like tranquillisers hypnotics, narcotics and other strong pain killers will require prior authorisation. You can check details with the Mauritian Health Ministry. If in any doubt, you should seek advice from the Mauritian High Commission. NaTHNaC have also published guidance on best practice when travelling abroad with medicines.
While travel can be enjoyable, it can sometimes be challenging. There are clear links between mental and physical health, so looking after yourself during travel and when abroad is important. Information on travelling with mental health conditions is available in our guidance page. Further information is also available from the National Travel Health Network and Centre (NaTHNaC).
Good private healthcare is available, but can be costly if you are not insured. More complex cases could require evacuation to Reunion or South Africa.  Make sure you have adequate travel health insurance and accessible funds to cover the cost of any medical treatment abroad and repatriation.
Although there are no malarial mosquitoes in Mauritius, the Ministry of Health may ask you for a blood sample either at the airport or at a later stage during your stay if you have travelled from a country where malaria is common.
Cases of dengue fever transmitted by mosquitoes have been reported. You should take mosquito bite avoidance measures.
Stonefish stings are rare but can be fatal. Seek urgent medical attention if you are stung. Many hotels stock anti-venom serum.
If you need emergency medical assistance during your trip, dial 999 or 114 and ask for an ambulance. Private and state ambulance services are available, but are of variable quality and speed. If you can you should go directly to the hospital. Otherwise, seek advice from your hotel reception. You should contact your insurance/medical assistance company promptly if you are referred to a medical facility for treatment.
Coronavirus
There is an ongoing outbreak of coronavirus (COVID-19) in China, some other countries in the region and elsewhere. The Mauritius authorities have introduced precautionary measures.
There are enhanced quarantine procedures at entry points to Mauritius such as airports and ports. Health authorities may carry out extended health checks on arrival. Any passenger showing symptoms of coronavirus may be placed in quarantine for up to 14 days. You should comply with any additional screening measures by the authorities if asked to go through extra checks.
As a preventative measure against the spread of coronavirus, the Government of Mauritius has announced that any person who has travelled to China since 19 January, or South Korea since 10 February, or Iran or Italy since 14 February, will not be permitted to clear immigration and enter Mauritius.
Further information on coronavirus, including advice on preparing for foreign travel and helping reduce the spread of the virus, is available from Public Health England and on the TravelHealthPro website.
