The information on this page covers the most common types of travel and reflects the UK government’s understanding of the rules currently in place. Unless otherwise stated, this information is for travellers using a full ‘British Citizen’ passport.
The authorities in the country or territory you’re travelling to are responsible for setting and enforcing the rules for entry. If you’re unclear about any aspect of the entry requirements, or you need further reassurance, you’ll need to contact the embassy, high commission or consulate of the country or territory you’re travelling to.
You should also consider checking with your transport provider or travel company to make sure your passport and other travel documents meet their requirements.
Restrictions in response to coronavirus
Travel restrictions and borders
Travellers without symptoms arriving from an EU Member State or Schengen Convention state or from the UK are allowed to enter the country. On 6 July, entry was also opened to travellers from some non-EU or EEA countries.
Temporary border controls introduced on 17 March, limit entry from other destinations to Estonian nationals, those with an Estonian Residence Permit or foreign citizens with family members in Estonia. There are some exceptions to this, including diplomats, healthcare workers and those transporting goods and raw materials, provided they are asymptomatic.
Quarantine requirements
Those arriving from countries where the COVID-19 infection rate is 16 cases or fewer per 100,000 people for the previous 14 days do not need to self-quarantine on entry.
If you’re arriving to Estonia from the UK, you’ll need to self-isolate for 14 days. From 1 September, you have the option of taking a test to reduce your self-isolation period. This option will not be available for children. Full details can be found on the Estonian Health Board website. You should not use the NHS testing service to get a test in order to facilitate your travel to another country. You should arrange to take a private test.
Information on restriction of movement requirements together with a list of countries from which arrivals are not required to self-quarantine is available on the Estonian Ministry of Foreign Affairs’ website and is updated every Friday. You should follow the local quarantine measures of the country that you are in.
See detailed information about border crossings on the Estonian government official crisis portal.

Regular entry requirements
Visas
If you hold a British Citizen passport, you don’t need a visa to enter Estonia. If you’re planning a stay of longer than 3 months, see our Living in Estonia guide and contact the Estonian Embassy if you have further questions.
The rules on travel will stay the same until 31 December 2020.
Visas from 1 January 2021
The rules for travelling or working in Europe will change from 1 January 2021:
You will be able to travel to countries in the Schengen area for up to 90 days in any 180-day period without a visa for purposes such as tourism. This is a rolling 180-day period.
Therefore, if you’re travelling to Estonia, previous visits to the Schengen area within the 180 days before your date of travel would count against the 90-day limit.
If you are travelling visa-free to Estonia and to other countries in the Schengen area, make sure your whole visit is within the limit.
To stay for longer, to work or study, or for business travel you will need to meet the entry requirements set out by Estonia. This could mean applying for a visa or work permit. You should check with the Estonian Embassy what type of visa, if any, you will need.
Periods of stay authorised under a visa or permit will not count against the 90-day limit.
The European Commission has not yet set out how the limit of 90 days in any 180-day period for visa-free travel will be implemented for those who are already travelling in the EU or Schengen Area on 31 December 2020.
If you are travelling to Estonia before 31 December 2020 and will stay until 1 January 2021 or later, you should check with the Estonian Embassy for information on how the 90-day visa-free limit will apply to you. This also applies if your stay includes travel to other Schengen area countries.
At border control for Estonia, you may need to:
show a return or onward ticket
show you have enough money for your stay
use separate lanes from EU, EEA and Swiss citizens when queueing Your passport may be stamped on entry and exit.
Passport validity
The rules on travel will stay the same until 31 December 2020.
Your passport should be valid for the proposed duration of your stay; you do not need any additional period of validity on your passport beyond this.
Passport validity from 1 January 2021
From 1 January 2021, you must have at least 6 months left on an adult or child passport to travel to most countries in Europe (not including Ireland).
If you renewed your current passport before the previous one expired, extra months may have been added to its expiry date. Any extra months on your passport over 10 years may not count towards the 6 months needed.
Check your passport is valid for travel before you book your trip. You will need to renew your passport before travelling if you do not have enough time left on your passport.
UK Emergency Travel Documents
UK Emergency Travel Documents (ETDs) are accepted for entry, airside transit and exit from Estonia.
