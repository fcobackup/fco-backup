Nationwide power outage
Cuba experienced a nationwide power outage on the evening of 14 March. Power was restored across the country on 16 March. Planned electricity outages continue across Cuba, including in Havana. In other areas of the country, power outages can be much longer. 
You should take precautions such as conserving fuel and mobile phone charge, particularly if travelling outside Havana. The mobile phone network may be limited. Transport may be affected due to inability to refuel during power outages. Ensure you have enough fuel before setting off on your journey.
