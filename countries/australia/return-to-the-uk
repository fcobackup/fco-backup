There remain commercial flight options to return to the UK from Australia.
If you live in the UK and are currently visiting Australia, you are strongly advised to return now by commercial means. Don’t run the risk of getting stranded.
UK special charter flights will only operate for priority countries where commercial flights are not available. You should not assume that these flights will become available in countries where commercial routes are operating.
If you’re looking to return to the UK, you should also register your details with the British High Commission. This will help us in our work with airlines to keep commercial routes open and to alert you to airline advice on flight options. You may add additional details including on your location any relevant information about your health or other vulnerabilities.
Flights
Flight options from Australia to the UK have become restricted following the tightening of entry restrictions for Australia and for countries through which flights transit.
The following airlines are advising that they are currently flying to the UK:
Qatar Airways (via Doha) - one flight per day from Sydney and Melbourne and four flights a week from Perth until further notice. Qatar Airways intend to restart five flights a week from Adelaide from 2 June. They are currently taking bookings for this route online. You should contact Qatar Airways for the latest information on all routes and to secure seats.
British Airways, Emirates and Etihad are amongst the airlines which have currently temporarily suspended flights to and from Australia. We currently do not know when their flights will restart.
Contact airlines and tour operators directly on availability and current status of flights, or to discuss alternative arrangements if you have bookings for suspended flights.
You will need to pay for your return travel to the UK. If departure options are available but you cannot afford the travel costs and have exhausted all other options for getting funds, you may be eligible to apply for an emergency loan from the government. This is a last resort option and you would need to repay the loan when you are back in the UK. For more information, you should contact Corporate Travel Management (CTM). CTM are a commercial partner of the FCO and are authorised to administer such loans on behalf of the FCO.
Travelling to your international airport
If you are already in Australia, you may travel by air to another Australian State to transit to an international flight as long as you hold a confirmed booking for that flight. You do not need to seek an exemption. You will be required to stay within the airport for the duration of your transit, or if transiting overnight, you will need to self-isolate in a hotel. In Western Australia, your transit time must be no more than 24 hours.
Qantas, Virgin Australia and Jetstar are running a limited schedule of domestic flights within Australia. Tigerair has currently suspended their domestic flights.
There are currently no restrictions if you are travelling by road to an airport within the same State but you may need to provide proof of your onward international travel. Some States require you to apply for an exemption to cross their borders. Given the fast changing situation, you should check State and Territory websites for the latest information. Links can be found on the Australian Government Coronavirus website.
