The Basque terrorist organisation ETA hasn’t mounted any attacks since 2009. In October 2011 ETA announced a “definitive cessation of armed activity”. In April 2017 they declared a “unilateral disarmament” and claimed to have handed in all of their weapons. ETA’s last major attack was in 2006. British nationals have not been a target of ETA terrorism.
Spanish police have disrupted a number of groups suspected of recruiting individuals to travel to Syria and Iraq from 2015 to the present date. Some of them expressed an intention to carry out attacks in Europe.
There’s a heightened threat of terrorist attack globally against UK interests and British nationals from groups or individuals motivated by the conflict in Iraq and Syria. You should be vigilant at this time.
