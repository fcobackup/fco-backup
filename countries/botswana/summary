Given the rapidly changing situation in the region we are temporarily withdrawing dependents from our High Commission in Botswana. The High Commission will continue to carry out essential work including providing 24/7 consular assistance and support to British people in Botswana.

Wildlife and livestock on roads are a hazard, particularly at night. See Road travel.
