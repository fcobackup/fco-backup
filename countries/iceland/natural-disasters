Iceland is volcanically and seismically active.
A small volcanic fissure eruption has begun (3 August 2022) in Meradir on the Reykjanes peninsula. There is no direct threat to populated areas. You are advised to avoid the area while the Civil Protection Agency assess the situation and not to try to visit the site. You should follow the safety advice issued by the Civil Protection Agency and monitor the Almannavenir Facebook page and Twitter: @almannavarnir for the latest updates.
A fissure eruption also occurred in March 2021 at Geldingadalur on the Reykjanes Peninsula. Larger volcanic eruptions took place in the area around the Bárðarbunga volcano on the Vatnajökull glacier in the east of Iceland in August 2014, and Eyjafjallajokull volcano in the south of Iceland in 2010 and Grimsvötn volcanoes erupted in 2010 and 2011 respectively causing disruption to Icelandic and European airspace.
Further volcanic eruptions are possible and there is the potential for sulphur dioxide and other volcanic gases to be emitted during eruptions as well as causing glacial floods. You should monitor alerts from the Icelandic Met Office.
If you have existing respiratory conditions, take particular care, monitor emissions and follow the advice of the Icelandic authorities.
If you plan to visit the Geldingadalur eruption site please note its remote location and the area is still seismically active. You can only reach the site via a hiking trail over rugged terrain that can take several hours. Good hiking shoes, warm clothing and wind and waterproof outerwear is essential. Beware of gas emissions levels.
Show caution in and around mountains/hills/slopes due to danger of rock fall and landslides.
There has been seismic activity in the South West and North of Iceland. Tremors can be numerous but usually don’t cause damage. However, they can cause rock falls and avalanches in the mountain areas. You should take care when driving and hiking in these areas. Follow the safety advice of the Icelandic authorities.
