Protests
Protests are taking place in Kathmandu and elsewhere across the country. There have been violent clashes, with lethal force used by the police. This has led to a number of deaths and injuries. Curfews have been introduced in several cities, including Kathmandu and Pokhara. Avoid protests, check local media for updates, and follow direction of the authorities. See ‘civil disorder’ on the ‘Safety and security’ page.
Kathmandu airport has also been disrupted, impacting domestic and international flights. Contact your airline, hotel and tour operator for up-to-date information before travel. Tourists should be able to move around and travel to and from airports with proof of travel plans.
While the social media ban has been lifted, expect continued disruption to services.
