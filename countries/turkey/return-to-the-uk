There remain extremely limited commercial options to return to the UK from Turkey and these may stop at short notice.
There is a route from Istanbul to the UK via Minsk with Belavia airlines – see below for further details. You may require a permit to travel to the airport – see Travel Permit section below.
If you live in the UK and are currently visiting Turkey, you’re strongly advised to return now by commercial means. Don’t run the risk of getting stranded.
UK special charter flights will only operate for priority countries where commercial flights are not possible. You should not assume that these flights will become available in countries where commercial routes are operating. Please do not contact the contracted travel management company if no flight is advertised here.
What to do
If you cannot leave Turkey at this time, you should:
follow the advice of local authorities, including local measures to help minimise your risk of exposure to coronavirus
find accommodation that’s suitable for your needs
keep in regular contact with family and friends at home, so they know you are safe and well
if you are visiting Turkey and normally resident in the UK, please register with the Embassy through our new registration process (see below)
One commercial flight route to the UK (via Minsk) is still operating, but this is subject to change and cancellation at short notice. There is no guarantee of how long the Minsk flights will continue to operate.
The British Embassy is issuing regular updates on Twitter and Facebook with the latest available information on flight departure options from Turkey.
As there are limited commercial means of returning to the UK from Turkey, you should contact your travel provider as soon as you can for more information. Note that plans might change at short notice.
Belavia - via Minsk
Flights are bookable directly with Belavia on their website. However, all flights are subject to change at short notice. You should contact the airline to confirm flight details.
Belavia flights from Istanbul to London Gatwick (via Minsk) are currently scheduled for 15 April, and then on Sundays from 19 April. Any passengers who had a ticket for the cancelled Belavia Istanbul to Minsk flight on the 12 April, and who would like to transfer their ticket to the Wednesday flight, should contact +90 532 266 1210 either on WhatsApp or by telephone.
From Thursday 16 April, flights operate once daily from Istanbul to Minsk. See the Belavia website or contact them directly for the latest availability. If no connecting (single-ticket) flights are showing, you will need to book separate tickets from Istanbul to Minsk, and Minsk to London, and travel with cabin baggage only.
If waiting overnight in Minsk airport you are not officially permitted to clear immigration or collect hold luggage without being subject to mandatory quarantine. We therefore do not recommend leaving the airport.
Travel Permit
Turkey has imposed restrictions on all internal travel between cities within Turkey. All travellers will need a travel permit if they are travelling from one city to another. In addition, you will also need a travel permit if you are aged over 65 or under 20 and need to travel within the same city. To request a travel permit, please submit your request here. You should make clear in the subject box that you are enquiring about a permit to travel, and have proof of your onward journey out of Turkey
Future travel options
The UK government is working closely with airlines, the Turkish authorities and other governments to make sure options are available for you to return to the UK as soon as possible.
This travel advice will be updated when departure options become available. Sign up for travel advice email alerts and follow the British Embassy on Twitter and Facebook.
