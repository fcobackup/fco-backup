The Luxembourg Government announced on 19 March that Luxembourg Airport (Findel) would close to passenger flights from Monday 23 March. Flights to the UK continue till then, however some airlines are cancelling flights.
We advise British travellers who are currently in Luxembourg and who wish to return to the UK to make travel plans to do so as soon as possible. Travellers wishing to return should contact their travel operator, checking the website of their airlines, train company or ferry companies for further advice.
