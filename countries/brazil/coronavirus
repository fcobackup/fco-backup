Travel in Brazil
Restrictions vary from city to city. The use of face masks in streets, public spaces such as parks, and on public transport including taxis is mandatory across the country. There are additional local requirements for the compulsory use of masks in other places, such as shops and gyms, in various cities including São Paulo, Rio de Janeiro, Belo Horizonte and Brasília. Social isolation measures have been lifted to an extent in some parts of the country, but localised lockdowns continue to varying degrees. You should refer to official guidance in your location for details of what preventative measures are in place and how you can comply with them. Failing to comply with these rules may result in a fine.
Accommodation
Some accommodation options are open such as hotels, hostels and private rentals but this varies area by area. Some popular beach areas remain closed to non-residents. Check with your accommodation provider what facilities, including restaurants, are available.
Public spaces and services
The situation varies around Brazil, each state will determine local measures to limit the spread of COVID-19, and this includes regulation on the opening of non-essential services (shops, restaurants, bars, beaches and other leisure activities). You should refer to official guidance in your location for details of what preventative measures are in place and how you can comply with them. It’s highly possible that public places likely to attract large crowds may be closed at short notice.
Healthcare in Brazil
If you think you have COVID-19 symptoms, you should self isolate for 14 days. You should only go to hospital if you are feeling breathless.
The public healthcare system varies across the country, and in some states in Brazil the additional burden of treating Covid-19 patients might affect services such as accident & emergency care. Some private hospitals are no longer accepting credit card payments for admissions and only accepting patients with valid health insurance.
Check if your travel or health insurance has comprehensive cover for coronavirus and refer to official channels in your location for further details.

Wherever possible British nationals should aim to be vaccinated in the country where they live. As further information is available about the national vaccination programme, this page will be updated. Sign up to get email notifications.
The Brazilian authorities have issued the national vaccination programme (only available in Portuguese). Resident British Nationals with a CPF (fiscal number) are eligible within the vaccination programme on the same basis as Brazilian nationals. Information about priority group categories and the vaccines available in Brazil are included in the guidance. Vaccination registration varies from state to state, you should refer to official guidance from local authorities for further information.
The Medicines and Healthcare Products Regulatory Agency (MHRA) is the UK authority responsible for assessing the safety, quality and efficacy of vaccines. It has authorised the Pfizer/BioNTech, Oxford/AstraZeneca and Moderna vaccines for temporary supply and use in the UK. Find out more about MHRA approval for these vaccines.
British nationals living overseas should seek medical advice from their local healthcare provider in the country where they reside. Information about vaccines used in other national programmes, including regulatory status, should be available from the local authorities. This list of Stringent Regulatory Authorities recognised by the World Health Organisation may also be a useful source of additional information.
