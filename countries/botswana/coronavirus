The Government of Botswana declared a public health emergency on 21 March and have introduced a number of precautionary measures in response to the coronavirus (COVID-19) pandemic.
International travel
From 16 March, individuals coming from countries affected by coronavirus, including the UK, will not be permitted to enter Botswana. Returning residents are exempt from these restrictions, but will be subject to a 14-day mandatory quarantine period. Visas will no longer be issued to nationals from countries affected by coronavirus. Current visas for those travelling from affected countries will be cancelled with immediate effect, except for those already in Botswana.
If you need further information about entry requirements, contact the local immigration authorities or nearest Botswana Embassy or High Commission. You should also check with your airline or travel company for the latest information.
Many visitors from the UK travel to and from Botswana via South Africa. South Africa has put in place travel restrictions on individuals from countries affected by coronavirus, including the United Kingdom. Follow our travel advice for South Africa for information on South African entry requirements, and consult your nearest South African High Commission.
SA Express suspended flights between all destinations in Botswana and Johannesburg on 18 March 2020 until further notice. Check with the airline or your tour operator before travelling.
The Botswana authorities have also closed a number of land border posts with neighbouring countries, including the Kazangula Ferry border post with Zambia.
The Botswana authorities have also suspended public gatherings of more than 100 people for 30 days from 16 March and have advised members of the public to postpone non-essential travel in-country.
Keep up to date with information from your tour operator, transport or accommodation provider on the impact on any existing travel plans.
