Cases of coronavirus (COVID-19) have been confirmed in Uzbekistan. Up-to-date statistics on COVID-19 cases in Uzbekistan are available from a dedicated Uzbekistan Government website - coronavirus.uz (in Uzbek and Russian only).The Uzbekistan authorities have introduced a number of measures to limit the spread of the virus.
Uzbekistan has closed land and air borders to non-Uzbek nationals. It may be possible for foreign nationals to depart Uzbekistan via its land borders, but this is unlikely and dependent upon restrictions in place in the country of destination (please also see FCO Travel Advice for Afghanistan, Kazakhstan, Kyrgyzstan, Tajikistan and Turkmenistan). All commercial flights in and out of the country have been suspended.

From 23 March, it is compulsory to wear a facemask while outside. From 0600hrs on 25 March, a fine (of approximately £20) will be issued for a first violation of this regulation, with additional fines for repeat offences.

Prohibition of entry/exit from Tashkent by any mode of transport, with the exception of goods transportation and foreign nationals wishing to depart Uzbekistan;
Closure of restaurants, cafes, bars, fitness centres, entertainment venues, shopping malls and non-essential shops (supermarkets excluded);
Ban on holding of public events and some private events, including weddings and other family celebrations;
