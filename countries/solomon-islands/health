your destination can provide the healthcare you may need
you have appropriate travel insurance for local treatment or unexpected medical evacuation
This is particularly important if you have a health condition or are pregnant.

Contact your insurance company quickly if you’re referred to a medical facility for treatment.

Healthcare in the Solomon Islands
Healthcare facilities in the Solomon Islands are very basic. There are limited hospital facilities and medical supplies are not always available. The National Referral Hospital in Honiara frequently runs out of blood supplies and often has limited stock of oral re-hydration salts, paracetamol and basic antibiotics. Wards and units can shut at short notice. Gizo hospital is newly built and has good facilities but can also run short of supplies.
Take a basic medical kit with you when visiting rural and remote areas. Make sure you have accessible funds to cover the cost of any medical treatment and repatriation. If you need to get medical treatment in Australia, you’ll need a medical visa to enter the country.
