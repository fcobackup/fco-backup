Entry rules in response to coronavirus
The Dominican Republic has resumed inbound passenger flights from the UK. Passengers from the UK are allowed to arrive in the DR, but it is mandatory to present a negative PCR test certification taken within the previous 72 hours before travel. Travellers from the UK who arrive without a PCR certificate will be subject to a COVID-19 test upon arrival and required to isolate in a government quarantine facility for seven days at their own cost. If you were planning to travel to or transit through the Dominican Republic, please check with your travel provider. Further updates will be published when they are available.
These measures will also apply to travellers who have previously been in the UK within two weeks of arrival in the Dominican Republic.
You should comply with additional screening and other social distancing measures put in place by the authorities and follow instructions from the airport authorities. These regulations may be subject to change at short notice and you should check with your travel provider before your journey.
For further information please check the Dominican Republic Travel Center website.
Testing on arrival
All passengers will have their temperature tested. The Dominican authorities will also administer a rapid diagnostic breath test to a percentage of randomly-selected passengers on arrival. Passengers arriving without a negative PCR test certificate shall be subject to COVID-19 test and shall be subject to mandatory quarantine of 7 days in a government facility at their own cost. Passengers showing COVID-19 symptoms will also be tested. Passengers who test positive will be isolated and attended at authorized locations pending a negative PCR test.

Regular entry requirements
Visas
British Citizens travelling to the Dominican Republic for tourism don’t need a visa.
As of April 2018, the tourism entry tax (previously known as a tourist card) is no longer collected upon arrival and should be included in your air fare. Contact your airline or tour operator if you’re unsure whether you have already paid this fee. The Dominican Republic Embassy website has more information.
On arrival you will normally be granted a 30-day stay. This can be extended to 120 days by paying for an extension when you leave the country. This can be done online at the Dominican Directorate General for Migration website or at the airport on departure. If you’re planning to stay for longer, seek advice from a local lawyer or contact the local Immigration authorities.
As a foreign national you will be required to give your fingerprints and have a photograph taken in order to enter the Dominican Republic.
You must carry a photocopy of your identification (such as a passport), a copy of your entry stamp and proof of onward or return travel at all times, so that you can produce them if you’re asked to do so by the authorities.

The affidavit will need to be legalised by the  Foreign, Commonwealth & Development Office (FCDO) and the Dominican Republic Embassy
