Travel in Gibraltar
A social lockdown came into effect in Gibraltar on Tuesday 24 March 2020 to slow the spread of COVID-19. However the lockdown restrictions are now in the process of being relaxed by the Government of Gibraltar, via a 6-phased process named ‘Unlock the Rock’ which started on 2 May 2020. Full details of the plans to lift lockdown restrictions can be found in this Government of Gibraltar press release.
Public places and services
On 22 May, the regulations affecting the freedom of movement of all citizens came to an end, and people are now permitted to leave their home without restriction – although the advice of the Government of Gibraltar remains for people to stay at home, and if they do go out, to maintain social distancing. From 1 June, restaurants and cafes can open with reduced capacity. From 22 June, bars can open, with some restrictions.
Some restrictions on freedom of association (gatherings) imposed by the Government of Gibraltar as part of the social lockdown remain in place. Visiting friends and relatives in their homes or public places is permitted, up to a maximum of twenty people in one gathering, with certain specified exceptions.
The Government of Gibraltar has issued guidance on social distancing and face coverings for people using Gibraltar International Airport. More information can be found on the Guidance for Travellers page of the Gibraltar International Airport website.
If anyone in Gibraltar has any of the symptoms of COVID-19, they must self-isolate and should not visit any friends or relatives, nor should they permit anyone to visit them until they have been tested and are negative for the virus.
