Entry and borders
On 23 March the Government of Ethiopia announced the closure of the country’s land borders. You should check for updates with local authorities before travelling to the border.
Addis Ababa Bole International Airport (and other international ports of arrival) have put in place additional measures to screen passengers arriving, departing or transiting through Ethiopia. Screening may include temperature measurements and checks on recent travel to affected areas.
Those people displaying symptoms linked to coronavirus may be transferred to a nearby isolation facility for up to 24 hours while further tests are carried out. The Ethiopian Public Health Institute advises that anyone who tests positive for the virus but displays only mild symptoms will be required to remain at the isolation facility for a further 14 days, in line with WHO guidance. Anyone with a pre-existing condition that requires regular medicines should bring sufficient amounts to cover a potential unplanned additional 2 week stay. More serious cases will be transferred to hospital.
Quarantine
All passengers arriving into the country will be subject to mandatory 14 day quarantine in hotels designated by the local authorities. You may choose from a range of hotels at different prices, but cannot change hotel once your quarantine has started. Passengers are responsible for the full cost of their stay in quarantine. You may need to demonstrate that you can afford the cost before boarding your flight. Contact your airline for more details. Those in quarantine will be monitored by the Ethiopian health authorities and may be tested for coronavirus . You may be moved to an isolation facility if you develop symptoms.
Local measures
On 8 April the Government of Ethiopia declared a State of Emergency to help limit the spread of coronavirus. The State of Emergency will last for five months and gives the Federal Government and security forces increased power to impose limitations. Measures include:
All meetings of four or more people for religious, government, social or political purposes are prohibited.
For gatherings of three or fewer people, individuals will be expected to ensure that they are 2 adult strides apart at all times. Exceptions for funerals and other essential functions to take place will be considered on a case-by-case basis.
Schools, bars, cinemas, theatres and nightclubs have been closed. Cafes and Restaurants must have no more than three people at a table with tables at least two adult strides apart.
Wearing of face masks is mandatory when visiting ‘service providing’ places such as shops and everyone must stand at least two strides apart.
Greetings by handshake are banned.
All movements across land borders, except for the flow of cargo and essential goods, are suspended.
Public transport will reduce passenger loads on vehicles to ensure social distancing is possible.
Landlords are banned from evicting or increasing rents on private tenants residing in their properties for the duration of the State of Emergency.
All commercial and private employers bound by the Labour proclamation will be prohibited from reducing their workforces or prematurely terminating employment contracts.
Students and teachers are banned from meeting and are only permitted to connect online or by other means that do not contravene social distancing measures.
Although lawyers will still be able to confer with their clients in correctional facilities with the necessary precautions in place, all other prison visits are prohibited.
Sporting activities at all levels are prohibited.
Children’s playgrounds and other such venues will be closed.
Any person failing to comply with the measures could face up to three years imprisonment or a fine of between 1,000 and 200,000 Ethiopian Birr (£25 – £5,000). The security forces can enforce these measures where necessary. You should comply with all such limitations and monitor local media for further updates.
Oromia, Amhara, SNNP, Harari and Tigray regional states have banned or restricted public transport to help limit the spread of coronavirus. Tigray has instituted additional quarantine measures for those travelling from overseas and other parts of Ethiopia and curtailed movement between cities and rural areas in the region. You should follow the advice of the local authorities.
What to do if you have symptoms
Residents and people already in Ethiopia who start to feel symptoms should self-isolate and call the Ethiopian coronavirus helplines on either 8335 or 952. You will be asked some questions and may be taken to an isolation facility at short notice. This will be a clinic or hospital where you will be tested for coronavirus and if needed, you will receive initial treatment.
You cannot change to a different isolation facility. You will need to stay in isolation at the government’s expense until the result of your test is known. This may take several days depending on the volume of tests being processed. If you test positive, you will need to stay until you have recovered and tested negative with follow up tests. Those experiencing more serious symptoms will be provided healthcare at a designated hospital.
Private Healthcare Facilities
Private healthcare facilities used by the international community with the capability to respond to coronavirus cases exist, but capacity is limited. These facilities are also those most frequently recommended by British travel insurance companies for other illnesses or injuries. You should therefore be aware that the ability to access treatment for other ailments is likely to be limited. You should check with your insurance company which facilities they recommend and phone the healthcare facility before you visit.
Crime
There have been reports of abusive behaviour towards foreigners in relation to coronavirus, including a small number of cases of assault. See Crime for advice on crime in Ethiopia.
