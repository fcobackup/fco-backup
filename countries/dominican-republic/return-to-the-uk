The Dominican Republic government has closed the country’s borders and all international flights have been suspended except “ferry flights” to repatriate foreign nationals.
The last direct ferry flight from the Dominican Republic to the UK departed on Thursday 19 March. Some airlines continue to fly limited routes back to the UK via third countries. Travellers should regularly check availability with their travel agent and directly with airlines.
Where possible, the British Embassy in the Dominican Republic will share relevant information about departure options on Facebook and Twitter.
You should contact your airline, tour operator and travel insurer to find out what support they can offer.
The FCO provides information on what to do and who to contact if you require financial assistance abroad.
