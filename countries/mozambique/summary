Mozambique was affected by two major tropical cyclones during the 2018-19 rainy season, which had a major impact on the people and infrastructure of Sofala, Manica, Nampula, Tete, Zambezia and Cabo Delgado provinces. Critical infrastructure has been restored and main roads are open. However, not all bridges have been repaired and travel in the rainy season may therefore be restricted. If you’re travelling to affected areas, you should plan ahead, check routes before travelling and follow the advice of the local authorities.
Coastal areas have a risk of tropical cyclones during the rainy season (November to April). Widespread flooding can also occur around river basins, especially the Zambezi. See Natural disasters
