Same-sex sexual activity is legal in Gabon and there is parity in the age of consent (18 years). However, same-sex couples and households headed by same-sex couples are not eligible for the same legal protections available to opposite-sex couples. There’s no legal protection against discrimination based on sexual orientation. Gabon remains a conservative society and discrimination can be a problem for those open about their sexual identity. Same-sex marriage isn’t recognised in Gabon - in January 2014, 6 men were briefly arrested for involvement in a same-sex marriage.
