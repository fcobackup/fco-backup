Moving around in Trinidad and Tobago
For information on entering Trinidad and Tobago, see Entry Requirements.
The Government has announced a phased approach to the easing of COVID-19 restrictions. On 22 June the country moved into phase five, lifting the majority of the remaining restrictions in place. Beaches, rivers, parks and gymnasiums have reopened. Restrictions on air travel between Trinidad and Tobago are lifted. Hotels have also resumed business. Food establishments and restaurants are now permitted to provide in-house dining services until 10pm and bars, casinos and cinemas have reopened. Places of worship have also now resumed normal services.
Sporting activities have resumed and members of the public are permitted to congregate in larger groups of up to 25 people.
You must wear a mask, to cover your nose and mouth, in public spaces. You should adhere to all precautionary measures put in place by the local authorities. Schools and universities remain closed.
Travel restrictions
If you are on a yacht, do not sail or transit out of the marinas or Chaguaramas Bay. You will be intercepted by the Coast Guard and handed over to the Trinidad and Tobago Police Service. The charges are TT$50,000 fine or 6 months in jail.
Entry stamps
If you are a British national and the entry stamp in your passport is due to expire due to the border closure you should request an extension by contacting the Trinidad and Tobago Immigration authorities by sending an email to extensions.international@gov.tt with a scanned copy of the biodata page of your passport, a copy of your last entry stamp, your address in T&T and a contact number.
If you are a British national with a work permit that is due to expire, you should request an entry stamp extension as detailed above whilst your work permit application is under consideration.

The Trinidad and Tobago government has set up a COVID-19 hotline staffed by doctors. If you suspect you have any symptoms please contact the hotline on +1 868 877-WELL (9355) from Trinidad or +1 868 800-HEAL (4325) toll-free from Tobago.

Finance
There is a range of financial support from the government that you can access while you are unable to return due to coronavirus restrictions.
If you’re in Trinidad and Tobago and have exhausted all other options to cover essential living costs while you wait to return home, you could apply for an emergency loan for your living costs from the UK government. You can only apply if you normally live in the UK and you cannot return home. This last-resort option is for those most in need, and you would need to repay the loan when you are back in the UK. Apply for an emergency loan.
