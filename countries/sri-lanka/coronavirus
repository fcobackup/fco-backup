Check the latest information on risk from COVID-19 for Sri Lanka on the TravelHealthPro website
See the TravelHealthPro website for further advice on travel abroad and reducing spread of respiratory viruses during the COVID-19 pandemic.
International travel
Commercial airlines are operating flights to and from Sri Lanka. Some airlines require evidence of a negative COVID-19 test taken up to 72 hours before the start of travel. You should check with your airline before travelling.
Due to a prevalence of COVID-19 cases in the community, there is a high risk of changes to flights and airport operations at short notice. If you wish to travel, you should consult your travel operator.
Further guidance from the Sri Lankan authorities for foreign tourists visiting Sri Lanka is available from Sri Lanka Tourism.
Entry and borders
See Entry requirements to find out what you will need to do when you arrive in Sri Lanka.
Returning to the UK
When you return, you must follow the rules for entering the UK.
You are responsible for organising your own COVID-19 test, in line with UK government testing requirements. You should contact local authorities for information on testing facilities.
Be prepared for your plans to change
No travel is risk-free during COVID. Countries may further restrict travel or bring in new rules at short notice, for example due to a new COVID-19 variant. Check with your travel company or airline for any transport changes which may delay your journey home.
If you test positive for COVID-19, you may need to stay where you are until you test negative. You may also need to seek treatment there.
Plan ahead and make sure you:
can access money
understand what your insurance will cover
can make arrangements to extend your stay and be away for longer than planned
Travel in Sri Lanka
Further to the island-wide travel restriction, the Government of Sri Lanka have announced guidelines, and further guidelines on permitted activities. Further restrictions may be imposed at short notice. Those not adhering to restrictions and local guidelines risk arrest. You should follow the advice of local authorities.
A 24-hour hotline number 1965 has been introduced for the public to make enquiries about essential services in operation while travel restrictions are in place.
The Ministry of Health has categorised Sri Lanka under Covid-19 Risk Alert Level 3.
Public gatherings such as exhibitions, conferences, parties, events, carnivals, outdoor musical shows and processions have been banned.
Regulations are in place to enforce social distancing and the wearing of a face mask in public areas.
Further restrictions and guidelines are being imposed at short notice. Public guidelines and circulars are sometimes published on government websites, such as the Ministry of Health, Epidemiology Unit or Health Promotion Bureau websites. However this is not always up to date. You should follow the media for updates, or speak to your hotel or travel agent for the latest information, and follow the instructions of the local authorities at all times.

The Sri Lankan national vaccination programme started in February 2021 and is using the Pfizer, AstraZeneca, Covishield, Sinopharm and Sputnik V vaccines.

Some hotels and guesthouses are open to foreign nationals.
