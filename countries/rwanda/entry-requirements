The information on this page covers the most common types of travel and reflects the UK government’s understanding of the rules currently in place. Unless otherwise stated, this information is for travellers using a full ‘British Citizen’ passport.
The authorities in the country or territory you’re travelling to are responsible for setting and enforcing the rules for entry. If you’re unclear about any aspect of the entry requirements, or you need further reassurance, you’ll need to contact the embassy, high commission or consulate of the country or territory you’re travelling to.
You should also consider checking with your transport provider or travel company to make sure your passport and other travel documents meet their requirements.
Entry rules in response to coronavirus
Entry to Rwanda
Kigali International Airport reopened on 1 August 2020. All arrivals must present a negative COVID-19 PCR test result taken within 72 hours of first departure. Negative test certificates must include the term ‘PCR’. All arriving passengers must self-quarantine for 7 days and take a PCR test at the end of this period.
You should not use the NHS testing service to get a test in order to facilitate your travel to another country. You should arrange to take a private test. The government of Rwanda have published guidance for passengers arriving into Rwanda. Land borders remain closed, except to returning Rwandan citizens and legal residents.
Screening on arrival
Screening procedures are in place for coronavirus at all entry points.
Quarantine requirements
After providing proof of a negative COVID-19 PCR test (as outlined above), all arriving passengers must self-quarantine for 7 days and take a PCR test at the end of this period. The test will cost 60USD.
Testing on departure
Departing passengers must present a negative PCR test before departure.
Exit screening is in place for all departing travellers. Any travellers exhibiting a symptom associated with coronavirus will be prevented from leaving the country and will be moved to isolation for testing. If an individual tests positive, they will be treated in a Government of Rwanda healthcare facility.
Regular entry requirements
Visas
You need a visa to enter Rwanda. Thirty-day tourist visas are free and available on arrival for citizens of member states of the Commonwealth (including the UK), as well as for those of the African Union and the Francophonie.
You can also choose to get a visa in advance at any Rwandan diplomatic mission or online. Further information about visa requirements is available from the Rwandan High Commission.
If you’re planning to apply for resident/business or missionary multiple entry visas on entry to Rwanda you will need to get UK police clearance before you travel. You can find details of how to do this on the ACRO Criminal Records Office website. This usually takes a minimum of 10 working days to process.
Passport validity
Your passport should be valid for at least 6 months from the date of entry into Rwanda. You’ll need one blank page on your passport for entry stamps.
If your UK passport has expired since 1 January 2020, or is due to expire before October 2020, the Government of Rwanda have agreed that such passports will be treated as valid for travel until December 2021. However, you still need to ensure you have a valid visa to remain in Rwanda. You should renew your visa if required at the Rwanda Directorate-General of Immigration and Emigration
UK Emergency Travel Documents
UK Emergency Travel Documents (ETDs) are accepted for entry, airside transit and exit from Rwanda. If you’re travelling into Rwanda on an ETD, you’ll be expected to provide Rwandan Immigration with a reason for the use of an ETD, eg proof of residency. If you’re seeking to use a two-way ETD, should clear this with Rwandan Immigration before you travel.
