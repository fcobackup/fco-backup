FCDO advises against all travel to parts of Nigeria.

You should also read FCDO’s overall travel advice and regional risks advice.
Terrorism
There is a high threat of terrorist attack globally affecting UK interests and British nationals, including from groups and individuals who view the UK and British nationals as targets. You should remain alert at all times.
UK Counter Terrorism Policing has information and advice on staying safe abroad and what to do in the event of a terrorist attack. Find out how to reduce your risk from terrorism while abroad.
Terrorism in Nigeria
Terrorists are very likely to try and carry out attacks in Nigeria.
The primary terrorist threat in Nigeria comes from Islamic State West Africa (ISWA) and Boko Haram. These groups are mainly based in north-east Nigeria in Borno, Yobe and Adamawa states. Since 2021, there have also been attacks likely associated with terrorist groups in Niger, Kaduna, Kogi, Bauchi, Ondo, Zamfara, Taraba, Jigawa, Sokoto, Edo and Kano states, as well as the Federal Capital Territory.
Attacks could be indiscriminate and could occur at any time, including in places frequented by foreign nationals, such as:
places of worship
markets
malls
hotels
bars and restaurants
sports venues and screenings
displacement camps
train networks and stations
government buildings
educational institution
international organisations
large public gatherings
Take particular care during election periods, or periods of religious significance or other public holidays.
Terrorist groups have also constructed bogus vehicle checkpoints on major supply and commercial routes, such as the A3 Maiduguri-Damaturu road.
A heavy security presence is often a sign of a particularly high risk. Avoid affected areas in the immediate aftermath of an attack. Stay aware of your surroundings, keep up to date with local media reports and follow the advice of local authorities.
Recent significant attacks have included:
in June 2023, Islamic State West Africa (ISWA) carried out an IED attack in Nasarawa State
in April 2023, ISWA claimed an IED attack on civilians in Jigawa State
in February 2023, ISWA bombed a local government office in Kogi State
in 2022, ISWA claimed responsibility for attacks on Nigerian security personnel in Ondo and Edo states
in 2022, ISWA attacked the Kuje Prison in the Federal Capital Territory and an unknown number of prisoners escaped
in 2022, ISWA claimed responsibility for attacks on policemen in Niger State, within 30 kilometres of the Federal Capital Territory
Terrorist kidnap
Terrorist groups are highly likely to carry out kidnaps in Nigeria. Kidnappings are widespread and could occur anywhere. Foreign nationals and humanitarian workers have been kidnapped in the North, including in the states of Adamawa, Bauchi, Borno, Katsina, Kano and Kebbi. There may be an increased risk of kidnap, particularly to NGO workers, in Borno State.  
British nationals are seen as legitimate targets, including tourists, humanitarian aid workers, journalists and business travellers. If you are kidnapped, the reason for your presence is unlikely to protect you or secure your safe release. 
The long-standing policy of the British government policy is not to make substantive concessions to hostage takers. The British government considers that paying ransoms and releasing prisoners builds the capability of terrorist groups and finances their activities. This can, in turn, increase the risk of further hostage-taking. The Terrorism Act (2000) makes payments to terrorists illegal. 
Political situation
Political rallies, protests and violent demonstrations can take place with little notice. Get advice on areas to avoid. Take care if you’re visiting crowded public places or attending events which attract large crowds. If you see a threatening or intimidating situation, do not try to make your way through it. Turn around and move to safety.
Incidents of intercommunal violence occur frequently and often without warning throughout Nigeria. Although foreign nationals are not normally targeted, there is a risk you could be caught in an attack. Monitor local government announcements and media reporting.
Curfews and communication blackouts
The authorities impose, amend and lift curfews and restrictions on the movement of vehicles at short notice throughout Nigeria.
If you fail to observe curfews and restrictions, you could be at significant risk. Check with the local authorities or someone with local knowledge for up-to-date information.
Network operators in Nigeria have in the past been ordered to suspend mobile networks and wi-fi with very little notice.
Crime
Street and road crime
Throughout Nigeria there are high levels of violent street crime including muggings and armed robbery.
There are frequent reports of carjackings, some involving armed gunmen, on Nigeria’s urban and rural road networks.
Criminals have targeted visiting British nationals as their perceived wealth makes them attractive victims. Follow guidance offered by hosts or employers and limit road travel at night as far as possible. Avoid carrying large amounts of cash and never wear valuable watches, jewellery or items of sentimental value. If you suspect danger, move to a safer area.
If you’re caught up in an armed robbery, immediately comply with the attackers’ demands.
Withdrawing and exchanging money
Areas around banks and ATMs have seen a spike in criminal activity, so take extra precautions when withdrawing cash, especially at night.
The Central Bank of Nigeria has issued new 200, 500 and 1000 naira notes. Check notes from currency exchange vendors are valid.
Credit card fraud is common, so keep your card within sight when paying bills.
Financial scams
British nationals are increasingly targeted by scammers operating in West Africa. Scams come in many forms including romance and friendship, business ventures and work or employment opportunities. Scams can put victims at great financial risk. Be cautious about requests for funds, job offers, business ventures and face-to-face meetings with anyone you have been in contact with online. Get more information on scams from Action Fraud, including ‘419’ emails and letters.
If you’re emailed about a money transfer to Nigeria for someone you know, contact the person supposedly receiving the money. If a caller claims to be in distress, ask if they have reported the incident to the British Deputy High Commission in Lagos.
If you receive a suspicious email that claims to be from any British High Commission office in Nigeria, contact the Consular Section of the British Deputy High Commission in Lagos.
IVF and fertility treatment scams
If you’re considering fertility treatment in Nigeria, be cautious. There have been a number of staged fake births (commonly called ‘miracle babies’) where visitors are falsely led to believe they have given birth. There is a risk in bringing a child who is not biologically related to you into the UK without following the legal procedures. The UK has restricted overseas adoption of children from Nigeria.
Kidnapping for ransom
Criminal groups may kidnap victims by stopping cars on major highways, including the:
Abuja-Kaduna highway
Enugu-Awka-Onitsha expressway in Anambra
There is a high threat of kidnapping and other armed attacks at oil and gas facilities in the Niger Delta region. This also applies to facilities at sea.
Possible targets for kidnap include British nationals of Nigerian origin visiting friends and relatives, and British nationals working for international corporations. They will have connections in the country with ready access to funds. There is a possibility that criminal groups could sell hostages on to terrorist organisations.
When arranging meetings, use a secure location. Avoid regular patterns of travel and aim to only travel during daylight hours.
Laws and cultural differences
Using a mobile
Your SIM must be linked to a Nigerian Identification Number. Get guidance from your network operator.
Ramadan
Nigeria has the largest Muslim population in sub-Saharan Africa. You should behave and dress modestly, particularly in the north and when visiting religious sites.
Ramadan is a holy month for Muslims. The dates vary by year. During this time, in any predominantly Muslim area you should not:
eat, drink, smoke or chew gum in public areas (including in cars and taxis) during the daytime
sit down to eat in hotels and restaurants without checking if there is a separate or screened area for food and drink
ignore dress codes – it is more important to wear respectful clothing during Ramadan
play loud music, swear, shout, sing or dance
Be aware that driving may be erratic, particularly at dusk when people are getting back home to eat.
Illegal drugs and prison sentences
Possession or use of illegal drugs is a serious offence and can result in lengthy prison sentences and heavy fines.
Using cameras in secure areas
Photography of government, military buildings and airports may lead to arrest.
LGBT+ travellers
Same-sex relationships are generally viewed as unacceptable in Nigeria. The ‘Same Sex Marriage Prohibition Bill’ allows lengthy prison sentences for those entering into a same-sex marriage, those witnessing, aiding or abetting a same-sex marriage, the operation and support of gay clubs, societies and organisations and the public display of same-sex relationships.
Read more advice for LGBT+ travellers.
Transport risks
Road travel
Road travel across Nigeria can be chaotic and slow moving. Take a mobile and a supply of bottled water with you when travelling by car.
You can drive in Nigeria with a UK driving licence for up to 3 months. If necessary renew or update it. The minimum legal age for driving is 18.
If you’re staying longer, you will need a 1968 international driving permit (IDP). For stays of more than a year, you will have to get a Nigerian driver’s licence.
Limit travel after dark outside city centres as far as possible. Avoid quiet and poorly lit roads. Be alert when in traffic jams or at traffic lights. Keep car windows up and doors locked, and make sure valuables are out of sight. If you feel your vehicle is being followed, drive to the nearest place of safety (such as a police station).
Take care when driving outside cities and consider travelling in convoy.
Dangers at road checkpoints
There are authorised and unauthorised vehicle checkpoints throughout Nigeria. Some are for security checks, others to extort small payments of money. Slow down at any type of checkpoint and stay calm. 
There has been an increasing trend of illegal vehicle checkpoints on major supply and commercial routes in northern Nigeria. This includes attacks on major roads into Maiduguri in Borno State, including the A3 Maiduguri-Damaturu road. These attacks have targeted civilians, security forces and aid workers.
Taxis and buses
Public transport throughout Nigeria is dangerous. Taxis and long-distance buses are often poorly maintained, uninsured and driven by unqualified drivers. Most major hotels offer cars for hire with drivers, so use these where possible.
If you are expecting a greeter or driver to collect you at any of Nigeria’s international airports, make sure they have properly identified themselves before you set off. Bogus greeters are a problem.
Sea travel
There have been armed robberies and incidents of piracy in Nigerian waters, the wider Gulf of Guinea, and on the rivers and harbours in the Niger Delta area. Mariners should get professional security advice and take appropriate precautions.
Swimming risks
Swimming off the coast of Nigeria is sometimes dangerous due to rip tides and undertows, with drownings occurring each year. Get local advice before swimming.
