Preparing for your return journey to the UK
If you’re returning to the UK from overseas, you will need to:
provide your journey and contact details before you travel
check if you need to self-isolate on your return
If your return journey to the UK transits another country, you should check whether it is subject to a travel ban or any other additional requirements. If so, contact your travel provider.

If you’re planning travel to Gabon, find out what you need to know about coronavirus there in the Coronavirus section.
During the COVID-19 pandemic, it is more important than ever to get travel insurance and check it provides sufficient cover. See the FCDO’s guidance on foreign travel insurance.
For information about COVID-19 vaccines, see the Coronavirus page.
The Gabonese Government has extended the state of health emergency indefinitely.
Political stability in Gabon remains uncertain ever since the result of the 2016 presidential election, with violent clashes occurring between demonstrators and security forces at that time. Protests are less common now but happen on occasion and may quickly turn violent without warning. You should avoid all demonstrations and rallies and remain vigilant during periods of unrest. See Political situation.
During periods of unrest, police checks may increase. Make sure you have all required documentation with you and avoid large gatherings.
Consular support may be limited in Gabon. However, the British High Commission in Yaoundé, Cameroon or Honorary Consul in Libreville can provide consular support to British nationals. See Consular assistance
Although there’s no recent history of terrorism in Gabon, attacks can’t be ruled out. See Terrorism
UK health authorities have classified Gabon as having a risk of Zika virus transmission. For information and advice about the risks associated with Zika virus, visit the National Travel Health Network and Centre website.
