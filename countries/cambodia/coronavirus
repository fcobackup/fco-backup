Travel in Cambodia
There are no travel restrictions within Cambodia and you can travel to the airport either from within Phnom Penh or from the provinces.
You’re expected to wear a face covering when inside the airport and many airlines will ask for face coverings to be worn. While no penalties are currently being imposed by the Cambodian authorities for refusing to wear a face covering, our advice is to wear a face covering when requested to.
Accommodation
Hotel and private rental accommodation is available throughout Cambodia. Some hotels have closed and remain so, and we advise that you contact hotels directly when booking. The majority of hotels will ask to take your temperature on arrival and ask you to complete a declaration in relation to your recent travel history and whether you have any symptoms related to COVID-19.
Some services and facilities in hotels may not be available e.g. leisure facilities.
Public places and services
Most public places and services are open to the public including restaurants, bars, public beaches and leisure facilities but subject to closure at short notice in line with COVID announcements by the government.
You should contact venues ahead of events.
