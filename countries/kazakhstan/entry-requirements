This advice reflects the UK government’s understanding of current rules for people travelling on a full ‘British citizen’ passport from the UK, for the most common types of travel.
The authorities in Kazakhstan set and enforce entry rules. If you’re not sure how these requirements apply to you, contact the Kazakh Embassy in the UK.
COVID-19 rules
There are no COVID-19 testing or vaccination requirements for travellers entering Kazakhstan.
Passport validity requirements
To enter Kazakhstan, your passport must be valid for at least 30 days from the date you arrive.
If you have a visa, your passport must have an ‘expiry date’ at least 3 months after your visa’s expiry date and at least one blank page
Check with your travel provider that your passport and other travel documents meet requirements. Renew your passport if you need to.  
You will be denied entry if you do not have a valid travel document or try to use a passport that has been reported lost or stolen. 
Kazakh-British dual nationality
Kazakhstan does not recognise dual nationality. If you are found to have a Kazakh passport and another passport, you will be fined and your Kazakh citizenship will be withdrawn.
Visa requirements
You can visit Kazakhstan without a visa for up to 30 days. You can make as many visa-free visits as you like, but you must not stay more than 90 days without a visa in any 180-day period.
To stay longer (to work or study, for business travel or for other reasons), you must meet the Kazakh Government’s entry requirements. Check which type of visa or work permit you need with the Kazakh Embassy in the UK. Also see visa information from Kazakhstan’s Ministry of Foreign Affairs.  
Check the validity dates of your visa and any restrictions before you travel.
Registering with the Kazakh authorities
Your hotel or the person hosting you must register your arrival with the Kazakh authorities. They must do this within 3 working days of your arrival in Kazakhstan. They can register you online. The visa-migration portal has more details.

Depending on your circumstances, this may include a yellow fever certificate.
