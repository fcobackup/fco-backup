Cases of coronavirus (COVID-19) have been confirmed in Thailand. The Thai authorities have introduced a number of measures to limit the spread of the virus.
Entry and borders
Thailand has introduced additional screening measures for passengers flying to Thailand from all countries. These additional screening measures will apply to passengers travelling to Thailand from all destinations, including those in transit. You should be aware that some scheduled flights are being cancelled and options may become more limited.
All passengers will need to present a medical certificate signed by a medical professional confirming no evidence of the coronavirus infection in the previous 72 hours, and also present evidence of medical insurance of no less than US$100,000 which covers COVID-19. Failure to meet these requirements will mean passengers are not permitted to board their flight even if they are transiting airside to another international destination.
Upon arrival in Thailand, passengers will be asked to present their health certificate and insurance details to disease control officials. Passengers will also need to present a completed T8 form with their name, nationality, passport number, active mobile phone number and e-mail address, or show that they have filled out this same information on the ‘AOT Airport of Thailand’ mobile application. Disease control officials may decide that some passengers be subject to a 14 day quarantine or self-isolation period within Thailand. You are advised to keep up to date with the latest information on boarding procedures on the website of the Civil Aviation Authority of Thailand, and the website of the Ministry of Public Health for information about quarantine and self-isolation procedures.
Thai authorities may introduce further measures. You can monitor the latest updates from Thailand’s Ministry of Public Health on its website, and refer to their Q&A for travellers.
