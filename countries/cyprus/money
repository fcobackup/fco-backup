If you’re found with fake euro banknotes the police will be called and you may be prosecuted. Several British nationals have been convicted and imprisoned for possession of fake euros. There are some simple checks you can make before accepting notes:
The front of a euro note bears the initials of the European Central Bank in five different languages. They should look like this: BCE ECB EZB EKT EKP, in that order.
They should have a raised print, a watermark, a security thread and a see-through number.

On the back of €5, €10 and €20 notes you should see a glossy strip and on the larger denominations, a number that changes colour.
The European Central bank’s website has more details.
