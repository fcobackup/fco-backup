Armenia is in an active seismic zone. The last serious earthquake was in 1988 in the Lori region in the north. It killed between 25,000 and 50,000 people, injured thousands and left several cities in ruins.
The US Federal Emergency Management Agency has advice about what to do before, during and after an earthquake.
