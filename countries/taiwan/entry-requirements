The authorities in Taiwan set and enforce entry rules.
All travellers
Travel ban on foreign nationals
Taiwanese authorities have announced a temporary ban on foreign nationals entering Taiwan. Exceptions apply for the following groups: ARC/APRC/Gold Card holders, business travellers, foreign spouses of Taiwan passport holders and their children under the age of 20, international students and foreign professors and researchers. Spouses and children under the age of 20 of foreign residents in Taiwan, excluding migrant workers and students, can now apply for a special entry permit to enter Taiwan.
All foreign nationals will be required to have obtained the correct entry permissions and a visa before they arrive in Taiwan. Currently there is no set date for when these border measures will be lifted. Exceptions may be made for emergency or humanitarian reasons. You should contact your local Taipei Representative Office for further information. Anyone entering Taiwan will be required to follow the quarantine requirements set out below.
All passengers travelling to Taiwan will be required to follow the quarantine and testing requirements set out below.
Screening on arrival
All passengers arriving or transiting in Taiwan are required to present a certificate of a negative COVID-19 RT-PCR test taken within two calendar days of boarding their flight to Taiwan. The test will be calculated based on the “specimen collection date” not the test report date. Any exemption due to exceptional circumstances will require prior approval before departure.
Test Certificates of a negative COVID-19 RT-PCR must be issued by a recognised medical institution in the country of departure and include the following information:
the passenger’s full name as per their passport,
the date of birth or passport number of the traveller,
specimen collection date and test report date,
the virus name, testing method and the test result
Test Certificates are required to be produced in either English or Chinese; however, in situations where the passenger provides a certificate in either French or Spanish, if the certificate is in the official language of the place of departure, and ground personnel of the airline are able to assist with the inspection of the content, the certificate may be accepted.
All passengers arriving in Taiwan on a long-haul flight will be required to undergo a COVID-19 RT-PCR test upon arrival. Passengers will be required to wait for the result of this test at the airport before they are permitted to depart for their quarantine facility. The local authorities will cover the cost of the COVID-19 RT-PCR test. Any individual who receives a positive COVID-19 test will not be permitted to quarantine at a quarantine hotel in Taiwan. Individuals with mild symptoms will be admitted into a centralised quarantine centre for the mandatory fourteen days (see above). Any individual with more severe symptoms may be hospitalised.
Anyone found to provide false or incorrect test results, or evade or obstruct the quarantine measures, may face a fine of between NT$10,000 to NT$150,000 and further criminal charges.
Refer to the Taiwan Centers for Disease Control for further information regarding Test Exemptions, Test Certificates and COVID-19 test requirements.
You should not use the NHS testing service to get a test in order to facilitate your travel to another country. You should arrange to take a private test.
Quarantine requirements for passengers arriving in Taiwan
From 7 March 2022, all passengers arriving in Taiwan from the UK will be required to complete a mandatory 10 day quarantine. Passengers will be able to choose whether they wish to complete their mandatory quarantine at their residential property, a quarantine hotel or a designated quarantine facility.
You will be required to undergo a COVID-19 PCR test upon arrival at the airport and a second test at the end of your mandatory 10 day quarantine. The local authorities will arrange for the second COVID-19 PCR test to be administered at a local hospital and will provide instructions and transport arrangements.
A further five self-administered rapid COVID-19 tests will be required during your mandatory 10 day quarantine and 7 day self-health management period. The first test will be required on your third day of quarantine, the second test on your fifth day of quarantine, the third test on your seventh day of quarantine, the fourth test on the second day of your self-health management period and the fifth test on the fourth day of your self-health management period. You should submit the result of each test to the Central Epidemic Command Center (CECC) using the instructions provided. You will need to pay the hospital transportation and registration fees. The local authorities will cover the costs of the two COVID-19 PCR tests and the five home-based rapid COVID-19 tests.
Passengers who are eligible and choose to complete their mandatory quarantine at their residential property rather than a quarantine hotel or a designated quarantine facility will be required to declare that their residence complies with quarantine requirements.
Any individual who receives a positive COVID-19 test will not be permitted to quarantine at their residential property or a quarantine hotel in Taiwan. Individuals with mild symptoms will be admitted into a centralised quarantine centre for mandatory quarantine. Any individual with more severe symptoms may be hospitalised.

Restrictions apply and not all British nationals will be eligible. You cannot apply more than 15 days before the 180 day point.
