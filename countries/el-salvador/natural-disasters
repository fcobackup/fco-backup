Volcanoes
El Salvador has several active volcanoes, at least six of which are monitored.
Since 17 November, the Chaparrastique Volcano, also known as San Miguel Volcano, has produced a series of small eruptions of gas and ash clouds. On 27 November, the Ministry of the Environment and Natural Resources (MARN) raised the alert in the municipalities of Chinameca, San Rafael Oriente, San Jorge and San Miguel to level 1 on the Volcanic Explosivity index (VEI), after volcanic activity intensified, including the ejection of rocks which fell on surrounding areas. Tourism and other activities within 6km of the crater have been suspended. For updated information, you should monitor local media and follow advice from the authorities.
Seek local advice before climbing any volcanoes in El Salvador and monitor local media for any updates on increased volcanic activity. You can find volcano warnings on the website of the Directorate General of Civil Protection (in Spanish). When climbing volcanoes or walking in remote areas, it is safer do so in daylight hours and with a tour guide.
Rainy season
The rainy season normally runs from June to November, coinciding with the hurricane season in the Caribbean. During the rainy season you can expect frequent heavy rain, thunder storms and possible tropical depressions. Roads can be affected by landslides and flooding. Mountain areas are particularly vulnerable to landslides.
Monitor local and international weather updates from the Ministry of the Environment and Natural Resources (MARN), the World Meteorological Organisation and the US National Hurricane Centre. See our Tropical Cyclones page for advice about what to do if you are caught up in a hurricane.
Earthquakes
El Salvador is subject to frequent minor earth tremors and occasional earthquakes. Local information can be found (in Spanish) on the MARN website or their Twitter feed @MedioAmbienteSV
Make sure you know what action to take should an earthquake occur. If you are staying in a hotel read their earthquake instructions. The US Federal Emergency Management Agency website has advice about what to do before, during and after an earthquake or tsunami.
Fire
Fires can increase during the dry season; particularly in San Salvador. You can contact the fire brigade by calling 911.
