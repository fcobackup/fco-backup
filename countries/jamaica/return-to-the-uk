Future travel options
There are currently extremely limited commercial options available to return to the UK from Jamaica.
You may be able to make indirect travel arrangements via the USA or Canada if possible but you may have to wait before a flight becomes available. You should refer to those countries’ restrictions before travelling to ensure that you will be allowed to enter the country for onward connection.
Currently no airlines are regularly scheduled to fly to the USA or Canada in May. JetBlue is operating flights at short notice from Kingston and Montego Bay to Fort Lauderdale, Florida from time to time. Miami International Airport is 30 minutes away by bus and flights to the United Kingdom are operating. British nationals require an ESTA or a valid US visa.
