This page has information on travelling to Vietnam. Check what you must do to return to the UK.
This page reflects the UK government’s understanding of current rules for people travelling on a full ‘British Citizen’ passport from the UK, for the most common types of travel.
The authorities in Vietnam set and enforce entry rules.
All travellers
From 15 March 2022 Vietnam has reintroduced visa waivers for the nationals of 13 countries including the UK. Visa waivers allow for visits to Vietnam for up to 15 days without needing to apply for a visa.
See Visas section for more information, including for those wishing to stay longer than 15 days.
Travellers to Vietnam, must follow the testing and quarantine requirements outlined below, wear a mask and follow handwashing and other COVID requirements. Airlines and transit points may stipulate additional requirements to these so you should consult with your travel company/airline as to what is required, before travelling.
Vietnam no longer differentiates between vaccinated and unvaccinated travellers for the purposes of entry. All travellers must follow the same entry requirements. However, some airlines and insurance companies may have additional requirements, so check with them before travelling.
Proof of negative COVID test result
You will need to present proof of a negative COVID test (except for children under 2 years) done within 72 hours prior to departure for RT-PCR tests or within 24 hours for rapid-flow antigen (lateral flow) tests. The results of either type of test must be certified by an accredited test provider and you should have your certificate available for inspection at your airline counter check-in and on arrival in Vietnam. Travellers with negative COVID tests are not required to quarantine.
If you show symptoms of COVID (fever, cough, sore throat, runny nose, body aches, loss of taste, loss of smell, headache, diarrhoea, breathing difficulty, etc.) you must notify the health agency at the border gates.
See information on getting a test before entry.
If you are travelling by road, rail or sea and do not have proof of negative tests
If you are travelling by road, rail or sea and do not have proof of a negative COVID test you will have to take either an RT-PCR or a rapid antigen test in the first 24 hours from the time of arrival in Vietnam. You will be liable for the costs of these.
If you are negative once tested, you do not need to quarantine.
If you’re fully vaccinated
Entry requirements for Vietnam are the same for all travellers, regardless of COVID-19 vaccination status. See All travellers.
Proof of vaccination status
Vietnam will accept the UK’s vaccination record and proof of COVID-19 vaccination issued in the Crown Dependencies. Your NHS appointment card from vaccination centres is not designed to be used as proof of vaccination and should not be used to demonstrate your vaccine status.
If you’re not fully vaccinated
Entry requirements for Vietnam are the same for all travellers, regardless of COVID-19 vaccination status. See All travellers.
If you’ve tested positive for COVID-19 in the past year
Entry requirements for Vietnam are the same for all travellers, regardless of whether you have tested positive for COVID-19 in the past year.
If you’re transiting through Vietnam
Currently transiting through Vietnam is not allowed.
Exemptions
There are no exemptions to Vietnam’s entry requirements.
Check your passport and travel documents before you travel
Passport validity
If you are visiting Vietnam, your passport should be valid for 6 months from the date you arrive.
A number of British nationals have been refused entry and exit due to their passport being damaged. Make sure your passport is in good condition before arriving in Vietnam. Being refused entry can result in significant cost and a long stay at the airport.
Check with your travel provider to make sure your passport and other travel documents meet their requirements.
Visas
If you want to stay in Vietnam, you should only do so legally and with the right visa and permission to stay. If you wish to remain in Vietnam as a tourist for longer than 15 days there are two visa options:
Book a tour with a travel agent in Vietnam requesting that the agent applies for a visa pre-approval letter for your travel to Vietnam. On receipt of the pre-approval letter by the Vietnamese Embassy your agent will inform you when to collect your visa from the Embassy;
Apply for an e-visa online through the online portal. E-visas are issued for stays of up to 30 days, single entry only. Use of the e-visa is limited to certain entry/exit points which you must select at the time of application. You cannot make any amendments once your application is completed.
Tourists to Vietnam can only apply for 30-day tourist visa. Tourist visas currently cannot be extended. Paid or volunteer work, missionary work, or other activities not related to tourism are not allowed under tourist visas.
If you are travelling to Vietnam for business, or are an expert and/ or a high-skilled worker you will need to contact your business partner/ employer/ sponsor in Vietnam to work with relevant authorities of Vietnam to arrange the issuance of your visa.
Those needing to renew their non-tourist visas can do so by completing the support request format or by telephoning the following number: 0283 920 0365 (ideally with the help of a Vietnamese speaker).
From 15 January 2022, those who entered Vietnam on visa waivers, e-visas or tourist visas from 1 March 2020 are no longer entitled to an automatic visa extension. If you now plan to leave Vietnam permanently and entered before 1 March 2020 without undergoing mandatory quarantine or treatment for COVID-19, you should contact your local immigration office in order to apply for your exit visa and pay any overstay fees. Going to the airport without an exit visa will result in you being denied boarding for your flight.
Vietnamese visit visas are issued to foreign nationals for a limited duration and on the basis that visitors must leave on or before the date of expiry, which is printed on your visa. Those who come to Vietnam to work are required to apply for a work visa / permit. You should check the visa validity and conditions carefully. Overstaying your Vietnamese visit visa or working illegally is a serious matter and you may be delayed from travel until a fine is paid, deported and may be prevented from visiting Vietnam in the future.
The Embassy and Consulate General will not be able to assist with individual visit visa extensions should you wish to stay in Vietnam, nor sponsor individual applications or sign NA5 forms (which has the same effect) as this involves legal and financial obligations. For those with a valid work visa or resident cards, you can extend these at immigration offices with the assistance and support of your family or employer.
Yellow fever certificate requirements
Check whether you need a yellow fever certificate by visiting the National Travel Health Network and Centre’s TravelHealthPro website.
UK Emergency Travel Documents
UK Emergency Travel Documents are accepted for entry, airside transit and exit from Vietnam. Please contact the nearest Vietnamese Embassy to obtain an appropriate visa before travel. If your ETD has been issued in Vietnam, to replace a lost/stolen passport, you will need an exit visa from the Vietnam Immigration Department before you can travel out of Vietnam. This process normally takes 5 working days. Contact the Immigration Department directly for further information.
Returning to the UK
There is no requirement for testing on departure. Anyone who has tested positive previously may be asked to show their negative test results and release certificates and some airlines may require a negative test certificate to board. If you are transiting through a third country you may also require evidence of a negative test.
