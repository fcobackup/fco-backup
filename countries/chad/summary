There is an ongoing outbreak of coronavirus (COVID-19) in China, and cases have been confirmed in other countries including Cameroon and Nigeria. The Chadian authorities have introduced a number of measures to limit the spread of the virus. We have received reports that N’Djamena International Airport will be closed for at least two weeks from midnight on Thursday 19 March. Currently, protective measures are being implemented at international airports. See Health
Before considering any travel, take professional security advice. You should follow your employer’s security advice and make sure the correct Chadian authorities are aware of your journey, you have in place the right permits if required, and you hold comprehensive travel insurance.
The number of reports of car-jackings on roads outside N’Djamena has increased, including during daylight hours. It is recommended that you use a police or military escort when driving outside the capital, and carry working communications equipment. See Crime
Terrorists are very likely to try to carry out attacks in Chad. Attacks could be indiscriminate, including in places visited by foreigners. There’s a threat of retaliatory attacks following the French intervention in Mali and due to Chad’s involvement in the regional fight to counter Boko Haram. There is a heightened threat of kidnap in Chad. See Terrorism
