This page has information on travelling to Antigua & Barbuda. Check what you must do to return to the UK.
This page reflects the UK government’s understanding of current rules for people travelling on a full ‘British Citizen’ passport from the UK, for the most common types of travel.
The authorities in Antigua & Barbuda set and enforce entry rules.
All travellers
On arrival, you will be subject to health screening. The Ministry of Health and Wellness of Antigua and Barbuda advise that all arrivals will be monitored for coronavirus for up to 14 days and that ultimately it is the decision of the Quarantine Authority on who must self-isolate or quarantine on arrival.
If you’re fully vaccinated
All arriving and transiting passengers aged 18 and over, must provide evidence of having received both doses of a two-dose WHO-approved COVID-19 vaccine, or a full dose of a single-dose WHO-approved COVID-19 vaccine. All COVID-19 vaccines administered in the UK are WHO-approved.
Fully vaccinated passengers are not required to present a negative COVID-19 test but may be required to submit to a RT PCR test for SARS-CoV-2 upon arrival at their own expense if they are displaying symptoms. Instructions on permissible activities while awaiting results will be provided by Port Health officials.
Proof of vaccination status
You must present proof that you have been fully vaccinated to enter Antigua & Barbuda
Antigua or Barbuda will accept the UK’s proof of COVID-19 vaccination record. Your NHS appointment card from vaccination centres is not designed to be used as proof of vaccination and should not be used to demonstrate your vaccine status.
If you’re not fully vaccinated
Unvaccinated or partially-vaccinated residents or nationals of Antigua and Barbuda will be permitted entry to the country provided they present a negative certified PCR/Rapid Antigen Test result taken no more than four (4) days prior to arrival in Antigua and Barbuda; submit to RT-PCR testing upon arrival at their own expense; self-isolate for 10 days if partially vaccinated; or self-isolate for 14 days if unvaccinated. If symptoms appear during the period of self-isolation, the person will be placed in isolation and will be tested for COVID-19.
Unvaccinated or partially-vaccinated non-residents and non-nationals will not be permitted entry to Antigua and Barbuda.
If you’ve had COVID-19 in the past year
If you have had COVID-19 in the past year, you will still need to demonstrate proof of vaccination as above. Antigua and Barbuda will not accept the UK’s proof of COVID-19 recovery letter.
Children and young people
Children under five years of age do not require any form of COVID-19 test to enter or transit Antigua and Barbuda.
Children aged 17 and younger do not need to have been vaccinated to enter or transit Antigua and Barbuda. All passengers aged between 5 – 17 years, arriving by air (including those transiting the country), who are not vaccinated or who are partially vaccinated must provide evidence of a negative COVID-19 RT-PCR test or an approved Rapid Antigen test taken within 4 days of their flight. Only tests using nasopharyngeal or oropharyngeal specimens/swabs are accepted. Home tests, self-administered tests and those using saliva samples are not accepted.
If you’re transiting through Antigua and Barbuda
Transiting is when you pass through one country on the way to your final destination.
