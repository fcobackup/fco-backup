Security situation in North Kivu
Fighting in Sake, 23km to the West of Goma, and the surrounding region has intensified and M23 are now in control of the town. M23 may continue to advance towards Goma. The situation in Goma remains uncertain, unstable and can change quickly. If your reason for being in Goma is not essential, consider leaving. Be prepared to leave at short notice and have adequate supplies of food, water and medicine in case of the need to lock down. The border crossings between Rwanda and the DRC at Gisenyi/Goma could close at short notice. Support from the UK government is severely limited outside Kinshasa. You should not assume that FCDO will be able to provide assistance to leave the country in the event of serious unrest or crisis.
