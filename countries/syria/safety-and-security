Civil unrest/political tension
The situation remains volatile and dangerous after a decade of conflict The Syrian regime does not exercise control of parts of Syria, notably in the north west and north east of the country. There are many armed groups – both internationally-backed and domestic – controlling huge swathes of the country.
In the north-west, a ceasefire between regime and opposition forces has been in place since March 2020. However, some violence continues involving the use of small arms, artillery and sporadic airstrikes. The earlier regime offensive displaced large numbers of civilians, caused significant civilian casualties, and severely damaged civilian infrastructure including health facilities.
In north-east Syria, a ceasefire agreed in October 2019 remains in place but the situation remains unstable with intermittent violence.
Daesh (formerly referred to as ISIL) fighters continue to operate as an insurgency and conduct regular attacks, especially in north-east Syria. Civil unrest and violent clashes between armed groups remain common throughout Syria, including in areas of north-west Syria under Turkish control, and areas of south Syria.
Fighting has at various times caused the temporary suspension of commercial flights, closed roads, impeded access to land border crossing points and led to the closure of some border crossings.
Journalism
A number of foreign journalists have been killed during the course of the Syrian conflict. All foreign journalists entering Syria require special permission from the Syrian authorities. Those journalists and other foreigners in opposition-held areas are vulnerable to mistreatment by armed groups as well as to explosive remnants of war, improvised explosive devices, and the bombardment of these areas. Others have been detained by regime security forces or other armed groups during the crisis. The security forces have confiscated phones, cameras and video cameras.
Political activity
There are severe restrictions on political activity. Thousands of people have been detained, and in many cases tortured and executed, because of actual or perceived involvement in political activity. Foreigners engaging in unlicensed political activity are at risk of detention.
The regime authorities have detained and deported several British nationals for unauthorised activity. Activity in opposition-held areas will also attract attention. If you are deported by local authorities, you will not be able to return to Syria.
Humanitarian crisis
Humanitarian needs in Syria have increased significantly since the beginning of the crisis with over 13million people in need of humanitarian aid. The ongoing conflict has seriously affected public infrastructure and services. This widespread destruction has led to high unemployment, scarcity/prohibitive cost of food, lack of water, sanitation, health services and fuel. Electricity, internet and cellular services are intermittent in many parts of the country.
Crime
The escalating conflict has led to a rise in crime in most areas, including extortion at checkpoints, violent robbery, carjacking and kidnapping.
Air travel
Fighting near airports has sometimes caused the temporary suspension of flights. Road networks may be blocked without warning. There are security force checkpoints on major road routes.
Fighting and road closures have affected access to some land border crossing points. Some border crossings are in the hands of non-state armed groups, vulnerable to attack, and/or closed.
Road travel
Road travel remains very dangerous in many parts of the country due to fighting, the fragile security situation and unexploded ordnance. Driving standards and traffic systems are poor, and the accident rate is high. Driving at night is particularly dangerous. When there is a car accident with a pedestrian, the car driver is usually legally responsible.
