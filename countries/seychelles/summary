The Public Health Authority in Seychelles reports that it has lifted travel restrictions imposed after the outbreak of pneumonic and bubonic plague in Madagascar.
Crime levels are rising and there has been an increase in break-ins, robberies, burglaries and opportunist thefts against residents, expatriates and tourists.
Recent months have seen a spate of robberies and attacks on and around Cote D’Or beach on the island of Praslin. Incidents have taken place both after dark and during daylight hours. Police have responded with increased foot patrols and have advised visitors to take care when walking in this area, particularly at night.
