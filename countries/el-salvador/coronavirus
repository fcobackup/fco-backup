Be prepared for your plans to change
No travel is risk-free during COVID-19. Countries may further restrict travel or bring in new rules at short notice, for example due to a new COVID-19 variant. Check with your travel company or airline for any transport changes which may delay your journey home.
If you test positive for COVID-19, you may need to stay where you are until you test negative. You may also need to seek treatment there.
Plan ahead and make sure you:
can access money
understand what your insurance will cover
can make arrangements to extend your stay and be away for longer than planned
Travel in El Salvador
While the requirement to wear masks in public places has been dropped, mask usage remains considerably more widespread than in the UK, and may be expected in some contexts (for example in some meetings). Other measures could be introduced with little or no notice, in El Salvador and/or third countries you might transit through en route. You should familiarise yourself with any local measures or restrictions, and comply with these and any other emergency measures.
Accommodation
Please check that your planned accommodation is available and whether any COVID-19 restrictions are being applied before travelling.
Health
British-issued prescriptions cannot be used locally. To find a pharmacy (“farmacia”) look for one of the big national chains such as Farmacia San Nicolas, Farmacias UNO or Farmacias Economicas, among others; a quick search online should help you to identify the nearest open one. For contact details for English speaking doctors visit our list of healthcare providers.
