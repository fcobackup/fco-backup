Cases of coronavirus (COVID-19) have been confirmed in Benin. The Benin authorities have introduced a number of measures to limit the spread of the virus.
Entry and borders
As of 19 March, entry visas are restricted. Entry and exit at border crossings is limited to “extreme necessity” and authorised in liaison with bordering countries.
Screening and quarantine
Cotonou Cadjehoun International Airport has heightened screening measures in place for visitors arriving in Benin. Reinforced measures will be put in place to quarantine people who are suspected to have or have COVID-19. Quarantine in allocated hotels will be obligatory for all passengers arriving in Benin via air. Foreign nationals will be required to cover their own costs of quarantine. Quarantine areas will be guarded by defence and security forces to ensure that quarantine regulations are strictly adhered to.
