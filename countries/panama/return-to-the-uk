All commercial flights have ceased operation to/from Panama until at least 22 June 2020. There are currently no commercial options available to return to the UK from Panama, but some special flights are currently operating (see below).
If you cannot leave Panama at this time, see information on staying in Panama during coronavirus.
UK special flights
On 11 June, a special flight will depart from Tocumen International Airport, Panama City, to the UK. The flight will go via San Jose, Costa Rica, where passengers will board a transatlantic charter to London Heathrow.
The flight cost is £800 per person, regardless of where your journey begins.
These flights are for:
British nationals, normally resident in the UK
dependants travelling with a British national
Vulnerable British nationals will be prioritised.
Vulnerable non-British UK residents with Indefinite Leave to Remain, and other foreign nationals, may be accommodated if there is sufficient capacity.
Your eligibility will be checked before your tickets are issued.
How to book
CTM is working on behalf of the Foreign and Commonwealth Office (FCO) to manage special flight bookings.
If you wish to travel, book on the CTM website as soon as possible.
To book flights on the CTM website, you will need:
full passport and contact details for each traveller
your UK home address and postcode
your means of payment, such as credit or debit card details
The booking website is only available to British nationals. If you have difficulty booking online, or if you are a vulnerable non-British UK resident with Indefinite Leave to Remain, or another foreign national, then you will need to contact us. To do so, send an SMS text message containing only your full name to +44 (0)7537 416 125.
A member of the CTM team will then be in touch.
Tickets will not be on sale at the airport. Do not travel to the airport without a confirmed ticket.
You may find it helpful to read our guide to eligibility and the booking process for special charter flights.
Financial support for a flight
If you have exhausted all other options available to you for getting funds, you may be eligible to apply for an emergency loan from the government to cover the cost of the ticket.
You would need to repay the loan when you are back in the UK.
Our partner CTM is also authorised to administer such loans on behalf of the FCO and details will be available when you are asked to pay.
Transport to the airport for flights
Movement within Panama is restricted, but for those with tickets, travel to the airport for repatriation is a valid exemption.
The British Embassy can facilitate a safe passage letter in Spanish and English for the driver for use at checkpoints to and from the airport. Email the British Embassy BEPanama.CV@fco.gov.uk with your flight confirmation and the following details:
the driver’s full name
identification number (cedula)
licence plate number
make and model of the vehicle
names of British nationals travelling with you
If you are having difficulty booking transportation, the British Embassy may be able to assist.
If you are travelling from outside Panama City, you’re advised to arrive in Panama City on the day before the flight, to prevent any last minute delays. See a list of hotels in Panama City that you may find helpful.
We are monitoring the situation for further departures from Panama but these are likely to be limited until the air embargo is lifted (currently scheduled for 22 June)
If local authorities need confirmation that you are in transit to the airport, please call +507-297-6550 for assistance.
Taxis, Cabify and InDriver continue to operate, as do the two transport options below. Others may be available. You should book in advance and inform the British Embassy of your arrangements, as below:
