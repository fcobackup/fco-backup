Entry rules in response to coronavirus
Entry to Timor-Leste
The Government of Timor-Leste has re-imposed the temporary closure of its airports, ports and land borders from 3 May 2021 to 1 June l 2021. The decision has been made under the State of Emergency declared by the President of the Republic, due to a recent increase in the community transmission of COVID-19 in Dili.
During the above mentioned period of closure, the following exceptions will apply:
Transit of Diplomatic or Consular Personnel, members of International Organisations and bilateral cooperation agencies, and workers in the petroleum sector, and other international workers whose work is relevant to Timor-Leste’s national interest;
Operation of medical evacuations, and;
International Transportation of goods.
Timor-Leste is in the process of implementing a series of changes to their admission procedures due to the recent increase in imported COVID 19 cases. While these are being rolled out, in addition to meeting the categories above, you should reconfirm your eligibility to enter Timor-Leste, with your travel agent/airline and the Embassy of Timor-Leste.
You should not use the NHS testing service to get a test in order to facilitate your travel to another country. You should arrange to take a private test.
Quarantine requirements
Following the presentation of a valid negative COVID 19 test, you will need to quarantine for 14 days either in a government facility or in your own accommodation, subject to the approval of the Ministry of Health. Those who have been fully vaccinated and hold a valid vaccination certificate will be exempt from mandatory quarantine. Those who present symptoms of COVID-19, including a fever greater than 37.5°C, cough and/or breathing difficulties will be prevented from travelling, and taken to a health facility for a COVID-19 test. Positive cases will be subject to isolation.
Testing on departure
Those wishing to leave Timor-Leste will be subject to health control measures including body temperature checks. The situation in Timor-Leste can change quickly. In exceptional cases, the Government may introduce temporary border closures.
Regular entry requirements
Visas
A tourist visa costs US$30 and can normally be issued to the holder of a valid British passport on arrival at Dili International airport or Dili seaport, provided entry into Timor-Leste is regarded as being for a legitimate purpose. The visa will be valid for a single entry and will allow you to stay for up to 30 days.
British Citizens intending to enter the country via the Indonesia (West Timor) land border crossing at Atambua/Batugade need to apply in Kupang for a tourism visa in advance. This visa will generally be valid for a single entry and a duration of up to 30 days.
In Dili, tourism visas can be extended to a total of 90 days, for a fee.
If you plan to travel overland (rather than by the ferry) to the exclave of Oecussi you’ll need to apply for an additional visa. You must present your round trip ticket and complete the required forms at your nearest Timor-Leste embassy or consulate, or in Dili, prior to travel. For information on other types of visa see the Immigration Department of Timor-Leste.
Passport validity
Your passport should be valid for a minimum period of 6 months from the date of entry into Timor-Leste.
Yellow fever certificate requirements
Check whether you need a yellow fever certificate by visiting the National Travel Health Network and Centre’s TravelHealthPro website.
UK Emergency Travel Documents
UK Emergency Travel Documents (ETDs) are accepted for exit from Timor-Leste only. You can’t use an ETD to enter the country. If you wish to transit Timor-Leste, you should contact the Immigration Department of Timor-Leste before you travel to confirm the requirements.
