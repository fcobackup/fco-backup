Security situation
Since confirmation of cases of Coronavirus (COVID-19) in Senegal, there have been reports of a limited number of incidents of increased hostility towards foreigners. You should be aware of this, take sensible precautions in your daily movements and avoid confrontation.
Crime
Pick pocketing and street crime are risks in common parts of Dakar, particularly around Place de l’Indépendence, the central area of the Plateau and the Western Corniche as well as Gorée Island. This type of crime is more common in the run-up to religious festivals. They can also increase early in the month after salaries are paid. There has also been an increase in crime in the context of COVID-19. Recent examples of street crime have also included attackers grabbing bags whilst driving scooters or motorbikes. You should be vigilant and take sensible precautions: e.g. avoid walking alone in the evening and after dark, be alert if using a mobile phone in public and avoid carrying valuables and bags in public.
If you’re expecting someone to collect you at the airport, make sure they properly identify themselves before you set off. Officials wear uniforms and have a visible airport pass.
Home robberies and armed robberies are becoming more frequent. Assaults usually take place early in the morning and after dusk.
Be cautious when changing cash given the risk of false money circulating.
British nationals are increasingly being targeted by scam artists operating in West Africa. Scams come in many forms (romance and friendship, business ventures, work and employment opportunities) and can pose a great financial risk to victims. You should be cautious about requests for funds, a job offer, a business venture or a face-to-face meeting from someone you have been in correspondence with over the internet who lives in West Africa. This includes requests from people who claim to be victims of various Western African conflicts (notably refugees from Sierra Leone) or relatives of present or former political leaders.
Political situation
President Macky Sall was re-elected for a second term in 2019.
Strikes by teachers’ unions and student bodies, and demonstrations about political issues and the cost of living, are a relatively frequent occurrence, particularly in Dakar but also other cities. There is a heightened risk of protests ahead of the legislative elections in July 2022. These are normally peaceful, but can sometimes turn violent at short notice. You should exercise caution and avoid areas where demonstrations and large gatherings are taking place, monitor the local media for information about forthcoming protests, and follow the instructions of local authorities.
Local travel
The FCDO advises against all but essential travel to the land border between The Gambia and southern Senegal (Casamance) and the N4 and N5 national highways between The Gambia and Ziguinchor. This is due to recent reports of a number of attacks on travellers, as well as military operations taking place in the Casamance region.
The Casamance region, the region south of The Gambia, has suffered for decades from low intensity separatist violence, largely directed at Senegalese security forces.
The security situation has improved significantly since 2012. The main faction of the separatist MFDC (Movement of the Democratic Forces of Casamance) declared a ceasefire in 2014, and political discussions with the government are ongoing. Armed separatist groups are, however, still present in Casamance, and the region continues to suffer from banditry. There are occasionally violent incidents, including armed attacks on travellers, businesses or villages. In January 2022, the MFDC killed four Senegalese soldiers who were part of a peacekeeping mission in The Gambia, near to the Casamance border. A military operation by Senegalese Armed Forces is underway north of Sindian in Casamance on the land border with Gambia. Land mines remain a hazard in certain areas of the Casamance, and have caused several hundred deaths since 1990.
De-mining operations are ongoing. Stick to paved roads where possible.
You should be vigilant when travelling in the Casamance region and monitor the local security situation before travelling. Where possible you should avoid travelling at night, stick to main roads and travel in a convoy when you can. There is a lower level of risk in the main tourist areas of the Casamance.
Road travel
You can drive in Senegal with a valid UK driving licence for up to 6 months, or on a valid International Driving Permit. If you’re staying longer or living in Senegal, you’ll need to get a Senegalese driving licence.
While some main roads are of good quality, other roads can be poor especially during the rainy season from June to September. Torrential rains can cause floods and landslides. Monitor local weather reports.
Driving standards are unpredictable. Some taxis and public mini-buses (‘car rapide’) are not roadworthy by UK standards.
Traffic congestion also increases throughout Senegal in the run up to and during religious festivals. You should take particular care and attention to avoid accidents. Driving after dark is more dangerous because of poor street and vehicle lighting. If you do have an accident you must contact the police (dial 17 from a local phone) and wait for them to arrive at the scene. Do not move the car involved in the accident until a police officer gives you permission to do so. In more remote areas you may need to go directly to the nearest police station in order to report the incident.
