Foreign nationals have been detained or had their passports seized by local authorities following commercial disputes. You should be cautious when dealing with commercial disputes and seek legal advice. Foreign nationals have also been detained or had passports seized as a result of immigration offences.
The Congolese authorities rarely meet their international obligations to notify Embassies when foreign nationals have been detained. Even if requested, adequate consular access isn’t always granted. You should therefore keep in close touch with family or friends and ask them to notify the British Embassy Kinshasa immediately in the event that you are arrested in DRC.
Public gatherings and demonstrations can be called with little or no notice and can quickly turn violent in DRC. In all instances, you should remain vigilant and be aware of disruptions to journeys around Kinshasa, as well as to and from N’Djili airport. If a demonstration or disturbance takes place, leave quickly and don’t attempt to watch or photograph it.
You should:
follow local media for news of any planned protests
avoid travelling around Kinshasa and other large cities on and around days of planned protests including travel to and from N’Djili airport, areas where demonstrations may take place, large sporting or music events, universities, political party headquarters, the parliament and the offices of the electoral commission.
In the event of serious unrest, commercial flights may be suspended, roads blocked and borders closed, making it difficult to leave the country. Internet connections and mobile phone networks may have reduced services or be cut off. Schools may be closed. Previous periods of unrest have seen an increased military and police presence in Kinshasa and other major cities, with stop-and-search checkpoints appearing in some areas, especially after dark.
Consider making contingency plans in the event of demonstrations, including keeping a stock of essential supplies and up-to-date travel documents and visas. See how to prepare for a crisis overseas and information on how to contact the British Embassy.
There are limits to the assistance the FCO can provide in a crisis, depending on the security and transport situation. You shouldn’t assume that the FCO will be able to provide assistance to leave the country in the event of serious unrest.
The security situation in eastern DRC remains unstable. The continued presence of armed groups, military operations against them, intercommunal violence and an influx of refugees from neighbouring countries all contribute to a deterioration in the political, security and humanitarian situation. There are continued reports of kidnappings, including of staff from international NGOs.
Tourists in eastern DRC have been known to be left very vulnerable as a result of trying to travel independently without escorted transport, and the risk of kidnap or injury as a result of armed or criminal activity remains high.
On 11 May 2018, 2 British nationals were kidnapped on the road north of Goma to Virunga National Park. They have since been released.
While British government staff do visit Goma, they aren’t always in the area, and as with anywhere outside of Kinshasa the British Embassy’s ability to offer consular assistance is severely limited.
Since July 2017, there have been increased reports of several towns in the South Kivu province of eastern DRC being attacked by or having come under the control of armed groups. There are reports of serious clashes between Congolese Armed Forces and militia groups around Uvira in South Kivu Province.
Crime
Be alert to the risk of street crime and armed robbery at all times. Foreigners are at particular risk of street robbery in Kinshasa, especially near hotels and supermarkets in the centre of town. Robberies by gangs of street children are increasingly common and can be aggressive.
Robberies by people posing as taxi drivers or taxi customers are increasingly common in Kinshasa, and are often accompanied by a threat of violence. You should avoid using any taxis in DRC. If you must take a taxi, use a privately booked one. Don’t hail taxis on the street.
Car jackings are rare but not unheard of. There have been reports of an increase in criminal activity in North and South Kivu specifically targeting the international community. There have been many reports of robberies and banditry in Goma after dark.
Don’t walk in the streets alone at any time, especially at night. Avoid displaying valuables and cash. Use a hotel safe if possible and keep copies of documents, including your passport separately.
Some gangs use girls to lure people into traps; others promise cut-price gold and diamonds, or pose as police or security forces. There is a risk of arbitrary arrests of foreigners by security authorities who demand payment for release.
Local Travel
If you’re in Haut-Uele, Haut Lomami, Ituri, North Kivu, South Kivu, Maniema, Tanganyika or within 50km of the border with the Central African Republic and South Sudan against FCO advice you should be vigilant at all times and keep your security situation under constant review. Attacks on the civilian population of Beni territory have led to several hundred deaths since 2014.
During fighting in the region in 2012 and 2013, shells landed on Goma causing civilian deaths and injuries. There was also shelling around the border with Rwanda in late 2012 and explosions in the town of Gisenyi on the Rwandan side of the border. While British Embassy staff do visit Goma, there aren’t always staff in the area, and our ability to offer consular assistance is therefore severely limited.
As well as civil unrest sometimes leading to anger at the international community, a risk of criminal acts remains, and attacks by armed men on NGO compounds have taken place.
There has been a series of kidnappings in North Kivu in the area around Goma in addition to military operations against armed groups. You should be especially vigilant, consider travelling in convoy on trips outside Goma and Bukavu and avoid making any journeys that would involve travel after dark.
The border crossings between Rwanda and the DRC at Gisenyi/Goma and Cyangugu/Bukavu are currently open between 6am and 6pm. Both borders are liable to short notice closure and you shouldn’t rely on them as a point of exit from the DRC. If you’re crossing regularly between Rwanda and the DRC you may encounter immigration difficulties if you haven’t regularised your residency status. There have been a number of security incidents in Lubumbashi and surrounding areas of Katanga, where the situation remains tense.
You should be prepared to move at short notice or lock down for a period of time. The local authorities may impose curfews without warning. You should follow the advice of the local authorities at all times. In the event of escalating tensions and civil unrest, commercial flights may be suspended and borders closed. Keep your travel documents up to date so you can avoid facing difficulties should you need to leave in an emergency.
The borders with Burundi and Angola can also be subject to closure at short notice. The opportunities for gorilla trekking in the Virunga National Park in North Kivu are limited, and armed groups are sometimes active within the park. Tourists in eastern DRC have been known to be left very vulnerable as a result of trying to travel independently without escorted transport, and the risk of kidnap or injury as a result of armed or criminal activity remains high.
The Nyiragongo volcano in Virunga National Park is active and has only limited access to tourists. The north eastern district of Ituri, near the frontier with Uganda, remains subject to inter-factional conflict despite the presence of the UN and the Congolese army. Following the unrest in the Central African Republic (CAR), refugees from CAR have crossed the border into the DRC and are now in the Gemena area in Equateur Province.
The Lord’s Resistance Army, a rebel group originating in northern Uganda, is currently operating in north eastern DRC.
Road travel
You’ll need an international driving permit and insurance to drive. Car hire is possible in Kinshasa although self-drive options are limited. Most car hire companies will only rent a car with a driver.
Driving conditions and standards are well below those in the UK and other European countries, and traffic accidents are common. Roads in Kinshasa are poorly maintained. Outside Kinshasa and other main cities, most roads are barely drivable even with a 4x4, especially during the rainy season (September to May). Consider the technical capability of your vehicle and be confident in your ability to safely operate it.
Be aware of vehicle theft and car-jacking. Lock vehicle doors and keep windows closed when driving and watch out for armed gangs who may target your car. Don’t drive off the main routes or park in unsupervised areas.
Security forces operate roadblocks, particularly after dark. If you are asked to produce documents for inspection at a check point, remain in your vehicle and show them through closed windows.
Rail travel
The railways are in a dilapidated state and you should generally avoid rail travel. In late 2015 a refurbished route opened between Kinshasa and Matadi, although services are infrequent.
Air travel
All air carriers certified in the DRC are banned from operating within the EU due to safety concerns.
You can find a list of recent incidents and accidents on the website of the Aviation Safety network.
The FCO can’t offer advice on the safety of individual airlines. However, the International Air Transport Association publishes lists of registered airlines that have been audited and found to meet a number of operational safety standards and recommended practices. This list isn’t exhaustive and the absence of an airline from this list doesn’t necessarily mean that it’s unsafe.
In 2014 an audit of the Democratic Republic of the Congo’s Civil Aviation Authority by the International Civil Aviation Organisation found that the level of implementation of the critical elements of safety oversight in the Democratic Republic of the Congo was below the global average.
UK government staff working in DRC are authorised to use aircraft operated by the Mission Aviation Fellowship for internal flights on a case by case basis.
River travel
The ferry service between Kinshasa and Brazzaville is operating, but is subject to cancellation at little notice. The ferry stops running in late afternoon, and there is no service on Sundays.
Boats and ferries serving the rivers and lakes are poorly maintained and often overloaded. As a result of the low safety standards, high river traffic levels, strong currents, shifting sandbanks and poor maintenance there have been many accidents.
Political situation
The political and security situation remains uncertain ahead of elections on 23 December 2018. The campaigning period runs from 22 November to 22 December. The political and security situation for previous electoral cycles has seen sporadic bouts of unrest and violence. In line with previous elections, the British Embassy Kinshasa will temporarily reduce staff numbers from 17 December to 6 January.
In September and December 2016, violence relating to political protests led to dozens of fatalities in Kinshasa and other major cities, the closure of international borders and schools, restrictions on the internet and an increased police and military presence in many cities.A heavy United Nations peace keeping presence is deployed in eastern DRC. The Congolese army is carrying out operations against foreign and domestic armed groups operating in North and South Kivu provinces. Large numbers of civilians remain displaced as a result of the conflict. Acts of violence, including killing, rape and looting continue against the civilian population.
Insecurity in eastern DRC has allowed other armed groups in the area to operate more freely. There has been an increase in armed group activity in Orientale, Katanga and both North and South Kivu.
The body of the former opposition leader Etienne Tshisekedi is expected to return to the DRC from Belgium at some point in the future. You should expect large crowds in Kinshasa on that day.
