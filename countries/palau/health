Healthcare in Palau
Health facilities in Palau are adequate for routine medical care. The only national hospital is Belau National Hospital in Koror, which is less than 2 hours from most locations. The hospital has a hyperbaric chamber to treat patients in diving accidents and can carry out operations.
There are small number of private clinics and community health centres that offer basic primary and urgent care services. Doctors and medical centres often expect immediate cash payment.
