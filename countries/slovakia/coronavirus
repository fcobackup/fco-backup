Local measures
On 12 March, the Slovak government declared a State of Emergency and announced a range of restrictions on travel and events.
Local public transport is running on a reduced timetable.
It is mandatory to wear a mask or otherwise cover your nose and mouth when travelling on public transport and anywhere outside the home. The exceptions to wearing a facemask outside are only for: children under 2 years; people from the same household walking in the countryside as long as they remain 20 metres from others; people diagnosed with serious autism; people in a car if they are from the same household.
All public gatherings have been banned, including sporting events and religious services. This includes theatres and cinemas, but not workplaces, supermarkets and pharmacies. All schools and universities are closed until further notice.
Restrictions apply to most public, social, sporting and cultural activities. All tourist and leisure sites, including ski resorts, spas and museums are closed. Restaurants are open for take-away food delivery only. Hotels (for short-term accommodation), bars and nightclubs are closed. Most shops are closed with exceptions for the sale of food, banks, pharmacies and petrol stations.
No fixed end date has been specified for most of these restrictions, but the Slovak government has set out a plan to lift the restrictions in four phases. The first phase began on 22 April, to allow the following businesses to open: shops and services with premises less than 300 m2; catering if food is served through a window; outdoor markets; some outdoor sprts venues for non-contact sports, without changing rooms/toilets and without spectators; car dealerships (new and second-hand); long-term accommodation, without catering. The timetable for a gradual lifting of measures in subsequent phases will be subject to review by the local authorities.
For more information and a full list of businesses and activities open to the public check the Slovak government Coronavirus website.
