If you are still in Cuba and your visa has expired or will expire while flights are suspended, you should keep in touch with the local immigration office; there is one in each municipality. All types of visas that have expired during Coronavirus measures will remain valid for 30 days after the suspension on commercial flights is lifted if you have not been able to renew yours with Immigration.
If you have dual British and Cuban nationality, you are subject to Cuban measures and should check your immigration status to clarify if you can leave Cuba while travel restrictions are in place (and when flights resume). If you need permission to leave, you should get this from the immigration office in Havana; permission cannot be given at the airport.
Travel in Cuba
Travel and transport within each Province varies according to the measures in place. The suspension of inter-provincial transport was lifted on 19 October 2020. The current exceptions are to/from Ciego de Avila, Sancti Spiritus and Pinar del Rio. Any change in the situation in a province or municipality may mean inter-provincial or municipal transport links also change.
Face masks must be worn at all times when travelling on buses, in taxis, and private hire vehicles.
Visitors are allowed to hire cars (see important information in Road Travel section but cannot enter/leave Ciego de Avila, Spriritus, or Pinar del Rio.
Visitors who fly directly in Jardines del Rey Airport (for holidays in Cayo Coco, Cayo Cruz or Cayo Guillermo) may rent cars, but cannot leave the Cayos.
Check with your tour operator and seek local advice if you have questions about excursions to other parts of Cuba.
