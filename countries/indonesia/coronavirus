Healthcare in Indonesia
For contact details for English speaking doctors, visit our list of healthcare providers.
A British national died of COVID-19 on 11 March 2020 in Bali. The standard of local medical care in Indonesia can be poor and some medical tests cannot be done reliably. As the government of Indonesia announces rising numbers of COVID-19 cases, there is an increasing risk that the healthcare system will come under significant further strain. Access to routine and emergency healthcare may be limited.
