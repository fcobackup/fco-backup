The holy month of Ramadan began in Algeria on 23 April and will continue until 23 May. Respect local traditions, customs, laws and religions at all times and be aware of your actions to ensure that they do not offend. See Travelling during Ramadan.
Following an attack on the coalition base at Taji in Iraq on 11 March, and subsequent US airstrikes, tensions may be raised across the region. There is a possibility of an increased threat against Western interests, including against British nationals. You should remain vigilant and keep up to date with the latest developments, including via the media and this travel advice.
Country-wide demonstrations and other forms of protest, which broke out across Algeria in February 2019 have been suspended due to the coronavirus. See Political situation
Terrorists are very likely to try to carry out attacks in Algeria, including kidnappings. Terrorist attacks have focused on the Algerian state, but attacks could be indiscriminate and include foreigners. There’s also a risk that lone actors could target foreigners. You should be vigilant at all times and take additional security precautions, especially in: towns and cities; the southern, Libyan and Tunisian border areas; rural and mountainous areas in the north; and the Sahara. See Terrorism
The Algerian authorities devote considerable resources to the safety of foreign visitors. If you’re travelling independently, you should notify the Ministry of Foreign Affairs or local authorities of your plans. See Local travel
When moving around Algiers and the other main cities, avoid areas that you don’t know, especially after dark. Travelling in rural areas and at night is particularly risky and it’s always advisable to travel with a reputable guide or companion in these areas. Avoid travel by road at night outside the major cities and motorways. See Crime and Local travel
You will need to get a visa before you travel. See Visas
If you’re abroad and you need emergency help from the UK government, contact the nearest British embassy, consulate or high commission. Consular support is severely limited in parts of Algeria where the FCO has existing advice against all travel, and limited where the FCO has existing advice against all but essential travel (see above).
