Mozambique is regularly affected by natural disasters, including floods, drought and cyclones.
Tropical Cyclone Eloise made landfall near Beira, Sofala province in the early hours of Saturday 23 January, bringing with it high winds and heavy rainfall. Winds have now lessened to speeds consistent with a tropical storm, but heavy rains continue and the risk of flooding remains high in affected areas of Central and Southern Mozambique. Monitor local reports and international weather updates from the World Meteorological Organisation, check your routes before travelling around the country and follow the advice of the local authorities.
See our Tropical cyclones page for advice about how to prepare effectively and what to do if youâ€™re likely to be affected by a tropical cyclone.
