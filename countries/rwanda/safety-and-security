Local travel
The eastern part of the Democratic Republic of Congo (DRC) which neighbours Rwanda remains unstable, and conflict can flare up with little notice. There have been incidents of violent clashes on the DRC-Rwanda border in recent years, and armed incursions into the southwest of Rwanda. On 10 June 2022 artillery fire from within DRC hit Rwandan territory close to the border in Kinigi sector of Musanze district in the North West. This follows a similar incident in May. Tourists sites have not been affected and the Rwandan government have assured residents and visitors that the area remains secure, but given instability in DRC further such incidents cannot be ruled out. On 17 June, a Congolese soldier crossed into Rwanda at Gisenyi and fired on civilians and Rwandan security personnel near the border. Two Rwandan police officers were injured, and the Congolese soldier was shot dead.
If you plan to visit areas close to the DRC or Burundi borders, such as popular tourist destinations including Volcanoes and Nyungwe National Parks, you should be alert to the risks and exercise caution. All travellers should keep up to date with developments on the current situation, including via your tour operator, the local media and this travel advice.
The land border crossings between Rwanda and the DRC at Gisenyi/Goma and Cyangugu/Bukavu are open although the hours of operation may vary. If you’re crossing regularly between Rwanda and the DRC you may encounter immigration difficulties if you have not regularised your residency status.
The situation in Burundi remains unstable. Tensions along the Rwanda/Burundi border remain heightened, with allegations from both sides of cross-border raids targeting local inhabitants.
In July 2016, Burundi banned public transport vehicles from crossing the border with Rwanda. The border remains closed currently.
Gorilla trekking
Gorilla trekking is open in the Volcanoes National Park.
If you plan to travel close to the border with the DRC you should remain aware of the risks, exercise caution, and keep up to date with developments on the current situation, including via your tour operator, the local media and this travel advice.
Grenade attacks
Grenade attacks have occurred sporadically over the last five years. Genocide memorial sites, markets, bus stops, and taxis have been targets in Kigali and Ruhengeri (Musanze). While such attacks have reduced in frequency, further indiscriminate attacks cannot be ruled out, including in places frequented by foreigners. You should remain vigilant.
Crime
Levels of crime remain relatively low in Rwanda, but there are cases of burglary, theft, bag snatching and mugging in Kigali.
You should take sensible precautions. Take care when walking at night. Pre-arrange transport. Lock car doors when driving, don’t leave valuables in cars when parked and don’t leave cars unsupervised in the town centre. Don’t carry large amounts of money or other valuables.
Some off-limits military zones in Kigali may not be well-lit or signposted. You should take extra care when walking around less populated zones, particularly at night time.
Road travel
You can drive using a UK driving licence or an International Driving Permit for up to one year, after which you should apply for a Rwandan licence. To apply for a local driving licence, you need to write a letter of application to the Commissioner Traffic and Road Safety attaching your existing licence and a copy of your visa or Foreign Resident ID card, and pay a fee.
Roads from Kigali to all major towns are good. There can be landslides during the annual rains in late spring and autumn. Avoid road travel after dark as roads are unlit and driving standards are poor.
Shared taxis (mini-vans) and motorbike taxis are the most common form of public transport within towns and around the country. However, they are also the most vulnerable to accidents.
Public transport may be affected by COVID-19 prevention measures. See Coronavirus
Air travel
Before using internal or regional flights that are not with major international carriers, you should check the airline’s accreditation and see whether the airline operates in line with the International Civil Aviation Organisation’s (ICAO) safety standards.
Health and safety
Levels of health and safety in Rwanda are lower than in the UK. There have been incidences of buildings and construction sites collapsing, causing deaths and serious injuries. Fire safety standards are also variable, with incidences of fire in residential and public places a continuing risk.
There have been a number of building fires apparently caused by poor wiring and substandard electrical cables. Take extra care when using electronic equipment.
