There are currently no commercial options available to return to the UK from Myanmar. The government has suspended all regular commercial passenger flights and shut all land borders.
We know this is concerning for British people trying to leave Myanmar. The UK government is working closely with airlines, the Myanmar authorities and other governments to make sure options are available for you to return to the UK as soon as possible.
What to do
If you cannot leave Myanmar at this time, you should:
follow the advice of local authorities, including local measures to help minimise your risk of exposure to coronavirus
find accommodation that’s suitable for your needs.
keep in regular contact with family and friends at home, so they know you are safe and well
If you have decided to stay in Myanmar, you should be prepared to rely on the local public healthcare system, which may be under severe pressure. You may not be able to access routine private healthcare, and if you have symptoms of coronavirus (COVID-19) you will be sent directly to a public facility. You should comply with Myanmar Government rules on isolation and quarantine.
The Myanmar Ministry of Labour, Immigration and Population has announced a new process for extending tourist visas, which involves obtaining a letter of recommendation from the embassy. Our current advice remains to pay for any overstay on departure (3$ per day).
We are liaising with the Myanmar Government to encourage overstays to be allowed automatically at no extra cost given the circumstances. However, if you do want to extend your visa, please email returnfrommyanmar@fco.gov.uk with a copy of your passport data page and a copy of your existing visa. We will email a letter of recommendation to you at no cost. You will then need to take the letter of recommendation to the Immigration office on Pansodan street, and pay a fee of $50.

Future travel options
The UK government is working closely with airlines, the Myanmar authorities and other governments to make sure options are available for you to return to the UK as soon as possible.
It may still be possible to purchase seats on special chartered flights, but this cannot be guaranteed and options are rapidly diminishing. If you are still in the country and wish to leave please e-mail ReturnFromMyanmar@fco.gov.uk and leave us your details:
name
email
phone
number of people wishing to travel
The British Embassy is issuing regular updates on Twitter and Facebook with the latest available information on departure options from Myanmar.
If you have managed to secure a seat on a special charter flight you should confirm with your airline before travel and continue to monitor your flight until you have received your boarding pass at the airport. Transit via Hong Kong, Singapore and Thailand are not currently possible for most travellers.
You will need to pay for your return travel to the UK. If departure options are available but you cannot afford the travel costs and have exhausted all other options for getting funds, you may be eligible to apply for an emergency loan from the government. This is a last resort option and you would need to repay the loan when you are back in the UK. For more information, you should contact Corporate Travel Management (CTM). CTM are a commercial partner of the FCO and are authorised to administer such loans on behalf of the FCO.
Arrival in the UK
When you arrive back in the UK, follow the guidance for when you return to the UK on steps you should take to protect yourself and others.
