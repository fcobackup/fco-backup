The Foreign, Commonwealth & Development Office (FCDO) provides advice about risks of travel to help British nationals make informed decisions. Find out more about FCDO travel advice.
Security situation
On 26 June there was heightened military activity and large protests near the presidential palace in La Paz. Although the armed forces have now returned to their bases the security situation could change quickly without warning. There are reports of road closures around La Paz and El Alto (which could impact travel to and from the airport). Protests, marches and demonstrations can occur with little prior notice, if they occur you should move away from the area and remain in a safe place. Remain alert to developments and pay attention to instructions from local authorities.
