Flights in and out of the country have been suspended, and land and sea borders are closed. The Government of Jordan has confirmed that these measures will remain in place until 24 June, and there are strong indications that the flight suspension and border closures will continue beyond this date.
Future travel options
All airports in Jordan remain closed for scheduled international flights. However, there is a one-off repatriation flight, operated by Royal Jordanian, to collect Jordanian nationals from Qatar that has seats available on the outward leg. This Royal Jordanian flight, from Amman to Doha, departs on Thursday 18 June at 1:30 pm. You can book a ticket onwards to the UK with Qatar Airways who offer connections to London or Manchester on Friday 19 June. If you wish to take these flights, you should first book travel from Doha to the UK with Qatar Airways and then contact Royal Jordanian to book their flight to Doha. These flights are operated on a commercial basis.
You will need to make your own arrangements for transfer to Queen Alia International Airport. If stopped at checkpoints you should show their your passport and flight tickets. Drivers will also require a copy of the flight tickets for the return journey.
There are currently no commercial flight options available to return to the UK from Jordan. In the event that flights become available, the British Embassy will do all it can to facilitate access to flights for British nationals and provide appropriate support in arranging your departure. In the case of flights departing to a third country, you will need to ensure that onward travel to the UK from the flight’s destination is possible.

You will need to pay for your return travel to the UK. If departure options are available but you cannot afford the travel costs and have exhausted all other options for getting funds, you may be eligible to apply for an emergency loan from the government. This is a last resort option and you would need to repay the loan when you are back in the UK.
