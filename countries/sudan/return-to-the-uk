There are currently no commercial options to return to the UK from Sudan. Since 16 March, all commercial international passenger flights to and from Sudan have been suspended. Cargo flights are permitted, but crew must observe strict guidelines. Land borders and seaports are also closed, except for food and aid transport.
The UK government chartered a special flight to help British nationals in Sudan return to the UK on 21 May. There are currently no further special flights planned. This travel advice will be updated with further information on options to return to the UK as soon as this is available.
You will need to pay for your return travel to the UK. If departure options become available but you cannot afford the travel costs and have exhausted all other options for getting funds, you may be eligible to apply for an emergency loan from the government. This is a last resort option and you would need to repay the loan when you are back in the UK.
The Embassy cannot provide further information or advice about departure options over the phone. This page will be updated when departure options become available and, if you are registered with the Embassy, we will alert you by email. To get the latest information sign up for travel advice email alerts.

Your journey home: re-entering the UK
When you return, you must follow the rules for entering the UK. You:
need to provide your journey and contact details up to 48 hours before you’re due to arrive in the UK
are not allowed to leave the place you’re staying for the first 14 days you’re in the UK except in very limited situations (known as ‘self-isolating’)
See also the list of people who are exempt from the border rules.
The National Travel Health Network and Centre (NaTHNaC) also provides advice on how to stay safe as you travel by air.
