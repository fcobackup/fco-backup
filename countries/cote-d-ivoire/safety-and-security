Security
Following peaceful presidential elections in 2015 the risk of a return to the levels of conflict experienced between December 2010 and May 2011 is low.
Following protests in January and February 2017, the government and soldiers reached a deal to end a dispute on pay and conditions. The public sector suspended their strike action at the end of January 2017. The situation then returned to normal. However, on 12 May 2017, military protests resumed after a television announcement that the soldiers had renounced their demand for further payouts from the government.
If you’re staying longer in Côte d’Ivoire you should regularly review personal security arrangements and seek professional security advice. You should keep a stock of food and water.
Crime
There’s a risk of crime in Abidjan, including violent crime, car-jackings, armed break-ins to private residences, hold-ups in the street, and theft from cars. These incidents aren’t common, but they do occur. If possible, avoid using public transport, shared taxis, or walking around after dark. On bridges to and from the Le Plateau areas of Abidjan pedestrians have been attacked and robbed even during the day. Avoid displaying your wallet; for instance, have money to hand to tip supermarket trolley attendants. In vehicles, keep doors locked, windows shut and valuables out of sight. Attacks by armed robbers have occurred on the main road between Yamoussoukro and Korogho. Attacks have been reported in the west of the country, during daylight hours as well as night.
Local travel
The FCO advise against all but essential travel to within 20km of the border with Liberia owing to the risk of serious violence by local militias. Fatal clashes between militias and the security forces have taken place in this area as recently as December 2015. Seek professional local advice before embarking on any travel to these areas. Take care if you intend to travel to any rural areas.
Roadblocks and checkpoints
You might still occasionally encounter checkpoints in and around Abidjan. You might also find official and unofficial roadblocks and checkpoints on the major routes outside of Abidjan. Take care and co-operate with those operating them.
Road travel
Driving standards and road conditions in Côte d’Ivoire are poor, although they are improving in Abidjan where the road infrastructure is being upgraded. Avoid driving outside towns and cities at night as roads andvehicles can be poorly lit, and unlit broken-down vehicles can block the road. You should be alert to the risk of stray livestock that could cause a safety hazard. Grass or leaves strewn on the carriageway often means an accident or other hazard in the road ahead. During the rainy season roads, especially those that are minor and unpaved, may become impassable.
Take care when using public transport; driving standards and vehicle maintenance are poor. Unskilled drivers, poorly maintained vehicles and overloaded vehicles and inadequate lighting make driving conditions hazardous. Taxis are available in main cities, but are likely to be in bad mechanical condition. There’s an online taxi booking service operated in Abidjan by Africab, whose service is becoming increasingly popular. Wear a seat belt at all times.
Floods
The rainy season in Côte d’Ivoire is generally from May to November. Torrential rains can cause floods, landslides and large potholes. Monitor local weather reports and expect difficulties when travelling to affected areas during this season. The Our Africa website has more details.
Air travel
The European Commission has published a list of air carriers that are subject to an operating ban or restrictions within the European Union. You should check the list to see whether this will affect your travel.
You should monitor changes to travel restrictions and make sure that you have adequate and flexible travel arrangements in place for your onward journey from Côte d’Ivoire.
Swimming
Ocean currents are very strong along the coast. There’s no lifeboat service and many drownings occur each year.
