International travel
On 21 July 2020, the Government of Jordan announced that it was preparing to open up Queen Alia International Airport to scheduled commercial flights from a list of select countries. This list is still under review but when the new Visit Jordan website becomes live in the near future, full details will be published.
Until then, commercial flights in and out of Jordan are suspended and all land and sea borders are closed. The Government of Jordan has confirmed that these measures will remain in place until 18 August, and there are strong indications that the flight suspension and border closures will continue beyond this date. Some commercial operators have been able, in exceptional cases, to negotiate flights out of Jordan. You should check any flight options directly with airlines or a reputable travel company.
This travel advice will be updated when flights become available. Sign up for travel advice email alerts and monitor British Embassyâ€™s social media channels on Twitter and on Facebook.
