Cases of coronavirus (COVID-19) have been confirmed in New Zealand. The New Zealand authorities have introduced a number of measures to limit the spread of the virus.
Entry and borders
Most foreign travellers can no longer enter New Zealand.
The New Zealand border is currently closed to almost all travellers to help stop the spread of coronavirus (COVID-19). New Zealand citizens and residents returning to New Zealand may travel to New Zealand and do not need any formal exemption. There are a small number of additional, limited exceptions to the ban on travelling to and entering New Zealand. The following people should seek approval from Immigration New Zealand (INZ) using the limited exceptions process:
Partners, dependent children (aged 24 years and under) and legal guardians of New Zealand citizens and residents who are travelling together on the same flight to New Zealand with the New Zealand citizen or resident family member.
Australian citizens and permanent resident who normally live in New Zealand.
People with one of the following critical purposes in New Zealand:
Essential health workers
Other essential workers who are specifically agreed to by the New Zealand Government
Samoan and Tongan citizens making essential travel
New Zealand-based partners and dependent children (aged 19 years and under) of a work or student visa holder who is in New Zealand
Critical humanitarian travel.
Full details on current border closures and exceptions and be found on the INZ website. The website includes information on how to submit a request for travel to New Zealand. A request for approval to travel to New Zealand can take up to two days to process.
On 9 April 2020, the Government announced that anyone entering the country will be required to undergo quarantine or managed isolation in an approved facility for a minimum of 14 days. You should visit the New Zealand Ministry of Health website for more information.
You should contact your insurance company and airline for the latest travel information, and contact i-SITE if accommodation is needed.
Transit via New Zealand
There is a general suspension on transit through New Zealand. However, on 9 April 2020, the UK and New Zealand governments agreed a reciprocal transit arrangement. This permits British citizens and residents to transit through New Zealand airports within a 10-hour window. Conditions apply.
There are limits to which countries passengers can transit through after leaving New Zealand in order to reach their final destination. These are countries with which the New Zealand government has received a written undertaking that transits are permitted. This includes the United States of America, Canada, the United Kingdom, Switzerland, and Chile. The New Zealand government is working on establishing similar arrangements with other major transit hubs.
Given the current general suspension on transit through New Zealand, some travellers may find when checking in at point of departure that there is an initial ‘denial of boarding’. Should this happen, the check-in staff will be instructed to contact New Zealand Border Authorities. British nationals, so long as there is no other reason why boarding should be denied, will see this initial denial overridden and check-in should be able to be completed.
Visas
Holders of a work, student, or visitor visa with an expiry date of 1 April 2020 or earlier and who are unable to leave New Zealand must apply online for a new visa. An interim visa will be issued.
Holders of a work, student, visitor, limited or interim visa with an expiry date of 2 April to 9 July 2020 inclusive who are in New Zealand on 2 April 2020 will have their visas automatically extended to 25 September 2020. Confirmation of extensions will be emailed to all visa holders.
Given the fast changing situation, you should check the latest entry requirements for your destination on the New Zealand Immigration website or check with your airline before you travel.
Local measures
On 21 March 2020, the New Zealand Government introduced a four-level national COVID-19 alert response. The previous level was COVID-19 Alert Level 2 – “Reduce Contact”. New Zealand moved to COVID-19 Alert Level 4 – “Eliminate” (highest level) at 2359 local time on 25 March 2020 for an initial four week period:
Level 4 response measures instruct people to stay at home, and sees educational facilities close, travel severely restricted, and businesses close except for essential services (e.g. supermarkets, pharmacies, clinics) and lifeline utilities.
Full details on the New Zealand Government’s COVID-19 national response alert system can be found on the New Zealand Government COVID-19 website.
Follow the advice of New Zealand authorities. Be ready to comply with isolation and testing or quarantine requirements.
On 25 March Prime Minister Ardern declared a State of National Emergency to fight COVID-19. The declaration allows the Director Civil Defence Emergency Management to direct and coordinate personnel, material, and other resources, and provides access to other extra-ordinary powers that will support delivery of an effective and timely response to COVID-19.
The Cook Islands
On 16 March 2020, the Cook Islands introduced a requirement for any national wishing to enter the Cook Islands to self-isolate for 14 days in New Zealand prior to travel to the Cook Islands. The measure is currently due to remain in place until 18 April 2020.
There have been no confirmed cases of coronavirus (COVID-19) in the Cook Islands, Tokalau, or Niue.
