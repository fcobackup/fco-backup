Most visits to Uzbekistan are trouble free.
On 6 November 2019, it was reported that 17 people were killed in an armed attack on a Tajik security check-point on the Uzbek/Tajik border. The Tajik Government has said that Daesh/ISIS was responsible. Tashkent remains calm, and there is no additional police presence on the streets or at checkpoints. You should exercise caution and vigilance, particularly if travelling near or across the Uzbek/Tajik border. See Local travel and Terrorism
From 1 February 2019, if you have a British Citizen passport you can enter Uzbekistan as a visitor for stays of up to 30 days without a visa. Clarification of which categories of visitors may travel under the new visa waiver scheme is still pending. If you’re travelling on a different type of British passport, are travelling for a purpose other than tourism or business, or intending to stay longer than 30 days, you should check entry requirements with the Embassy of the Republic of Uzbekistan in London.
