Past incidents involving explosive devices have killed and injured a number of individuals. These explosions occurred in public places, although there has not been a successful attack in a number of years. The most high profile and recent of these include:
On November 10 2017, an oil pipeline exploded in the village of Buri, with no reported casualties.
On October 27 2017, Shia militants detonated an IED along a major highway targeting an MOI police bus killing one officer and injuring eight others.
Terrorists continue to issue statements threatening to carry out attacks in the Gulf region. These include references to attacks on western interests, including residential compounds, military, oil, transport and aviation interests as well as crowded places, including restaurants, hotels, beaches, shopping centres and mosques. You should maintain a high level of security awareness and vigilance, including around significant high profile occasions and events, particularly in such public places and report anything suspicious to the local authorities.
There is a heightened threat of terrorist attack globally against UK interests and British nationals, from groups or individuals motivated by the conflict in Iraq and Syria. You should be vigilant at this time.
