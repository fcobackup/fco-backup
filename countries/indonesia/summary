The Foreign and Commonwealth Office (FCO) is advising British nationals against all non-essential international travel at this time. Existing advice for Indonesia remains in place:
The FCO advise against all travel to:
within 4 km of the Mount Agung crater in east Bali
within 7 km of the Mount Sinabung crater in Kalo Regency, North Sumatra
These are exclusion zones put in place by the local authorities due to ongoing volcanic activity. If you’re in either exclusion zone, you should leave immediately. See Mount Agung and Mount Sinabung
There are currently limited commercial options available to return to the UK from Jakarta and all commercial options to return from Bali require transit through Jakarta. Public health measures by the Indonesian authorities include a ban on most in-country air travel until 1 June (with some exceptions – which may extend to domestic flights made by foreign nationals as part of a journey home). This has increased commercial pressures on international airlines still serving Indonesia, which is already reducing options for travellers. See Return to the UK
On 31 March 2020, the Indonesian authorities announced a series of new measures in response to the COVID-19 pandemic. Large-scale social restrictions (PSBB) in Jakarta are being eased in stages. For guidance on how to stay safely in Indonesia as a visitor if you are unable to return to the UK, see Staying during coronavirus
Other measures include the suspension of the visa exemption scheme for visitors from the UK (and other countries) and an entry and transit ban for those who have visited the UK in the last 14 days. See Entry requirements
Since 19 March, some staff and all dependents in the British Embassy have been withdrawn from Indonesia. Core staff remain to continue critical work, including consular assistance.
Around 390,000 British nationals visit Indonesia every year.
Violent protests have taken place in Manokwari, West Papua Province and in Jayapura and Wamena, Papua Province during August and September 2019. You should monitor local media, follow the advice of local authorities, and avoid large gatherings in public areas, including demonstrations and political rallies, as they could become violent with little notice. See Papua and West Papua
There were nationwide protests in Indonesia by students against new draft legislation on 24 September 2019. These have the potential to reoccur. You should avoid large gatherings in public areas, including demonstrations and political rallies, as they could become violent with little notice. See Political situation
Terrorists are very likely to try to carry out attacks in Indonesia. Terrorist groups continue to plan attacks and have the capacity and intent to carry out these attacks at anytime and anywhere in the country. Types of attacks have included suicide bombing and small-arms fire, targeting public and crowded places. Be vigilant and take care. There is a heightened risk during holiday periods, including those with a religious focus. You should exercise extra caution at these times. See Terrorism
You should exercise caution when travelling to Aceh, Central Sulawesi Province (especially Palu, Poso and Tentena), Maluku Province (especially Ambon), Papua and West Papua Province due to potential for violence or violent conflict. See Local travel
Forest fires continue to burn in Indonesia’s forest and peatlands, mostly on Sumatra and Borneo, generating widespread haze that can affect air quality. You should monitor air quality during your visit and follow medical advice where appropriate. See Health
There are many active volcanoes in Indonesia, any of which can erupt with little or no warning. This often results in the evacuation of villages within a 3 to 7 km radius and disruption to air travel in the wider region. In the past, repeated eruptions have caused destruction and fatalities. Check media reports before travelling to areas that are prone to volcanic activity. The local alert level may change at short notice. Take extra care and follow the advice of local authorities, including respecting any exclusion zones. See Natural disasters
A number of areas across Indonesia, including in Central Sulawesi, Lombok and the Sunda Strait, are continuing to recover from the impact of earthquakes and/or tsunamis in 2018. If you’re travelling to affected areas, you should exercise caution, particularly around damaged buildings and the most affected areas. See Earthquakes and tsunamis
UK health authorities have classified Indonesia as having a risk of Zika virus transmission. For more information and advice visit the National Travel Health Network and Centre website for travel to Indonesia - including Bali, for travel to Indonesia - Borneo.
