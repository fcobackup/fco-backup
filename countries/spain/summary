Spain declared a State of Emergency (“Estado de Alarma”) on 14 March, which introduces a series of measures including significant restrictions on movement throughout the country in response to the coronavirus outbreak. We expect the Spanish government to order that hotels and short-stay accommodation (such as short-stay campsites or caravan parks) must close in the coming days. We do not expect these measures to apply to long-term accommodation. British travellers who are currently in Spain and who wish to return to the UK are advised to make travel plans to do so as soon as possible. For more information, see Health

You can find more information about the action you can take if you have suffered a personal injury on the Citizens Advice website. You should only consider pursuing a complaint or claim if you have genuinely suffered from injury or illness. If you make a false or fraudulent claim, you may face legal proceedings in the UK or Spain.
