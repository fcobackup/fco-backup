The FCDO advises against all but essential travel to:
the whole of Lesotho based on the current assessment of COVID-19 risks.
Travel to Lesotho is subject to entry restrictions
Lesotho has returned to ‘Purple Stage’ (Sporadic Cases) in its COVID-19 Regulations. All categories of travellers, including tourists, are still permitted to enter provided they present a negative COVID-19 PCR test certificate from a test completed within 72 hours of arrival or departure.
Students and business travellers who cross the border daily may do so for 14 days from the date of their negative COVID-19 test.
Lesotho residents are permitted to travel to South Africa and return within 7 days of their COVID-19 test without requiring a new test.
See Entry requirements for more information before you plan to travel.
Visiting Lesotho requires entry to South Africa. See our Travel Advice for South Africa for further information.

There is often an increase in criminal activity, especially property crimes, leading up to the holiday season. Take extra care and be vigilant during this period. See Crime
Although there is no recent history of terrorism in Lesotho, attacks can’t be ruled out. See Terrorism
