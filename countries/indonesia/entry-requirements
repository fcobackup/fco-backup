Arriving in Indonesia if you’re fully vaccinated
If you have received a full course of COVID-19 vaccination (at least 2 doses), you can enter Indonesia as follows:
Those intending to purchase a “visa on arrival” should:
install the Peduli Lindungi mobile application
show proof of a full course of vaccination (travellers under 18 years old or those who cannot be vaccinated for health reasons are exempt)
show proof of full health insurance from an insurance company which is incorporated as a legal entity in Indonesia. Coverage should include COVID-19 treatment.
undergo a temperature check upon arrival and, if showing COVID-19 symptoms and / or a temperature above 37.5 degrees, a RT-PCR test. If you test positive, you may be taken to a hospital for treatment or an isolation centre at your own expense. If negative, fully vaccinated travellers can continue their journey
Travellers who have received a full course of COVID-19 vaccination and a booster do not need to have antigen/PCR test to travel domestically. Travellers who have not received any booster vaccination may need to show negative antigen/PCR test to travel domestically. Contact your airlines for further details.
Proof of vaccination status
You must present proof of vaccination status to enter Indonesia and/or to travel domestically within Indonesia.
You can use the UK COVID Pass to demonstrate your vaccination record when entering Indonesia. You may need to present both soft and hard copies of your NHS vaccination certificates at various stages of your journey. Your NHS appointment card from vaccination centres is not designed to be used as proof of vaccination and should not be used to demonstrate your vaccine status.
The British Embassy understand that hard copies of NHS certificates suffice for most purposes (with check in staff and Immigration staff at the Indonesian border as well as entry to facilities in Indonesia).
Vaccine verification
Please note, the Indonesian Government recognises UK NHS Vaccine certification and verification of your certificates for use on the Peduli Lindungi app is the responsibility of the Government of Indonesia (usually the Ministry of Health authorities on arrival at your port of entry).
Arriving in Indonesia if you’re not fully vaccinated
If you’re not fully vaccinated, you will:
need to take a RT-PCR upon arrival
be vaccinated at the entry point (only for KITAS/KITAP holder and diplomats. Children aged 6 - 17 years old may be required to complete vaccinations by local authorities)
partially vaccinated or non-vaccinated travellers will be required to self-quarantine for 5 x 24 hours, with a second RT-PCR before release from isolation
See information on getting a test before entry.
If you’ve had COVID-19 in the past year
If you have had COVID-19 and recovered within 30 days prior to departure, you are exempt from the requirement to show proof of vaccination and negative RT-PCR prior to departure. However, you will be required to take a RT-PCR test upon arrival and show the recovery certificate from a hospital in your country of origin
Indonesia’s Directorate General of Immigration (DGI) is no longer automatically extending expired visas or stay permits under COVID-19 emergency arrangements. In country KITAS application is no longer available.
KITAS Extension – offshore application
KITAS holders with expiring stay permit but currently outside Indonesia can apply for an extension through a sponsor. The sponsor must submit the application to the immigration office attaching a copy of the passport and proof of leaving Indonesia. The application is submitted without biometric sampling. The sponsor must report the foreigner’s arrival within 30 days.
Children and young people
Children aged 12 to 17 follow the same rules as fully or partly vaccinated travellers. Partially vaccinated or unvaccinated 6-17 year olds may be required to complete vaccinations by local authorities. Children aged 5 and under are not required to be vaccinated.
If you’re transiting through Indonesia
Transiting is when you pass through one country on the way to your final destination.
Transiting through Indonesia is permitted for travellers who remain airside. Passengers will need to receive approval from the port health authority before continuing their journey. They should have evidence of their vaccination status, PCR test results and onward flight details ready for inspection
If you are transiting through Indonesia on your way to another country and will be passing through immigration (sometimes known as a layover), for example to stay in a hotel for a flight the next day, you will need to follow the requirements for a visitor.
Exemptions
All passengers must be in possession of a health certificate confirming a negative COVID-19 PCR test (swab test) result and proof of vaccination status.
Exemptions to these rules may apply for:
Travellers below 18 years of age if they produce proof of policy from their home country
Foreign nationals who cannot be vaccinated due to their medical condition. They must produce a certificate from a medical professional to confirm this.
Diplomatic/Service Visa holder for the purposes of a Ministerial/Official visit
Active flight or ship crew
Check your passport and travel documents before you travel
If you are visiting or are a resident in Indonesia, your passport should be valid for 6 months from the date you arrive.
Check with your travel provider or the nearest Indonesian Embassy or Consulate to make sure your passport and other travel documents meet their requirements.
Health certificate
All visitors need to present vaccine proof if available at check-in ahead of any scheduled travel in order to enter Indonesia without the need for self isolation and PCR testing at your own expense on arrival. You should comply with any additional screening measures put in place by the authorities.
More information is available regarding coronavirus in Indonesia via the Ministry of Health.

Full details of the travel restrictions for foreign visitors are available in English on Twitter via DitJen Imigrasi (@ditjen_imigrasi). For more information, see the announcement on the Indonesian Embassy website.
Visa scams
Beware of visa scams by fraudulent visa agents who, having taken your money, may fail to provide a visa or supply the wrong kind. This could result in your overstaying and a fine of IDR 1million/day, detention, deportation and possible re-entry ban. You should use the Indonesian Immigration self-service portal.
Visa scams are on the rise in Indonesia. The British Embassy is aware of numerous foreign nationals in Bali who have been the victim of visa scams at this time. Many have lost significant sums of money, some have been deported despite paying large fees to their agent to secure the correct visa or extension to stay.
If you wish to use to use an agent, do thorough due diligence and check for reviews and recommendations.
Dual nationality
Indonesian law doesn’t allow dual nationality for adults over 18 years of age. If you’re a British national who has retained Indonesian nationality, you may experience immigration difficulties in Indonesia.
UK Emergency Travel Documents
UK Emergency Travel Documents (ETDs) are accepted for airside transit and exit from Indonesia. If you’re entering Indonesia using an ETD you must apply for a visit visa before travelling. You won’t be able to get a visa on arrival. The processing time for an Indonesian visa can vary depending on where you apply. Some Indonesian embassies do not issue Indonesian visas in ETDs. Contact your nearest Indonesian Embassy to check before you apply.
Entry requirements may differ if you live in Indonesia. Contact your nearest Indonesian Embassy to confirm whether you need to apply for a visit visa before you travel to Indonesia using an ETD.
If you apply for an ETD whilst in Indonesia, you may need to get an exit permit from Immigration to leave the country. We will advise you to contact the nearest Immigration office to check before travelling.
Proof of onward travel
Immigration officials in Indonesia may ask you for proof of onward travel (such as a return or onward air ticket). You should make all reservations before leaving for Indonesia. Some airlines have refused to board passengers without evidence of onward travel.
Departure and airport tax
Airport tax is included in the cost your ticket for all domestic flights within Indonesia. For some international flights departing Indonesia, airport tax may not be included in the price of the ticket. You should check with your airline or travel agent before you travel.
Overstaying your visa
Overstaying without the proper authority is a serious matter and visitors can be held in detention or refused permission to leave the country until a fine of Rp 1 million per day is paid. After overstaying for 60 days, you will be detained and possibly imprisoned.
Registering
If you stay in private accommodation in Indonesia (not a hotel) you must register your presence with the local police or you could face a fine of Rp 5 million. If you stay in a hotel you will be registered automatically.
Travelling with medication
If you bring any prescription medication into Indonesia, make sure you have a copy of the prescription with you. The prescription must cover the quantity of medication you bring. Be aware that some prescription or other medication available in the UK, including some psychotropic medicines, may be illegal in Indonesia. If you’re unsure, speak to your doctor and the Indonesian Embassy for advice before you travel.
