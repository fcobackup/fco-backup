The level of consular assistance the British Embassy can provide to travellers in Afghanistan is extremely limited. The British Embassy is not able to accept registrations from British nationals travelling in Afghanistan or monitor their safety when they are in country. Staff from the British Embassy may be unable to travel to certain parts of the country due to the security situation; this may severely limit the consular assistance that can be offered.
Hotels and guesthouses used by foreign nationals and the government of Afghanistan are subject to regular threats. The British Embassy doesn’t allow official visitors to stay in hotels overnight and has placed restaurants and other venues off limits to staff. Make sure your accommodation is secure and review your security measures regularly.
Terrorists are very likely to try to carry out attacks in Afghanistan. Specific methods of attack are evolving and increasing in sophistication.
on 20 January 2018, a complex attack on the Intercontinental Hotel in Kabul resulted in the deaths of around 20 people.
on 27 January 2018, an explosion occurred at the Afghan National Defence and Security Forces (ANDSF) checkpoint near the old Ministry of Interior building in Kabul.
You should follow the instructions of local authorities. There is a high threat of kidnapping throughout the country. Travel by road throughout the country, but particularly outside the capital Kabul, is extremely dangerous. Seek professional security advice for all travel and consider using armoured vehicles. See Terrorism
Take out comprehensive travel and medical insurance before you travel. Make sure your policy covers you for travel in Afghanistan, noting any requirements for security and armoured vehicles. It may be difficult to get insurance.
Afghanistan is in a major earthquake zone and remains at risk from powerful earthquakes, aftershocks, landslides and flooding. The British Embassy can provide limited consular assistance in Afghanistan, particularly outside the capital Kabul. See Natural Disasters
You can contact the emergency services by calling 119 (police and ambulance) and 112 (fire).
