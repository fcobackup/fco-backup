The FCDO advises against all but essential travel to the whole of Cyprus based on the current assessment of COVID-19 risks.
Travel is subject to entry restrictions

The UK entered the Amber category on 29 April. Visitors from ‘Amber’ category countries are required to undergo a PCR test within 72 hours prior to departure and provide proof of a negative result.
Legal residents of Cyprus, Cypriot ID holders and their family members can enter Cyprus without a PCR test result, but will be tested on arrival and subject to self-isolation until a negative result is obtained.
See Entry requirements for more information before you plan to travel.

You can find more information about the action you can take if you have suffered a personal injury on the Citizens Advice website. You should only consider pursuing a complaint or claim if you have genuinely suffered from injury or illness; if you make a false or fraudulent claim, you may face legal proceedings in the UK or Cyprus.
If you need to contact the emergency services call 112.
If you’re abroad and you need emergency help from the UK government, contact the nearest British embassy, consulate or high commission.
