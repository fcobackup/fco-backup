Travel to Tunisia is subject to entry restrictions
On 16 November, the Tunisian government changed the measures in place to limit the risk of travellers spreading COVID-19 on arrival in Tunisia. The rules you should follow are no longer determined by your nationality or the country from which you are travelling. Instead, there is one set of measures that applies to all people arriving in Tunisia. This is subject to change at short notice. You should check the latest rules with your airline or travel provider before travelling.
You must take a PCR test less than 72 hours before travel and show evidence of the negative test result, with the date of the test clearly labelled, at your point of departure for Tunisia. Children under 12 years old are exempt from this requirement
You must complete this Tunisian government short online questionnaire before travelling
You must download and use the Tunisian government’s ‘track and trace’ application on your mobile phone
On arrival, you must self-isolate at your place of residence, a government-approved hotel or quarantine centre for 14 days at your own expense
If you wish to pay for a second PCR test after 7 days, and this comes back negative, you will be permitted to leave quarantine early
If your visit to Tunisia is for a maximum of 5 days, you are exempt from quarantine, although a evidence of negative PCR test upon arrival remains compulsory
The authorities may assess your private accommodation to check whether it is suitable for quarantine. If they deem it unacceptable, you will be required to isolate at a hotel or quarantine centre at your own expense. No further details have been shared.
See Entry requirements for more information before you plan to travel.
Preparing for your return journey to the UK
If you’re returning to the UK from overseas, you will need to:

On 28 October the Tunisian authorities introduced new COVID-19 measures due to the detection of infection clusters. These measures include a national curfew and travel restrictions. If you’re planning travel to Tunisia, find out what you need to know about coronavirus in the Coronavirus section.
During the COVID-19 pandemic, it is more important than ever to get travel insurance and check it provides sufficient cover. See the FCDO’s guidance on foreign travel insurance.
A state of emergency is in effect in Tunisia, imposed after a suicide attack on a police bus on 24 November 2015. It has been extended a number of times, most recently on 30 May 2020.
Since the terrorist attack in Sousse in June 2015, which targeted tourists, the UK government has been working closely with the Tunisian authorities to investigate the attack and the wider threat from terrorist groups. The Tunisian government has improved protective security in major cities and tourist resorts.
Terrorists are still very likely to try to carry out further attacks in Tunisia, including against UK and Western interests. Security forces remain on a high state of alert in Tunis and other places. You should be vigilant at all times, including around religious sites and festivals. Crowded areas, government installations, transportation networks, businesses with Western interests, and areas where foreign nationals and tourists are known to gather may be at higher risk of attack. You should be particularly vigilant in these areas and follow any specific advice of the local security authorities. In more remote areas of the country, including tourist sites in southern Tunisia, security forces’ response times to an incident may vary. Follow the advice of the Tunisian security authorities and your travel company if you have one. See Terrorism
Demonstrations often occur in Tunisia and the majority are peaceful. However, you should avoid all areas of demonstrations, and exercise caution if in the vicinity of any large gatherings or protests. Localised disruption, such as road blockages, are likely in the vicinity of protests and may occur with little to no warning. See Political situation
You can contact the emergency services by calling 197 (police - when in cities and towns), 193 (national guard - when in rural areas or small villages), 190 (ambulance) or 198 (civil protection - for assistance at incidents, such as car accidents, to provide medical assistance and response to fire).
If you’re abroad and you need emergency help from the UK government, contact the nearest British embassy, consulate or high commission. Consular support may be limited in parts of Tunisia.
