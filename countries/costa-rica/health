Before you travel check that: 
your destination can provide the healthcare you may need 
you have appropriate travel insurance for local treatment or unexpected medical evacuation 
This is particularly important if you have a health condition or are pregnant.
Emergency medical number 
Call 911 and ask for an ambulance. 
Contact your insurance company quickly if you’re referred to a medical facility for treatment.
Vaccine recommendations and health risks

Medication 
Prescriptions from the UK cannot be used locally. To find a pharmacy (‘farmacia’) look for one of the big national chains such as Farmacia Fischel, Farmacia Sucre, FarmaValue, Farmacia Saba, or Farmacia Santa Lucia, among others; a quick search online should help you to identify the nearest one open.
