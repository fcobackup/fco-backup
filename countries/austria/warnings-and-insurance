Flooding in Western and Southern Austria
Heavy rain in Western and Southern Austria has led to mudslides and road closures in the Vorarlberg, Tyrol, Salzburg und Oberk√§rnten regions. There is an increased risk of flooding in affected regions. Check local conditions before you travel, including roads and hiking trails, and follow the instructions of local officials.
