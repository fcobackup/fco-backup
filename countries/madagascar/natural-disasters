The cyclone season in Madagascar normally runs from November to April. Tropical Cyclone Belna is forecast to make landfall on the north-west coast of Madagascar on 9 December 2019. As well as very strong winds, significant rainfall is anticipated which may lead to flash floods and an increased landslide risk. You should monitor the progress of approaching storms on the METEO Madagascar website, check routes before travelling and follow the advice of local authorities.
See our Tropical cyclones page for advice about what to do if youâ€™re caught up in a storm.
Coastal areas are particularly affected by cyclones more generally, and remote areas throughout the country can become inaccessible and suffer damage and contamination to water supplies. You should monitor local and international weather updates from the World Meteorological Organisation (WMO), Meteo Madagascar (French) or FB Cyclone Indien Ocean (French, Malagasy).
