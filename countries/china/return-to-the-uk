A large number of airlines, including British Airways and Virgin Atlantic, have suspended flights to and from mainland China.
Chinese authorities are asking airlines to further reduce international flights from 29 March. Each domestic airline may only operate one route to any specific country, with no more than one flight per week. International airlines may only maintain one route to China, operating one flight per week. This will severely restrict options to return to the UK.
You will need to pay for your return travel to the UK. If departure options are available but you cannot afford the travel costs and have exhausted all other options for getting funds, you may be eligible to apply for an emergency loan from the government. This is a last resort option and you would need to repay the loan when you are back in the UK. For more information, you should contact Corporate Travel Management (CTM). CTM are a commercial partner of the FCO and are authorised to administer such loans on behalf of the FCO.
