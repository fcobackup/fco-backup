You must have a valid British passport and the GHIC to apply for a certificate of entitlement from the Montenegrin Health Insurance Fund, to access free or subsidised medical care at state run medical facilities. You must apply for a certificate in advance or as soon as possible after an urgent admission to hospital.

If you do not have a certificate, you will have to pay for the treatment and paid bills cannot be reimbursed.
