The Foreign and Commonwealth Office (FCO) advise against all but essential travel to the Gili Islands (Gili Trawangan, Gili Meno and Gili Air), off the north-west coast of Lombok. Following the 6.9 magnitude earthquake in the region on 5 August, there is a risk of aftershocks, which could cause further damage to buildings and pose risks to safety. In the event of serious injury, access to immediate medical assistance on the islands is extremely limited.
A series of earthquakes to the north east of the island of Lombok on 29 July and 5 August 2018 resulted in casualties and extensive damage to buildings and infrastructure in the Gili Islands and northern and western areas of Lombok, north of Senggigi. There have also been some isolated reports of minor damage to buildings in parts of Bali. Ngurah Rai airport (Denpasar) and the major tourist resorts in southern Bali are operating as normal.
If you’re in an affected area, you should exercise caution, monitor local media, liaise with your travel company, hotel or guesthouse and follow the advice of the local authorities. Where possible, keep your family and friends up to date with your situation. If you need consular assistance (for example, if your passport has been lost or if you’re injured), call the British Consulate in Bali on (+62) (21) 2356 5200.
If you’re planning to travel to Lombok, you should keep your travel plans under close review, seek the advice of your transport and accommodation providers before travelling, and ensure that you have contingency plans and travel insurance in place.
You should be mindful of the risk of aftershocks affecting the region in the coming days and weeks. Buildings could have been weakened by the earthquake, especially in areas of northern Lombok and the Gili Islands closest to the epicentre, and may be more structurally vulnerable to the ground shaking during aftershocks. Consider the safety of your accommodation, your potential exit routes and any other hazards in the vicinity. Take extra care when in or around potentially damaged buildings and be aware of the possibility of falling debris that could cause injury. More information and advice on safety considerations in an active earthquake zone is available from the International Rescue Corps.
Following the 5 August earthquake, the Indonesian authorities assisted residents and visitors who wished to leave the Gili Islands via boat. These services have now concluded and transport options from the Gili Islands may now be limited. If you have remained on the islands and now wish to leave, contact the local Tourist Police on the islands for up-to-date information on departure options. Lombok airport remains open and operational.
The Foreign and Commonwealth Office (FCO) advise against all travel within 4 kilometres of the Mount Agung crater in east Bali and within 7 kilometres of the Mount Sinabung crater in Kalo Regency, North Sumatra due to ongoing volcanic activity. These are exclusion zones put in place by the local authorities. If you’re in either exclusion zone, you should leave immediately.
On 28 June 2018 Mount Agung in east Bali erupted, emitting gas and ash which resulted in the closure of Bali’s I Gusti Ngurah Rai Airport and a number of nearby regional airports for a period of time on 29 June 2018, causing flights to be cancelled and delayed. The alert level for Mount Agung remains at level 3 and there is a 4 kilometre exclusion zone around the crater. Travellers to Bali may find this information for travel during the volcanic activity useful.
On 11 May 2018, Mount Merapi, near Yogyakarta in central Java, erupted. The Indonesian authorities have set a 3km exclusion zone around the volcano. If you’re in the area, you should monitor local media, exercise caution and follow the advice of local authorities.
There are many active volcanoes in Indonesia, any of which can erupt with little or no warning. This often results in the evacuation of villages within a 3 to 7 kilometre radius and disruption to air travel in the wider region. In the past, repeated eruptions have caused destruction and fatalities. Check media reports before travelling to areas that are prone to volcanic activity. The local alert level may change at short notice. Take extra care and follow the advice of local authorities, including respecting any exclusion zones. See Natural disasters

Terrorist groups continue to plan attacks and have the capacity and intent to carry out these attacks at anytime and anywhere in the country.
