Warning
FCDO advises against all but essential travel to parts of Thailand.

Before you travel check that:
your destination can provide the healthcare you may need
you have appropriate travel insurance for local treatment or unexpected medical evacuation
This is particularly important if you have a health condition or are pregnant.
Emergency medical number
Dial 191 and ask for an ambulance.
Local number: 1669
Contact your insurance or medical assistance company quickly if you’re referred to a medical facility for treatment.
Vaccine recommendations and health risks
At least 8 weeks before your trip:
check the latest information on vaccinations and health risks in TravelHealthPro’s Thailand guide
see where to get vaccines and whether you have to pay on the NHS travel vaccinations page
See what health risks you’ll face in Thailand, including: 
Zika virus
malaria and dengue
Altitude sickness is a risk in parts of Thailand. Read more about altitude sickness on TravelHealthPro. 
Air quality
There can be high levels of air pollution in large cities. This includes Bangkok and Chiang Mai, which are also affected by seasonal regional smoke haze caused by farmers burning trees and crops. The high pollution and particulate count sometimes reach dangerous levels. This may worsen bronchial, sinus or asthma conditions.
Check air quality levels for many cities on the World Air Quality Index website.
Medication
The legal status and regulation of some medicines prescribed or bought in the UK can be different in other countries.
Hospitals and pharmacies across Thailand will usually accept UK prescriptions. Brand-name medication can often be more expensive than locally produced medication.
Medication sold on the street may not be genuine or may have been stolen. Taking medication without medical advice or a prescription can have serious health consequences.
Read best practice when travelling with medicines on TravelHealthPro.
Healthcare in Thailand
FCDO has a list of medical facilities in Thailand where some staff will speak English.
All hospitals require a guarantee of payment before treating patients. Make sure you have adequate health insurance.
Private hospitals in Thailand are of a high standard but can be expensive. Public hospitals and clinics do not always meet UK standards, particularly outside Bangkok.
Travel and mental health
Read FCDO guidance on travel and mental health. There is also mental health guidance on TravelHealthPro.
