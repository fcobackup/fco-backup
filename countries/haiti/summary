The Foreign and Commonwealth Office (FCO) advise against all but essential travel to Haiti due to the volatile security situation. If you are in Haiti, you should consider carefully whether you need to remain, and keep your departure options under close review.
The FCO strongly encourage non-resident British nationals in Haiti to consider leaving quickly to avoid difficulties they may face in getting home due to travel restrictions imposed by the Haitian Government in response to the Coronavirus (COVID-19) pandemic. Cases of Coronavirus (COVID-19) have been confirmed in Haiti. The Haitian authorities have introduced a number of measures to limit the spread of the virus. See Health
There have been sporadic, unpredictable and sometimes violent demonstrations, protests and roadblocks in Port au Prince and throughout Haiti since July 2018, with a notable increase in civil unrest in the weeks since 2 September 2019. The movement of goods and people into and within the country is often disrupted due to blocked roads and security incidents. As a consequence, there are sometimes fuel and food shortages. There are currently no UK diplomats in country, although the Embassy remains open.
On 19 March Haiti announced the closure of all their land, sea and air borders to travellers. Quarantine restrictions of 14 days have been introduced for travellers from affected countries.
On 19 March the Haitian President announced a national state of emergency and detailed further measures aimed at tackling the spread of COVID-19. We strongly advise all British Citizens in Haiti to follow the regulations set out by the President of Haiti in full. Key measures include:
A curfew between 2000 and 0500 effective from Friday 20 March;
Citizens to stay at home and limit their movements to essential movements only;
Schools, universities and factories and places of worship to close;
A ban on all events/meetings of more than 10 people
Consular support is not available from the British Embassy in Haiti. If you are in Haiti and need help, you should contact the British Embassy in Santo Domingo, Dominican Republic. Our ability to offer consular support in Haiti from Santo Domingo is limited. In the event of fuel shortages and/or a deterioration in the political or security situation, it may be affected even further.
If you’re in Haiti or due to undertake essential travel, you should remain vigilant and informed at all times, keep movements to a minimum and regularly review your departure options. Avoid all demonstrations and large public gatherings, monitor local media, follow the advice of local authorities and keep up to date with this travel advice.
