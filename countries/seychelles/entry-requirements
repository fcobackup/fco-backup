This information is for people travelling on a full ‘British citizen’ passport from the UK. It is based on the UK government’s understanding of Seychelles’ current rules for the most common types of travel.
The authorities in Seychelles set and enforce entry rules. If you’re not sure how these requirements apply to you, contact the Seychelles High Commission in the UK.
COVID-19 rules
There are no COVID-19 testing or vaccination requirements for travellers entering Seychelles.
Passport validity requirements
If you’re visiting Seychelles, your passport must be valid for the duration of your stay.     
Check with your travel provider that your passport and other travel documents meet requirements. Renew your passport if you need to.
You will be denied entry if you do not have a valid travel document or try to use a passport that has been reported lost or stolen.
Visa requirements
You do not need a visa to visit Seychelles, but you must get a travel authorisation before you travel.
When you arrive, you’ll get a visitor’s permit for 3 months. You can apply for 3-month extensions, up to a maximum period of 12 months in total, if you meet visitor permit extension requirements. You can apply to extend any time before your current visitor’s permit expires.
The visitor’s permit is free for the first 3 months, but there is a fee for each 3-month extension.
Applying for a travel authorisation
You must apply and pay for a travel authorisation online to enter Seychelles. You can apply up to 10 days before you arrive. In an emergency, you can pay an extra fee for an express application.
When you apply, you will need to show you meet Seychelles entry requirements. These include having:
a valid return or onward ticket
proof of confirmed accommodation
sufficient funds for the duration of your stay
Checks at border control  
When you arrive, you may need to show proof you have travel insurance and are covered for any potential health costs.
Vaccine requirements
You must have a certificate to prove you’ve had a yellow fever vaccination if you’re coming from a country listed as a transmission risk. 
For full details about medical entry requirements and recommended vaccinations, see TravelHealthPro’s Seychelles guide.     
Customs rules
There are strict rules about goods you can take into or out of Seychelles. You must declare anything that may be prohibited or subject to tax or duty.
Taking money into Seychelles
If you are taking cash with a value of 50,000 Seychellois rupees or more into Seychelles, declare this when you apply for your travel authorisation.
