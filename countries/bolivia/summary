40,106 British nationals visited Bolivia in 2017. Most visits are trouble free.
The current political situation in Bolivia is highly unpredictable, with increased risk to traveller safety. Following presidential elections on 20 October 2019, there have been large and wide-scale political demonstrations across the country, including La Paz, Santa Cruz, Potosi, Sucre, Oruro and Cochabamba, many resulting in violence. Further demonstrations and strikes are planned and there is a risk that these will turn violent without warning. You should avoid large crowds or public demonstrations and don’t attempt to cross blockades.
All travel within and between major cities is being intermittently blocked by protestors and major roads have been closed. Transport options will be extremely limited and journey times may take a lot longer than planned. You should regularly check the viability of any existing travel plans around the country, seeking local advice as needed. There may be long queues at land borders and disruption to flights is likely to be encountered at airports. El Alto airport in La Paz is especially likely to experience high levels of disruption. Strikes and blockades may result in intermittent availability of food, fuel, prescription medicine and other goods in some areas.
If you need urgent consular assistance, contact the British Embassy La Paz on (591 2) 2433424. The British Embassy’s ability to travel to deliver consular services is very limited at this time.
