This page has information on travelling to Zambia..
This page reflects the UK government’s understanding of current rules for people travelling on a full ‘British Citizen’ passport from the UK, for the most common types of travel.
The authorities in Zambia set and enforce entry rules. If you’re unsure how Zambia’s entry requirements apply to you, contact its UK embassy, high commission or consulate.
All travellers
Travellers to Zambia are encouraged to be fully vaccinated but this is not mandatory.
Regardless of vaccination status, you are required to complete a health declaration form and undergo thermo-scanning. If you enter Zambia with a body temperature equal to, or above 38.0 C you will be tested for COVID-19 at your expense on arrival and be required to quarantine (at your home, a hotel or government facility) until your test results are known.
All travellers entering Zambia are required to adhere to the prescribed COVID-19 public health measures, summed up in the “Five Golden Rules” as follows:
i) Masking up consistently and correctly in public premises; ii) Frequently washing hands with soap and water or use of alcohol based hand sanitiser; iii) Keeping physical distancing of not less than 1 metre; iv) Avoiding crowded places; v) Seeking medical attention early if feeling unwell.
You will need a tourist or business visa to enter or travel through Zambia as a visitor as well as valid return air tickets (if arriving by air) and sufficient funds for your stay.
See Visas for more information.
If you’re fully vaccinated
If you are fully vaccinated, you can enter Zambia without providing any form of negative COVID 19 PCR test. Fully vaccinated means complete doses of a vaccine e.g. first and second dose of a two-dose COVID-19 vaccine.
Proof of vaccination status
You must present proof that you have been vaccinated to qualify as fully vaccinated. Accepted evidence of proof has not been specified. The UK COVID Pass is expected to be accepted but you are advised to take a paper copy.
If you’re not fully vaccinated
If you are not fully vaccinated, you’ll need to show proof of a negative SARS-CoV-2 PCR test. Zambian Government guidelines state tests should be taken within 72 hours before departure from the country of origin. Some airlines ask passengers for evidence of a negative PCR test taken within 72 hours prior to arrival in Zambia. You should check your airline’s guidelines carefully when arranging your tests.
You should not use the NHS testing service to get a test in order to facilitate your travel to another country. You should arrange to take a private test. See information on getting a test before entry.
You should upload your negative PCR test certificate online before travel.
If you’ve had COVID-19 in the past year
Entry requirements for Zambia are the same for all travellers, regardless of whether you have tested positive for COVID-19 in the past year.
Children and young people
Children aged 11 and under are exempt from the requirement to provide a PCR COVID-19 test or proof of vaccination
If you’re transiting through Zambia
Transiting is when you pass through one country on the way to your final destination.
If you are travelling to a destination that requires a negative COVID-19 certificate, on departure from Zambia you will be expected to present evidence of a negative SARS-CoV-2 PCR test certificate from a certified Ministry of Health COVID-19 testing laboratory. Travellers should upload their negative PCR test certificate to https://globalhaven.org/. Holders of tests taken outside Zambia are not exempt from this requirement, even if their test was taken within the previous 72 hours.
Exemptions
There are no exemptions to Zambia’s entry requirements.
Check your passport and travel documents before you travel
Passport validity
If you are visiting Zambia, your passport should be valid for a minimum of 6 months from the date you arrive and have at least 2 blank pages.
Check with your travel provider to make sure your passport and other travel documents meet their requirements.
Zambia recognizes dual nationality. However to avoid delays you should leave Zambia on the same passport you used to enter.
Visas
A visa is required to enter Zambia. British nationals visiting Zambia for less than 90 days do not need a visa in advance, and can obtain a visa on arrival. Effective from 1 November 2022, the Government of Zambia removed all visa fees for British passport holders visiting Zambia. British nationals travelling for tourism are permitted to stay in Zambia for a total of 90 days per calendar year.
British nationals travelling to Zambia for business are entitled to a free thirty-day visa. Business visas may be obtained by presenting a letter of invitation from the sponsoring organization. Business visas can be obtained at ports of entry, or in advance through Zambian Embassies and High Commissions or e-Visa.
Business visitors intending to stay longer than thirty days must apply for a temporary employment permit at Zambia immigration offices. This will allow them to reside, enter and re-enter Zambia for the validity of the permit.
For further information about entry requirements contact the Zambian High Commission in London at info@zambiahc.org.uk or visit Zambia Department of Immigration.

The KAZA UNVISA is valid for travel between Zambia and Zimbabwe and day-trips to Botswana through the Kazungula border. It’s available at the international airports in Lusaka and Livingstone and at the land borders at Livingstone (Zimbabwe border) and Kazungula (Botswana border). You can also apply online.
