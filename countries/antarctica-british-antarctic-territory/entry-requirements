This information is for people travelling on a full ‘British citizen’ passport from the UK. It is based on the UK government’s understanding of Antarctica’s/British Antarctic Territory’s current rules for the most common types of travel. 
Passport validity requirements 
Check with your travel provider that your passport and other travel documents meet requirements. Renew your passport if you need to. 
You will be denied entry if you do not have a valid travel document or try to use a passport that has been reported lost or stolen. 
Permits 
Anyone on a British expedition to Antarctica or taking a British vessel or aircraft into Antarctica must apply for a permit from the Polar Regions Department of the Foreign, Commonwealth & Development Office (FCDO). 
For passengers on an organised visit to Antarctica, the tour operator usually arranges a permit. If you are concerned, talk to your operator. 
If you travel to any part of Antarctica without permission, you could get a fine or a prison sentence. 
Vaccine requirements  
For details about medical entry requirements and recommended vaccinations, see TravelHealthPro’s Antarctica guide.
