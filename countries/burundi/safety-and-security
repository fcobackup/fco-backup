Crime
There’s a substantial risk of crime. Muggings at gun and knifepoint, bag snatching, pick-pocketing, burglary, car break-ins, and armed car hijackings have all been reported. Avoid walking in the streets or using public transport after dark, even in Bujumbura city centre, and don’t carry large amounts of money. Take care when withdrawing or exchanging cash, and avoid doing so at night.
Stay at hotels that have good security. Safeguard valuables and cash. Use hotel safes, where possible. Keep copies of important documents, including your passport and visa, separately. Be wary of who you plan to meet and where, and inform colleagues or family members of your plans.
Local travel
The security situation across Burundi remains changeable.
There have been armed incursions from eastern DRC into neighbouring border areas of Burundi. You should make contact with your destination before you set off and make sure that you allow enough time to complete your journey during daylight hours.
The FCDO continues to advise against all travel to the following areas and roads for security reasons:
Cibitoke and Bubanza provinces
areas of Bujumbura Rural province west of the Rusizi river towards the Democratic Republic of Congo border, with the exception of the Rusizi Delta Nature Reserve
the road north of Bujumbura airport towards Cibitoke
the main road running west from Kayanza through the Kibira National Park
The FCDO advises against all but essential travel to:
Ruvubu National Park
Rusizi Delta Nature Reserve
Bujumbura rural
the RN2 road from Bujumbura to rural Gitega
Road travel
Public transport vehicles are banned from crossing the border with Rwanda and there are restrictions on Burundian food products being exported into Rwanda.
Burundi is currently suffering from severe fuel shortages across the country. You shouldn’t take accessibility of fuel for travel in the country for granted. Where fuel is available, there can often be long queues.
You can drive in Burundi on a full UK driving licence for the first 6 months after you arrive. You’ll then need to get a Burundi driving licence. There are only a small number of tarmac roads and these are sometimes in poor condition. Driving standards are poor and there are frequent serious accidents. Keep car doors locked and windows closed when driving. Access in to and out of Bujumbura city is controlled by police at night. Avoid travelling by road outside Bujumbura after dark. This is due to the security situation and road safety concerns.
Road blocks and document checks are common, and not always official. Carry a copy of your passport and visa, but you may be need to produce the originals. Reports of attempted robberies at fake checkpoints have increased.
Avoid travelling on collective and public transport (buses and motorbike taxis), due to poor vehicle maintenance and low driving standards.
Road infrastructure is poor and roads are frequently blocked or damaged by landslides, especially after heavy rain. Landslides have destroyed road bridges, making some routes impassable. Check local advice on road conditions when planning travel by road and have a contingency plan in case your preferred route is blocked.
Air travel
Commercial flights to Burundi are now operating at a reduced capacity. Please check with carriers for more information. See Coronavirus.
A number of carriers normally fly in and out of Burundi including: Rwandair, Ethiopian Airlines, Kenyan Airways and Brussels Airlines.
The EU has published a list of air carriers that are subject to an operating ban or restrictions within the EU.
Burundian rebels claimed a series of mortar attacks on Bujumbura International Airport (BJM) on 18 September 2021. Travellers should be aware that the security situation can change without warning and should follow the instructions of local authorities.
Political situation
There have been violent attacks, including on opposition supporters. There are reports that arbitrary arrests, detentions and disappearances of Burundians, most often from civil society, independent media and pockets of society perceived to be anti-government, continue. The police have used live ammunition and tear gas against demonstrators.
Grenade attacks are common in Burundi, and can be politically motivated.
In September 2021, there was a suspected mortar attack against Bujumbura’s International Airport (the Melchior Ndadaye International Airport). Also in September there was a grenade attack at a bus parking area near the Bujumbura’s old central market, and a grenade attack in the city of Gitega. Previously there have been grenade attacks on buses and a bus station in Bujumbura. There was also a grenade attack in a café in Muramvya, capital of Muramvya Province, in May 2021, and an attack on vehicles on the main highway (National Route 2) linking Bujumbura to Gitega, in June.
You should avoid all large gatherings, remain vigilant at all times and follow the instructions of local authorities given security and health risks.
Consular assistance
The British Embassy Office in Bujumbura can offer limited consular assistance to British Nationals in Burundi. The British High Commission in Kigali, Rwanda, can provide additional consular support to British nationals in Burundi.
