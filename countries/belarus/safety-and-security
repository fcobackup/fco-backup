FCDO advises against all travel to Belarus.
Read this guidance alongside FCDO’s overall travel advice and warnings for Belarus.
Terrorism
There is no recent history of terrorism in Belarus, but attacks cannot be ruled out.
There is a high threat of terrorist attack globally affecting UK interests and British nationals, including from groups and individuals who view the UK and British nationals as targets. You should remain vigilant at all times. UK Counter Terrorism Policing has information and advice on staying safe abroad and what to do in the event of a terrorist attack. Find out how to reduce your risk from terrorism while abroad
Attacks could happen anywhere and could affect western interests and places visited by foreigners.
Political situation
Demonstrations and protests are possible and could become confrontational, with security forces likely to use force to disperse and detain demonstrators. Belarusian authorities launched a violent crackdown against demonstrators across Belarus after the 2020 presidential elections and is currently a repressive environment. You should:
stay vigilant
avoid crowds
if protests break out, leave the area immediately
There is often a heightened security forces presence on the streets of Minsk and other major cities. Security forces (some may be in plain clothes) might carry out a stop and search or ask for identification documents. Make sure you carry your passport or a photocopy of the photo page of your passport, and visa if you have one.
Russian military operations
The Belarusian authorities are facilitating Russia’s war against Ukraine. Russian military operations are taking place inside Belarus. The situation is unpredictable and could escalate without warning. This has increased the risk of conflict within Belarusian borders. If conflict takes place, FCDO’s ability to offer consular assistance may be limited. Events in Ukraine are fast-moving.
There is high risk of military activity in places where there are Russian and Belarusian military personnel and equipment, including:
Yelsk
Mazyr
Rechitsa
Luninets
Gomel
Asipovichy
Baranovichi
Brest
Avoid restricted areas reserved for military exercises or operations. Do not take photographs of security forces’ activity (including police and military), and establishments or sites of strategic importance, including government buildings and critical infrastructure. This is illegal. There may not be warning signs in locations where prohibitions are in place. If in doubt, leave potentially restricted areas immediately.
Monitor local media, sign up to get email notifications when this advice is updated, and read our advice on how to deal with a crisis overseas.
Crime
There is little crime in Belarus, but be alert to the possibility of street crime and theft from vehicles or hotel rooms.
Border crossings
There may be long queues at borders. Customs and immigration can be lengthy and bureaucratic. Ignore any private facilitators who offer to help you pass through checkpoints.
You must be able to produce original vehicle ownership documents at border crossings. If you’re not the owner, you will need a letter of ‘power of attorney’. You must have car insurance. There is more information about insurance requirements on the State Border Committee website.
Do not overstay or break the temporary import terms and conditions for your vehicle. If you do, your vehicle could be confiscated at the border or at an in-country police checkpoint.
Polish border
The situation close to the Polish border is unpredictable. Border crossings may close or implement restrictions at short notice. You should check this before any travel across the border.
Lithuania border
In August 2023, Lithuanian authorities closed two border crossing points with Belarus. Several others remain open. Further border crossings may close or implement restrictions at short notice. Check before you travel across the border, the latest information on the Belarus-Lithuania border can be found on Lithuanian Ministry of the Interior website.
Transport risks in Belarus
Road travel
If you are planning to drive in Belarus, see information on driving abroad and read the RAC guidance.
You need car insurance to drive in Belarus. There is more information about insurance requirements on the State Border Committee website.
Driving regulations
Drivers with foreign licence plates must pay a fee to use toll rods or face a fine. For more information, see the BelToll website.
For information on speed limits, including rules for visiting motorists, see the RAC guidance on driving in Belarus.
There is a zero-tolerance policy towards drink driving. Depending on the situation, penalties can include fines or imprisonment.
There are police checkpoints on routes throughout the country. Stop when instructed and have vehicle documentation available.
Driving standards
The quality of driving in Belarus is unpredictable. A-class highways are in good condition. The condition of B-class roads varies. Some are impassable for periods in winter. Road works and potholes are usually poorly marked.
See the RAC guide on driving in Belarus.
Air travel
There are no direct flights between Belarus and the UK.
Since mid-2021 all Belarusian airlines have been banned from flying into the UK. The EU has closed its airspace to Belarusian registered aircraft and has sanctioned Belavia the Belarusian state owned carrier.
The UK has sanctioned the Belarusian air traffic control operator.  Due to international restrictions on Belavia, they may not have access to components which are needed for the safe maintenance of their aircraft.
HMG staff do not use Belavia.
The UK has placed sanctions on some Russian airlines, including Aeroflot, Rossiya Airlines and Ural. It is illegal for any British national or company in the UK to do business with these airlines, including buying airline tickets.
Rail travel
There are frequent standard security checks at some stations on the Minsk Metro. Transport police may ask to scan your bags. You must comply with this. You could be arrested if you refuse.
Pedestrians
You could be fined for jaywalking.
Chernobyl site
There’s an exclusion zone immediately around the Chernobyl site. This includes the area close to the border with Ukraine in the south east of Belarus. Access to this part of the country is limited. The risk of radioactive contamination from the Chernobyl site is insignificant elsewhere.
Laws and cultural differences
Drugs
There are severe penalties for drug-related crime. These include prison sentences of up to 5 years for drug possession and up to 25 years for more serious drug-related offences.
LGBT+ travellers
Homosexual relationships are legal in Belarus. However, Belarus is still a conservative society and the LGBT+ scene is very low profile. Very few LGBT+ people are open about their sexuality. Read more advice for LGBT travellers.
Photography
Avoid taking photographs of all government buildings, military installations and uniformed officials. You will be asked to delete photos and there may be other penalties.
Importing goods for charitable purposes
If you want to import goods or services for charitable purposes, consult the Embassy of Belarus in the UK for advice about local procedures and tariffs. If you think your goods will be exempt from Belarusian taxation, get written confirmation from the Embassy of Belarus in the UK.
Surrogacy
FCDO advises against all travel to Belarus. Because of potential security challenges linked to Russia’s war with Ukraine, we advise against commissioning new surrogacy arrangements in Belarus.
If you are a British national with current surrogacy arrangements in Belarus, contact FCDO on 01908 516 666 if you have not already done so.
If you already have surrogacy arrangements in place:
You may wish to ask your surrogacy agency about the safest location where all parties to the surrogacy arrangement can stay. The FCDO cannot facilitate evacuation.
In many cases, Belarusian law requires that the surrogate is married. This could affect British nationality for a child born under such a surrogacy arrangement. You should seek specialist UK legal advice about nationality determinations, Parental Orders and what you need for travel documents.
Seek in-country legal advice. This is important for issues like legalising UK documents, notarising Belarusian documents, document processing and the maximum period of stay the authorities will allow. Due to the security challenges, FCDO cannot confirm which lawyers are currently offering services. The surrogacy process in Belarus can be lengthy and complicated.
If you are considering changing your surrogacy arrangements, or making a new arrangement in another country, read the guidance for intended parents planning for international surrogacy.
Money
Using foreign credit and debit cards
There are plenty of ATMs in major cities. However, there are currently problems withdrawing cash using foreign credit and debit cards. Almost all major banks in Belarus do not accept foreign-issued cards. Those banks that do may charge a higher commission.
There is also limited cash available. Many ATMs have limits on the amount of cash you can withdraw, particularly for foreign cards. Not all cards will be accepted in Belarus. Many reputable international money transfer providers have suspended operations in Belarus. Consider having cash in US dollars or euros if you decide to visit Belarus.
Sanctions
The UK government has imposed sanctions against a range of Belarusian companies and individuals. These may impact on financial transactions.
Exchanging currency
It can be difficult to exchange British pounds for Belarusian roubles. US dollars and Euros are more widely accepted. You may be asked to present your passport at a foreign currency exchange. Use government-licensed booths to exchange currency. You can find these in or near major stores, hotels and banks. If you exchange money elsewhere, you could be fined or arrested and the currency will be confiscated. You cannot exchange Belarusian roubles into other currencies outside Belarus.
Bank services
If you’re travelling to Belarus, speak to your UK bank before you go. Because of sanctions against Belarus, your bank may block your card if you use it in Belarus. Many banks have suspended their services in Belarus, so please check with your provider.
