This advice reflects the UK government’s understanding of current rules for people travelling on a full ‘British citizen’ passport from the UK, for the most common types of travel.
The authorities in Finland set and enforce entry rules. If you’re not sure how these requirements apply to you, contact the Embassy of Finland in London.
COVID-19 rules
There are no COVID-19 testing or vaccination requirements for travellers entering Finland.
Passport validity requirements
To travel to Finland, you must follow the Schengen area passport requirements.
To enter Finland (and all Schengen countries) your passport must:
have a ‘date of issue’ less than 10 years before the date you arrive. Passports issued after 1 October 2018 are now valid for only 10 years, but for passports issued before 1 October 2018, extra months may have been added if you renewed a passport early
have an ‘expiry date’ at least 3 months after the day you plan to leave
Contact the Embassy of Finland in London if your passport does not meet both these requirements.
Check with your travel provider that your passport and other travel documents meet requirements. Renew your passport if you need to.
You will be denied entry if you do not have a valid travel document or try to use a passport that has been reported lost or stolen.
Make sure you get your passport stamped
If you’re a visitor, your passport must be stamped when you enter or leave the Schengen area (which includes Finland).
Border guards will use passport stamps to check you haven’t overstayed the 90-day visa-free limit for stays in the Schengen area. If your passport was not stamped, border guards will presume you have overstayed the visa-free limit.
If your passport was not stamped, show evidence of when and where you entered or left the Schengen area (for example, boarding passes or tickets) and ask the border guards to add the date and location in your passport.
Read about passport stamping if you live in Finland for passport stamping information.
At Finnish border control, you may also need to:
show proof of your accommodation, for example, a hotel booking confirmation or proof of address for a second home
show a return or onward ticket
prove that you have enough money for your stay – the amount varies depending on your accommodation
Visa requirements
You can travel to countries in the Schengen area (including Finland) for up to 90 days in any 180-day period without a visa. This applies if you travel:
as a tourist
to visit family or friends
to attend business meetings, cultural or sports events
for short-term studies or training
If you’re travelling to Finland and other Schengen countries without a visa, make sure your whole visit is within the 90-day limit. Visits to Schengen countries within the previous 180 days before you travel count towards your 90 days.
To stay longer (for example, to work, study or for business), you must meet the Finnish government’s entry requirements. Check which type of visa or work permit you need with the Embassy of Finland in London.
Travelling with children
Minors can enter Finland with an adult who is not their legal guardian (such as a grandparent). You should carry a letter of consent from their parents or legal guardians.
Travelling from Russia
All border crossing points on the land border between Finland and Russia will be closed from 15 December until 14 January. British Nationals should monitor Finnish Border Guard website for details of border closures with Russia.
For more information on leaving Russia, see our Russia Travel Advice.
Vaccination requirements
At least 8 weeks before your trip, check the vaccinations and certificates you need in TravelHealthPro’s Finland guide.
Customs rules
There are strict rules about goods that can be brought into and taken out of Finland. You must declare anything that may be prohibited or subject to tax or duty.
Taking food and drink into the EU
You cannot take meat, milk or products containing them into EU countries. There are some exceptions for medical reasons, for example certain amounts of powdered infant milk, infant food, or pet food. Check the rules about taking food and drink into the EU on the European Commission website.
Restrictions on Russian vehicles
There are restrictions on vehicles with Russian licence plates in Finland. See Finland’s Ministry of Foreign Affairs for more information.
Taking money into Finland
If you have over 10,000 euros or the same amount in other currencies, you must declare this to Finnish Customs. See guidance on declaring cash from the Finnish government.
