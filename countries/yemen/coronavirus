Returning to the UK
When you return, you must follow the rules for entering the UK.
You are responsible for organising your own COVID-19 test, in line with UK government testing requirements.
Be prepared for your plans to change
No travel is risk-free during COVID. Countries may further restrict travel or bring in new rules at short notice, for example due to a new COVID-19 variant. Check with your travel company or airline for any transport changes which may delay your journey home.
If you test positive for COVID-19, you may need to stay where you are until you test negative. You may also need to seek treatment there.
Plan ahead and make sure you:
can access money
understand what your insurance will cover
can make arrangements to extend your stay and be away for longer than planned
Travel in Yemen
Authorities across Yemen have introduced a range of measures. These include curfews, movement restrictions, closures of businesses and limitations on public and private gatherings. Implementation may vary and restrictions can change at short notice.
Some areas have designated quarantine camps. These can vary in both quality and access to medical provision.
Healthcare in Yemen
Medical facilities, particularly away from the main towns, are poor. There are four testing facilities in Mukalla, Sana’a, Aden and Taiz.
