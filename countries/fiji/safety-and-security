Crime
The level of serious crime is generally low, but petty theft is fairly common. Be particularly careful with personal possessions and travel documents in cities and other popular tourist destinations. Use a hotel safe where possible and avoid carrying everything in one bag. Ensure copies of important documents e.g. passports are kept in a safe place. Don’t leave your belongings unattended. Be alert when you are withdrawing money from cash machines. There have been reports of thefts from motor vehicles in Suva. Windows should be kept up and doors locked when driving.
Take particular care when walking at night in cities and towns and when visiting isolated areas. Women travelling alone should take extra care. There have been cases of serious sexual assaults against foreign nationals in Fiji, including against British women. See our advice for women travelling abroad.
Water-based activities
There are dangerous rip tides along reefs and river estuaries. Always comply with warning signs, especially red flags, and only swim from approved beaches. If you plan to go out to the reefs or engage in any water activities, you should satisfy yourself that the company you are using has the most up-to-date equipment, including all of the necessary safety features and that they - and you - are fully licensed and insured.
There’s only one hyperbaric (decompression) chamber in Fiji, located at the Colonial War Memorial Hospital in Suva, and it is not always operational. Visitors should check on its status before diving and consider amending their dive depth accordingly. You should make sure you have travel and health insurance that includes coverage for diving and evacuation costs.
Follow local advice if jellyfish are present.
Road travel
Many roads in Fiji are in a poor condition and can be dangerous. A lack of street lighting and the presence of pedestrians and stray animals on the road makes travel particularly hazardous after dark. Where possible, you should therefore avoid road travel outside of urban areas at night. When driving, you must keep your driving licence with you at all times. Vehicle safety regulations are rarely enforced and traffic violations can occur. Severe weather can lead to roads becoming damaged, blocked or washed away. Seek local advice before you set out.
Taxis are of variable quality. Only use licensed taxis; they have a yellow registration plate.
Not all minibuses are licensed by the Land Transport Authority (LTA). As with taxis, those with yellow number plates have been approved by the LTA. Unlicensed minibuses will probably not be insured.
Sea travel
Before boarding inter-island or other vessels, check the operators’ credentials and safety equipment in advance and ensure your travel insurance policy covers your planned activities. Do not travel on any overloaded vessels.
Political situation
The security situation in Fiji is stable. Fiji has experienced periods of political instability in the past and visitors are advised to avoid demonstrations, street rallies and areas of military activity.
Mobile phones
The mobile phone network generally works well in cities and large towns but coverage in some rural areas and outlying islands can be limited or non-existent. You can use your UK mobile phone in Fiji if global roaming has been activated, but making and receiving calls can be expensive. Many UK mobile phones will not work in Fiji as your mobile phone provider may not have an international roaming agreement with Fiji’s mobile phone providers, Vodafone and Digicel. Many visitors prefer to buy a Fiji SIM card on arrival. These are relatively cheap to buy and calls, both local and international are cheaper than using a UK SIM card. Fijian SIM cards are available at Nadi International Airport and at convenience stores and supermarkets. Registration of a SIM card purchased locally is mandatory.
