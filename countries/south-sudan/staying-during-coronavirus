This page gives you guidance on how to stay safely in South Sudan as a visitor, if you are unable to return to the UK.
Everyone should comply with the measures put in place in South Sudan to limit the spread of coronavirus (COVID-19).
Moving around in South Sudan
An official government curfew is in force across South Sudan from 10pm to 6am. Some shops, restaurants and businesses are open but subject to strict social distancing, which is observed in a rather haphazard way. There are also restrictions on public transport, inter-state movements and public gatherings.
Keep up-to-date with information from your tour operator, transport or accommodation provider on the impact on any existing travel plans. If you need further information about entry requirements, see Entry requirements or contact the nearest South Sudan embassy. You should also check with your airline or travel company for the latest information.
Health
