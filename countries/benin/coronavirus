Travel in Benin
Travel within the country should be limited to essential travel only. Capacity on public transport is limited to 50%.
Public places and services
Gatherings of over 50 people are prohibited. Restrictions on bars, restaurants and entertainment spots have been lifted.
Visits to public institutions, including government buildings, have been limited. Additional measures include the requirement to wear face masks in public spaces and a systematic sanctioning of those people found to have breached restriction and confinement measures imposed on them.
Schools and other educational establishments have been reopened.
Healthcare in Benin
Unlike in the UK, you will need to go to a pharmacy to obtain most over-the-counter medicines. Pharmacies are widely available and are usually identified by a green cross. They will accept prescriptions from the UK although the specific prescribed brand will most probably be replaced by a generic or other brand equivalent. Benin has not yet forced a total lockdown and in the event that this occurs, pharmacies will remain open.
