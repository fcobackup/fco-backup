The information on this page covers the most common types of travel and reflects the UK government’s understanding of the rules currently in place. Unless otherwise stated, this information is for travellers using a full ‘British Citizen’ passport.
The authorities in the country or territory you’re travelling to are responsible for setting and enforcing the rules for entry. If you’re unclear about any aspect of the entry requirements, or you need further reassurance, you’ll need to contact the Embassy, High Commission or Consulate of the country or territory you’re travelling to.
You should also consider checking with your transport provider or travel company to make sure your passport and other travel documents meet their requirements.
Entry rules in response to coronavirus (COVID-19)
Entry to Singapore
Only Singapore Citizens and Permanent Residents can enter Singapore without prior permission. Employment Pass, S-Pass and Work Permit holders, foreign domestic workers, Dependent Pass, Long-Term Visit Pass and Student Pass holders and their dependents can enter Singapore if they are fully vaccinated and have applied for [retry permission] (https://safetravel.ica.gov.sg./) from the Singapore government before travelling. Visitors are not able to enter Singapore without prior permission from the Singapore government.
If you have been in the UK or another ‘high risk’ country up to 21 days prior to entry you will be quarantined in a government facility for 14 days upon arrival. Arrivals from a small number of countries may serve no quarantine, or a shorter period of quarantine, or be able to quarantine at home. These requirements are subject to change at short notice. See the Singapore Government website for more information.
See further information, including which countries are considered high risk, from the Immigration and Checkpoints Authority.
You should not use the NHS testing service to get a test in order to facilitate your travel to another country. You should arrange to take a private test.
Once you have permission to enter Singapore you must submit an online health declaration in advance of your arrival. Otherwise, it will need to be completed upon entry and may result in delays to immigration clearance. If you’re allowed to enter, you must have travel insurance of at least S$30,000 covering Covid-19 hospitalisation and treatment.
Travellers are advised to check the Singapore Ministry of Health’s (MOH) website and the Immigration and Checkpoint Authority (ICA) and its Safe Travel pages before travelling.
All work pass holders must comply with all Singapore government regulations or face their passes being revoked and/or fines/jail.
Quarantine requirements
Everyone granted permission to enter Singapore will be tested for COVID-19 upon arrival and arrivals from most destinations will be issued with a ‘Stay at Home Notice’ (SHN) for 14 days. For arrivals from the UK and from most destinations the SHNs must be served at a government designated hotel. The cost must be met by the traveller. Children or vulnerable people are usually allowed to serve their SHN with an appropriate carer.
A limited number of countries have been designated as ‘low-risk’ and will be issued with a shorter SHN, or no SHN. Arrivals from these countries may be also be permitted to carry out quarantine at their residence, if applicable. Full details of exemptions including testing requirements and quarantine information can be found on the Singapore Immigration and Checkpoints Authority (ICA) ‘Arrival in Singapore’ and ‘SafeTravel’ webpages. You should check these websites for updates and review SHN details before travelling.
Everyone aged over 12 who is in home quarantine will need by law to wear an electronic tag for the duration of their quarantine period. The tags are about the size of a watch and are worn on the wrist.
In addition to quarantine fees, all arrivals must pay for a COVID-19 test which will be conducted before the SHN quarantine period ends. While you’re serving quarantine you will not be allowed to leave your room/place of residence. Smoking may not be allowed in government allocated quarantine facilities. The quarantine period cannot be reduced, even if you wish to leave Singapore. Failure to comply carries a fine and a jail term of up to six months. More details can be found on the Singapore government website.
Specific schemes exist for essential business travel to Singapore from certain countries. To use these schemes your travel must be sponsored by your employer. Schemes also exist for long-term pass holders to facilitate limited travel between Malaysia and Singapore.
Transiting Singapore
Singapore’s Changi Airport allows transit of passengers only in certain circumstances. Check with your airline before undertaking a journey via Singapore. You should also familiarise yourself with new transit procedures for Changi Airport before travelling.

Travelling while pregnant
Women who are more than six months pregnant no longer need to get permission before travelling, but the final decision on the length of stay permitted rests with the immigration officer on arrival. Prior entry clearance is needed for women intending to give birth in Singapore. You can apply at the High Commission for the Republic of Singapore in London or the nearest Singapore Embassy/High Commission if you’re not in the UK.

Importing certain controlled drugs and pirated copyright material is prohibited and there are restrictions on entering with items like replica guns, radio communications equipment, and weapons and ammunition (including empty cartridge cases and air guns).
