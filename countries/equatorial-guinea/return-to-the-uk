The Equatorial Guinea authorities have announced the suspension of all international flights until further notice. All land, sea and air borders have been closed indefinitely.
Future travel options
Chartered repatriation flights may be organised by foreign governments where some places may be available for British nationals.
Information about these flights is generally only available at short notice therefore you should e-mail ConsularYaoundeEnquiries@fco.gov.uk with your full name, date of birth, passport number, address in the UK, any medical conditions, telephone number and e-mail address if you are seeking to leave Equatorial Guinea.
This travel advice will be updated when charter and commercial departure options become available.

You will need to pay for your return travel to the UK. If departure options are available but you cannot afford the travel costs and have exhausted all other options for getting funds, you may be eligible to apply for an emergency loan from the government. This is a last resort option and you would need to repay the loan when you are back in the UK.
For more information, you should contact Corporate Travel Management (CTM). CTM are a commercial partner of the FCO and are authorised to administer such loans on behalf of the FCO.
