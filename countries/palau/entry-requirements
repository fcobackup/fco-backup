The authorities in Palau set and enforce entry rules. For further information contact the embassy, high commission or consulate of the country or territory you’re travelling to. You should also consider checking with your transport provider or travel company to make sure your passport and other travel documents meet their requirements.
Entry rules in response to coronavirus (COVID-19)
Entry to Palau
The wearing of a face mask is mandatory when exiting the aeroplane in Palau.
Quarantine requirements
A 14 day compulsory quarantine is currently in place for international arrivals into Palau. During this time, you will need to undertake two separate PCR swab tests. If your tests return a negative result then at the end of the 14 days quarantine you can transfer to your residence to complete a further 7 days of self isolation, followed by a further PCR swab test.
Fully vaccinated individuals may be exempted from quarantine, subject to presentation of proof of a complete course of COVID-19 vaccination, with the final dose having been administered at least 14 days prior to departure, and a negative PCR test taken within 3 days of leaving the country of origin. Travellers who have previously contracted COVID-19 may submit proof of recent infection and a letter from a healthcare provider certifying recovery.
Travellers exempt from quarantine must ensure their vaccine has received emergency use authorisation from either the US Food and Drug Administration or the World Health Organization.
Palau authorities require that any traveller exempted from quarantine undergo two mandatory COVID-19 tests at Belau National Hospital. These tests must fall on the first and fifth day of the traveller’s stay. Quarantine-exempted travellers are also required to limit their movement around Palau until they have taken their second test.
Demonstrating your COVID-19 status
Palau has not yet confirmed that it will accept the UK’s proof of COVID-19 recovery and vaccination record. You should follow the entry rules for unvaccinated people. Your NHS appointment card from vaccination centres is not designed to be used as proof of vaccination.
