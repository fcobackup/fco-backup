This advice reflects the UK government’s understanding of current rules for people travelling on a full ‘British citizen’ passport from the UK, for the most common types of travel.
The authorities in Morocco set and enforce entry rules. If you’re not sure how these requirements apply to you, contact Morocco’s embassy in the UK.
COVID-19 rules
Countries may restrict travel or bring in rules at short notice. Check with your travel company or airline for changes.
If you test positive for COVID-19, you may need to stay where you are until you test negative. You may also need to seek treatment there.
Visit TravelHealthPro (from the UK’s National Travel Health Network and Centre) for general COVID-19 advice for travellers.
Demonstrating your COVID-19 status
Morocco accepts the UK’s proof of COVID-19 vaccination record at the border. Your NHS appointment card from vaccination centres cannot be used to demonstrate your vaccine status.
Passport validity requirements
The embassy of Morocco in the UK advise that your passport should be valid for at least 3 months on your date of entry to Morocco. If your passport does not meet this requirement, you may face difficulties and you should check with the Moroccan authorities and your travel provider before travelling.
Make sure your passport isn’t damaged. Some travellers have been refused entry when travelling on damaged passports.
Moroccan citizens who reside in the UK and travel to Morocco, may not be allowed to return to the UK unless they present evidence of their UK immigration status. This can include their UK biometric residence permit card or a valid UK entry clearance.
Visa requirements
British nationals don’t need a visa to enter Morocco for the purpose of tourism for up to 3 months. British nationals who stay longer than 3 months need to go to a local police station to request an extension.
When entering the country, make sure your passport is stamped. Some travellers have experienced difficulties leaving the country because their passport has no entry stamp.
Arriving by private boat
If you’re arriving by private boat, you must enter the country at a recognised port of entry. Entry through other ports is illegal.
Vaccination requirements (other than COVID-19)
At least 8 weeks before your trip, check the vaccinations and vaccination certificates you may need on TravelHealthPro.
Taking money into Morocco
Most major credit cards are accepted in larger towns. ATMs are widely available in cities and most main towns. There is no limit on the amount of foreign cash you can bring into the country. You won’t be able to change Scottish or Northern Irish bank notes. It’s difficult to exchange travellers’ cheques.
The Moroccan Dirham (MAD) is non-convertible. You can import or export up to a maximum of 2,000 MAD to or from Morocco.
