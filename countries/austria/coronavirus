Local measures
Extensive measures are in place throughout Austria, affecting all areas of everyday life. Restaurants, bars and cafes are closed until 15 May, hotels are closed until 29 May. Face masks are compulsory on public transport and in shops and people must keep at least a metre apart from each other in public.
Entry and borders
Anyone entering Austria from the Czech Republic, Germany, Hungary, Italy, Liechtenstein, Slovakia, Slovenia or Switzerland, or anyone who has, in the last 14 days, been in an area for which the Austrian Foreign Ministry has travel warnings in place due to COVID-19 (including the UK), must present a medical certificate with micro-biological test results in English, French, German or Italian which is no more than 4 days old.
Without this document, entry will be refused for anyone without a valid Austrian residence permit, with some exceptions (in German). Anyone with a valid Austrian residence permit can enter Austria, but without a valid medical certificate will be required to self-isolate for 14 days.
Transit
UK nationals transiting through Austria without a stopover do not require a health medical certificate, if they can prove they are transiting. Neighbouring countries are restricting movement across borders and conducting health checks. There are no direct rail connections from Austria to the Czech Republic, Italy, Slovakia, Slovenia or Switzerland. You should refer to travel advice for the country you are travelling from/to for information.
