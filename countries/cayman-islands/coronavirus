Be prepared for your plans to change
No travel is risk-free during COVID-19. Countries may further restrict travel or bring in new rules at short notice, for example due to a new COVID-19 variant. Check with your travel company or airline for any transport changes which may delay your journey home.
If you begin to feel any COVID-19 symptoms, take a lateral flow test (LFT). You should report positive LFT results through the Cayman Islands Government website. If you test positive, you will need to complete a confirmation PCR test at one of HSA’s testing centres.
If you are vaccinated and test positive for COVID-19, then you will need to isolate for no less than 7 days.
If you are unvaccinated or partially vaccinated and test positive, you are required to isolate for a period of no less than 9 days.
There is no requirement for a person to test once they have completed isolation.
Plan ahead and make sure you:
can access money
understand what your insurance will cover
can make arrangements to extend your stay and be away for longer than planned
