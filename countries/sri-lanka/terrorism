Avoid crowded public places, large gatherings and demonstrations, and follow the advice of local authorities.
UK Counter Terrorism Policing has information and advice on staying safe abroad and what to do in the event of a terrorist attack. Find out more about the global threat from terrorism.
On 21 April 2019, bombs were used to attack 3 churches and 3 hotels in Sri Lanka: in central Colombo; in the northern suburb of Colombo Kochchikade; and in Negombo roughly twenty miles north of Colombo; and in the east of the country in Batticaloa. More than 250 people were killed, including 8 British nationals.
Security has been stepped up across the island. The Sri Lankan authorities have made a number of arrests in relation to the attacks.
Thereâ€™s a heightened threat of terrorist attack globally against UK interests and British nationals, from groups or individuals motivated by the conflict in Iraq and Syria. You should be vigilant at this time.
