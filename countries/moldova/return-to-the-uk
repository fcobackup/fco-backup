As a consequence of the Moldovan government’s ban on all scheduled flights to/from Moldova, there are currently no scheduled commercial flights available to the UK. This ban will remain in place until further notice. Occasional ad hoc charter flights to UK and other European countries are being organised by the Moldovan authorities.
Once such flights are confirmed by the Moldovan government and bookings are possible, the Embassy will publicise information about them on its Facebook page and via the Twitter account of Her Majesty’s Ambassador. You should be aware that these flights can be scheduled at short notice and are subject to last minute changes. Most of these ad hoc charters have been operated by Air Moldova. As well as following the Embassy’s social media channels, mentioned above, you should consult Air Moldova for information and to make any bookings on their flights.
You will need to pay for your return travel to the UK. If departure options are available but you cannot afford the travel costs and have exhausted all other options for getting funds, you may be eligible to apply for an emergency loan from the government. This is a last resort option and you would need to repay the loan when you are back in the UK. For more information, you should contact Corporate Travel Management (CTM). CTM are a commercial partner of the FCO and are authorised to administer such loans on behalf of the FCO.
Travel via Romania
You may wish to consider travelling to the UK via Romania. However, you should be aware that the Romanian government has banned flights to several countries, including UK, until further notice. Flights to a small number of European destinations are still operating. If you plan to take a flight from Romania, or to travel overland through Romania and from there onwards to UK, you should consult our travel advice for Romania and for all other countries on your route, before setting off. To inform yourself of border crossing restrictions imposed by the Moldovan and Romanian governments, check the Moldovan Border Police website, and our travel advice for Romania.
Arrival in the UK
When you arrive back in the UK, follow the guidance for when you return to the UK on steps you should take to protect yourself and others.
