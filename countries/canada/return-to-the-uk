If you live in the UK and are currently travelling abroad, you are strongly advised to return now, where and while there are still commercial routes available. Many airlines are suspending flights and many airports are closing, preventing flights from leaving.
Only the following airports are operating international flights: Toronto Pearson (YYZ); Montreal Pierre Elliott Trudeau (YUL); Calgary International Airport (YYC); and Vancouver International Airport (YVR).
Porter Airlines has suspended all international flights. Other airlines (WestJet, Air Canada, Air Transat, British Airways) are offering limited services, and have suspended some routes.
The situation is liable to change with little or no notice. We will post significant updates on the British High Commissionâ€™s UkinCanada Twitter and Facebook accounts, but please contact airlines directly as they will have the most up to date information. You can find contact details for airlines still operating on our Facebook and Twitter page, as well as on our website.
