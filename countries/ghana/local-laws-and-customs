Ghana is a conservative and deeply religious country. Although modern and progressive attitudes also prevail, you should show respect for traditional values and morals.  
Dress modestly in public.
Wearing military clothing including camouflage is prohibited.
Don’t become involved with drugs of any kind. Penalties for drug related offences are severe. Even possession of small amounts of marijuana can lead to a prison sentence in excess of 5 years, usually after a lengthy and expensive legal process. Bail is not normally granted. Class A drugs like cocaine are likely to be laced with other substances. Foreign visitors, including British nationals, have died after taking these drugs.
Carry a photocopy of your passport with you at all times, and put the original document in a safe.
There is little tolerance towards lesbian, gay, bisexual and transgender people in Ghana and many Ghanaians don’t accept that such relationships exist. Some same-sex sexual acts are covered by a criminal code that could d lead to a custodial sentence between 3 and 25 years (there is no records that this is enforced).
Anti LGBT rhetoric/hate speech by religious leaders, government officials and local media can incite homophobia against the LGBT community. LGBT people can be victims of physical violence and psychological abuse. See our information and advice page for the LGBT community before you travel.
Photography near sensitive sites like military installations or the airport is strictly prohibited. Ask permission if you want to take a photograph of a building where there are guards on duty. Beware of self-appointed officials trying to charge fees to take pictures of well-known sites of interest.
Ghanaian family law is very different from UK law, particularly when child custody becomes an issue.
