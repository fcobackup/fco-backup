Guinea-Bissau suffers from political instability. Following the presidential elections in November and December 2019, there is now an enhanced military presence around the capital, including government buildings and the airport. You should exercise a high degree of caution should you decide to travel to Guinea-Bissau. In the event of any political unrest you should follow the advice of local authorities.
Although the security situation is currently calm, you should stay alert to local developments and avoid sensitive areas like military installations. You should also avoid any demonstrations or large public gatherings. See Political situation
UK health authorities have classified Guinea-Bissau as having a risk of Zika virus transmission. For more information and advice, visit the National Travel Health Network and Centre website.

If you’re abroad and you need emergency help from the UK government, contact the nearest British embassy, consulate or high commission.

However, the British Embassy Dakar in Senegal can provide consular support to British nationals but you should note that, due to the measures introduced by the authorities in response to Coronavirus (COVID-19), capacity is extremely limited.
