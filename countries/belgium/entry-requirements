The information on this page covers the most common types of travel and reflects the UK government’s understanding of the rules currently in place. Unless otherwise stated, this information is for travellers using a full ‘British Citizen’ passport.
The authorities in the country or territory you’re travelling to are responsible for setting and enforcing the rules for entry. If you’re unclear about any aspect of the entry requirements, or you need further reassurance, you’ll need to contact the embassy, high commission or consulate of the country or territory you’re travelling to.
You should also consider checking with your transport provider or travel company to make sure your passport and other travel documents meet their requirements.
Entry rules in response to coronavirus (COVID-19)
The Belgian Government has announced that from 1 January 2021 entry to Belgium for UK nationals resident in the UK or outside the EU will be restricted to essential travel only due to EU-wide COVID-19 restrictions. A list of permitted reasons for essential travel can be found in the ‘traveling to Belgium from a third country’ section on the website of the Belgian Immigration Office. To gain entry travellers must have an essential journey certificate issued in advance by a Belgian embassy or consulate attesting that the journey is essential. There are some very limited exceptions to this rule, e.g. for transit passengers in possession of an onward travel document and diplomats travelling on a diplomatic passport). For more information please visit the website of the Belgian Immigration Office.
These restrictions do not apply to UK nationals who are resident in Belgium. You will be allowed to re-enter the country, but may need to show proof of residence. All non-residents (including those in the exempted list above), will need to provide evidence of a negative COVID-19 PCR test upon entry. This PCR test is to be taken no more than 72 hours prior to arrival in Belgium. Transiting passengers are advised to check the Belgian guidance for requirements. Further information is available on the website of the Belgian Embassy to the UK.
All travellers from the UK, including those resident in Belgium, must complete the Belgian Passenger Locator Form before travel. Belgium residents (who do not have a negative test upon entry) will be required to take a test on arrival using a code that you will receive via SMS after submitting your PLF. Both residents and non-residents will then need to self-isolate for at least seven days on arrival (except if you are undertaking essential work listed above). Following the seven days, both residents and non-residents should take another Covid-19 test. If this test is negative, you may end your self-isolation. You should follow closely the instructions you receive via SMS after submitting your Passenger Locator Form.
If you are travelling through France, you should also check the France Travel Advice. Please note that transport services are subject to change, so please check with your transport operator before travel, including whether they will require evidence of a negative COVID-19 test before boarding.
The Belgian Government has introduced a traffic light system of high, medium and low risk regions. You should check the map on the Belgian Ministry of Foreign Affairs website (in English) for the latest information on affected regions. Check the map frequently, including both before and during your travel, as the zones are updated regularly.
Regular entry requirements
Visas
If you hold a British Citizen passport, you don’t need a visa to enter Belgium. If you’re planning a stay of longer than 3 months, see our Living in Belgium guide and contact the Belgian Embassy if you have further questions.
The rules on travel will stay the same until 31 December 2020.
Visas from 1 January 2021
The rules for travelling or working in Europe will change from 1 January 2021:
you will be able to travel to countries in the Schengen area for up to 90 days in any 180-day period without a visa as a tourist, to visit family or friends, to attend business meetings, cultural or sports events, or for short-term studies or training
if you are travelling to Belgium and other Schengen countries without a visa, make sure your whole visit is within the limit. Visits to Schengen countries within the previous 180 days before you travel would count towards the 90-day limit
To stay for longer, to work or study, for business or for other reasons, you will need to meet the entry requirements set out by Belgium. This could mean applying for a visa and/or work permit. You should check with the Belgian Embassy what type of visa and/or work permit, if any, you will need.
if you are in Belgium with a visa or permit, your stay will not count towards the 90-day limit.
The 90-day limit for visa-free travel will begin on 1 January 2021. Any days you stay in Belgium or other Schengen countries before 1 January 2021 will not count towards the 90-day limit.
At border control for Belgium, you may need to:
show a return or onward ticket
show you have enough money for your stay, and
use separate lanes from EU, EEA and Swiss citizens when queueing
Your passport may be stamped on entry and exit.
Passport validity
The rules on travel will stay the same until 31 December 2020.
Your passport should be valid for the proposed duration of your stay; you do not need any additional period of validity on your passport beyond this.
Passport validity from 1 January 2021
From 1 January 2021, you must have at least 6 months left on an adult or child passport to travel to most countries in Europe (not including Ireland).
If you renewed your current passport before the previous one expired, extra months may have been added to its expiry date. Any extra months on your passport over 10 years may not count towards the 6 months needed.
Check your passport is valid for travel before you book your trip. You will need to renew your passport before travelling if you do not have enough time left on your passport.
UK Emergency Travel Documents
UK Emergency Travel Documents (ETDs) are accepted for entry, airside transit and exit from Belgium.
