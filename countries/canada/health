Contact your insurance or medical assistance company quickly if you’re referred to a medical facility for treatment.

Healthcare in Canada
Medical treatment can be very expensive. There are no special arrangements for British visitors. 
For emergency healthcare, go to a hospital emergency room or a walk-in clinic.
If you have dual British-Canadian citizenship, you may still have to pay for medical treatment if you do not meet provincial residency requirements for healthcare. Check with the relevant province or territory health ministry for more information.
