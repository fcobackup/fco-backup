This page has information on travelling to Mozambique. Check what you must do to return to the UK.
This page reflects the UK government’s understanding of current rules for people travelling on a full ‘British Citizen’ passport from the UK, for the most common types of travel.
The authorities in Mozambique set and enforce entry rules.
All travellers
You will need a visa to enter Mozambique. If you’re a tourist or travelling for work purposes from a country where there is a Mozambican diplomatic mission, you must get the appropriate visa before travelling. Regardless of vaccination status, you must present a negative COVID-19 PCR test on arrival. The test must have been issued in the departure country, within 72 hours prior to the time of arrival, even if they hold proof of vaccination. You should not use the NHS testing service to get a test in order to facilitate your travel to another country. You should arrange to take a private test.
A negative PCR test is valid for up to 7 days for travellers using the South Africa land border.
See Visas for more information.

Allow adequate time to arrive at your destination before nightfall. This and other land borders are currently closed except to essential freight traffic.
