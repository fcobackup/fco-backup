Flights in and out of the country have been suspended, and land and sea borders are closed. The Government of Jordan has confirmed that these measures will remain in place until 4 June, and there are strong indications that the flight suspension and border closures will continue beyond this date.
Future travel options
All airports in Jordan remain closed for scheduled commercial flights. There is, however, a one-off repatriation flight to collect Jordanian nationals from Qatar that has seats available to Doha with onward connections to the UK. This Qatar Airways flight from Amman to Doha departs on Sunday 31 May 2020 at 1:30pm. Onward connections from Doha will be available to London or Manchester on Monday 1 June. These flights are operated on a commercial basis. If you wish to take this flight option, you need to book on the Qatar Airways website using the following promotional code: TRAVELHOME.
Passengers will need to make their own arrangements for transfer to Queen Alia International Airport. If stopped at checkpoints they should show their passport and flight tickets. Drivers will also require a copy of the flight tickets for the return journey. If there is a need to travel across governorates, you should seek permission to do so from the Governor’s Office of the governorate you are in. To do so you should show your flight tickets as proof of need to travel.

You will need to pay for your return travel to the UK. If departure options are available but you cannot afford the travel costs and have exhausted all other options for getting funds, you may be eligible to apply for an emergency loan from the government. This is a last resort option and you would need to repay the loan when you are back in the UK.
