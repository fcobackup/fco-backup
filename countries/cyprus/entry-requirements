The information on this page covers the most common types of travel and reflects the UK government’s understanding of the rules currently in place. Unless otherwise stated, this information is for travellers using a full ‘British Citizen’ passport.
The authorities in the country or territory you’re travelling to are responsible for setting and enforcing the rules for entry. If you’re unclear about any aspect of the entry requirements, or you need further reassurance, you’ll need to contact the embassy, high commission or consulate of the country or territory you’re travelling to.
You should also consider checking with your transport provider or travel company to make sure your passport and other travel documents meet their requirements.
Restrictions in response to coronavirus
From 9 June, tourist arrivals from a limited number of countries will be permitted, but this does not include the UK. Passengers who have been in the UK, or any other destination not listed in categories A or B, in the last 14 days will not be allowed to enter Cyprus, even via a third country (eg: Greece), until further notice. We expect this to be reviewed in the coming weeks. The exception to this is legal residents of Cyprus and Cypriot ID holders who will be permitted to enter Cyprus on presentation of proof of residence or Cypriot nationality and a negative PCR (antibody) test result (taken in the previous 72 hours). Further details are available from the Cypriot government website, where PCR test results should be uploaded in order to secure your Cyprus Flight Pass prior to travel.
British nationals currently located in category A or B countries, who have not been in the UK in the last 14 days, will be allowed to enter Cyprus. To do so, you will need to show a negative PCR test result (taken in the previous 72 hours). Further details are available from the Cypriot government website.
From 8 June, the administration in the north of Cyprus is allowing entry to ‘citizens’ and foreign nationals who hold residency, work or student permits. UK nationals that are in one of these categories and arrive before 1 July will have to go into 14 days quarantine in facilities controlled by the administration, the cost of which is payable by the individual concerned. Any UK national will be permitted entry from 1 July but will be required to present a negative PCR test result (taken in the previous 72 hours) and have to go into quarantine for 14 days in facilities controlled by the administration, the cost of which is payable by the individual concerned.
Neighbouring countries including Greece and Turkey have also introduced restrictions which may impact on travel. Check country-specific FCO Travel Advice for details.
Regular entry requirements
Passport validity
Your passport should be valid for the proposed duration of your stay; you do not need any additional period of validity on your passport beyond this. However, if you’re travelling to the north of Cyprus, their administration advises that your passport should be valid for at least 6 months from your date of entry to the north.
The rules on travel will stay the same until 31 December 2020.
Visas
If you hold a British Citizen passport, you don’t need a visa to enter Cyprus. If you’re planning a stay of longer than 3 months, see our Living in Cyprus guide and contact the Republic of Cyprus High Commission if you have further questions.
The rules on travel to and from the Republic of Cyprus, including travel to or from the north, will stay the same until 31 December 2020.
