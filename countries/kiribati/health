Before you travel check that:
your destination can provide the healthcare you may need
you have appropriate travel insurance for local treatment or unexpected medical evacuation
This is particularly important if you have a health condition or are pregnant.
Emergency medical number
Call 994 and ask for an ambulance.   
Contact your insurance company quickly if you’re referred to a medical facility for treatment.
Vaccine recommendations and health risks
At least 8 weeks before your trip:
check the latest vaccine recommendations for Kiribati
see where to get vaccines and whether you have to pay on the NHS travel vaccinations page
See what health risks you’ll face in Kiribati, including Dengue.
Drink and use only boiled or bottled water and avoid ice in drinks. Do not eat local shellfish or lagoon fish on Tarawa.  
Medication
The legal status and regulation of some medicines prescribed or bought in the UK can be different in other countries.

Healthcare in Kiribati
Medical facilities at the general hospital in Tarawa are modest. Elsewhere, nurse practitioners generally staff clinics.
Pharmaceuticals – both prescription and non-prescription medicines – are generally not available. Bring any medicines you need with you.
If you need any non-basic medical treatment, you will usually need medical evacuation from Kiribati. Make sure you have adequate travel health insurance and accessible funds to cover evacuation by air ambulance plus the cost of medical treatment abroad and repatriation.
