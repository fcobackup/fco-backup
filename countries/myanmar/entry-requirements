This page has information on travelling to Myanmar Check what you must do to return to the UK.
This page reflects the UK government’s understanding of current rules for people travelling on a full ‘British Citizen’ passport from the UK, for the most common types of travel.
The authorities in Myanmar set and enforce entry rules.
All travellers
COVID-19 rules and requirements can change at short notice. Confirmation should be sought from the relevant Myanmar Embassy or Consulate well in advance of your departure.
Insurance
Ahead of arrival to Myanmar, you will need to purchase a Travel Accident Insurance Policy with COVID 19 coverage from Myanma Insurance. This applies even if travellers have worldwide insurance cover. The tariffs depend on age and length of stay (full details are on the Myanma Insurance website). Diplomats, UN officials and their family members do not need to purchase Myanma Insurance and can show proof of health insurance from their countries of origin instead.
Data collection
On arrival, passengers may be asked to fill in a paper form giving your name, contact details and address.
If you’re fully vaccinated
Arrival by commercial flight
Arrivals to Myanmar must be fully vaccinated, and must present proof they have received their second vaccine dose at least 14 days prior to arrival. Alternatively, arrivals can present proof they have recovered from COVID-19.
Arrivals must also provide evidence of a negative COVID-19 PCR test result. The test should be issued no more than 72 hours prior to the date of departure from the origin airport. You should not use the NHS testing service to get a test in order to facilitate your travel to another country. You should arrange to take a private test. Testing requirements ahead of entry to Myanmar are subject to change. Confirmation should be sought from the relevant Myanmar Embassy or Consulate well in advance of your departure.
Arrivals will need to purchase a Travel Accident Insurance Policy with COVID 19 coverage from Myanma Insurance (see above).
Arrivals will need to complete a COVID-19 Rapid Test Requisition form and a Health Declaration Form when they arrive, which should be provided by the airline or the airport authorities.
On arrival in Myanmar, arrivals will take a COVID-19 Rapid Antigen Diagnostic Test. If the test is negative you will be free to leave. who display symptoms or test positive will be isolated and taken to a hospital or hotel designated by the Ministry of Health at their own expense.
Arrival by relief flight
If you are entering Myanmar on a relief flight, you must quarantine in a hotel on arrival and take COVID-19 PCR tests at your own expense.
If you are vaccinated and can demonstrate proof that you have recovered from COVID within the last 90 days (but where COVID has not been detected in the previous 72 hours) the quarantine requirement is 3 days and checkout the same day if COVID-19 is not detected.
These rules change frequently and often at short notice. Those planning to go to Myanmar should contact their nearest Myanmar embassy for details before departure.
Testing positive
If you test positive for COVID-19, you will be immediately isolated and taken to a medical facility. Foreign nationals are expected to pay the medical costs and other costs related to isolation and treatment in the designated health facilities.
If hospitalised with coronavirus, patients are obliged to use a government facility even if they have private insurance. Patients in government hospitals are generally expected to make their own arrangements for bringing in food and other essential supplies. Lone travellers will not be allowed out of isolation to buy food or make phone calls.

Proof of vaccination must demonstrate you have received your second vaccine dose at least 14 days prior to arrival.
