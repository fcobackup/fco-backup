This page reflects the UK government’s understanding of current rules for people travelling on a full ‘British Citizen’ passport, for the most common types of travel.
The authorities in Barbados set and enforce entry rules. For further information contact the embassy, high commission or consulate of the country or territory you’re travelling to. You should also consider checking with your transport provider or travel company to make sure your passport and other travel documents meet their requirements.
Entry rules in response to coronavirus (COVID-19)
Entry to Barbados
Barbados has published travel protocols setting out its entry requirements in relation to COVID-19. Visit the Visit Barbados website for full details. You should read these before your departure and monitor the pages on a regular basis as the requirements may change at short notice. Masks should be worn at all times during your travel to Barbados and your passage through the airport. Social distancing and hygiene protocols are in place.
Arrive with a COVID 19 negative test
All travellers from the UK must present on arrival a valid COVID-19 PCR negative test result taken no more than 3 days in advance of your flight’s arrival. Please note that the test can be taken at any time during the day 3 days prior to the date of your arrival in Barbados. (For example, if your flight arrives at 10pm on Saturday, you can take a test at any time on the Wednesday prior to this.) You should check the protocols to confirm and understand all requirements. Relevant test accrediting bodies and standards authorities include: ISO 15189, CAP, UKAS or the equivalent.
All passengers are also required to submit an Embarkation/Disembarkation (ED) card 24 hours prior to travel, to which they should upload their negative test result via Travel Form. The BIMSafe app can also be used.
If you arrive in Barbados from the UK without a valid negative PCR test, you may be denied entry to the country. You should not use the NHS testing service to get a test in order to facilitate your travel to another country. You should arrange to take a private test. On arrival all passengers are also subject to a health screen.
Demonstrating your COVID-19 vaccination status
Barbados will accept the UK’s solutions to demonstrate your COVID vaccination status. Your NHS appointment card from vaccination centres is not designed to be used as proof of vaccination and should not be used to demonstrate your vaccine status.
Quarantine for unvaccinated arrivals
On arrival, you will be quarantined at approved facilities (a designated holding hotel, approved villa or a government facility at your own expense).
You will be required to undergo a second PCR test 5 days after arrival.
You will need to remain in your hotel room and may be required to wear an electronic tracking bracelet until you receive the results of your second test. If the result of that second test is negative, you will not be subject to further quarantine. The government aims to return results within 48 hours. Return times can sometimes be longer than this. See the Barbados Travel Protocols for further details.
Quarantine for vaccinated arrivals
From 8 May a new protocol is in place for fully vaccinated individuals (2 doses administered more than 14 days prior to arrival) who have not visited high risk countries including India, South Africa or Brazil in the previous 21 days.
Details of what the Barbadian authorities will accept as proof of vaccination can be found on page 6 of the Barbados Travel Protocols. If you are able to provide sufficient proof that you have been vaccinated then you will be treated as if you are unvaccinated.
On arrival, you will undergo a rapid PCR test either at the airport or at your government-approved accommodation. You will need to remain on the premises of your accommodation and follow the quarantine rules until you receive the results of your second test. The government aims to return results within 24 hours but it is recommended that you book two nights’ accommodation. See the Barbados Travel Protocols for further details.
If the result of that second test is negative, you will not be subject to further quarantine.
If you test positive for COVID-19 at any point during your stay in Barbados, you will be required to self-isolate. You will first be transferred to the government isolation facility for 24 hours. You can then request to self-isolate at your hotel, apartment or villa, or government approved isolation property under strict stipulations that must be signed and adhered to. This will be at your own expense for non-nationals and non-residents. You will need to remain at your designated accommodation until the Barbadian authorities are satisfied that you have recovered. This may mean a mandatory stay of several weeks in Barbados. Upon recovery, tourists can continue their holiday or return home. See the Barbados Travel Protocols for full details of isolation options, facilities and requirements.
If you are deemed to have been in close contact with a positive COVID-19 case, you will be required to quarantine at approved facilities. See Barbados Travel Protocols for full details.
You can find full and definitive details of the protocols at Visit Barbados website and are advised to read and understand the requirements carefully before departure.
You should monitor the Visit Barbados website website on a regular basis as the Government of Barbados may change the requirements without notice.
See the Barbados Travel Protocols for procedures for:
arrivals from high risk countries (India, South Africa, Brazil plus others) – stricter protocols are in place.
fully vaccinated arrivals from some low risk countries in the region – a ‘travel bubble’ has been introduced and no quarantine is necessary.
