Crime
Crime rates are low, but you should take sensible precautions to protect your personal safety and belongings:
don’t leave valuables lying about.
use a hotel safe or a safety deposit box where possible.
take particular care of your passport as this can’t be renewed or replaced in the Cayman Islands.
report the theft or loss of your passport immediately to the police (from whom a written report must be obtained).
In a genuine emergency, the Cayman Islands Passport Office may be able to issue an Emergency Passport.
Road travel
Minibuses are the only form of local public transport. They run only on the main routes. For other journeys, taxis are available or you can hire a car. Driving is on the left, as in the UK. Observe the speed limits, wear your seat belt at all times and don’t drink and drive. It’s illegal to use a mobile phone while driving, offenders face a mandatory fine of CI$150.
Air travel
Airlines require earlier check-in times for passengers and luggage. Both hold-loaded and carry-on luggage is subject to being hand-searched. Allow extra time at the airport and check the recommended check-in time for your flight with your airline. Travellers must ensure they comply with local immigration requirements, eg, retention of immigration card issued on arrival for departure.
Emergency assistance
The Cayman Islands is a British Overseas Territory so doesn’t have formal British consular representation. All emergency assistance needed by British nationals is delivered by the Cayman Islands government.
In an emergency dial 911.
If you’re a victim of crime, contact the Royal Cayman Islands Police on 911.
