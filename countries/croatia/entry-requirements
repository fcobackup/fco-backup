This page reflects the UK government’s understanding of current rules for people travelling on a full ‘British Citizen’ passport, for the most common types of travel.
The authorities in Croatia set and enforce entry rules. For further information contact their embassy, high commission or consulate. You may also check with your transport provider or travel company to make sure your passport and travel documents meet their requirements.
Entry rules in response to coronavirus
Entry to Croatia
To be allowed entry into Croatia, all travellers from the UK must present one of the following documents on arrival:
proof of a vaccination, or;
a negative COVID-19 antigen not older than 48 hours, or;
a negative PCR test result not older than 72 hours, or;
a doctor’s certificate of recovery from COVID-19. (See ‘Demonstrating your COVID-19 status’).
Children under 12 and accompanied by a parent or guardian are exempt from these requirements if the parent or guardian has one of the documents set out above.
You should not use the NHS testing service to get a test in order to facilitate your travel to another country. You should arrange to take a private test.
Details of further exemptions from the requirements set out above are available here and include for example passengers transiting Croatia in under 12 hours.
If you are arriving in Croatia from countries other than the UK, Cyprus, Russia, South Africa, Brazil or Zanzibar and do not have one of the documents listed above, and are not subject to a specific exemption, you will be required to take a PCR test or rapid antigen test upon arrival in Croatia. You will need to self-isolate until the results of a negative test are received. Upon entry to Croatia, you will be handed instructions regarding the conditions for self isolation, which will include details about ending your self-isolation through a negative test. See more information about testing centres in Croatia.
If you travel to another country after receiving a negative PCR (72 hours validity) test or rapid antigen test (48 hours validity) in Croatia and return back to Croatia within less than 48 or 72 hours (for PCR) from the date of testing, you will not be required to provide a new test from the country you travelled to.
Additional documents for entry
You will need to complete an online entry form before you travel to Croatia.
You should carry a copy of your accommodation booking or proof of ownership of holiday homes / boats when arriving in Croatia. If you are travelling to Croatia for business, you should carry evidence of a business invitation or meetings.
Demonstrating your COVID-19 status
Croatia will accept either certificate of completion of a two dose vaccine course (Pfizer, Moderna, AstraZeneca, Gamaleya, Sinopharm) or a certificate of receipt of a one dose vaccine (Janssen, Johnson & Johnson). In both cases immunization must have been completed 14 days prior to arrival.
Alternatively, Croatia will accept a doctor’s certificate of recovery within the previous 8 months, alongside proof of a first dose of the vaccine.
Croatia will accept the UK’s proof of COVID-19 recovery and vaccination record. Your NHS appointment card from vaccination centres is not designed to be used as proof of vaccination and should not be used to demonstrate your vaccine status.
Travelling to Croatia from South Africa, Brazil, India or Zanzibar
There are additional restrictions if you are travelling to Croatia from South Africa, Brazil, India or Zanzibar. In addition to holding a negative PCR test result taken within 48 hours prior to arrival, permitted travellers must also undergo a mandatory 14 day self-isolation period on arrival to Croatia. The isolation period can be reduced to 7 days if a subsequent PCR test confirms a negative result.
Details of eligibility to travel, possible exemptions, and instructions for arrivals including approved rapid antigen tests are available from the Croatian Ministry of Interior. PCR tests are available at most Croatian airports – travellers should check this with the specific airports they are travelling to. Those seeking a test on arrival will need to contact a clinic directly and may temporarily leave their accommodation to attend a test appointment. See more information about testing centres in Croatia. Tests cost approximately 700 Croatian Kuna and results are generally available within 48 hours.
