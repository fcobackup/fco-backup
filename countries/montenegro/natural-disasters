Montenegro lies in a seismically active zone and small tremors are recorded throughout the year. Serious earthquakes are less frequent but do occur. The last serious earthquake, in 1979, resulted in 94 deaths and approximately 1,000 injuries and caused major structural damage along the Montenegrin coast. To learn more about what to do before, during and after an earthquake, visit the website of the US Federal Emergency Management Agency.
Wild fires are common in Montenegro from April to October due to the dry/hot weather. Wild fires are highly dangerous and unpredictable. Take care when visiting or driving through woodland areas. Make sure cigarette ends are properly extinguished, do not light fires or barbecues and do not leave any rubbish, particularly empty bottles, behind. If you see a forest fire, call the emergency services on 112.
Flooding can be a problem in winter and spring when heavy rains and snow melt causes rivers to swell.
Monitor media reports and follow the advice of the local authorities if a forest fire, flood or earthquake occurs in your area.
