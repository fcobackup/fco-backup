There are currently extremely limited commercial options available to return to the UK from Turkey.
The Turkish Government has implemented a ban on international flights until 10 June. Normal, scheduled international flights will not resume until the ban is lifted. At present there is no information about how soon airlines will resume their operations after it is lifted. Occasional ad hoc flights are still operating.
If you have a future reservation for a flight from Turkey to the UK other than those listed below and on our social media @UKinTurkey, there is no guarantee that the flight will operate. Contact your airline for the latest information.
If you live in the UK and are currently visiting Turkey, you are strongly advised to return now by commercial means.

Travelling to the airport
Turkey has now lifted most restrictions on internal travel. However, you will still need a travel permit if you are over 65 and you must remain at your destination for a minimum of 30 days unless travelling for an international flight. Individuals under 18 no longer require a permit to either travel within the same city, or undertake intercity travel. When travelling they must, however, be accompanied by a parent or guardian, aged below 65 years of age.
To request a travel permit, submit a request to the British Embassy Ankara. Make clear in the subject box that you are enquiring about a permit to travel, and have proof of your onward journey out of Turkey.
