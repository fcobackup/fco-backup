The Mozambique authorities have introduced a number of precautionary measures in response to the coronavirus (COVID-19) pandemic.
The Mozambican Government has declared a state of emergency for the month of April starting from 1 April, imposing limitations on movements within the country and border entries.
Many airlines are suspending flights and many airports are closing, preventing flights from leaving.

Entry and borders
The government of Mozambique requires travellers from all countries with active transmission to self-isolate on arrival for 14 days. The government has suspended the issuing of entry visas and banned gatherings of more than 50 people.
You should comply with any additional screening measures put in place by the authorities.
Many of Mozambique’s neighbouring countries, including South Africa, have closed their borders or put in place other travel restrictions. Check FCO Travel Advice for South Africa or other affected countries before planning onward travel from Mozambique.
If you need further information about entry requirements, contact the local immigration authorities or nearest Mozambique Embassy or High Commission. You should also check with your airline or travel company for the latest information.
