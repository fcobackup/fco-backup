Crime
There have been reports of people being robbed by bogus and unlicensed taxi drivers, including airport taxis. We advise to only use official and/or pre-booked taxis and to ask taxi drivers for proof of reservation.
There have been incidents involving people being followed from Santiago International Airport to their destinations and then robbed, sometimes at gunpoint. The British Embassy has noted an increase in ‘car-jacking’ and general crime in and around Santiago, especially in affluent areas. Be aware of your surroundings in and around the airport, when driving away and on arrival at your destination. In case of an incident, do not offer resistance.
Criminals will often target vehicles entering/exiting private residences, in affluent areas, while the gates are opening/closing. Keep vehicle doors locked and windows closed and wait for the gates to fully close before exiting your vehicle.
There have been a number of incidents in major cities where those driving rental cars have been victims of crime. The perpetrators puncture the car’s tyres surreptitiously (often while at traffic lights) and then target the vehicle when the occupants notice the flat tyre. Often the victims do not notice the theft is taking place as an accomplice will distract while another steals valuables from the vehicle. Remain vigilant and keep valuables secure in this event. Other incidents include the interception of locking cars when drivers remotely activate the lock. Always double check that the car is locked.
Pick pocketing and muggings are common in many cities throughout Chile, particularly around affluent or well-known tourist sites including airports, bus stations, ports and popular areas visited by foreigners. Pay particular attention to your belongings in popular foreign cafes and restaurants where there has been an increase in bag theft. In restaurants, never hang your handbag over the chair or leave your cellphone on the table. There have been reports of violent muggings in areas popular with tourists in Santiago and Valparaiso. The British Embassy is aware of an increase in the use of weapons, such as pistols and knives. These muggings can take place during the day and in plain sight of others. Be vigilant in public, particularly if you are in places popular among tourists or near official buildings. Avoid carrying large amounts of money, passport (a photocopy is sufficient if needed), wearing valuable watches or jewellery or using your mobile phone while walking on the streets. Local authorities recommend not to resist muggers.
Avoid putting any valuables in the storage compartments of buses and coaches, especially interregional transport - keep them with you at all times.
Book a taxi in advance rather than hailing one from the street, especially late at night. Keep in groups and avoid walking alone late at night.
There have been a few reports of people being given ‘spiked’ drinks in nightclubs and bars, particularly in the Suecia and Bellavista areas of Santiago. These can leave the victim open to theft or assault.
Leave your passport and other valuables in a safe place and carry a photocopy of the details page of your passport with you at all times.
Local travel
Landmine accidents mainly affect livestock and local people crossing borders at unauthorised points. Most minefields are near the borders with Peru and Bolivia in the extreme north of Chile (regions XV, I and II) and Argentina in the south (region XII). Although most minefields are clearly marked, some signs and fences are old and damaged, and may be hard to spot. In some cases, minefields are laid right up to the edge of highways. Check with local authorities before travelling to more rural areas, stick to clearly marked roads and observe all warning signs.
If travelling to national parks in Chile you are advised that open fires (outside permitted camping areas) are strictly forbidden. Local authorities may revoke tourist permits from anyone caught starting a fire within a Chilean National Park and ask them to leave Chile voluntarily within 72 hours or face deportation. Additionally, if the open fire results in a larger forest fire, there may also be criminal penalties and fines.
If you plan to go exploring or mountaineering, notify the local authorities before you set off. For further information on mountaineering, contact the Federación de Andinismo de Chile, Almirante Simpson 77, Santiago, Chile, Telephone: (56 2) 2220888.  For any other type of exploring, contact the Chilean Embassy in London, to see if permits are required. There are good rescue facilities in Chile.  You may be charged for the service they provide.
Road travel
You can use your UK driving licence while in Chile if you’re visiting as a tourist. You must have your passport and entrance card with you while driving. If you hire a car, take out adequate insurance including for windscreen damage, which can be expensive.
If you’re resident in Chile you must get a Chilean driving licence from the nearest ‘municipalidad’. You can find further information about the process on the Chilean Transport Ministry website.
There is no car insurance available on Easter Island. In case of accidents or any damage to your vehicle, you will have to pay for the repairs yourself.
Main roads in Chile are surfaced, but you may need a four-wheel drive vehicle in the countryside. Be prepared for a range of driving conditions, from snow and ice to hot sandy deserts. Road tolls are increasingly common. Between June and September, winter weather sometimes temporarily closes the Chile-Argentina border crossing high up in the Andes, including the main Los Libertadores crossing between Santiago and Mendoza.
Air travel
The Foreign, Commonwealth and Development Office (FCDO) can’t offer advice on the safety of individual airlines, but the International Air Transport Association publishes a list of registered airlines that have been audited and found to meet a number of operational safety standards and recommended practices. This list is not exhaustive and the absence of an airline from this list does not necessarily mean that it is unsafe.
A list of recent incidents and accidents can be found on the website of the Aviation Safety network.
Political situation
There remains a risk of violent protest in Santiago and other Chilean cities, particularly on Friday afternoons/evenings.
Nationwide protests often take place on 11 September (anniversary of the military coup), 29 March (‘day of the young combatant’) and 1 May (Workers’ Day). Even peaceful protests can become violent. The largest protests usually take place in central Santiago. Police can use tear gas and water cannon against protesters. Other public demonstrations, often led by students or indigenous rights defenders, can occur around Chile. You should avoid all demonstrations.
The following Santiago districts have in the past been the focus of strong protests: the boroughs of:
Providencia
Santiago Central
Huechuraba
Estacion Central
Ñuñoa
San Joaquin
Renca
La Pintana
Macul
Downtown university neighbourhoods can also be the location of large demonstrations which may become violent after dark. Please be particularly aware of possible disturbances in those areas.
In the Araucanía Region, especially around Temuco, civil unrest continues including attacks against security forces, property, people, vehicles and industrial equipment by groups of demonstrators. Caution should be exercised when travelling within the Araucanía Region. A state of emergency has been declared in the provinces of Biobío, Arauco, Cautín and Malleco owing to a significant increase in violent incidents. The state of emergency continues until further notice. Over this period, the military have been deployed to assist regional police activity. You should follow the instructions of local authorities.
