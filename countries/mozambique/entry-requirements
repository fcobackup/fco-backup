This page has information on travelling to Mozambique.
This page reflects the UK government’s understanding of current rules for people travelling on a full ‘British Citizen’ passport from the UK, for the most common types of travel.
The authorities in Mozambique set and enforce entry rules. If you’re unsure how Mozambique’s entry requirements apply to you, contact its UK embassy, high commission or consulate.
All travellers
You will need a visa to enter Mozambique. See Visas for more information.
If you’re fully vaccinated
You must produce an electronically verifiable full vaccination certificate at the point of entry.
Proof of vaccination status
Mozambique will accept the UK’s proof of COVID-19 vaccination record and proof of COVID-19 vaccination issued in the Crown Dependencies. Your final vaccine dose must have been administered at least 14 days prior to travel. Your NHS appointment card from vaccination centres is not designed to be used as proof of vaccination and should not be used to demonstrate your vaccine status.
If you’re not fully vaccinated
You will need to provide a negative PCR test if you have not been vaccinated against COVID-19. The PCR test result must have been issued in the departure country within 72 hours prior to the time of arrival. You should not use the NHS testing service to get a test in order to facilitate your travel to another country. You should arrange to take a private test.
A negative PCR test is valid for up to 7 days for travellers using the South Africa land border.
Children and young people
Children 11 and under are exempt from the requirement to present a COVID-19 PCR test on arrival to Mozambique.
Children 11 and older must follow the normal entry requirements in accordance with their vaccination status.
If you’re transiting through Mozambique
Transiting is when you pass through one country on the way to your final destination.
Transiting through Mozambique is permitted for all travellers who follow the entry requirements in accordance with their vaccination status.
Exemptions
There are no exemptions to Mozambique’s entry requirements.
Check your passport and travel documents before you travel
Passport validity
If you are visiting Mozambique, your passport should be valid for 6 months from the date you arrive and have at least two blank pages.
Check with your travel provider to make sure your passport and other travel documents meet their requirements.
Visas
You will need a visa to enter Mozambique. You can now apply for a visa through the new e-visa portal online by selecting the most appropriate visa for your travel.
You must present on entry a return air ticket (for air travellers) and either an invitation from family / friends or a confirmed hotel reservation.
Travel to or from South Africa
If you’re planning to enter South Africa before or after you visit Mozambique, you should refer to the travel advice for South Africa.
Travelling with children via South Africa
If you’re transiting through South Africa with children, see our South Africa travel advice page for information and advice about the documents you’ll need to carry.
Border formalities
It can take a long time to clear border formalities at the Lebombo/Ressano Garcia land crossing with South Africa, especially during holiday periods and if you are travelling on public transport. Allow adequate time to arrive at your destination before nightfall. This and other land borders are currently closed except to essential freight traffic.
Yellow fever certificate requirements
Check whether you need a yellow fever certificate by visiting the National Travel Health Network and Centre’s TravelHealthPro website.
UK Emergency Travel Documents
UK Emergency Travel Documents (ETDs) are accepted for entry into, transit through and exit from Mozambique as long as they have a minimum of 6 months’ validity and a valid entry visa.
