There are good medical facilities in Windhoek. Make sure you have adequate travel health insurance and accessible funds to cover the cost of any medical treatment abroad and repatriation. Even with fully comprehensive travel insurance, private hospitals in Namibia may insist on proof of payment (cash or credit card) before starting treatment. They may also insist you pay up front, reclaiming from your insurer at a later date. Some travel insurance policies are not recognised by some Namibian hospitals, you should check with your provider if their product is accepted in Namibia before you travel and seek alternative coverage where necessary. Medical evacuation from remote areas can take time.
Cholera is known to occur in Namibia and an outbreak has been reported in the Kunene Region with additional cases reported in the Omusati, Oshana, Ohangwena, and Khomas Regions, including a small number of cases in the capital, Windhoek. For further information see NaTHNaC’s Information sheet.
