This page gives you guidance on how to stay safely in Azerbaijan as a visitor, if you are unable to return to the UK.
Everyone should comply with the measures put in place in Azerbaijan to limit the spread of coronavirus (COVID-19).
Moving around in Azerbaijan
For information on entering Azerbaijan, see Entry Requirements
Restrictive measures are in place until 31 May to combat the spread of COVID 19. As of 18 May there will be a lift of some of the previous restrictions in the quarantine regime. Information about the relaxing of the quarantine measures can be found here.
The system of using SMS to gain permission to leave the home and the registration of key workers on the government database has been abolished.
Moving between cities by land and air remains prohibited. Emergency services and cargo are the exceptions.
Key sector workers
If you work in a government identified key sector or in a permitted business your employer will no longer need to register your details with the authorities so that you can travel freely on working days.
The SMS process for those who are not key workers has also been lifted.
Quarantine
The Azerbaijani authorities have informed that as of 25 March all nationals arriving from abroad will be placed in to state-run quarantine facilities for up to14 days. These facilities include Baku based hotels, hospitals or the Olympic Village.
You may be quarantined with someone you do not know, and families could be separated in different rooms. It is unlikely you will have direct access to one another during the period of time you spend in quarantine if this is the case. Similar procedures are also in place for British nationals who show signs of potential COVID-19 infection while staying in Azerbaijan.
If you or a British national you know is quarantined and needs consular assistance, contact the British Embassy. Call: +994 12 437 7878. You may hear a message stating that our offices are closed, however, we are available 24/7 – please stay on the line to select the option for ‘calling about an emergency involving a British national’ to speak to a Consular duty officer.” You can also reach us via Facebook.
Visas
The Azerbaijani authorities have introduced additional visa measures for British nationals. See Visas
If you have extended your stay in Azerbaijan due to restrictions on travel this is now considered to be valid for an indefinite period of time until restrictions on flights to and from Azerbaijan are lifted. Once the restrictions are lifted then you will need to leave the country as soon as possible and apply for a new visa, or the relevant residence permit.
