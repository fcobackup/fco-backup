Terrorism
There is a high threat of terrorist attack globally affecting UK interests and British nationals, including from groups and individuals who view the UK and British nationals as targets. Stay aware of your surroundings at all times.  
UK Counter Terrorism Policing has information and advice on staying safe abroad and what to do in the event of a terrorist attack. Find out how to reduce your risk from terrorism while abroad. 
Terrorism in Pakistan
Terrorists are very likely to try to carry out attacks in Pakistan.
There is a high threat of terrorism and sectarian violence throughout Pakistan.
Read our advice on regional risks in Pakistan for information about areas where we advise against travel.
Terrorist groups operating in Pakistan include: 
Tehreek-e Taliban Pakistan (TTP) 
Tehreek-e Jihad Pakistan (TJP)  
Balochistan separatists 
Islamic State Khorasan Province (ISKP)  
al-Qa’ida 
Terrorist groups mainly target Government of Pakistan security forces. Areas of Balochistan and Khyber Pakhtunkhwa, including Peshawar, suffer regular terrorist attacks. Attacks have also taken place in Karachi and other major cities.
While terrorist attacks are mainly directed against the Pakistani state, attacks could be indiscriminate and occur without warning, including in places visited by foreign nationals, such as:
Pakistani government buildings and infrastructure
security, judicial and police force locations
places of worship, including churches and religious sites
hotels, restaurants and shopping areas
schools and educational institutions
popular tourist sites or hiking trails
Be cautious about attending any public event, including:
processions, protests, demonstrations and rallies
religious gatherings
sports and live music events
Public transport and transport hubs, including airports, are at risk of attack. Avoid using the railway network due to the risk of terrorist attacks.
Take particular care during periods of national or religious significance, including the month of Ramadan, and during election periods. When travelling, always:
keep a low profile
minimise your exposure to areas and events that pose a higher risk
vary your routes and timings if you make regular journeys
limit movements on Friday afternoons
be prepared to change your plans as necessary
Examples of recent attacks include:
in March 2025, the Jaffar Express passenger train travelling from Quetta to Peshawar, with at least 380 passengers on board, was hijacked by the Balochistan Liberation Army (BLA), resulting in 64 deaths
in November 2024, a suicide attack by Baloch separatists at Quetta railway station killed at least 26 people.
in October 2024, a suicide attack near Karachi’s Jinnah International Airport killed 4 individuals - including two Chinese nationals and two Pakistani civilians
public service and health officials have been attacked while working on health programmes
Terrorist kidnap 
There is a threat of kidnap throughout Pakistan, particularly within the Khyber Pakhtunkhwa and Balochistan provinces. Terrorist groups are unlikely to prioritise the kidnap of westerners in Pakistan. Any kidnap of a foreign national by terrorist groups in Pakistan would likely be opportunistic.
British nationals are seen as legitimate targets, including tourists, humanitarian aid workers, journalists and business travellers. If you are kidnapped, the reason for your presence is unlikely to protect you or secure your safe release.  
The long-standing policy of the British government policy is not to make substantive concessions to hostage takers. The British government considers that paying ransoms and releasing prisoners builds the capability of terrorist groups and finances their activities. This can, in turn, increase the risk of further hostage-taking. The Terrorism Act (2000) makes payments to terrorists illegal.
Political situation
Political rallies, protests and demonstrations may take place across the country and can start with little warning. Most are peaceful, but they can turn violent quickly and lead to clashes with law enforcement. During elections, terrorists have targeted security forces, political events, rallies, government buildings and polling stations.
You should:
avoid all political demonstrations, large crowds of people and public events  
be prepared to change your plans as necessary 
keep track of the local news 
During times of protest or civil unrest, mobile data coverage and internet connectivity may be cut without warning. Additionally, major road networks in and around cities may be shut or blocked. You should have alternative travel options such as different routes for any journeys you plan.
Crime 
Protecting yourself and your belongings
Street crime is a risk, particularly in crowded areas. Take sensible measures to guard your possessions and reduce your personal risk. Be cautious when moving around urban areas at night, especially when on foot.
There is an active black market in forged and stolen passports. Credit card fraud is common. Beware of scams.
Criminal kidnap
British nationals of Pakistani origin have been targeted by criminals, including kidnappers, as they are often perceived as being wealthier than locals.
Laws and cultural differences  
Pakistan is a Muslim country. Respect the local traditions, customs and laws. Make sure your actions do not cause offence. 
Standards of public behaviour differ between the UK and Pakistan. Behaviour that might be acceptable in the UK can cause offence in Pakistan. Being considerate of others is important in Pakistani culture. Loud or rowdy behaviour in public is likely to attract a negative response.
Personal ID 
Always carry photo ID.  You may be asked to show it.
Ramadan  
Ramadan, also called Ramazan in Pakistan, is a holy month for Muslims. The dates vary by year and country. In 2026, Ramadan is expected to start around mid-February and finish around mid-March. During this time, do not: 
eat, drink, smoke or chew gum in public in the daytime, including in your car  
play loud music or dance  
swear in public  
Get more advice when you arrive from your tour guide, hotel or business contacts.  
You should also:  
check opening hours of shops and restaurants  
be aware that if hotels and restaurants are providing food or drink in fasting hours, they may separate you from Islamic guests, for example with screens  
follow local dress codes – clothing that does not meet local dress codes may cause more offence at this time  
be aware that fasting can cause tiredness  
be aware that driving may be unpredictable, particularly when people are trying to get home at dusk  
be patient and show tolerance 
Dress code
Dress modestly. Men and women should cover their shoulders and legs in public. Women should cover their heads when entering mosques and holy places, and in rural areas. 
Blasphemy 
Insulting or showing disrespect or contempt of religion, religious beliefs or anything considered sacred (blasphemy) is illegal. Blasphemy has a broad definition in Pakistani law. It includes public and private comments in any form, including on social media.
There are significant criminal penalties, including the death penalty. Those accused of blasphemy are at significant risk of violence from the public. Both Muslims and religious minorities have been victims of blasphemy accusations and violence, including killings.  
Be sensitive to religious beliefs and behave appropriately.  
Death penalty 
The death penalty can be imposed for individuals convicted for crimes including blasphemy, murder and rape.
Alcohol laws and bans 
Drinking alcohol is illegal for Muslims. Non-Muslims are allowed to drink in Pakistan, but you must get a licence from the authorities. It is also illegal for non-Muslims to supply alcohol to Muslims. Public drinking and drunkenness are illegal and can lead to detention. 
Illegal drugs and penalties
You can get a prison sentence for possession of even small quantities of illegal drugs. British nationals have been arrested on drug trafficking charges and have been detained for long periods while their case is in the Pakistan legal system.
Taking photos in secure areas
Do not take photos at military establishments, airports or any infrastructure (including bridges and dams) or from aircraft. British nationals have been arrested on suspicion of ‘spying’. Check with officials if you’re not sure whether you can take a photo. 
You should not take photos of people without seeking prior permission.
LGBT+ travellers 
Same-sex sexual activity between men is illegal. There are occasional arrests, and there are negative attitudes to same-sex relationships throughout Pakistan. See more details from the Human Dignity Trust about the current application of the law.
Read more advice for LGBT+ travellers.
Relationships 
It is illegal for unmarried couples to live together. 
Transport risks  
Planning secure travel around Pakistan
Pakistan authorities advise all foreign nationals (including diplomats) not to move out of their place of residence without proper security and co-ordination with the law enforcement agency. This is not rigorously enforced, but consider telling local authorities about any travel plans. There are a number of prohibited areas across the country. Officials could stop you and ask you to turn back.
When travelling in Pakistan be aware of the risks, including carjacking. You or your travel company should contact the local authorities of your destination in advance to check the local security situation. They may arrange police protection. They will also tell you if you need a No Objection Certificate from the Pakistani Ministry of Interior.
Take safety precautions, keep a low profile and choose your accommodation carefully.
Road travel 
If you are planning to drive in Pakistan, see information on driving abroad.
You’ll need to have both the 1968 version of the international driving permit (IDP) and your UK driving licence with you in the car. You cannot buy an IDP outside the UK, so get one before you travel.
Road conditions
Outside of the major motorways, the quality of roads is variable. Road conditions can be poor. Local driving standards are erratic, especially at night. Take care on long road journeys and when travelling cross-country. 
The north of Pakistan is mountainous. Many roads, including the N15 highway between Chilas and Babusar in Gilgit Baltistan, are inaccessible at some times of the year due to extreme weather conditions. Many roads in these remote areas are of very poor quality with uneven surfaces. Landslides frequently block or destroy roads. Use experienced local drivers when travelling these routes and only in clear weather conditions.
Public transport
Due to the level of crime, avoid using public transport, including the Metro Bus between Rawalpindi and Islamabad.
Taxis 
Avoid using street or e-taxis. Only use taxis from reputable, licensed companies where you call for a taxi and the operator contacts a taxi driver. 
Air travel 
Airports can be crowded at times and your baggage may need to go through screening equipment and checks. When travelling through an airport, allow enough time to complete check-in and security procedures.
Flights to and from the mountainous areas in the north of Pakistan are frequently delayed or cancelled due to extreme weather.  
Rail travel 
Avoid using the railway network due to the risk of terrorist attacks and derailments. 
Sea travel 
The threat from piracy within Pakistan’s territorial waters is low. There is a significant threat of piracy in the Gulf of Aden and other parts of the Indian Ocean. Mariners should follow shipping industry guidelines on precautions to take.
Extreme weather and natural disasters 
Monitor local and international weather updates from the Pakistan Meteorological Department and see weather advisories from the National Disaster Management Authority.
Find out what you can do to prepare for and respond to extreme weather and natural hazards.
Monsoon 
The monsoon season in Pakistan is from late June to early October. Heavy rains can cause severe flooding, particularly in Sindh and Punjab provinces. 
Landslides 
Check local forecasts from the Pakistan Meteorological Department and be aware of the risk of landslides and road blockages, particularly in hilly and mountainous regions. Take extreme care crossing swollen rivers. 
Flooding  
Pakistan can experience  flooding and landslides during monsoon season. Roads and bridges have been damaged or destroyed, affecting travel in many parts of the country. More information is available from the National Disaster Management Authority.
Earthquakes 
Earth tremors are common. The US Federal Emergency Management Agency has advice on what to do before, during and after an earthquake.
