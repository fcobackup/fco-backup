Cases of coronavirus (COVID-19) have been confirmed in Senegal. The Senegalese authorities have introduced a number of measures to limit the spread of the virus, including a ban on all commercial air transport starting from 2359 GMT on 20 March, with the exception of flights with ‘special authorisation’.This ban on commercial flights has been extended to 31 May. Please check with your airline before travelling. Senegal’s borders with neighbouring countries are closed, except for goods vehicles in the case of Mali and Guinea.

The government of Senegal is encouraging those with any information or concerns about coronavirus to call this number: +221 800 00 50 50.
As of 14 March, all public gatherings have been cancelled for 30 days; schools and universities are closed for three weeks and cruise ships won’t be allowed to enter Senegalese waters for 30 days.
On 23 March President Macky Sall declared a national state of emergency. On 3 April this national state of emergency and measures it provides for was extended for a further 30 days. The range of measures designed to stop the spread of the virus includes a curfew from 2000 to 0600 and limiting and prohibiting travel from one region to another. In the event of a medical emergency, health personnel are allowed to travel during the curfew. Measures also include the possibility of: prohibiting gatherings and demonstrations on public highways; prohibiting the movement of people, vehicles and goods in given locations or times; and banning public or private meeting spaces as well as all public or private gatherings that could lead to civil disturbance. If you are travelling between Senegal’s regions you will need to obtain the authorisation to do so from Governor or Préfet. You should plan to get to the airport in time to respect the curfew and for your driver to also be able to return in time. Our information is that you should be able to travel to the airport for a flight that has ‘special authorisation’ but you should expect to show your travel documents (passport and plane ticket) to any officials that may stop you during your journey. Please also ensure that your driver has photocopies of these documents to justify travel during their return journey. On 27 March the Minister for Transport set out further measures including limiting the number of passengers per vehicle (for example, three - including driver- for a five seater car) and use of masks, gloves and hand sanitiser for public transport employees. We have also received reports that road users have been stopped and fined for not wearing masks and gloves.
Thirteen hotels in Dakar have been requisitioned as part of the emergency response to COVID-19. These are: Virage, Arc-En-Ciel, Étoile du Lac, Chez Salon, Pullman-Teranga, Ngor Diarama, Ibis-Novotel, Lagon, Savana, Ndiambour, Terrou-Bi, Calao and Fleur de Lys.
You should comply with any additional screening measures put in place by the authorities. Keep up to date with information from your tour operator, transport or accommodation provider on the impact on any existing travel plans.
If you need further information about entry requirements, contact the local immigration authorities or the nearest Senegalese embassy. You should also check with your airline or travel company for the latest information.
