This page reflects the UK government’s understanding of current rules for people travelling on a full ‘British Citizen’ passport, for the most common types of travel.
The authorities in Cape Verde set and enforce entry rules. For further information contact the embassy, high commission or consulate of the country or territory you’re travelling to. You should also consider checking with your transport provider or travel company to make sure your passport and other travel documents meet their requirements.
Entry rules in response to coronavirus
Entry to Cape Verde
Cape Verde’s air and sea borders are open. You’ll need to complete an International Travel Form on the Covid19.cv website and show one of the following to enter the country:
a valid COVID-19 vaccination certificate showing you are fully vaccinated
a COVID-19 recovery certificate showing you recovered from COVID-19 no more than 90 days before you travel
a COVID-19 PCR test done 72 hours before departure or an antigen test (Ag-RDT) done 48 hours before departure
Children aged 11 and under are exempt from these requirements.
You should not use the NHS testing service to get a test in order to facilitate your travel to another country. You should arrange to take a private test.
Before you travel, you’ll also need to complete and submit the Airport Security Tax Form (TSA) on the EASE website (see Visas)
Screening on arrival
Your temperature will be taken on arrival in Cape Verde. If it is higher than 37.5°C, you will be taken to an assigned area at the airport where it will be measured again. If your temperature remains high, the Cape Verde authorities may need you to do a COVID-19 test.
Check the requirements for travel to Cape Verde with your airline before you book a flight.
Transiting through Cape Verde
If you’re transiting through Cape Verde on your way to another country, you will not need to show a COVID-19 vaccination or test certificate if you are arriving by air and staying airside.
You should still check the COVID-19 entry requirements for your final destination.
Regular entry requirements
Visas
If you have a British Citizen passport, you can enter Cape Verde as a visitor for up to 30 days without a visa.
Before you travel, you must register with the Cape Verde authorities on the EASE website and, if arriving by air, pay the Airport Security Tax (TSA) of 3,400 escudos (approximately £30). This does not apply to visitors under 2 years of age or those who are normally resident in Cape Verde.
Check with your tour operator or airline what arrangements are in place for your booking, as some tour operators and airlines may complete this on your behalf and have specific registration requirements. You can find more information on the pre-registration process and TSA in this information leaflet.
If you’re travelling on a different type of British passport, are travelling for a purpose other than tourism, or intending to stay longer than 90 days, you should check entry requirements with the nearest Cape Verde Embassy:
