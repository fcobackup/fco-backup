Crime
There have been incidents of armed banditry, car-jacking and kidnap in northern and central Mali. Bandits and smugglers are present along Mali’s northern borders and pose a risk to travellers, especially after dark.
In case of emergency, you can contact the Malian authorities on +223 80 00 11 15 or +223 20 23 95 11.
Local travel
The FCO advise against all travel to the provinces of Tombouctou, Kidal, Gao and Mopti, as well as parts of the provinces of Kayes, Koulikoro and Segou. The FCO advise against all but essential travel to the rest of Mali, including Bamako.
There are an increasing number of inter and intra-communal security incidents in parts of the country, notably in Mopti region. In March 2019,160 villagers were killed by masked gunmen in a single attack in Ogossagou in central Mali. Landmines are used by groups operating in Centre, North and North East Mali.
There have been recent changes in the security situation in parts of Segou province/region. On 26 January 2020, terrorists attacked a Malian military camp in Sokolo, killing 20 soldiers. On 17 February, armed elements attacked a checkpoint of Bla, approximately 70 km south-east of Ségou town. If you’re in or travelling to rural areas outside the town of Segou, you should regularly review risks, and your resultant security arrangements, consider additional security measures and keep up to date with developments.
Travel in Mali can be difficult and conditions are poor for overland travel. You should take all necessary safety precautions, especially outside of main urban areas, have confidence in your security arrangements and maintain a high level of vigilance.
Political situation
There was a coup in Mali in 2012 following armed conflict in the north. Following a French-led military intervention, democracy was restored in 2013. A peace agreement has been signed by most parties to the earlier conflict and a process of reconciliation is continuing. President Ibrahim Boubacar Keïta (IBK) took office in September 2013, following national elections and was re-elected in 2018. Mali is due to hold legislative elections in March and April 2020- vigilance is recommended.
Protests, marches and demonstrations can occur with little prior notice and may see a heavy police and security presence. If you become aware of any nearby protests, marches or demonstrations, you should leave the area immediately, remain vigilant, and follow the local news as the atmosphere can change quickly and without warning. You should stay away from any blockades set up by the police and security forces.
Road travel
Night-time checkpoints operate in Bamako at various locations. Checkpoints are in place from approximately 9pm until dawn.
Keep vehicle and personal identification documents with you at all times while travelling by road. Approach security checkpoints slowly and comply with instructions given. There have been incidents late at night where people dressed as policemen have demanded money from drivers in Bamako. Ask to see identification. Don’t resist if the person is armed.
Road conditions off the main roads are often poor, especially in the rainy season (June to September). Other road users may drive dangerously. You should take particular care and attention when driving in urban centres.
In the case of a vehicle accident, go to the nearest police station to file a report immediately. If you remain on the spot you may be vulnerable. Medical help in the event of an accident is likely to be limited.
Air travel
The FCO can’t offer advice on the safety of individual airlines. However, the International Air Transport Association publishes lists of registered airlines that have been audited and found to meet a number of operational safety standards and recommended practices. This list isn’t exhaustive and the absence of an airline from this list doesn’t necessarily mean that it’s unsafe.
You can find a list of recent incidents and accidents on the website of the Aviation Safety network.
Scams
Foreign nationals are targets for online scams. Treat with considerable caution any requests for funds, a job offer, a business venture or a face to face meeting from someone you have been in correspondence with over the internet who operates in West Africa.
