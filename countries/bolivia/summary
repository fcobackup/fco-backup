40,106 British nationals visited Bolivia in 2017. Most visits are trouble free.
The current political situation in Bolivia is highly unpredictable, with increased risk to traveler safety. Following presidential elections on 20 October 2019, there have been large and wide-scale political demonstrations across the country, including Sucre, Santa Cruz and Potosi, many resulting in violence. Further demonstrations and strikes are planned and there is a risk that these will turn violent without warning. You should avoid large crowds or public demonstrations and don’t attempt to cross blockades. Travel routes across the country have also been affected, and the Embassy’s ability to travel to deliver consular services may be limited. See Political situation
