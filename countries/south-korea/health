Before you travel check that:
your destination can provide the healthcare you may need
you have appropriate travel insurance for local treatment or unexpected medical evacuation
This is particularly important if you have a health condition or are pregnant.
Emergency medical number
Call 119 and ask for an ambulance.
Contact your insurance company promptly if you’re referred to a medical facility for treatment.
Vaccinations and health risks
At least 8 weeks before your trip check:
the latest information on vaccinations and health risks in TravelHealthPro’s South Korea guide
where to get vaccines and whether you have to pay on the NHS travel vaccinations page
Tick bites, and tick-borne encephalitis, are a risk throughout South Korea. Read more about avoiding tick and insect bites on TravelHealthPro.
Air pollution, including yellow dust pollution, is common, especially during spring months. Follow local media reporting and check the Korean Meteorological Administration website. On days when concentrations are high, most residents will stay indoors or use face masks outside. It’s also important to drink plenty of water.
Medication
The legal status and regulation of some medicines prescribed or bought in the UK can be different in other countries.
South Korean customs authorities allow you to bring small amounts of medication for your personal use, if it is kept in carry-on baggage. Take an English language prescription from your doctor at home for both your prescription drugs and non-prescription medicines. Consult the website of the South Korean Ministry of Food and Drug Safety before you travel to South Korea.
Read best practice when travelling with medicines on TravelHealthPro.
The NHS has information on whether you can take your medicine abroad.
Healthcare facilities in South Korea
Medical and dental care in South Korea is usually of a good standard, but can be expensive. Staff may not speak English. Make sure you have adequate travel health insurance and accessible funds to cover the cost of any medical treatment abroad and repatriation.
If you need to stay in a South Korean hospital, particularly if your condition is severe, the hospital may ask you to bring a guardian or ‘bohoja’ to assist you with basic care needs such as trips to the bathroom, washing and exercise. It is possible to find agencies who will provide a caregiver or ‘ganbyungin’ for a fee, but these caregivers generally do not speak English. If you know that you may need to enter a Korean hospital, you should try to organise a guardian such as a friend or relative in advance.
FCDO has a list of English-speaking doctors in South Korea. 
There is also guidance on healthcare if you’re living in South Korea.
