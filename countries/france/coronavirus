Travel in France
France has put measures in place to limit the spread of COVID-19.
National lockdown ended on 15 December. You no longer need an attestation (or self-certificate) when you go out during the day. A curfew is in place from 8pm to 6am across much of the country. The French government has announced that, from 10 January, the following departments will be subject to a 6pm curfew (it will remain at 8pm elsewhere): l’Allier, Hautes-Alpes, Alpes-Maritimes, Ardennes, Les Bouches-du-Rhône, Le Cher, la Côte-d’Or, Doubs, Jura, Marne, Haute-Marne, Meurthe-et-Moselle, Moselle, Meuse, Nièvre, le Bas-Rhin, le Haut-Rhin, Haute-Saône, Saône-et-Loire, le Vaucluse, Vosges and Territoire de Belfort. From 12 January, the 6pm curfew will also be brought into force for the departments of le Var and la Drôme. Please check the French government’s COVID 19 pages (in French) for more information as well as with the relevant local authority for localised measures. These measures may change at short notice. Exemptions from the curfew are very limited and only apply for those with medical needs, caring responsibilities or working in roles which cannot be done from home. New attestations (or self-certificates) to leave the house during curfew are available on the French Interior Ministry website and through the digital app ‘Tous anti-Covid’.
Travel between regions is now allowed. Public services, schools and shops are open but restaurants and cafes are closed, along with cinemas, theatres and museums.

Public spaces and services
Wearing face masks in enclosed public spaces has been compulsory since 20 July. This applies to those aged 11 and over. Local authorities in an increasing number of cities and regions (including Paris), have extended this to also include outdoor public spaces. Failure to comply with these restrictions may result in a fine. Please refer to local guidance for more information.
Since 11 May, wearing masks on public transport has been compulsory for all users aged 11 and over, with fines for those who are not compliant. Masks are also compulsory in taxis and private hire vehicles without a plexiglass screen.
Some travel operators such as airlines may specify types of masks to be worn on board e.g. surgical masks, and may encourage you to take spares for long journeys. Please check with your travel operator before travelling.
