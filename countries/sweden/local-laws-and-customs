There are heavy punishments for importing illegal drugs.
All forms of physical punishment of children have been outlawed since 1979 in Sweden. Sweden was the first country in the world to introduce legislation of this kind. Any public action with the potential to be interpreted as physical punishment is likely to, at minimum, attract strong criticism from on-lookers.
Taking food and drink into the EU
You cannot take meat, milk or products containing them into EU countries. There are some exceptions for medical reasons, for example certain amounts of powdered infant milk, infant food, or pet food required for medical reasons. Check the rules about taking food and drink into the EU on the European Commission website.
