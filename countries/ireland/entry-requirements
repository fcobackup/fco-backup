The information on this page covers the most common types of travel and reflects the UK government’s understanding of the rules currently in place. Unless otherwise stated, this information is for travellers using a full ‘British Citizen’ passport.
The authorities in the country or territory you’re travelling to are responsible for setting and enforcing the rules for entry. If you’re unclear about any aspect of the entry requirements, or you need further reassurance, you’ll need to contact the embassy, high commission or consulate of the country or territory you’re travelling to.
You should also consider checking with your transport provider or travel company to make sure your passport and other travel documents meet their requirements.
Entry rules in response to coronavirus (COVID-19)
From Saturday 16 January 2021, all passengers arriving into Ireland (except those arriving from Northern Ireland) are required to have a negative/’not detected’ result from a pre-departure COVID-19 PCR test carried out no more than 72 hours prior to arrival in Ireland.
Passengers will be asked to present evidence of their negative/‘not detected’ result before boarding their airplane or ferry, and will be required to produce this evidence to Immigration Officers on arrival at points of entry to the State.
Passengers who arrive in an Irish Airport or Sea Port without evidence of a negative/’not detected’ COVID-19 PCR test result will commit an offence and may be subject to prosecution, punishable by a fine not exceeding €2,500 or imprisonment for a term not exceeding 6 months or both.
Exemptions are limited to international transport workers, including hauliers, pilots and aviation crew, masters and maritime crew, where they are travelling in the course of their duties. Children under six will also be exempt.
Passengers who arrive in Ireland solely for the purpose of travelling onwards to another state and do not leave the airport are also not required to provide evidence of a test.
Passengers whose journey originates in Northern Ireland are not in scope of this announcement, but any such travel is subject to the public health restrictions in place in Northern Ireland and Ireland respectively.
If a citizen has a genuine humanitarian emergency requiring urgent travel, they should contact the nearest Irish Embassy or Consulate immediately for advice and consular assistance before commencing their journey.
Self-isolating/restricting movements on arrival
Arrivals from Great Britain and South Africa
Those arriving in Ireland from Great Britain, should self-isolate (stay in your room) for 14 days from the date of arrival into Ireland, including after 9 January for those who have shown evidence of a negative PCR Covid-19 test. There is more information about how to self-isolate on the Irish Government website
All such travellers, whether they have symptoms or not, are asked to phone any GP or GP out-of-hours service to arrange for a COVID-19 test, which should be done as soon as possible after 5 days post-arrival. This test will be free of charge if arranged through GPs.
Please check the Irish College of General Practitioners website for a list of GPs with phone contact information, or the HSE website for your local GP out of hours service.
Taking this test will allow the HSE to identify suspect cases for this new variant of COVID-19 and control its transmission in Ireland. Notwithstanding the result of this test, you are advised to complete the entire 14 days period of self-isolation.
If at any point in the 14 days following arrival, a traveller develops any symptoms suggestive of COVID-19, they should immediately phone a GP and alert them of their recent visit from Great Britain or South Africa.
Arrivals from all other countries
Arrivals from red and grey list countries (as defined by the EU traffic light system), and all other locations outside of Europe, must continue to restrict their movements for 14 days on arrival. However this may be lifted on receipt of a negative/not detected result of a second PCR test taken no less than 5 days after arrival.
Arrivals from green and orange countries (as defined by the EU traffic light system) will not be required to restrict their movements on arrival but must adhere to the local public health guidance. Please see the Irish Government website for more details.
Exemptions from restricted movement
People arriving from Northern Ireland and people arriving from a region categorised as ‘green’ under the EU ‘traffic lights’ scheme are not required to restrict their movements. Some other defined categories of arrivals are also exempted from countries under the ‘EU traffic lights’ scheme. These include:
For a full list of people who are exempted from restricting movements on arrival please see the Irish Government website.
Post-arrival testing of passengers
From midnight on 29 November arrivals from “red”, “orange” or “grey” regions under the ‘EU traffic lights’ scheme can end their period of restricted movement if they receive a negative /‘not detected’ result of a Polymerase Chain Reaction (PCR) test that has been taken a minimum of five days after their arrival in Ireland. This does not apply to arrivals from Great Britain or South Africa. Passengers wishing to obtain a post-arrival test should seek an appointment for a test in advance of travel, should note that the test will be provided by private commercial sector testing supply and will be paid for by passengers. Such passengers should wait for their negative test result to be returned before ending the period of restricted movements. Under Ireland’s infectious disease legislation details of a positive post-arrival Covid-19 test result must be provided by the test provider to the HSE public health department for follow-up. Please see the Irish Government website for further details on all of these issues.
Data collection
From 28 May there is a legal requirement for passengers arriving in Ireland from overseas to complete a Public Health Passenger Locator Form, with penalties for non-compliance as detailed in the form.
The form may be used by health authorities to contact you to verify your location in the country. It will also help contact tracers get in touch with you if there is a confirmed case of coronavirus on your flight or ferry. You must fill in the form before you arrive in Ireland.
Regular entry requirements
ID
Ireland, along with the UK, is a member of the Common Travel Area. British nationals travelling from the UK don’t need a passport to visit Ireland. However, Irish immigration officers will check the ID of all passengers arriving by air from the UK and may ask for proof of nationality, particularly if you were born outside the UK. You are therefore advised to take your British passport with you.
For more information about the types of ID you might be asked to present, see the website of the Ireland Citizens Information Board.
Before travelling, check with your carrier about their ID requirements, as most airlines and other transport providers won’t carry passengers to and from Ireland unless they’ve seen satisfactory photographic ID.
Passport validity
If you’re using a passport to enter Ireland, it should be valid for the proposed duration of your stay; you don’t need any additional period of validity on your passport beyond this.
UK Emergency Travel Documents
UK Emergency Travel Documents (ETDs) are accepted for entry into, transit through, and exit from Ireland.
