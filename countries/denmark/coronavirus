COVID-19 Vaccines if you live in Denmark
We will update this page when the Danish government announces new information on the national vaccination programme. You can sign up to get email notifications when this page is updated.
The Danish national vaccination programme started in December 2020 and uses the Pfizer-BioNTech and Moderna vaccines. AstraZeneca and Janssen (Johnson and Johnson) may also be available. British nationals resident in Denmark are eligible for the vaccine. The Danish authorities have issued guidance (in English) on how to get a vaccine in Denmark. Vaccination is voluntary and free of charge.
Find out more, including about vaccines that are authorised in the UK or approved by the World Health Organisation, on the COVID-19 vaccines if you live abroad.
If you’re a British national living in Denmark, you should seek medical advice from your local healthcare provider. Information about COVID-19 vaccines used in the national programme where you live, including regulatory status, should be available from local authorities.
If you receive your COVID-19 vaccination in Denmark, you can get an EU Digital COVID Certificate from the national authorities. The Certificate proves that you have been vaccinated against COVID-19, received a negative test result, or recovered from COVID-19. It will help facilitate your travel within the EU and, in some countries, you can use it to demonstrate your COVID-19 status to businesses and other organisations. For further information visit the European Commission’s EU Digital COVID Certificate page.
