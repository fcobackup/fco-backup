This page has information on travelling to Finland. Check what you must do to return to the UK.
This page reflects the UK government’s understanding of current rules for people travelling on a full ‘British Citizen’ passport from the UK, for the most common types of travel.
The authorities in Finland set and enforce entry rules.
If you’re fully vaccinated
If you’re fully vaccinated, you can enter Finland without needing an essential or compassionate reason for entry. You will need to demonstrate proof of being fully vaccinated at least 7 days prior to arrival. See ‘Proof of vaccination status’ below.
If you have received a booster, you are considered fully vaccinated for entry into Finland. There is currently no expiry date for booster jabs. If you have not received a booster, but have received two doses of a vaccine approved for use by Finland, then at least 7 and no more than 270 days must have passed since your second dose, to qualify as fully vaccinated.
Find out if you qualify as fully vaccinated in Finland on the Finnish Institute for Health and Welfare’s website.
Proof of vaccination status
You must present proof that you have been fully vaccinated to enter Finland, otherwise you will need to demonstrate an essential or compassionate reason to enter.
You can use the UK’s proof of COVID-19 vaccination record or proof of COVID-19 vaccination issued in the Crown Dependencies. Your final vaccine dose must have been administered at least 7 days prior to travel. Your NHS appointment card from vaccination centres is not designed to be used as proof of vaccination and should not be used to demonstrate your vaccine status.
Residents of Finland
Permanent residents of Finland returning to Finland (e.g. persons who have registered the right of residence in Finland or with a residence permit granted by Finland) do not need to demonstrate proof of vaccination or an essential reason for entry. They will be granted entry to Finland from any country.
If you’re not fully vaccinated
If you’re not fully vaccinated, you will only be allowed to enter Finland if you can provide evidence of an essential or compassionate reason for entry. This does not include tourism.
Visit the Finnish Border Guard website (Section 3 - Entry into Finland from other countries) for full details.
If you have recovered from COVID-19 and have received one vaccine dose, you will be considered fully vaccinated by the Finnish authorities and should follow the instructions in the above section. You will need to evidence this on a single certificate. Find out if you qualify as fully vaccinated in Finland on the Finnish Institute for Health and Welfare’s website.
Alternatively, you can present an EU digital COVID certificate that proves you have recovered from COVID-19 within 6 months.
All of the above mentioned requirements apply to persons born in 2006 or earlier.
Children and young people
Young people born in 2007 or later are exempt from Finland’s COVID-19 entry requirements and they do not need to provide proof of vaccination or take a COVID-19 test, if they are ac-companied by a fully vaccinated adult guardian.
You can use the FINENTRY service to check entry requirements and book COVID-19 tests on arrival, if applicable. Visitors to Lapland can also familiarise themselves with entry requirements on the Laplandentry website.
If you’re transiting through Finland
Transiting is when you pass through one country on the way to your final destination.
There are no Finnish restrictions on cross-border traffic with other states in the Schengen area for commuter and other essential traffic. Restrictions for other travellers remain in place. See the Finnish Border Guard website for more information.
Passengers are allowed to transit through Helsinki Airport as long as they can verify acceptance at their final destination. Finavia strongly recommend that passengers use face-masks as they travel round airports in Finland, and Finnair have made the wearing of face-masks mandatory for passengers aged seven or over on their flights. Please check your carrier’s requirements before travelling.
Exemptions
Citizens of Finland, permanent residents in Finland, people travelling to Finland for essential or compassionate reasons and children born in 2007 or later are exempt from proving vaccination status or COVID-19 recovery status.
HGV drivers
HGV drivers from the UK entering Finland do not have to show a negative COVID-19 test, proof of vaccination or proof of recovery and do not have to quarantine.
Check your passport and travel documents before you travel
Passport validity
If you are planning to travel to an EU country (except Ireland), or Switzerland, Norway, Iceland, Liechtenstein, Andorra, Monaco, San Marino or Vatican City, you must follow the Schengen area passport requirements.
Your passport must be:
Issued less than 10 years before the date you enter the country (check the ‘date of issue’)
valid for at least 3 months after the day you plan to leave (check the ‘expiry date’)
You must check your passport meets these requirements before you travel. If your passport was issued before 1 October 2018, extra months may have been added to its expiry date.
Contact the embassy of the country you are visiting if you think that your passport does not meet both these requirements. Renew your passport if you need to.
Visas
You can travel to countries in the Schengen area for up to 90 days in any 180-day period without a visa. This applies if you travel as a tourist, to visit family or friends, to attend business meetings, cultural or sports events, or for short-term studies or training.
If you are travelling to Finland and other Schengen countries without a visa, make sure your whole visit is within the 90-day limit. Visits to Schengen countries within the previous 180 days before you travel count towards your 90 days.
To stay longer, to work or study, for business or for other reasons, you will need to meet the Finnish government’s entry requirements. Check with the Finnish Embassy what type of visa and/or work permit you may need.
If you are travelling to Finland for work, read the guidance on visas and permits.
If you stay in Finland with a residence permit or long-stay visa, this does not count towards your 90-day visa-free limit.
Passport stamping
Check your passport is stamped if you enter or exit the Schengen area through Finland as a visitor. Border guards will use passport stamps to check you’re complying with the 90-day visa-free limit for short stays in the Schengen area. If relevant entry or exit stamps are not in your passport, border guards will presume that you have overstayed your visa-free limit.
You can show evidence of when and where you entered or exited the Schengen area, and ask the border guards to add this date and location in your passport. Examples of acceptable evidence include boarding passes and tickets.
You may also need to:
show a return or onward ticket
show you have enough money for your stay
If you are resident in Finland, read our Living in Finland guide for passport stamping information.
Travelling with children
Minors are permitted to enter Finland with an adult who is not their legal guardian (such as grandparents) but you are advised to carry a free-form letter of consent from the legal guardian(s) including their contact details.
If you have further queries about entry to Finland you can contact the Finnish Border Guard directly on their helpline (+358 295 420 100), open Monday to Friday between 8am and 4pm Finnish local time (GMT +2).
UK Emergency Travel Documents
UK Emergency Travel Documents (ETDs) are accepted for entry, airside transit and exit from Finland.
