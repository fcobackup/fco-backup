Healthcare in Georgia
A number of medical facilities are allocated specifically for coronavirus patients, with further facilities in reserve. When cases had been low, everyone infected had been hospitalised as a precautionary measure. Since October only those with the most serious symptoms are taken to hospital. Everyone else is able to self-isolate at home, or placed in a COVID hotel if unable to self-isolate, and will be able to access medical advice and monitoring. If you think you might have symptoms of coronavirus you should call the Georgian Emergency number 112.
The Georgian National Centre for Disease Control (NCDC) has published a list of laboratories carrying out COVID testing. You should be prepared to pay up to 200 Lari (approx. £45). The list is in Georgian only.
