As the British Virgin Islands (BVI) is a British Overseas Territory, there is no formal British diplomatic or consular representation and the local authorities deal with all requests for emergency assistance.
The Foreign, Commonwealth & Development Office (FCDO) provides advice about risks of travel to help British nationals in making informed decisions. Find out more about FCDO travel advice.
A flash flood warning has been issued for the BVI because of Tropical Storm Phillipe. This means that moderate to major flooding is occurring or is imminent. All airports, Government offices and schools are closed. People are advised to stay inside and monitor updates from the BVI Department of Disaster Management DDM. Passengers due to fly to the BVI should contact their airline for further information.
