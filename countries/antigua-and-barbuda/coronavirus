Be prepared for your plans to change
No travel is risk-free during COVID-19. Countries may further restrict travel or bring in new rules at short notice, for example due to a new COVID-19 variant. Check with your travel company or airline for any transport changes which may delay your journey home.
If you test positive for COVID-19, you may need to stay where you are until you test negative. You will be contacted by the Health Authorities and instructed to self-isolate or move to a quarantine facility. This will be determined by the Quarantine Authority. You may be instructed to stay at the Government’s Quarantine facility. This would be at a charge of XCD 82 per night. You may also need to seek treatment there. Minors will be subject to the same regulations as adults.
Plan ahead and make sure you:
can access money
understand what your insurance will cover
can make arrangements to extend your stay and be away for longer than planned
