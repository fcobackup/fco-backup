Travelling from and returning to the UK
Check what you must do to travel abroad and return to England, Scotland, Wales or Northern Ireland.
If you plan to pass through another country to return to the UK, check the travel advice for the country you’re transiting.
Be prepared for your plans to change
No travel is risk-free during the COVID pandemic. Countries may further restrict travel or bring in new rules at short notice, for example, due to a new COVID-19 variant. Check with your travel company or airline for any transport changes which may delay your journey home.
If you test positive for COVID-19, you will need to stay where you are for seven days. If you do not have a place to stay, government authorities will direct you to a designated hotel if you do not have a permanent residence. Your details will be taken so the authorities can monitor your isolation.
Plan ahead and make sure you:
can access money
understand what your insurance will cover
can make arrangements to extend your stay and be away for longer than planned
International travel
Air carriers are free to operate direct flights to the UK from their usual airports in Turkey. Check their websites for the latest flight schedules.
See Entry requirements to find out what you will need to do when you arrive in Turkey.
Public spaces and services
Face masks are no longer required outdoors or indoors if air circulation and social distancing are adequate.
Turkey will accept the UK’s proof of COVID-19 recovery and vaccination record. A COVID-19 recovery certificate must have been issued no more than 6 months before arrival. Your NHS appointment card from vaccination centres is not designed to be used as proof of vaccination and should not be used to demonstrate your vaccine status.
Healthcare in Turkey
You should ensure that you are prepared for any unplanned or extended stays due to changes in COVID-related restrictions or your travel arrangements. If you take regular medication, make sure you have adequate supplies to cover you in case you are required to quarantine as a result of a positive COVID test.
British-issued prescriptions are not accepted in pharmacies in Turkey, although some medicines may be available over the counter.
If your medical supplies do run out whilst in Turkey it may be possible, in some cases, to liaise with Turkish hospitals and your GP to arrange for a Turkish prescription for the equivalent medicine. For contact details for English speaking doctors visit our list of healthcare providers.
Your emotional and mental wellbeing is important. Read guidance on how to look after your mental wellbeing and mental health.

COVID-19 vaccines if you live in Turkey
We will update this page when the Government of Turkey announces new information on the national vaccination programme. You can sign up to get email notifications when this page is updated.
The Turkish national vaccination programme started in January 2021 and is using the Pfizer-BioNTech and Sinovac vaccines. The Government of Turkey has stated that British nationals resident in Turkey are eligible for vaccination if they choose to join the programme. If you have not yet registered with the Turkish health service you should do so through the Enabiz website.
The details of foreign nationals may not automatically be included in the system which sends out automatic appointments. Even if you are already registered on the Enabiz system, you may still need to request a vaccine through the Enabiz website.
Find out more, including about vaccines that are authorised in the UK or approved by the World Health Organisation, on the COVID-19 vaccines if you live abroad.
If you’re a British national living in Turkey, you should seek medical advice from your local healthcare provider. Information about COVID-19 vaccines used in the national programme where you live, including regulatory status, should be available from local authorities.
