Local currency (Ouguiya) is not convertible and canâ€™t be exported. US dollars and euros can be changed for Ouguiyas at banks, some hotels and official bureaux de change. The sterling rate is very poor. Credit cards can be used at a few hotels in Nouakchott and Nouadhibou; some hotels only accept Visa cards. Some ATMs accept foreign credit or debit cards.
