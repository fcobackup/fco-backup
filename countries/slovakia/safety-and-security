Terrorism in Slovakia
Terrorist attacks in Slovakia cannot be ruled out.
Attacks could be indiscriminate, including in places visited by foreign nationals. Stay aware of your surroundings, keep up to date with local media reports and follow the advice of local authorities.
An attack on a bar popular with the LGBT+ community in the capital, Bratislava, on 12 October 2022, which resulted in 2 deaths, was classified as a terrorist act. Prior to this attack, there was no recent history of terrorism in Slovakia.
Border with Ukraine
There is widespread military activity in Ukraine. See warnings against travel in Ukraine travel advice.
Political demonstrations
Demonstrations may start with little or no warning. Follow the advice of local authorities.
Crime
Protecting your belongings
There is a risk of petty crime, especially in Bratislava. Take precautions against pickpockets and bag snatchers and do not leave your possessions unattended. Pickpockets operate around the main tourist areas, particularly the Christmas markets and in bars, and have targeted foreign nationals.
Do not leave your passport as a deposit for services such as car rental. Keep sight of your bank card when making payments. 
Drink spiking and scams
There is a risk of drink spiking and theft in clubs around the Bratislava Old Town pedestrian area. People have sometimes been charged extortionate prices for drinks, so check prices before ordering.  
Vehicle crime
Criminals sometimes target foreign-registered vehicles. They may puncture your tyres at a petrol station and then pretend to help or fake a breakdown. If you stop to help, they may rob you or steal your car.
At night, only stop your car in a well-lit public area such as a service station. Make sure you lock your car and be extremely wary of anyone offering help.
Do not leave luggage in view in your car.
Laws and cultural differences
Personal ID
You must always carry your passport with you as ID. You can get a fine of up to 1,600 euros for not showing ID if the Slovak police ask for it.
Illegal drugs
Illegal drugs, including cannabis, carry severe penalties. You should expect a long jail sentence and heavy fines for possessing, using or smuggling illegal drugs, including when transiting through the airport.
Airports in Slovakia have excellent technology and security for detecting illegal items. This is also used to scan the baggage of transiting passengers.
Alcohol laws
Bratislava has become a popular destination for stag parties. Tourists have been fined or imprisoned for being a public nuisance. Unruly or rowdy behaviour is illegal could attract police attention, particularly between 10pm and 6am. In Bratislava Old Town, it is illegal to drink alcohol in the street. If you drink alcohol (for example, bought in a supermarket) in this or other public areas, you could get a fine of 33 euros.
Using cameras in secure areas
Taking photos of any location that could be seen as a military establishment or security related may result in problems with the authorities.
LGBT+ travellers
Same-sex sexual relationships are legal in Slovakia, but Slovak law does not recognise same-sex marriages and civil partnerships. Same-sex couples showing affection in public may receive unwanted attention.

Transport risks
Road travel
If you are planning to drive in Slovakia, see information on driving abroad and check the rules of the road in the RAC’s Slovakia guide. The guide lists driving regulations and other legal requirements you need to be aware of. 
You can use a UK photocard driving licence to drive in Slovakia for up to 6 months. If you still have a paper driving licence, you may need to update it to a photocard licence or get the 1968 version of the international driving permit (IDP) as well.  
If you stay longer than 6 months, you must exchange your licence for a Slovak one.
Hire car companies often have stricter requirements for their customers, such as a year of driving experience, a higher minimum age and holding an IDP . 
Drink-driving is a serious offence in Slovakia. If you are tested and found to have any alcohol in your system, you may get a fine of up to 1,300 euros, have your licence confiscated and face possible imprisonment.
Road conditions
Many main roads have only a single carriageway in each direction making overtaking difficult. Beware of oncoming cars overtaking on your side of the road. Road markings are difficult to see in poor weather and can be faded. In winter, you must equip your car for severe driving conditions.
Tolls
If you use Slovak motorways (‘Dialnica’), you must display a motorway vignette (sticker) on the inside of your windscreen as you enter Slovakia. If you do not, you could get a heavy fine. You can get a motorway vignette at all major border crossings into Slovakia and at larger petrol stations. More information and a road network map is available from the toll system operator.
Taxis
Only use officially licensed taxis. Drivers must display their licence. Take sensible precautions, particularly at night or if you are alone. Do not get into a taxi if you are concerned about the driver or condition of the vehicle. Taxi drivers sometimes try to overcharge tourists by adding unauthorised supplements or by not setting the meter at the start of a journey. Make sure the taxi meter is on or agree a set price for the journey beforehand. See information on local taxi use.
