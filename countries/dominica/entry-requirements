This information is for people travelling on a full ‘British citizen’ passport from the UK. It is based on the UK government’s understanding of Dominica’s current rules for the most common types of travel.
The authorities in Dominica set and enforce entry rules. If you’re not sure how these requirements apply to you, contact the Dominica High Commission in the UK. 
Passport validity requirements 
To enter Dominica, your passport must have an ‘expiry date’ at least 6 months after the date you arrive. 
Check with your travel provider that your passport and other travel documents meet requirements. Renew your passport if you need to.  
You will be denied entry if you do not have a valid travel document or try to use a passport that has been reported lost or stolen. 
Visa requirements 
You do not need a visa to visit Dominica. The border authorities will grant you a stay of 6 months on arrival. If you want to stay longer, you must arrange and pay for an extension with the Dominica Immigration Division. 
It is illegal to overstay or work without a work permit. 
Checks at border control 
At border control, you may also need to show a return or onward ticket. 
Departure tax 
There is a departure tax of 86 East Caribbean dollars or 33 US dollars. It is usually included in the cost of your plane ticket. You also need to pay departure tax if travelling by ferry. 
Vaccine requirements  
To enter Dominica, you must have a certificate to prove you’ve had a yellow fever vaccination if you’re coming from a country listed as a transmission risk.
For full details about medical entry requirements and recommended vaccinations, see TravelHealthPro’s Dominica guide. 
Customs rules 
There are strict rules about goods you can take into or out of Dominica. You must declare anything that may be prohibited or subject to tax or duty. 
Taking money into Dominica   
Declare cash or travellers cheques if the value is 10,000 East Caribbean dollars or more. You will get a certified declaration to show you brought it in with you.
