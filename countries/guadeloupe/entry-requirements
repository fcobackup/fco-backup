This page reflects the UK government’s understanding of current rules for people travelling on a full ‘British Citizen’ passport, for the most common types of travel.
The authorities in Guadeloupe set and enforce entry rules. For further information contact the embassy, high commission or consulate of the country or territory you’re travelling to. You should also consider checking with your transport provider or travel company to make sure your passport and other travel documents meet their requirements.
Entry rules in response to coronavirus (COVID-19)
The French government website currently advises that travel to and from all French overseas territories is only possible if you have compelling reasons for travel, with the exception of those who are fully vaccinated, and on condition of a negative PCR or antigen test result.
Restrictions are in place for entry to Guadeloupe depending on your vaccination status and your country of departure. Please check the website of the local Prefecture (in French) on the current requirements for entry. For more information on specific entry measures, you should consult the French government website and this French government COVID-19 website (in French).
Regular entry requirements
Visas
Guadeloupe is an Overseas Department of France (département d’outre-mer).
If your passport describes you as a British Citizen, you will not need a visa to enter Guadeloupe. Other British passport holders should check the current entry requirements on the website of the French Ministry of Foreign Affairs and if necessary confirm with the nearest French Diplomatic mission.
If the UK leaves the EU without a deal, the current visa policy for British Citizens visiting Guadeloupe may change. We’re working with the relevant authorities to clarify entry requirements and this page will be updated as soon as further information is available. If you would like more details in the meantime, or want to discuss a specific issue, you should consult the French Embassy in London. If you’re a British Overseas Territories Citizen passport holder the current visa policy for travel to Guadeloupe will be unaffected by the UK leaving the EU.
Passport validity
Travellers should ensure that their passport has at least 3 months of validity after the date you intend to leave Guadeloupe.
Check your passport is valid for travel before you book your trip. You will need to renew your passport before travelling if you do not have enough time left on your passport.
Yellow fever certificate requirements
Check whether you need a yellow fever certificate by visiting the National Travel Health Network and Centre’s TravelHealthPro website.
UK Emergency Travel Documents
UK ETDs are accepted for entry, airside transit and exit from Guadeloupe.
