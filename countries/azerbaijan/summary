The FCO advise against all travel to:

The Azerbaijani Government has introduced a number of measures to limit the spread of the virus. This includes the mandatory quarantining of all arrivals from abroad for 14 days. Additionally, the Government, has increased restrictions on movement. People should only leave their home for an essential purpose: to obtain food or medicine, to work in an identified key sector, to seek medical treatment or if in danger. Use of private cars should only be for serious need. Please refer to our Facebook page for a list of the key sectors.
Restrictive measures have been extended until 4 May to combat the spread of COVID-19. Those working in key sectors will need to have their employer register them online. You may need to show your ID or certificate to a police officer when travelling to and from work. Please refer to our Facebook page for the list of key sectors, registration details and information about how to obtain permission to leave your place of residence if you are not working in a key sector.

The Azerbaijani authorities have extended the suspension of all commercial passenger flights in to and out of Azerbaijan until 4 May. If you are booked on to an AZAL flight which has been cancelled you should speak with the airline or your travel agent. See Return to the UK
Around 30,000 British nationals visit Azerbaijan every year, mainly on business. Most visits are trouble free.
All British nationals travelling to Azerbaijan must get a visa in advance. The Azerbaijani authorities have announced from 13 March the ASAN Visa service (e-visas) are temporarily suspended. E-visas issued before the suspension of the service but which have not yet been used for entry in to Azerbaijan have been annulled. See Safety and Security
Consular support is not available in the Nagorno-Karabakh region. Tensions between Azerbaijan and Armenia over Nagorno-Karabakh continue. Several ceasefire violations along the Line of Contact separating the opposing forces and elsewhere on the inter-state border between Azerbaijan and Armenia took place in 2018, resulting in a number of deaths and casualties. Anyone who has visited Nagorno-Karabakh without the permission of the Azerbaijani authorities will be refused entry to Azerbaijan. See Local travel
Terrorists are likely to try to carry out attacks in Azerbaijan. See Terrorism
