Quarantine requirements
The Colombian Government has recently reintroduced the requirement to present a negative PCR test 96 hours prior to boarding a flight for all passengers and that with this it is not mandatory to observe quarantine.
Any passenger from abroad who is not able to take the Covid test can travel, explaining verbally without having to complete any format, to the airline the reasons why it was not possible to take the test. All airlines and the Colombia Immigration Agency have already received instructions on this new rule and must allow passengers to board. In this case, once the passenger arrives in Colombia, the Covid test must be taken and quarantine observed while the test result comes out. If the test is negative, the person can continue with their normal daily activities, but if the test is positive, the person must observe mandatory preventive isolation of 14 days.
Passengers arriving in Colombia from other destinations, and whose journey has started in the UK, will be required to self-isolate for 14 days on arrival.
