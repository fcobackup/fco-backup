Be prepared for your plans to change
No travel is risk-free during COVID-19. Countries may further restrict travel or bring in new rules at short notice, for example due to a new COVID-19 variant. Check with your travel company or airline for any transport changes which may delay your journey home.
If you test positive for COVID-19 in Finland, you will receive instructions from the Finnish authorities and will be asked to self-isolate. You may also need to seek treatment there.
Plan ahead and make sure you:
can access money
understand what your insurance will cover (including COVID-19 related costs if you have to stay longer than planned)
can make arrangements to extend your stay and be away for longer than planned. There have been several incidences where people have had to quarantine for up to 10 days in Finland at their own cost
Public spaces and services
The Finnish authorities have lifted the general recommendation on the use of face masks. Wearing a mask is still recommended in public indoor spaces and on public transport if you are seeking treatment or a test due to a suspected COVID-19 infection, have symptoms of a respiratory infection, or if you know you have been exposed to coronavirus.
