If you plan to pass through another country to return to the UK, check the travel advice for the country you’re transiting. If you will pass through a red list country, book your hotel quarantine package before travelling to the UK.
You are responsible for organizing your own COVID-19 test, in line with any UK government testing requirements. You should check that the test result can be provided in the correct format and language.
Be prepared for your plans to change
No travel is risk-free during COVID-19. Countries may further restrict travel or bring in new rules at short notice, for example due to a new COVID-19 variant. Check with your travel company or airline for any transport changes which may delay your journey home.
Plan ahead and make sure you:
can access money
understand what your insurance will cover
can make arrangements to extend your stay and be away for longer than planned
If you test positive for COVID, or have been in contact with a confirmed case of COVID-19, you must self-isolate in a hotel or private accommodation. If you do not have symptoms, you must self-isolate until advised otherwise by their doctor, after testing negative, or for 7 days. If you test positive and are showing symptoms, you must self-isolate for 7 days after developing symptoms.
If you are forced to self-isolate, please make sure you have a plan for ensuring continued access to supplies such as food, as there is no government provision.
These measures are the same for all ages.
