COVID-19 entry restrictions for Lebanon
Before you travel, check the ‘Entry requirements’ section for Lebanon’s current entry restrictions and requirements. These may change with little warning. Monitor this advice for the latest updates and stay in contact with your travel provider.
Returning to the UK
Lebanon is on the amber list for entering England. Check what you must do to enter England, Scotland, Wales or Northern Ireland.
Due to specific issues with the reliability of fuel supplies and the impact on critical services in Lebanon, some staff and dependents in the British Embassy are being temporarily withdrawn. The Embassy will continue to carry out essential work including providing 24/7 consular assistance and support to British people in Lebanon. See Safety and security
Basic commodities (fuel, medicines, food) have become increasingly scarce due to the economic crisis. See Safety and security for further information on the impact and how to prepare yourself.
COVID-19 lockdown measures have been largely lifted, although they can change at short notice. Public places such as restaurants, theatres, cinemas, cafes and gyms are allowed to open, and supermarkets, pharmacies and restaurant delivery services can operate. Hotels are allowed to open 24/7. However, many businesses are now being affected by fuel shortages so you should call ahead to confirm that they are open. You must apply online via this platform to undertake certain activities such as going to the bank and going food shopping. Certain activities e.g. going to clothes shops or veterinary clinics do not require this authorisation. See Coronavirus
Protests against the political and economic situation in Lebanon, are continuing. Protests can occur nationwide, including in Beirut, Tripoli, the Beqaa Valley, Saida and the South, often with little notice. Violent confrontations between protesters, security forces and supporters of political groups have occurred across the country, often resulting in injuries to protestors and security forces. You should avoid protests, remain vigilant and follow the advice of the local authorities.
As a result of protests, major roads (including to and from Beirut airport) have been blocked, banks and businesses have closed. See Political situation
On 4 August 2020 a large explosion occurred in the port area of Beirut causing widespread damage to buildings and infrastructure in the city and surrounding areas. Many of the buildings have not been repaired yet and you should exercise caution in affected areas as buildings may not be safe.

A conflict with Israel could spark with little warning and lead to a rapid escalation in violence. There have been exchanges with the Israeli Defence Forces across the Blue Line in the South of Lebanon. This has included cross-border shelling and air strikes on Lebanon. See Security situation
Terrorists are very likely to try to carry out attacks in Lebanon. You should be vigilant at all times, avoid crowds and crowded places and follow the advice of the Lebanese authorities. Previous attacks have targeted the security forces, as well as locations where Western visitors may congregate. There have been large scale counter-terrorism operations in recent months in North Lebanon. You should follow the advice of the local authorities, and check local news and this travel advice regularly. See Terrorism
There’s a heightened risk of terrorism against aviation. Additional security measures have been in place on flights departing from Lebanon to the UK since March 2017. You should co-operate fully with security officials.
Groups within Lebanon, including Hizballah, are proscribed under the Terrorism Act 2000 and the Counter Terrorism (Sanctions) (EU Exit) Regulations 2019. Offences committed under the act – including funding and supporting proscribed organisations – may be liable to prosecution in the UK.
There are unexploded ordnance and land mines in many places. You should avoid travelling away from established paths, especially when hiking. This is particularly a concern in southern Lebanon. See Local travel
You can contact the emergency services by calling 112.
If you’re abroad and you need emergency help from the UK government, contact the nearest British embassy, consulate or high commission. Consular support is severely limited in parts of Lebanon where we advise against all travel and limited where we advise against all but essential travel.
