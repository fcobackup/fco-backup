Travel in Finland
The Finnish authorities introduced a number of measures to limit the spread of the virus. These measures include more stringent controls on people arriving from abroad. See the Finnish Border Guard website for more details. From 29 March, this will include the right to order a compulsory health examination, which could include a COVID-19 test, on arrival.
Travel around Finland is still permitted, with some restrictions on the opening hours of restaurants, cafes and bars in some regions. Visit the THL website for details of regional restrictions. The Finnish authorities recommend the use of face masks when travelling on public transport and in other situations where maintaining safe distances is not possible. For further details visit the THL website. The wearing of facemasks on trains and on other public transport in some areas (including Helsinki) is now compulsory. Please check details before travelling. There are also restrictions on public premises and events. Check the Helsinki City website for more details and guidance on restrictions. The coronavirus situation around Finland can vary widely, so local advice should be followed.

COVID-19 Vaccines if you live in Finland
Wherever possible British nationals should aim to be vaccinated in the country where they live. As further information is available about the national vaccination programme, this page will be updated. Sign up to get email notifications.
The Finnish vaccine programme started on 27 December and includes all residents aged 16 years or older. The vaccine is voluntary and free of charge. The Finnish authorities have issued guidance on COVID-19 vaccines in Finland.
The Medicines and Healthcare Products Regulatory Agency (MHRA) is the UK authority responsible for assessing the safety, quality and efficacy of vaccines. It has authorised the Pfizer/BioNTech, Oxford/AstraZeneca and Moderna vaccines for temporary supply and use in the UK. Find out more about MHRA approval for these vaccines.
British nationals living overseas should seek medical advice from their local healthcare provider in the country where they reside. Information about vaccines used in other national programmes, including regulatory status, should be available from the local authorities. This list of Stringent Regulatory Authorities recognised by the World Health Organisation may also be a useful source of additional information.
