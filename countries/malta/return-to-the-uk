There remain commercial options to return to the UK from Malta. If you live in the UK and are currently visiting Malta, you’re strongly advised to return now by commercial means. Don’t run the risk of getting stranded.
UK special charter flights will only operate for priority countries where commercial flights are not possible. You should not assume that these flights will become available in countries, like Malta, where commercial routes are operating. Please do not contact the contracted travel management company if no flight is advertised here.
The Maltese Government has also implemented a repatriation scheme for any foreign nationals who have a valid Maltese Residence card and who wish to return to their home countries. You can register your request for assistance by visiting foreignandeu.gov.mt/apply. For further details you can contact the authorities on +356 2204 2800 or repatriation.mfea@gov.mt.
Air Malta flights
Air Malta has exceptionally arranged to maintain a flight to London Heathrow, currently five times a week, for a limited period subject to demand. Anyone wishing to leave Malta for the UK on this flight should, make an online booking in the normal way. Any passenger must have the right to enter the UK. No person with a temperature or other symptoms of COVID-19 will be allowed to travel.
You will need to pay for your return travel to the UK. If departure options are available but you cannot afford the travel costs and have exhausted all other options for getting funds, you may be eligible to apply for an emergency loan from the government. This is a last resort option and you would need to repay the loan when you are back in the UK. For more information, you should contact Corporate Travel Management (CTM). CTM are a commercial partner of the FCO and are authorised to administer such loans on behalf of the FCO.
