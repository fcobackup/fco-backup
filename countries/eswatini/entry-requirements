The information on this page covers the most common types of travel and reflects the UK government’s understanding of the rules currently in place. Unless otherwise stated, this information is for travellers using a full ‘British Citizen’ passport.
The authorities in the country or territory you’re travelling to are responsible for setting and enforcing the rules for entry. If you’re unclear about any aspect of the entry requirements, or you need further reassurance, you’ll need to contact the embassy, high commission or consulate of the country or territory you’re travelling to.
You should also consider checking with your transport provider or travel company to make sure your passport and other travel documents meet their requirements.
Visa
British passport holders do not require visas for Eswatini. Visitors will normally be given entry permission for up to 30 days. This can be extended at the Eswatini Immigration Department in Mbabane. All Eswatini border posts open daily throughout the year, but hours of operation are variable.
Passport validity
Your passport should be valid for a minimum period of 3 months from the date of entry into Eswatini and have at least 2 blank pages.
If you intend to visit South Africa before or after travelling to Eswatini, you’ll need to have an additional 2 blank pages to enter and leave South Africa.
