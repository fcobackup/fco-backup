Political situation
Following sustained gunfire on 5 September 2021 there has been an attempted coup in Conakry. The situation is evolving and you should remain vigilant, monitor local media and avoid movement. Leaders of the attempted coup have announced that land borders are closed for a week. Some airlines have cancelled flights. You should contact your airline for further information.
Political tensions are high. Demonstrations are likely to continue following the presidential elections that were held on 18 October 2020. Public gatherings and demonstrations can be called with little or no notice and can quickly turn violent. You should avoid the demonstrations and crowds, remain aware of your surroundings, moving quickly to a safe place if you see signs of disturbances or unrest, and monitor the local media for any changes.
In recent years there have been many deaths of protestors and bystanders during protests as well as hundreds injured.
You should remain vigilant and aware of your surroundings, particularly when roads are blocked and crowds are gathering. Avoid large demonstrations or rallies (both political and non-political), particularly those close to military barracks and regularly monitor local and international media reports.
“Villes mortes” (general strikes) do happen intermittently and you should be particularly vigilant when these occur.
Local travel
Areas of Guinea bordering Senegal, Guinea Bissau, Côte d’Ivoire, Liberia and Sierra Leone are often tense with an increased military presence.
Protests in Middle Guinea in January 2020 led to several public buildings being ransacked and set on fire and increased criminal activity. The security situation has improved in Middle Guinea but tensions remain, particularly around large events such as the recent presidential elections. Tensions are likely to continue. There have been a number violent demonstrations this year in Kankan and Siguiri protesting against the lack of electricity. You should exercise caution and be vigilant. Stay clear of demonstrations and monitor local media carefully.
Road travel
All valid UK driving licences should be accepted. If you have a driving licence that is not of the European Communities model, you may wish to voluntarily update your licence before travel as acceptance cannot be guaranteed.
Alternatively, older licences may be accompanied by an International Driving Permit. You can get International Driving Permits over the counter from 2,500 UK Post Offices. You will not be able to buy an International Driving Permit outside the UK, so get one before you travel.
Road travel is hazardous during the rainy season from May to October. Torrential rains can cause floods and landslides. Monitor local weather reports and expect difficulties when travelling to affected areas during this season. Avoid travel outside cities after dark.
Taxis and long distance buses are poorly maintained, and the drivers often unqualified. Few motorists have any form of insurance. Most major hotels and travel agencies offer cars for hire, with a chauffeur if required.
The standard of road maintenance is low. Beware of deep potholes. Many roads are not metalled and are not repaired after the rainy season. Roads within Conakry and other principal towns can quickly become flooded and impassable.  
Supplies of fuel may run low from time to time; it is worth considering carrying an emergency stock, especially when making a long journey.
Police and local militia maintain checkpoints across the country. Vehicles and passengers are submitted to checks on documentation and baggage. Corruption and extortion are common at roadblocks. Occasionally, checkpoints can be a pretext for armed robbery.
Air travel
The Airport is gradually opening to commercial flights. The FCDO cannot offer advice on the safety of individual airlines.
Flights in Guinea are frequently delayed or cancelled.
If you plan to arrive in Conakry on a flight after dark, you should arrange your airport transfer before you travel.
