The political and security situation remains uncertain across Bolivia following an extended period of wide-scale political demonstrations and civil unrest since disputed elections in October 2019, and the resignation of the President and senior public officials on 10 November. An interim government is now in place ahead of fresh elections.
Protests are still occurring in the city of Cochabamba and further demonstrations are likely to take place elsewhere in Bolivia at short notice. These could turn violent without warning. Many previous demonstrations in La Paz city centre and other major towns and cities have resulted in violence, including in some cases the deaths of protesters.
You should continue to avoid large crowds and public demonstrations, don’t attempt to cross blockades, and pay close attention to developments via local media and this travel advice. If you’re intending to travel within Bolivia, you should plan your travel carefully, regularly check the viability of your plans and be prepared to change them at short notice.
There has been disruption to flights and access to airports in recent weeks, particularly at El Alto airport in La Paz, and increased levels of disruption remain possible. If you’re planning to travel to or from El Alto airport, contact your airline or travel company for the latest information before you leave for the airport and check with the authorities on arrival that ground transport is functioning normally before leaving the terminal.
