The Ukrainian government has recently announced the resumption of international flights from 15 June.
If you leave Ukraine via a third country, you may need evidence of onward travel, for example, a flight ticket to your next destination. Measures imposed by some third countries to combat coronavirus include restricting entry of foreign nationals and suspending flight operations in those countries. Please check FCO Travel Advice for other countries on your route and with any airlines for flights you may wish to take. You should consult Customer Service’s interactive map for information on the status of checkpoints at Ukraine’s borders.
You will need to pay for your return travel to the UK. If you cannot afford the travel costs and have exhausted all other options for getting funds, you may be eligible to apply for an emergency loan from the government. This is a last resort option and you would need to repay the loan when you are back in the UK.
For more information, you should contact Corporate Travel Management (CTM). CTM are a commercial partner of the FCO and are authorised to administer such loans on behalf of the FCO.
Your journey home: re-entering the UK
When you return, you must follow the rules for entering the UK. You:
need to provide your journey and contact details up to 48 hours before you’re due to arrive in the UK
are not allowed to leave the place you’re staying for the first 14 days you’re in the UK except in very limited situations (known as ‘self-isolating’)
See also the list of people who are exempt from the border rules.
The National Travel Health Network and Centre (NaTHNaC) also provides advice on how to stay safe as you travel by air.
