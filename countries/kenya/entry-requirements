Warning
FCDO advises against all but essential travel to parts of Kenya.

This advice reflects the UK government’s understanding of current rules for people travelling on a full ‘British citizen’ passport from the UK, for the most common types of travel.
The authorities in Kenya set and enforce entry rules. If you’re not sure how these requirements apply to you, contact the Kenya High Commission in the UK.
COVID-19 rules
You do not need a negative COVID-19 test or proof of vaccination to enter Kenya.
If you have flu-like symptoms when you arrive, you must take one or more COVID-19 tests at your own expense. If tests show you have COVID-19, you must isolate. For more information see COVID-19 travel requirements from the Kenyan Civil Aviation Authority.
Passport validity requirements
To enter Kenya, your passport must have:
an ‘expiry date’ at least 6 months after the date you arrive
at least 2 blank pages
Check with your travel provider that your passport and other travel documents meet requirements. Renew your passport if you need to. 
You will be denied entry if you do not have a valid travel document or try to use a passport that has been reported lost or stolen.
Visa requirements
You must have a visa to visit Kenya if you are aged 16 and over.
For more information see visa information from the Kenyan High Commission in London or check which type of visa or work permit you need with the Kenyan Department of Immigration. If you plan to work in Kenya, you must have a work permit. This includes voluntary work and if you are self-employed.
Applying for a visa
You must get a Kenyan e-visa before you travel by applying online.
Vaccine requirements
At least 8 weeks before your trip, check the vaccinations and certificates you need in TravelHealthPro’s Kenya guide.
Depending on your circumstances, these may include a yellow fever certificate.
Customs rules
There are strict rules about goods you can take into or out of Kenya. You must declare anything that may be prohibited or subject to tax or duty.
Drones
It is illegal import or export drones without prior approval from the Kenyan Civil Aviation Authority (KCAA). Contact the KCAA well in advance of travel if you wish to bring a drone to Kenya.
