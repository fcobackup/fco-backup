Crime
Crime levels are low, but there are occasional incidents of petty crime against tourists as well as house burglaries. Take particular care of your passport, avoid carrying valuables with you and do not leave possessions in unattended vehicles, even if out of sight in a locked boot.
Road travel
Drivers of vehicles not registered in Brunei can only purchase motor fuel at 10 designated filling stations throughout the country, to a maximum of 250 litres. Filling a foreign car is more expensive as the purchase price does not include a government subsidy.
You can drive in Brunei with a UK driving licence for up to 3 months. Alternatively, you can use an International Driving Permit (for up to three months).
Driving standards differ from the UK. Traffic will not always stop at red lights or pedestrian crossings. Speeding and non use of seatbelts is common. Road conditions are generally good but you should take extra care while driving through heavy rain as road surfaces are uneven.
If you’re involved in a road accident as a driver, you should not leave the scene or move the vehicle until the police have attended.   
Trekking
Police advise individuals against hiking alone in the forest, including at well-known recreation areas. It’s easy to get lost when visiting the rainforest. Use recognised and well-known guides, and stay on the footpaths.
Political Situation
Demonstrations or large public gatherings are unlikely in Brunei. Keep yourself informed through the local media.
