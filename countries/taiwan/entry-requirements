This page has information on travelling to Taiwan.
This page reflects the UK government’s understanding of current rules for people travelling on a full ‘British Citizen’ passport from the UK, for the most common types of travel.
Rules to enter Taiwan change frequently. You should keep up to date with the latest information on the websites of the Central Epidemic Command Center, National Immigration Agency, Ministry of Foreign Affairs and the Taipei Representative Office in the UK.
The authorities in Taiwan set and enforce entry rules. If you’re unsure how Taiwan’s entry requirements apply to you, please contact your local Taipei representative office or embassy.
All travellers
On 12 September 2022, Taiwan reinstated visa-exempt entry for British passport holders. British visitors are permitted to spend up to 90 days in Taiwan under this scheme for tourism, international exchanges and business purposes.
If you are unsure whether you are permitted to enter Taiwan, or have further questions about the resumption of the visa-exempt entry scheme, you should contact your local Taipei representative office or embassy before you attempt to travel. Entry procedures are being regularly reviewed so may change at short notice.
Passengers entering Taiwan under the visa-exempt entry scheme will be required to undergo the self-screening on arrival and epidemic prevention requirements, as set out below.
Epidemic prevention requirements for passengers arriving in Taiwan
The Central Epidemic Command Center (CECC) has announced that from 13 October 2022, the previously mandatory quarantine requirement for international arrivals in Taiwan has been replaced with a 7 day self-initiated epidemic prevention period. There will be a maximum ceiling of 150,000 arrivals permitted per week into Taiwan.
British passport holders arriving in Taiwan will no longer be required to make a health declaration on the Quarantine System for Entry website or purchase a Taiwanese SIM card upon arrival.
Passengers arriving in Taiwan from overseas are now permitted to take public transportation from the airport.
On arrival, passengers aged 2 years and above will receive 4 self-administered rapid COVID-19 test (rapid test) kits. You will be required to take a rapid test on day 0 or day 1 of your 7 day self-initiated epidemic prevention (SIEP) period and will be permitted to leave your accommodation only if you test negative. There is no longer an obligation to report your test results to the health authorities.
Should you decide to leave your accommodation during the 7 day SIEP period, you will be required to take further rapid tests at intervals of no more than 48 hours. Those leaving their accommodation on day 2 or 3 (depending on whether you took your rapid test on day 0 or day 1) would need to take a rapid test on days 2 or 3 and then each 48 hours afterwards. The Taiwanese authorities will cover the costs of the 4 rapid COVID-19 test kits.
Passengers arriving in Taiwan should follow the CECC guidelines on one person per room (with a private bathroom) during their 7 day self-initiated epidemic prevention period. Face masks should be worn at all times when leaving your accommodation.
You may contact your local health department or the Taiwan Centers for Disease Control (CDC) for immediate medical assistance if you suspect that you may have contracted COVID-19, or have experienced any suspected COVID-19 symptoms. If you are unable to speak to anyone at the CDC you can telephone the British Office Taipei for support.
You should refer to the Taiwan Centers for Disease Control (CDC) or contact their helpline on 1922 for further information.

Entry procedures are being regularly reviewed, so may change at short notice.
Visa extensions
The National Immigration Agency (NIA) has announced that from 25 October 2022, the automatic visa extension programme in Taiwan will finish. Foreign nationals who have been granted an automatic visa extension by the NIA will need to depart Taiwan before the end of their 30 day visa extension.
You should contact the National Immigration Agency or visit one of the NIA Service Centres for further information. The British Office Taipei is unable to issue letters or endorsements to support any application to remain.
British nationals in Taiwan who hold a Youth Mobility Scheme (YMS) visa are able to apply to switch in Taiwan to a working visa or a visa to study a degree course at undergraduate level or higher.
All applications should be submitted to the Bureau of Consular Affairs (BOCA) for consideration. You will then be able to apply for an Alien Resident Card at your local National Immigration Agency (NIA) Service Center once your application has been approved. You should contact the Bureau of Consular Affairs or National Immigration Agency for further information.
