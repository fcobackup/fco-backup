See the TravelHealthPro website for further advice on travel abroad and reducing spread of respiratory viruses during the COVID-19 pandemic.
International travel
International commercial passenger flights are operating with restrictions. You should check with airlines to confirm what flight options are available. Flight schedules are subject to change at short notice and you should monitor travel arrangements closely.
In addition to the COVID-19 test requirements for entry (see Entry requirements), the government also require passengers to carry a negative test certificate for COVID-19, issued by a government authorised facility, on departure from Bangladesh. Airlines may have slightly different requirements and you should confirm that your test also meets the specific requirements of your airline in advance of your departure.
If your journey to or from Bangladesh includes a transit stop you may need to meet separate COVID-19 certificate requirements for that country. You should check the requirements for all locations in your journey, both transit and final destinations, before travelling. For further guidance you should check with your airline and visit the travel advice pages for countries on your route.

Moving around in Bangladesh
As part of COVID-19 measures, the Government of Bangladesh has introduced restrictions on movements. All forms of public transport, including inter-district, are operating with limited passenger capacity. Domestic air travel is operating a limited service. Further restrictions may come into force at short notice.
Face masks must be worn at all times when moving in and around Bangladesh. You should also wear a mask at home if anyone in your household is displaying COVID-19 symptoms.
Curfew
The Government is requiring people to stay at home. People should only leave their homes if there is an urgent need. Anyone not complying with these requests risks legal action.
Businesses and services
Shops and restaurants, including shopping malls, are operating reduced hours. Banking services are also likely to be affected. Emergency services including hospitals remain open. At short notice local authorities may lockdown buildings, streets and areas in order to control the spread of coronavirus.
Accommodation
Some hotels and guesthouses are open, but services and guest capacity are limited. In areas with high infection rates hotels and guesthouses may close completely. Check with your travel or accommodation provider.
Healthcare in Bangladesh
If you’re running out of medication and need to get more, you should visit the nearest pharmacy or ask for assistance from family/friends or your accommodation provider. If the same medication you’re on is not available, consult a local doctor for a Bangladeshi alternative or go to the nearest hospital.
You should carry any medical papers or prescriptions and be prepared to answer questions if stopped by law enforcement authorities.
In case of any emergency, you can dial the Bangladesh National Emergency Hotline - 999 from your mobile/telephone for any assistance whilst in Bangladesh.
