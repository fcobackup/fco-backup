Honduras is particularly susceptible to hurricanes, flooding and earthquakes. Drought and forest fires are also common.
Hurricanes
Hurricane Iota is forecast to make landfall in Nicaragua on the morning of 17 November. It is expected to strengthen to a category five hurricane, potentially causing catastrophic damage as it moves inland. Extreme winds and life-threatening storm surge are expected along portions of coast in Nicaragua and Honduras. Flash flooding and landslides are likely and could be exacerbated following Hurricane Eta’s recent impact. You should monitor local and international weather updates from the US National Hurricane Centre. Follow the advice of local authorities, including any evacuation orders.
The hurricane season in Honduras normally runs from June to November. Roads throughout the country can be affected by landslides and flooding. You should monitor weather updates from the National Hurricane Centre. For information in Spanish, see the Honduran national civil protection website (COPECO).

Earthquakes
Make sure you know what action to take if an earthquake occurs. Read the hotel earthquake instructions. The US Federal Emergency Management Agency website has advice about what to do before, during and after an earthquake or tsunami.
