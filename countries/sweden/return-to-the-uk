Flights
At present there are no direct flights from Sweden to the UK. There are reduced options to fly to the UK via other countries. You are strongly recommended to contact your travel operator or travel agent for flight availability. Flight schedules may change at short notice
Travel via Denmark
If you are in southern Sweden, you may be considering returning to the UK via Denmark. This would require you to cross the Oresund Bridge or use the Helsingborg – Helsingör ferry route, and therefore cross Danish border controls. You should inform the Danish border officials that you are returning to the UK, and be prepared to provide evidence to support this, for example a flight ticket. Please see travel advice for Denmark.
