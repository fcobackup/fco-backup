Political situation
Following Parliamentary elections on 4 October large numbers of protesters gathered in central Bishkek and other cities across the country. Whilst the scale and frequency of demonstrations has now reduced It is possible that demonstrations will continue in the coming week and further demonstrations are possible and there is a risk that somethese may become violent. You are advised to avoid all crowds and demonstrations and, maintain a low profile. Follow updates on local media and any instructions from the police or other authorities.
Crime
Muggings (sometimes violent) and theft occur regularly. There have been incidents involving criminals, mostly after dark. Take care if you go out after dark.
Large amounts of money should not be on show and be wary of strangers offering help or being over-friendly. Be particularly aware of your surroundings when using currency exchange offices and visiting the bazaars in Bishkek, particularly Osh Bazaar, where tourists are regularly targeted by pickpockets.
Local travel
Take care if you travel to the Oblasts (Provinces) of Osh, Batken and Jalal-Abad. While there has been no widespread violence since 2010, underlying tensions continue to exist. In October 2020 there were protests in Osh and Jalal- Abad following parliamentary elections.
Tensions exist over recognition of the Kyrgyz/Tajik borders. There have been a number of security incidents in this region and several gunfire exchanges, the most recent in October 2020.
There are also occasional violent incidents on the Kyrgyz/Uzbek and Kyrgyz/Kazakh border. There is a risk that uncontrolled Kyrgyz/Uzbek border areas may be land-mined. The Kyrgyz/Uzbek border was closed to foreigners during the demonstrations in October. Check in advance which border posts are open.
You should only use officially recognised border crossings. The border can be closed at short notice, particularly near the Vorukh enclave. You should remain vigilant in border areas and check local media reports before you travel.
There are frequent power cuts throughout the country.
Road travel
You can drive in Kyrgyzstan using a UK driving licence for up to 30 days or an International Driving Permit. If you require an International Driving Permit, from 28 March 2019 you will need to have a 1968 International Driving Permit (IDP) to drive in Kyrgyzstan. From 1 February 2019, you can only get IDPs over the counter from 2,500 UK Post Offices. You will not be able to buy an IDP outside the UK, so get one before you travel.
Petrol stations are limited in rural areas and diesel is often unavailable. Make sure you take all you need for your journey. Take extra care when driving, particularly over long distances. You should avoid giving lifts to hitchhikers given incidents when drivers have been robbed by people they picked up. Many roads are poorly lit and poorly maintained with road works or damaged roads often not clearly signposted. Roads outside the capital are often blocked by snow in winter. There is currently no MOT and no legal requirement for vehicles to be insured. Pedestrians often have a low awareness of road safety
You should avoid flagging down taxis. Use telephone, SMS, or taxi services, which are more reputable and have English-speaking dispatchers. Wherever possible use main roads when travelling in and around Bishkek and avoid large crowds even if in a vehicle.
Avoid using local buses and mini-buses as they are not always properly maintained and are notorious for pick-pockets. There have been cases of sexual harassment and assault on public transport.
Air travel
Limited internal flight services currently operate between Bishkek, Osh, Jalalabad and Batken.
All Kyrgyz airlines are banned from operating services to the EU because they don’t meet international safety standards.
Where there’s a clear business need to travel internally within Kyrgyzstan, British government staff may use Air Manas flights (formerly known as Pegasus Asia).
You can see a list of recent incidents and accidents on the website of the Aviation Safety Network.
The International Air Transport Association publishes a list of registered airlines that have been audited and found to meet a number of operational safety standards and recommended practices. This list is not exhaustive and the absence of an airline from this list does not necessarily mean that it is unsafe.
In 2009 the International Civil Aviation Organisation conducted an audit of the level of implementation of the critical elements of safety oversight in Kyrgyzstan.
Trekking
Trekking in Kyrgyzstan often involves travelling to very remote areas. There is a high risk of avalanches, landslides and rock falls. Adequate insurance, including for any activity at high altitude, is essential. If you’re trekking or mountaineering, be vigilant and be prepared to adapt your plans to reflect local conditions and advice. Use a reputable trekking agency, let someone know your estimated return time and don’t trek alone. In remote areas, mobile phone coverage is extremely limited, and any medical facilities basic.
There is a limited mountain rescue service staffed by volunteers, but the rescue equipment they have is limited.
Doing business in Kyrgyzstan
If you are considering setting up an investment or doing business in Kyrgyzstan it is essential to research carefully, including looking into potential business partners thoroughly. You may also want to consult a local lawyer. Kyrgyzstan is ranked 126th of 198 countries on the 2019 Transparency International Global Corruption Index. Although there are British companies operating successfully in Kyrgyzstan, there have been a number of instances of British people getting into difficulties, including having assets stolen or being physically attacked. Getting redress through the Kyrgyz legal system can be slow and getting judgements implemented can be very difficult. The British Embassy is not able to get involved (including offering advice) in private disputes over property, employment, commercial or other matters.
There is a list of local lawyers and translators available on our website. There are also a number of business associations in Kyrgyzstan that may be able to offer you advice. If you get into difficulties due to the actions of state bodies you can also contact the office of the Business Ombudsman.
