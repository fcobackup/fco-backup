Healthcare in Paraguay
If you think you have COVID-19 symptoms, dial the Ministry of Health hotline at 154.
The public healthcare system varies across the country, and in some cities in Paraguay, the additional burden of treating Covid-19 patients might affect services such as accident and emergency care. Some private hospitals might not accept credit card payments for admissions and only accept patients with valid health insurance. Short-term foreign visitors are required to demonstrate proof of medical insurance before boarding their flight to Paraguay. Check with your airline carrier.
Check if your travel or health insurance has comprehensive cover for coronavirus and refer to official channels in your location for further details.
People with COVID-19 symptoms, that have recently come in contact with someone with COVID-19, or have recently travelled internationally are eligible for testing by booking an appointment by calling the Ministry of Health’s hotline at 154, but results from public laboratories may take up to a week to arrive.

Wherever possible British nationals should aim to be vaccinated in the country where they live. As further information is available about the Paraguayan national vaccination programme, this page will be updated. Sign up to get email notifications.
The Paraguayan authorities have issued the national vaccination programme (only available in Spanish). Vaccination is occurring in priority phases and is voluntary and free of charge. Resident British Nationals with a locally issued cédula de identidad (identity card) are eligible to register within the vaccination programme on the same basis as Paraguayan nationals, by using the Registro de Ciudadanía option. British Nationals who do not hold a cédula de identidad (identity card) are eligible to register within the vaccination programme, under the Registro de Extranjeros option. Information about priority group categories are included on the national vaccination programme website.
Please refer to official guidance from local authorities for further information.
The Medicines and Healthcare Products Regulatory Agency (MHRA) is the UK authority responsible for assessing the safety, quality and efficacy of vaccines. It has authorised the Pfizer/BioNTech, Oxford/AstraZeneca and Moderna vaccines for temporary supply and use in the UK. Find out more about MHRA approval for these vaccines.
