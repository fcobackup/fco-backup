Entry rules in response to coronavirus (COVID-19)
Entry to Papua New Guinea
Commercial options for travel to and from Papua New Guinea remain very limited. If transiting through another country, it is important that you also check the latest requirements for transit through that country. Only certain international carriers are authorised to take connecting passengers on Air Niugini flights from Port Moresby via Singapore and Hong Kong. Being able to transit these hubs on a certain carrier on the way into Papua New Guinea is not a guarantee that you will be able to connect onto the same carrier on the return leg. Air Niugini also requires that all passengers departing internationally – except those with medical exemptions or children under 18 – provide evidence at check-in that they are fully vaccinated. You should check the Air Niugini website for the latest advice.
International passengers, over the age of 18, must be fully vaccinated to enter Papua New Guinea. Papua New Guinea nationals are exempt from this requirement. ‘Fully vaccinated’ is defined as having had the recommended number of doses of recognised COVID-19 vaccines within 6 months prior to arrival, or having had the recognised number of doses and a booster. Your NHS appointment card from vaccination centres is not designed to be used as proof of vaccination.
All arrivals, except children aged 5 or younger, must also be able to demonstrate a negative Polymerase Chain Reaction (PCR) test taken within 72 hours prior to boarding at their first port of departure for Papua New Guinea. You should not use the NHS testing service but should arrange to take a private test.
If a passenger has tested positive for COVID-19 within three months prior to travel to Papua New Guinea and their pre-departure PCR test is positive, they must have a medical certificate from a registered medical practitioner in their country of departure that states the passenger is not infectious and is fit to fly.
All incoming passengers, except children under 5, must take a rapid antigen test on arrival (charges may apply). Those who test positive must also undergo a PCR test to confirm the results. If the second test results are positive, the passenger must quarantine for 7 days at an approved facility (at their own expense) or at home (with approval).
You must also complete an online electronic health declaration form within 24 hours prior to departure. The barcode generated should be saved and provided at check-in as evidence of submission of the online form.
You should check the Papua New Guinea Government’s COVID-19 website for details of the latest international travel measures and other updates.
Face masks must be worn on all domestic flights. All domestic travellers must submit a health declaration form to the Provincial Health Authority on arrival. Domestic airline travellers may need to be tested for COVID-19. Testing requirements for domestic travel are at the discretion of each province, and travellers should check the latest requirements with their travel agent.
You should check the Papua New Guinea Government’s COVID-19 website for details of the latest domestic travel measures and other updates. Separate arrangements apply for travel to the Autonomous Region of Bougainville.
