Travel in Yemen
Authorities across Yemen have introduced a range of measures. These include curfews, movement restrictions, closures of businesses and limitations on public and private gatherings. Implementation may vary and restrictions can change at short notice.
Some areas have designated quarantine camps. These can vary in both quality and access to medical provision.
Healthcare in Yemen
Medical facilities, particularly away from the main towns, are poor. There are four testing facilities in Mukalla, Sana’a, Aden and Taiz.
COVID-19 vaccines if you live in Yemen
The Medicines and Healthcare Products Regulatory Agency (MHRA) is the UK authority responsible for assessing the safety, quality and efficacy of vaccines. It has authorised the Pfizer/BioNTech, Oxford/AstraZeneca and Moderna vaccines for temporary supply and use in the UK. Find out more about MHRA approval for these vaccines.
British nationals living overseas should seek medical advice from their local healthcare provider in the country where they reside. Information about vaccines used in other national programmes, including regulatory status, should be available from the local authorities. This list of Stringent Regulatory Authorities recognised by the World Health Organisation may also be a useful source of additional information. Find out more about COVID-19 vaccines on the World Health Organisation COVID-19 vaccines page.
