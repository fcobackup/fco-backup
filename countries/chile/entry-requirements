This page has information on travelling to Chile.
This page reflects the UK government’s understanding of current rules for people travelling on a full ‘British Citizen’ passport from the UK, for the most common types of travel.
The authorities in Chile set and enforce entry rules. The British Embassy cannot intervene on Chilean entry rules. If you’re unsure how Chile’s entry requirements apply to you, contact its UK embassy, high commission or consulate.
All travellers
All travellers should familiarise themselves with the entry rules for Chile before travel.
If you are a British passport holder visiting Chile for less than 90 days, you do not need a visa. Your passport should be valid for the proposed duration of your stay. No additional period of validity beyond this is required.
Review the entry requirements into Chile very carefully. These change depending on the COVID ‘Alert Level’ in Chile, at the time of your entry. Chile is currently in Alert Level 1. You can review the requirements here in Spanish and here in English. Chile has instated additional mandatory COVID-19 entry requirements for passengers arriving from China.
Non-resident foreigners:
will need to provide identification and a vaccination certificate issued in the country in which they were vaccinated OR
will need to present a negative PCR test taken within a maximum of 48 hours at their last point of departure prior to arrival in Chile.
Arrival at airport:
Children under 18 years of age are not subject to any Covid-related entry requirements.
Only residents returning from abroad will be randomly tested at the airport upon arrival.
Proof of travel insurance is no longer required. However, insurance coverage for COVID-related issues is highly recommended for the duration of your stay in Chile.
More information about what you need to do when you enter Chile can be found on the Chilean government website, selecting ‘Plan Seguimos Cuidándonos’.
Special entry requirements for travellers who have been in China within the past 7 days:
All passengers, including children and resident foreigners, who have been in China within the seven days before their arrival in Chile must present a negative PCR (or antigen) test taken 48 hours prior to boarding.
All arrivals will also be required to take a mandatory COVID test upon arrival. The result should be available within 4-6 hours.
Mandatory 5-day isolation if the test result is positive upon arrival. You should await the result at your booked accommodation. If it is positive, the health authorities will contact you to determine arrangements for your isolation period. This may be at your chosen accommodation or at a government health residence.
Proof of vaccination status
Your NHS appointment card from vaccination centres cannot be used to demonstrate your vaccine status.
If you’ve had COVID-19 in the past month
If you test positive for COVID-19 a month preceding your boarding to Chile, and if 72 hours prior to boarding, you continue to test positive, you can replace the negative PCR result by showing Chilean authorities the two positive PCR test results. One of the positive PCR tests must have been taken up to 72 hours prior to boarding, the other positive PCR test must have been taken more than 10 days prior to the date of boarding but less than one month before boarding.
Children and young people
If you travel with children under 18 years old, you must review the documents you will need to show upon entry on the Chilean Ministry of Foreign Affairs website.
Children under 18 years old
Children under 18 years old (including non-resident foreigners) are not subject to any Covid-related entry requirements.
Special entry requirements to travel to Easter Island (Rapa Nui)
All travellers will have to comply with the following requirements to enter Easter Island (Rapa Nui):
Mobility Pass (Validated vaccinations) or vaccination certificate and identity document for non-resident foreigners. To apply for a Mobility Pass visit ‘MeVacuno website’. Foreign visitors can create an account linked to their email address to access the site. Children under 3 years old are not subject to this requirement. The authorities will check that foreign visitors have had the full vaccination scheme required by the issuing country of the document.

Reservation in a tourist service registered in SERNATUR or invitation letter from the Provincial Delegation.
In addition, all travellers will be subject to health monitoring for 7 days after entering the island.
All persons may be subjected to a Covid test between the first and fifth day of arrival. If the passenger refuses or has a positive result, a mandatory quarantine must be carried out for the following 7 days.
If you’re transiting through Chile
Transiting through Chile on your way to another country without exiting the airport premises and without transiting to a domestic flight is permitted. Nevertheless, if you wish to exit the airport or if your transit comprises flying to another city within Chile, Chilean authorities will require you to meet all the current entry requirements.
Check your passport and travel documents before you travel
Passport validity
Your passport should be valid for the proposed duration of your stay. No additional period of validity beyond this is required.
If you are a resident in Chile, your passport must be valid when entering the country.
Check with your travel provider to make sure your passport and other travel documents meet their requirements.
Visas
If you are a British passport holder visiting Chile for less than 90 days, you do not need a visa.
On arrival in Chile the immigration authorities will issue you with a ‘Tarjeta de Turismo - Tourist Card’, an A5 sized white form. You must keep this document on a safe place and present it to immigration when you leave the country. If you lose it, you should request a copy of the Tourist card on the PDI website choosing the option ‘Duplicado de Tarjeta de Turismo’, at the nearest PDI office or at the office at Santiago airport.
Please note that the official website for digital procedures for Chilean immigration is in the process of being changed as a result of the approval of the Regulation of Law No. 21.325 (‘El portal oficial de trámites digitales del Servicio de Migraciones se encuentra en proceso de cambio producto de la aprobación del Reglamento de la Ley N° 21.325’.) This change is likely to affect any visa extension or ‘Prorroga de Turismo’.
Closely review the Chilean Immigration Department (Extranjeria) website for any updates regarding visas. Telephone: 600 626 4222.

British-Chilean dual nationals must enter and leave Chile using their Chilean passport. Chilean entry and exit requirements for dual nationals may change without notice. For further information check with the nearest Chilean Embassy.
Travelling with children
Chile has strict requirements for the entry and exit of minors under the age of 18.
Children born in Chile require a Chilean passport to leave.
Children under 18 years old, who are leaving Chile alone, with only one parent/guardian, with friends or relatives, must get authorisation to travel from a Chilean notary (“notaría”) before travelling.
UK Emergency Travel Documents
UK Emergency Travel Documents (ETD) are accepted for entry, airside transit and exit from Chile. Your ETD must be valid for the proposed duration of your stay. Dual British/Chilean nationals must have a Chilean travel document (passport) to be allowed to depart - UK ETDs cannot substitute this requirement.
