Entry rules in response to coronavirus (COVID-19)
Entry to Jordan
The Jordanian government suspended all direct air passenger flights between the UK and Jordan from 21 December 2020. This suspension has now been extended until 18 January. A further review is expected and there is the possibility of a further extension.
Passengers who have been in the UK within the previous 14 days, including passengers who have passed through the UK in transit, are not permitted to enter Jordan during this period. You cannot transit from the UK through a third country to enter Jordan.
Jordan’s international airport re-opened to scheduled flights on 10 September. Passengers must register to travel on the Gateway 2 Jordan website and have PCR tests before departure, on arrival and during the period of self quarantine.
Four land borders: Sheikh Hussein Bridge, Al Mudawwarah, King Hussein Bridge and Al Omari will be partially reopened from Thursday 29 October. There will be restrictions on the number of travellers limited between 100 and 150 from each of the four border crossings each day.
You should not use the NHS testing service to get a test in order to facilitate your travel to another country. You should arrange to take a private test.
Transiting Jordan
Passengers who have been in the UK within the previous 14 days, including passengers who have passed through the UK in transit, are not permitted to enter Jordan as from 21 December 2020.
There are currently limited flights operating to and from Jordan. All passengers arriving at Queen Alia Airport Jordan will need to follow instructions set out by government of Jordan.
International transfer passengers are allowed at Jordanian Airports and require:
negative PCR test within 72 hours before arrival
transfer time does not exceed 6 hours
Arrivals from Turkey, Egypt and Iraq need to have a PCR test from accredited Labs only. A List of accredited Labs can be found on the Gateway 2 Jordan website.
Testing / screening on arrival
All passengers, including Jordanians, arriving in Jordan by special repatriation flights or via land borders will be PCR tested at their own cost.
There are additional PCR testing requirements during the period of self quarantine in Jordan. Testing requirements are subject to change with little or no notice. Please check the requirements listed on the Gateway 2 Jordan website.
Quarantine requirements
From 23 September, passengers arriving in to Jordan are no longer subject to institutional quarantine, but are required to self-quarantine for one week even if their PCR test result is negative.
All passengers arriving in Jordan should self-quarantine in their accommodation for seven days on arrival whether they test positive (and are Asymptomatic) or negative.
If you test positive and have mild symptoms you will be asked to stay home and self-quarantine for 14 days. If you have severe symptoms you be asked to go to a COVID-19 designated hospital, and the British Embassy will be informed by the Ministry of Foreign Affairs.
Data collection
The Government have announced that on arrival in Jordan you will need to provide your contact details, travel information and complete passenger health declaration and locator forms. Passengers arriving will need to install Aman.jo application on their mobile device. This will inform the user if they had contact with an infected person, so the user can seek appropriate medical attention.
Testing on departure
There is no testing requirement on departure, although the Government advises travellers to comply with coronavirus regulations in the destination country.
Regular entry requirements
Visas
You’ll need a visa to enter Jordan. You can buy a single entry visa valid for 1 month on arrival at the airports or the Sheikh Hussein/North Border crossing at the Jordan/Israel border.
Check with the Jordanian authorities if you’re planning to cross the Wadi Araba/south border crossing (Aqaba/Eilat) or the Allenby/King Hussein Bridge.
An exit tax, currently 10JD, is payable at all border crossings, except the airports.
If you wish to combine travel to Jordan with a visit to Israel and the Occupied Palestinian Territories, it’s usually better to get a multiple entry visa before you travel from the Embassy of the Hashemite Kingdom of Jordan in London.
You can extend your visa after you arrive in Jordan up to a maximum period of 6 months. If you overstay your visa you will be fined. You can apply to extend your visa using the following website. Payment is accepted online.
If you’re entering for tourism you can get a combination of a visa and reduced cost entry to the major tourism sites by applying for a Jordan Pass online.
Passport validity
Your passport should be valid for a minimum period of 6 months from the date of entry into Jordan.
Previous travel to Israel
Evidence of a previous visit to Israel like an Israeli entry/exit stamp in your passport does not normally cause any difficulties when entering Jordan. It is, however, for the Jordanian authorities to determine the right of entry into the country. If you have any concerns, you should contact the Consulate of the Hashemite Kingdom of Jordan in London.
Yellow fever certificate requirements
Check whether you need a yellow fever certificate by visiting the National Travel Health Network and Centre’s TravelHealthPro website.
HIV test
You must undergo an HIV test if you intend to stay in Jordan for more than 30 days, either as a resident or as a long-term visitor. The fee to obtain the health certificate is currently 20 Jordanian Dinars.
Dual nationals
If you are a British/Jordanian national, you are allowed to use your British passport on arrival, but will need to show your Jordanian passport on departure.
UK Emergency Travel Documents
UK emergency travel documents are accepted for entry, transit and exit from Jordan. However, for entry and transit using an emergency travel document, you’ll need to get a visa from the Jordanian Embassy in the country where the document was issued. For exit using an emergency travel document, you’ll need to get a stamp from the Immigration & Residency department in Amman (not at the airport). A minimum of one month remaining validity is required on an emergency travel document.
