A 7.8 earthquake hit Gaziantep and neighbouring provinces in the south-east of Turkey on 6 February 2023. On the same day a 7.5 magnitude earthquake hit the neighbouring province of Kahramanmaras. There have been several strong after-shocks. The Turkish government has announced a national emergency in the 10 provinces affected by the earthquake. These are the provinces of Kahramanmaraş, Gaziantep, Malatya, Diyarbakır, Kilis, Şanlıurfa, Adıyaman, Hatay, Osmaniye, Adana. The Turkish government has stated that only vehicles which carry aid teams and aid materials will be allowed to enter cities deemed to be inside the area of the disaster. If you are in the affected area, you should exercise caution and follow the advice of the local authorities.
If you require consular assistance, you should call our 24-hour helpline on +90 312 455 3344 and select the option for “consular services for British nationals,” or send an enquiry via the web contact form.
Before you travel, check the ‘Entry requirements’ section for Turkey’s current entry restrictions and requirements. These may change with little warning. Monitor this advice for the latest updates and stay in contact with your travel provider for up to date information on entry restrictions and requirements.
If you plan to pass through another country to return to the UK, check the travel advice for the country you’re transiting.
It is more important than ever to get travel insurance and check it provides sufficient cover. See the FCDO’s guidance on foreign travel insurance.
Terrorists are very likely to try to carry out attacks in Turkey. Terrorist groups, including PKK, Daesh (formerly referred to as ISIL) and far left organisations, continue to plan and carry out attacks. Further attacks could be indiscriminate. Most attacks have taken place in the south-east of the country, and in Ankara and Istanbul. There is a potential that citizens from western countries may be targets or caught up in attacks, particularly in the major cities. Follow the advice of the local security authorities and monitor media reports. See Terrorism
It is illegal to be a member or supporter of a terrorist organisation in Turkey, including expressions of support on social media. Some organisations in the region though not proscribed in the UK, such as the YPG and the Gülen Movement are illegal in Turkey.
If you’re travelling to Turkey for tourist or business purposes, you are able to travel without a visa for visits of up to 90 days in any 180-day period. See Visas
British nationals made over 3.8 million visits to Turkey in 2022. Most visits are trouble free. Be alert to your surroundings and remain vigilant in crowded places popular with foreign nationals, including during festival periods.
Many parts of Turkey are subject to earthquakes. You should familiarise yourself with safety procedures in the event of an earthquake and follow the advice of the local authorities. See Natural disasters
You should carry your passport and a printed copy of your visa (if applicable) or residence permit at all times. In some busy areas, especially Istanbul, the Turkish authorities are stopping members of the public to conduct ID checks. See Local laws and customs
There have been reports of an increase in holidaymakers being encouraged to submit a claim for personal injury if they have experienced gastric illness during their stay. You can find more information about the action you can take if you have suffered a personal injury on the Citizens Advice website. You should only consider pursuing a complaint or claim if you have genuinely suffered from injury or illness. If you make a false or fraudulent claim, you may face legal proceedings in the UK or Turkey.
You can contact the emergency services by calling 112. Alternatively, you can call emergency services directly by calling 155 (police), 112 (ambulance) and 110 (fire).
If you’re abroad and you need emergency help from the UK government, contact the nearest British embassy, consulate or high commission. Consular support is severely limited in parts of Turkey where the FCDO advise against travel, and limited in the areas where the FCDO advise against all but essential travel.
