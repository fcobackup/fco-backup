You are responsible for organising your own COVID-19 test, in line with UK government testing requirements. You should contact local authorities for information on testing facilities.
Be prepared for your plans to change
No travel is risk-free during COVID. Countries may further restrict travel or bring in new rules at short notice, for example due to a new COVID-19 variant. Check with your travel company or airline for any transport changes which may delay your journey home.
If you test positive for COVID-19, you will have to self-isolate for 14 days at home or at your hotel. If you continue to test positive, you may not be able to get a fitness-to-fly certificate. You may also need to seek treatment.
Plan ahead and make sure you:
can access money
understand what your insurance will cover
can make arrangements to extend your stay and be away for longer than planned
Travel in Cape Verde
Inter-island travel
There are ferry and airline connections operating between islands. If you’re travelling between islands, you’ll need to complete an online health surveillance form and present a COVID certificate or a negative RT-PCR or antigen test done 72 before departure. Children up to the age of 12 are exempt from this requirement.
International travel
For international travel out of Cape Verde, you’ll need to present a COVID-19 test (RT-PCR or Ag-RDT) done in the last 72 hours before you travel or a COVID certificate. You can book your test online on some of the islands. This does not apply to children under the age of 12. You should check what the entry requirements are for the country you are travelling to.
Tests are available at health centres and cost 6500CV Escudos (around £55). You can find a list of health centres online.
If you are travelling to or from Cape Verde and transiting other countries, you will need to check the travel advice pages of that country. You should also check with your airline or travel provider about entry requirements when transiting other countries.
Accommodation
Find accommodation that is suitable for your needs. Some hotel accommodation is open and there is self-catering accommodation available. Look for hotels that have been awarded the “Cabo Verde – Secure Tourism” certification.
Public places and services
Cape Verde is in a ‘state of contingency’. The Cape Verde government has started to ease some of the restrictive measures previously in place, while maintaining the need to observe the rules on social distancing and hygiene:
keep a social distance of at least 2m
wash your hands regularly
respect the rules on maximum occupancy in shops and service, restaurants, cafés and on public transport
If you test positive for COVID-19, it is still mandatory to self-isolate at your accommodation for 14 days.
With immediate effect:
Shops and stores close at 8:30pm, with the exception of pharmacies and bread shops which close at 9pm
Bars, open-air cafés selling alcoholic drinks, restaurants, snack bars and takeaways close at 12am
Lounge bars close at 12am on weekdays and at 2am on weekends and bank holidays
Parties and social gatherings are restricted to family groups up to a maximum of 10
Cultural, recreational, sporting and leisure activities and family events, such as weddings and christening, are permitted, subject to the rules on social distancing and hygiene
Beaches are open but access may be conditioned and rules on maximum capacity in force
Use of COVID certificates and negative test results
The Cape Verde government has introduced the use of COVID certificates and negative test results to access services and activities, including:
to enter bars and lounge bars on the eve of public holidays and on the weekend from 7pm on Fridays
to use gyms
to check in to hotels and other tourist accommodation (with the exception of children up to the age of 18 when accompanied by a parent or guardian)
to attend cultural, sporting, corporate, recreational and family events (with the exception of children up to the age of 18 when accompanied by a parent or guardian)
from 1 September, to eat inside restaurants on the eve of public holidays and on weekends from 7pm on Fridays
from 1 October, to enter nightclubs and dance halls
There are three Cape Verde COVID certificates – one proving the holder has been vaccinated, one proving the holder has recovered from COVID-19 and one showing evidence of a negative COVID test.
If you are resident in Cape Verde, check whether you are eligible for a COVID certificate on the Cape Verde government website.
If you are not eligible for a Cape Verde COVID certificate, you may show a negative COVID test result, obtained by one of the following means:
Certified PCR test done within the previous 72 hours
Certified antigen test done within the previous 72 hours
Face coverings
You must wear a face mask in enclosed spaces, such as shops and supermarkets, health centres, schools, airports and ports, cafes and restaurants and on public transport. You should wear your face covering when you enter the building and keep it on until you leave. In cafes and restaurants, keep your mask on until you are seated.
You must also wear a face mask outdoors where it is not possible to maintain a 2m social distance from people outside your family group.
These measures apply to everyone over the age of 10.
You may be exempt from using a face mask on medical grounds if authorised by the health authorities.
Healthcare in Cape Verde
If you’ve got COVID-19 symptoms you must self-isolate at your accommodation for 14 days. The government of Cape Verde has set up a free helpline, which you can call if you have any concerns about COVID-19: +238 (0)800 1112. This helpline is only available in Portuguese.
If you need medicine, you will only be able to buy it from a pharmacy. Unlike in the UK, non-prescription medication is not available in supermarkets or other shops. There are a limited number of pharmacies on each island and they are usually identified by a green cross. Find a pharmacy near you on the Pharmacy Network website.
If you have a UK prescription, take it to a pharmacy and ask the pharmacist whether they can dispense your medication for you. Remember the pharmacist will have to apply national rules so may not be able to give you the same strength or dosage. Some medicines may not be available or may not be authorised for sale in Cape Verde. In some cases, the medicine might not be in stock so they will need to order it. This can take up to a week or more.
If you need a repeat prescription, go to the nearest health centre or hospital A&E.
