This page has information on travelling to Portugal. Check what you must do to return to the UK.
This page reflects the UK government’s understanding of current rules for people travelling on a full ‘British Citizen’ passport from the UK, for the most common types of travel.
The authorities in Portugal set and enforce entry rules.
All travellers
You can travel to mainland Portugal for all purposes from the EU/EEA, the UK and from some other non-EU/EEA countries.
If you’re travelling from any country not listed above, you can only enter for essential purposes, such as to live with immediate family members, or for professional, educational, health or humanitarian reasons.
You can travel to the autonomous regions of Madeira and the Azores for any purpose without restriction.
All travellers to Portugal are required to complete a passenger locator form before arrival:
Complete this form for mainland Portugal
Complete this form for the Azores
Complete this form for Madeira and Porto Santo
Complete one form per passenger. If you’re travelling to Madeira or Porto Santo with children aged 11 and under, include their details in your form.
If you’re fully vaccinated
If you’re fully vaccinated, you can enter mainland Portugal without needing to test.
To qualify under the fully vaccinated rules, you must have a vaccination certificate which shows you have had either:
a full course, as described below, of a vaccine approved by the European Medicines Agency, at least 14 days and no more than 270 days before you arrive, or
a full course of a vaccine, as described below, plus a booster vaccine approved by the European Medicines Agency at least 14 days before you arrive
You will be considered fully vaccinated if you have had:
both doses of a 2-dose vaccine, or a combination of two different vaccines, or
an approved one-dose vaccine, or
a full course of a vaccine, plus a booster vaccine, or
if you caught COVID-19 after just one dose of a 2-dose vaccine and your certificate shows that your vaccination course is complete after the administration of just one dose of the vaccine
Check the Portuguese Airport authority passenger guide and Visit Portugal website for further information.
Proof of vaccination status
You must present proof that you have been fully vaccinated when you check-in for your flight to mainland Portugal.
You can use your UK COVID Pass (paper or digital format) to demonstrate your vaccination record.
If you’re fully vaccinated and your airline allows you to travel to mainland Portugal without proof of your vaccination status, you will be denied entry on arrival unless you’re legally resident. If you are legally resident in Portugal, you’ll be allowed to enter but you’ll have to take a rapid lateral flow test at the airport at your own expense and you will be fined a minimum of €300.
Check the entry requirements for those who are not fully vaccinated.
If you’re not fully vaccinated
If you’re not fully vaccinated, you’ll need to show proof of a negative PCR test (taken no more than 72 hours before entry) or rapid lateral flow test (taken no more than 24 hours before entry) when you check in for your flight to mainland Portugal. See information on getting a test before entry
Make sure your test is carried out by a trained healthcare professional. Self-administered tests are not acceptable. If you take a rapid lateral flow test, check it meets the standards set out in the EU common list of Rapid Antigen Tests.
If you’re not fully vaccinated and your airline allows you to travel to mainland Portugal without a negative test, you will be denied entry on arrival unless you’re legally resident. In this case, you’ll be allowed to enter but you’ll have to take a test at the airport at your own expense and you will be fined a minimum of €300.
If you’ve had COVID-19 in the past year
If you’ve tested positive for COVID-19 in the last year, you can enter mainland Portugal with a COVID-19 recovery certificate showing you recovered from COVID-19, no less than 11 days and no more than 180 days before you travel. You will not need to take a test.
You can use your UK COVID Pass to demonstrate proof of COVID-19 recovery when checking in for your flight.
Entry to the Azores
You’ll need to take a test on arrival in the Azores unless:
you have a valid EU vaccination or recovery certificate, or
you have taken a PCR or rapid lateral flow test before you travel
Your PCR or rapid lateral flow test must meet the following criteria:
it is carried out by a trained healthcare professional. Self-administered tests are not acceptable
the rapid lateral flow test is taken no more than 48 hours before you travel and meets the standards set out in the EU common list of Rapid Antigen Tests
the PCR test is taken no more than 72 hours before you travel
Your EU vaccination certificate must show you have completed your vaccination course at least 14 days and no more than 270 days before you arrive in the Azores. Your recovery certificate must show you recovered from COVID-19, no less than 11 days and no more than 180 days before you travel.
For further information about entering the Azores, see the regional government’s website and Visit Azores.
Entry to Madeira and Porto Santo
It is recommended that you complete a passenger locator form before you travel to Madeira and Porto Santo. If you’re travelling with children aged 11 and under, include their details in your form.
There are no other requirements for entry to Madeira and Porto Santo.
Self-isolating if you test positive for COVID-19
If you test positive for COVID-19 during your stay in mainland Portugal, you’ll have to self-isolate at your own expense for at least 7 days. Check the rules for self-isolating in mainland Portugal (in Portuguese).
If you test positive for COVID-19 during your stay in Madeira, Porto Santo or the Azores, you’ll have to self-isolate at your own expense for at least 5 days. Check the rules for self-isolating in Madeira and Porto Santo (in Portuguese).
Children and young people
Children aged 11 and under do not need to take a test or show proof of vaccination or recovery to enter mainland Portugal and the Azores.
If you’re transiting through Portugal
If you’re transiting through Portugal on your way to another country, you’ll need to follow the rules that apply to your vaccination status, even if you’re arriving by air and are staying in the airport (airside).
Further information about transiting through Portugal can be found on the Portuguese immigration service website.
Travelling through Spain and France to Portugal
Check the requirements for entering and transiting France and Spain on FCDO Travel Advice, before you travel.
Check the requirements for crossing the land border into Portugal from Spain.
Exemptions
Frontier workers who carry out their professional activity within 30km of the Portugal/Spain border and people who provide essential services, such as hauliers, healthcare professionals and security forces, are exempt from testing, but must show a vaccination or recovery certificate.
Further information on exemption from testing can be found on the Portuguese Immigration authority and Visit Portugal websites.
Check your passport and travel documents before you travel
Check with your travel provider to make sure your passport and other travel documents meet their requirements.
Passport validity
If you are planning to travel to an EU country (except Ireland), or Switzerland, Norway, Iceland, Liechtenstein, Andorra, Monaco, San Marino or Vatican City, you must meet the Schengen area rules.
Your passport must meet 2 requirements. It must be:
less than 10 years old on the day you enter (check the ‘date of issue’)
valid for at least 3 months after the day you plan to leave (check the ‘expiry date’)
We are asking the European Commission to clarify the 10-year rule. Their guidance for Schengen border guards may not be updated until the spring of 2022. Until then, for some Schengen countries your passport may need to be less than 10 years old during your whole visit, and the 3 months at the end of your visit may need to be within 10 years of your passport’s issue date.
Check both the issue date and the expiry date in your passport. If you renewed your passport early, extra months may have been added to its expiry date. This could affect the requirement for your passport to be less than 10 years old.
Contact your travel provider or embassy of the country you are visiting if you think that your passport does not meet both these requirements. Renew your passport if you need to.
Visas
You can travel to countries in the Schengen area for up to 90 days in any 180-day period without a visa. This applies if you travel as a tourist, to visit family or friends, to attend business meetings, cultural or sports events, or for short-term studies or training.
If you are travelling to Portugal and other Schengen countries without a visa, make sure your whole visit is within the 90-day limit. Visits to Schengen countries within the previous 180 days before you travel count towards your 90 days.
To stay longer, to work or study, for business travel or for other reasons, you will need to meet the Portuguese government’s entry requirements. Check the Portuguese Immigration Service (scroll to the bottom of the page) and check with the Portuguese Embassy what type of visa and/or work permit you may need.
If you are travelling to Portugal for work, read the guidance on visas and permits.
If you stay in Portugal with a residence permit or long-stay visa, this does not count towards your 90-day visa-free limit.
Passport stamping
Check your passport is stamped if you enter or exit the Schengen area through Portugal as a visitor. Border guards will use passport stamps to check you’re complying with the 90-day visa-free limit for short stays in the Schengen area. If relevant entry or exit stamps are not in your passport, border guards will presume that you have overstayed your visa-free limit.
You can show evidence of when and where you entered or exited the Schengen area, and ask the border guards to add this date and location in your passport. Examples of acceptable evidence include boarding passes and tickets.
You may also need to:
show a return or onward ticket
show you have enough money for your stay
If you are resident in Portugal, read our Living in Portugal guide for passport stamping information.
Travelling with children
Children aged 17 and under travelling to Portugal alone or in the company of a person who is not their parent or legal guardian, should either:
be met at the airport or point of entry by their parent or guardian, or
carry a letter of authorisation to travel from their parent or guardian. The letter should name the adult in Portugal who will be responsible for them during their stay and the identification and contacts details of the parent or guardian.
For more information, check the Portuguese government portal.
Resident children leaving Portugal
A child aged 17 and under who is resident in Portugal must carry a notarised letter of authority from their parent or guardian if they’re travelling out of the country alone or in the company of a person who is not their parent or legal guardian. The letter of authority can be issued by:
one of the child’s parents (if the parents are married)
the parent the child lives with (if the parents are separated or divorced)
one of the adoptive parents (if the child is adopted) or
the child’s legal guardian
Further information is available on the Portuguese immigration service website.
UK Emergency Travel Documents
UK ETDs are accepted for entry, airside transit and exit from Portugal.
