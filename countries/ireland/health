At least 8 weeks before your trip, check the latest country-specific health advice from the National Travel Health Network and Centre (NaTHNaC) on the TravelHealthPro website. Each country-specific page has information on vaccine recommendations, any current health risks or outbreaks, and factsheets with information on staying healthy abroad. Guidance is also available from NHS (Scotland) on the FitForTravel website.
General information on travel vaccinations and a travel health checklist are available on the NHS website. You may then wish to contact your health adviser or pharmacy for advice on other preventive measures and managing any pre-existing medical conditions while you’re abroad.
The legal status and regulation of some medicines prescribed or purchased in the UK can be different in other countries. If you’re travelling with prescription or over-the-counter medicine, read this guidance from NaTHNaC on best practice when travelling with medicines. For further information on the legal status of a specific medicine, you’ll need to contact the embassy, high commission or consulate of the country or territory you’re travelling to.
While travel can be enjoyable, it can sometimes be challenging. There are clear links between mental and physical health, so looking after yourself during travel and when abroad is important. Information on travelling with mental health conditions is available in our guidance page. Further information is also available from the National Travel Health Network and Centre (NaTHNaC).
Coronavirus
There is an ongoing outbreak of coronavirus (COVID-19) in China, but cases have been confirmed in other countries, including Ireland. The Irish authorities have introduced a number of measures to limit the spread of the virus. This has included the cancellation of the Dublin St Patrick’s Day Parade on 17 March, with many other St Patrick’s Day events across the country cancelled as well.
We would advise all travellers to Ireland to follow the advice of the Health Service Executive and the Health Protection Surveillance Centre. We would advise all travellers to Ireland to follow the regular updates on the situation from the Irish Government.
Further information on coronavirus, including advice on preparing for foreign travel and helping reduce the spread of the virus, is available from Public Health England and on the TravelHealthPro website. You can find more information about cases in Ireland on the TravelHealthPro country page.
Healthcare
If you need emergency medical assistance during your trip, dial 999 or 112 and ask for an ambulance. If you are referred to a medical facility for treatment you should contact your insurance/medical assistance company immediately.
If you are a British or Irish citizen, you have the right to access healthcare in either state. When visiting you also have the right to access needs-arising healthcare during your stay. Both Governments have committed to taking steps to ensure that this will continue. More information about healthcare for UK nationals living in and visiting Ireland is available on the NHS website.
It is important to take out comprehensive travel insurance that includes cover for medical treatment and associated costs. Read more about what your travel insurance should cover.
If you’re living in Ireland, you can also find more information on healthcare for residents in the Living In Ireland guide.
