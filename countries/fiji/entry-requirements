This page reflects the UK government’s understanding of current rules for people travelling on a full ‘British Citizen’ passport, for the most common types of travel.
The authorities in Fiji set and enforce entry rules. For further information contact the embassy, high commission or consulate of the country or territory you’re travelling to. You should also consider checking with your transport provider or travel company to make sure your passport and other travel documents meet their requirements.
Entry rules in response to coronavirus (COVID-19)
The Fiji government has announced changes to international travel due to Covid-19. Whether entry will be permitted to Fiji and what the process is on arrival will depend on individual circumstances but the major consideration is the countries you have visited or transited in the ten days prior to entering Fiji. Fiji has placed all countries into one of three categories: “Travel Partner” countries, which includes the UK; “Non-Travel Partner” countries; and “Red-List” countries. Full information on the latest rules is available from the Ministry of Commerce, Trade, Tourism and Transport and you should familiarise yourself carefully with these. In some cases approval prior to travel must be sought.
A pre-departure coronavirus RT-PCR test is required for all travel to Fiji. This should be taken no more than 3 days prior to the day of departure.
Only fully vaccinated travellers are able to enter Fiji and the vaccine must be of a type approved by the Fijian authorities. You will also need to ensure you meet testing and vaccination requirements of your airline and any countries transited enroute to Fiji.
Fiji government requires travellers coming for tourist purposes to have medical travel insurance that covers COVID-19.
You may transit Nadi Airport from Travel Partner countries if you have a valid ticket, negative COVID-19 test and are fully vaccinated.
All foreign nationals who are currently unable to leave Fiji have been advised to contact Fiji Immigration Office so that they may be properly guided to maintain their legal status. This applies to all categories of permit holders.
These restrictions supersede the regular entry requirements set out below which refer to Fiji’s requirements that existed before the border was closed.
Regular entry requirements
Visas
Visas are not needed for visits of up to 4 months. You must have an onward or return ticket and a valid visa for the next country you’re travelling to. If you’re visiting Fiji on business you will be granted a stay for 14 days on arrival.
If you plan to stay for longer than 4 months, you will need to apply for a visa from the Fiji High Commission in London.
Yachts can only enter Fiji through Suva, Lautoka, Savusavu and Levuka. For other ports, such as Nadi/Denarau, prior arrangement with the Fijian Authorities is needed.
Passport validity
Your passport should have at least 6 months’ validity remaining on your date of entry into Fiji.
UK Emergency Travel Documents
UK Emergency Travel Documents are valid for entry, airside transit and exit from Fiji.
Yellow fever certificate requirements
Check whether you need a yellow fever certificate by visiting the National Travel Health Network and Centre’s TravelHealthPro website.
Customs requirements
Fiji customs enforce strict quarantine regulations and x-ray all in-bound luggage at Nadi airport. Most perishable foodstuffs will be confiscated on arrival, unless arriving from a country with quarantine agreements with Fiji.
You must declare currency amounts in excess of FJ$10,000.
Travelling with children
Some countries need documentary evidence of parental responsibility before allowing lone parents to enter the country or, in some cases, before permitting the children to leave the country.
In the case of Fiji, no such documentation is needed for visitors. But it is needed for those applying for work and/or residency permits. For further information contact the Fiji High Commission in London.
