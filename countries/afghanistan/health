Other health risks
Diarrhoeal diseases and other gastrointestinal infections are common causes of ill health, becoming worse in the hotter months.  
The dry dusty conditions in summer and winter can cause irritation to the eyes, throat, nose and skin.
Respiratory tuberculosis is common in the Afghan population. 
Malaria is present except in the high mountainous regions of the country and in winter. 
Local medical care
We advise against all travel to Afghanistan. Only very limited medical facilities are available in Afghanistan and access is likely reduced in the deteriorating security situation.
We are aware that at present there is no public ambulance service offered in Kabul or the rest of the country. If you are in need of urgent attention you are advised to speak directly with a local medical practitioner and consider alternative transport options to hospital where safe to do so. You should contact your insurance/medical assistance company promptly if youâ€™re referred to a medical facility for treatment. Ambulance services may request payment or evidence of insurance before providing assistance.
