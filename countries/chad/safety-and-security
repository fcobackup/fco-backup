Political situation
On 20 April, the Chadian army announced the death of President Déby, increasing risk of instability in the capital N’Djamena and the wider country. Land and air borders have now been reopened. You should exercise extra vigilance and caution, and avoid any demonstrations or large gatherings of people.
On Sunday 11 April an armed convoy belonging to the rebel group “Le front pour l’alternance et la concorde au Tchad” (FACT) crossed into Chad from Libya, and engaged in fighting with government security forces. On Saturday 17 April, the rebel convoy moved south west, passing the town of Faya. The convoy appeared to be heading towards the capital, N’Djamena. Additionally, a separate FACT convoy was seen approaching the town of Mao from the north.
Since the Chadian Presidential Election on 11 April, tensions have remained high. On 27 April, there were violent clashes between protesters and security forces in N’Djamena and southern Chad. A number of people were killed, with reports of live ammunition being used against demonstrators. You should be vigilant and avoid any demonstrations or large gatherings of people. If you become aware of any nearby protests leave the area immediately. You should keep yourself informed of developments through local media.
Crime
The number of reports of car-jackings on roads outside N’Djamena has increased, including during daylight hours. You should use a police or military escort when driving outside the capital, and carry working communications equipment.
Armed robberies, particularly from cars, in some residential areas of N’Djamena are common. Foreigners are sometimes targeted.
Be vigilant and take particular care in the capital. Travel by car and not by foot or motorbike. Keep doors locked and windows closed. Do not carry large sums of money, jewellery, or other valuables. Avoid isolated or less developed areas of towns and do not travel alone at night.
Local travel
There are around 572,000 refugees and returnees in Chad from Sudan, Central African Republic and Nigeria, in the east, south, and Lake (western) regions of Chad respectively. There are also around 236,000 internally displaced people in the Lake region, where military operations have increased resulting in more displacements since March and a state of emergency remains in place.
Chad and Sudan have agreed to enhance the role of the joint border force but banditry and violent crime in eastern Chad still exist. Inter-communal clashes in West Darfur State have led to a new flow of refugees crossing into Chad in late December 2019 and January 2020. The number of Sudanese refugees following this influx is around 363,000.
The border between Chad and Central African Republic has been closed and instability in neighbouring Central African Republic remains concerning. The border with Sudan is subject to closure at little notice.
The area bordering Libya is heavily land-mined. The northern regions of Borkou, Ennedi and Tibesti remain unsafe.
Road travel
Road travel can be dangerous due to the state of the roads and quality of driving. Accidents involving motorbikes are particularly common. Crowds can quickly gather around the scene of an accident and, while rarely violent, can be intimidating. Try to make contact with the police or other local authority immediately if you’re involved in an accident.
For travel outside the capital, you will need authorisation from the Ministry of the Interior, which is normally granted without difficulty after a few days. Roads are poor and often impassable during the rainy season (July-October), especially in the south. Heavy rains can result in major flooding in many areas, particularly in the south and east.
You should travel in convoy, keep doors locked and carry spare fuel and supplies. Police checkpoints are common: you may be asked to show your passport, driving licence and vehicle registration documents. Do not travel by road after dark.
You should avoid using at night the road passing in front of the Presidential Palace in N’Djamena. In 3 separate incidents in March 2019, 2 motorists were killed, and a motorcyclist shot, by Palace guards.
