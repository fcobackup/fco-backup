Male and female same-sex sexual activity remains illegal in Trinidad and Tobago. There is legislation in place that bars LGBT individuals from entering the country. In practice, these laws are rarely enforced and there is growing local support for LGBT rights. However, public displays of affection between same sex couples may attract negative attention. See our information and advice page for the LGBT community before you travel.
It is an offence for anyone, including children, to carry or dress in camouflage clothing.
