This page reflects the UK government’s understanding of current rules for people travelling on a full ‘British Citizen’ passport, for the most common types of travel.
The authorities in Réunion set and enforce entry rules. For further information contact the embassy, high commission or consulate of the country or territory you’re travelling to. You should also consider checking with your transport provider or travel company to make sure your passport and other travel documents meet their requirements.
Entry rules in response to coronavirus (COVID-19)
On 12 May 2022, the French government announced that travel restrictions between France and Réunion would be relaxed. If you’re unvaccinated, you no longer need a compelling reason for travel or proof of a negative COVID-19 test before travel.
You may still face restrictions for entry to Réunion depending on your vaccination status and your country of departure. You should check the status of your country of departure and relevant restrictions on the French government’s website, and the local Prefecture’s website (in French) for details on any remaining local restrictions.  For more information on specific entry measures, you should consult the French government website and this French government COVID-19 website (in French).

Visas
Réunion is an Overseas Department of France (département d’outre-mer) and part of the European Union.
If you hold a British Citizen passport, you don’t need a visa to enter Réunion for stays of up to three months. Other British passport holders, and those who plan to stay longer than three months, should check the current entry requirements on the website of the French Ministry of Foreign Affairs and, if necessary, confirm with the nearest French Diplomatic mission.
