Conflict in Israel and the OPTs
On 7 October 2023 there was a large-scale terrorist attack by Hamas in southern Israel. Hamas continues to launch rockets into Israel and the Israeli Defence Forces are conducting significant military activity in Gaza.
There is also increased military activity by the Israeli Defence Forces around Gaza, within the West Bank and on Israel’s northern border.
There are continued exchanges of rocket, drone and small arms fire over Israel’s northern border with Lebanon and a potential increase in rocket attacks and other incidents of violence across Israel and the OPTs, including the West Bank. On 27 July, a strike on the town of Majdal Shams in the Golan Heights killed at least 12 civilians.
We recognise this a fast-moving situation that poses significant risks. The situation has potential to deteriorate quickly and without warning, and could result in instructions to shelter in place. This could disrupt air and road links out of the country. We strongly encourage you to check you and your dependents have the required documentation to travel at short notice. If your reason to remain in Israel and the OPTs is not essential you should consider leaving if it is safe to do so.
If you are in an area affected by the fighting, follow the instructions of Israeli Home Front Command. To find these:
visit the Israeli Home Front Command website (available in Israel only)
call 104 if you are in Israel
The Israeli government has declared a state of emergency across the whole country. International borders (air and land) in Israel and the OPTs could close at short notice. Check the travel advice for any neighbouring country that you are planning to travel to or through.
Before travelling within Israel or  the OPTs, check the local measures in place, that roads are open and, where appropriate, that scheduled train and bus services are operating.
Monitor this travel advice and other media as the situation is changing fast. Follow and contact FCDO travel on Twitter, Facebook and Instagram. You can also get email notifications when this travel advice is updated.
Read FCDO advice if you’re affected by a crisis abroad.
Travel within or out of Israel or the OPTs is at your own risk. You are encouraged to follow the advice of local authorities, for example on which routes are open or when to take shelter.
Travelling to Egypt from Gaza
The Rafah border crossing has been closed to all civilians due to Israeli military operations in the area since 6 May. When re-opened, it is for the Egyptian and Israeli authorities to determine who is permitted to cross, and when.
If you are a British national in Gaza who wants to leave Gaza, you should make contact with us as soon as possible. There are currently no exit routes available for foreign nationals to depart Gaza as a result of the military operations, but we are working with the Israeli, Egyptian and Jordanian authorities to explore alternatives.
If you are a UK visa holder who meets all of the following criteria, you can contact us to request support to leave Gaza:
you have a spouse/partner or a child aged 17 or under currently living in the UK; and
you hold valid permission to enter or remain in the UK for longer than 6 months
