Stay at home
Only go outside for food, health reasons or work (but only if you cannot work from home)

Wash your hands as soon as you get home
Do not meet others, even friends or family.
You can spread the virus even if you donâ€™t have symptoms.

We strongly encourage any non-resident visitors on holiday to Bermuda to consider leaving as soon as possible to avoid difficulties they will face if travel out of the territory and the wider region are further restricted and they are unable to get home.
You should check the Bermuda Government website for more information.
