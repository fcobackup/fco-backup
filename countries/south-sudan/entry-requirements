Warning
FCDO advises against all travel to South Sudan.

This information is for people travelling on a full ‘British citizen’ passport from the UK who choose to travel against Foreign, Commonwealth and Development Office (FCDO) advice. It is based on the UK government’s understanding of South Sudan’s current rules for the most common types of travel. 
The authorities in South Sudan set and enforce entry rules. If you’re not sure how these requirements apply to you, contact the South Sudanese Embassy in the UK.
Passport validity requirements
To enter South Sudan, your passport must have an ‘expiry date’ at least 6 months after the day you arrive and have at least 2 blank pages.
Check with your travel provider that your passport and other travel documents meet requirements. Renew your passport if you need to.
You will be denied entry if you do not have a valid travel document or try to use a passport that has been reported lost or stolen.
Visa requirements
You must have a visa to enter or travel through South Sudan.
Applying for a visa
You can:
apply online for a South Sudan visa
apply through the South Sudanese Embassy for a visa
If you want to extend your visa, contact the Ministry of the Interior in person:
Ministry of the Interior, Airport Road, Juba
Phone: +211 (0)926 388 499
Email: info@mol.gov.ss
If you plan to work in South Sudan, see information on work permits from the Ministry of Labour.
Registering with the police
You must register at a local police station if you’re in South Sudan for 5 days or more.
Vaccine requirements
To enter South Sudan, you must have a certificate to prove you’ve had a yellow fever vaccination.
For details about medical entry requirements and recommended vaccinations, see TravelHealthPro’s South Sudan guide.
COVID-19
On rare occasions, some travellers have been asked to show proof of their COVID-19 vaccination. You can get proof of vaccination:
from your GP or Health and Social Care Trust
at the location you were vaccinated
in Scotland, through the COVID-19 vaccination helpline or an online customer service portal
in Northern Ireland, from your GP or Health and Social Care Trust
Harassment related to vaccine certificates, visas and work permits  
South Sudan’s security services have harassed, detained and expelled foreign nationals, including non-governmental organisation staff and journalists, when they enter or leave Juba airport. These incidents are often linked to proof of yellow fever vaccination, and visa and work permit issues. Make sure you have the correct visa and any required work permit.
Customs rules
There are strict rules about goods you can take into or out of South Sudan. You must declare anything that may be prohibited or subject to tax or duty. Contact the South Sudanese Embassy in the UK for information.
