The Danish authorities have introduced a number of measures to limit the spread of the virus. Denmark’s Health Authority (Sundhedssytrelsen) has opened a Coronavirus hotline on +45 70 20 02 33, operators speak English and Danish. There is also a Coronavirus website with all the latest information in English.
From 14 March until at least 13 April, the Danish border will be closed to foreign nationals who do not have a ‘worthy purpose’ for entering Denmark. Border checks will be implemented at all entry points. Tourists and those the Danish authorities say cannot demonstrate a ‘worthy purpose’ will not be allowed to cross the border.
Foreign nationals normally living (temporary or permanent residents) and working in Denmark are still able to enter the country, as are those who need to transit through Denmark to return to their place of residence, and those who are providing a service or delivering goods to Denmark. Proof will be required to demonstrate a ‘worthy purpose’ to enter. The Danish authorities have set up a helpline (+45 7020 6044) to provide advice on the conditions of entry for foreign nationals. They have also published an online Q&A.
Copenhagen and Billund airports are open. However, there are limited commercial means to return to the UK by air. From 21 March until at least 4 April, there will be no commercial flights to and from Greenland. The commercial air service to the Faroe Islands has been severely reduced, with only one daily service to and from Copenhagen.
Please contact your airline directly for more information on how your travel plans may be affected and the steps you should take.

The Danish government announced on 17 March that everyone entering Denmark should stay at home for 14 days.
Until at least 30 March, no more than ten people are allowed to gather either outside or inside (public transport, supermarkets, airport and work places exempt). All sport facilities, theatres, cinemas, restaurants, bars, clubs, shopping centres, and shops with close physical contact with customers are closed. Supermarkets and pharmacies remain open.
The Danish authorities have issued recommendations for travellers using public transport, including avoiding travelling during rush hour.
