The Foreign and Commonwealth Office (FCO) advise against all but essential travel to Belize due to travel restrictions implemented by the Belize Government related to the coronavirus (COVID-19) pandemic.
The Government of Belize has announced the closure of all remaining borders including the Philip Goldson International Airport (Belize City). Exit out of Belize will not be possible after border closures.
The Philip Goldson International Airport (Belize City) will close on Monday 23 March following the last scheduled flight departure. The Northern land border (Santa Elena Border) between Corozal and Chetumal, Mexico, including the Corozal free zone, will close at 11.59pm local time on Saturday 21 March. The rest of Belize’s entry ports remain closed – the Western, Southern and any other small border entry points. These restrictions will be reviewed after 30 days.
At the Northern border, Belizean nationals, residents and diplomats residing in Belize will be allowed entry into Belize subject to inspection and possible quarantine for 14 days. But there will be no exit from Belize except for agreed emergencies.

Belize authorities already have in place a number of precautionary measures and travel restrictions. Among these, British and European nationals, as well as anyone who has travelled to the UK and Europe within the last 30 days, will be prohibited entry into Belize.
Flights out of the country and the region remain restricted. Currently flights are still leaving to Mexico and the United States (with restrictions, please see FCO travel advice pages for the USA from Philip Goldson International Airport (Belize City).

Departing via land crossing at the Northern border (Santa Elena Border) between Corozal and Chetumal, Mexico (until border closure) into Mexico to pick up an onward flight may also be an option.
