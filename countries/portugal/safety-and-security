Crime
Crime rates are low but pickpocketing, handbag snatching and theft from cars and holiday properties are common in major tourist areas and can be accompanied by violence. Be alert, keep sight of your belongings at all times and beware of thieves using distraction techniques. Be especially vigilant on public transport (particularly the popular numbers 15 and 28 trams in Lisbon) and at busy railway and underground stations and crowded bus and tram stops.
Do not carry all your valuables together in handbags or pockets. Leave spare cash and valuables in a safe place. Avoid leaving items in an unattended car, even for a short period; if you have no alternative, hide them in the boot before you reach your destination. Foreign-registered and hire cars are often targeted by thieves.
Report the loss or theft of your passport immediately to the local police and obtain a police report. You will need the report for insurance purposes.
Make sure your holiday accommodation has adequate security. Lock all doors and windows at night and when you go out. If you’re worried about security at your accommodation, speak to your tour operator or the owner. Familiarise yourself with the contact details of the local PSP (city police) or GNR (rural and small town police).
Personal attacks, including sexual assaults are rare, but do occur. Buy your own drinks and keep sight of them at all times to make sure they aren’t spiked. Drinks served in bars overseas are often stronger than those in the UK. Avoid splitting up from your friends, and don’t go off with people you don’t know.

Road travel
In 2021, there were 514 road deaths in Portugal (source: Department for Transport). This equates to 5 road deaths per 100,000 of population and compares to the UK average of 2.4 road deaths per 100,000 of population in 2021.

Licences and documents
You can drive in Portugal on your UK driving licence.
If you’re living in Portugal, check the Living in Guide for information on requirements for residents.
Driving a British car abroad
You may need a UK sticker to drive your car outside the UK. From 28 September 2021 UK stickers have replaced GB stickers. Check the GOV.UK Displaying number plates website for more information on what to do if you are driving outside the UK.
Driving regulations
Driving is on the right. If you hire a car, make sure you have the appropriate insurance and check how you will pay for any toll charges.
Driving regulations in Portugal can differ from those in the UK. See the European Commission, AA and RAC guides on driving in Portugal.
Bringing a vehicle to Portugal
As a tourist, you can bring your own vehicle to Portugal for a maximum of 183 days in any 12-month period. You must not use your vehicle for any other purpose than tourism or loan it to anyone else during that time. If you intend to stay longer, you must apply to the Portuguese Customs authority to have the car legally imported. You will be fined if you leave the country without your car.
Local travel
Madeira
Walking the levadas (ancient irrigation channels) can be challenging. Choose only the ones that are suited to your own standard of fitness and experience. Be prepared for narrow, uneven paths and heights. Wear suitable clothing and walking boots. Leave details of where you are going with your hotel reception and take your mobile telephone with you. You can reduce risks by walking with a group or following a guide. Take extra care if it has rained as the ground may be slippery and unstable. Check with your tour guide or local organiser that it is safe to visit before setting off.
Further information about walkway closures and access restrictions can be found on the Visit Madeira official website.
Beaches and swimming
Deaths by drowning occur every year on Portuguese beaches and in swimming pools. The Maritime Police have the authority to fine bathers who disobey the lifeguard’s warning flags.
Take warning flags on beaches seriously. The red flag indicates danger: never enter the water when the red flag is flying. If there is a yellow flag, you may paddle at the water’s edge, but not swim. The green flag indicates that it is safe to swim, and the chequered flag means that the beach is temporarily unmanned. Follow local advice if jellyfish are present.
Take care when walking close to the water’s edge along unsupervised stretches of beaches. Waves can be unpredictable and have a strong undertow.
Don’t swim at beaches that link to/from rivers, or those without lifeguards. Don’t dive into unknown water as hidden rocks or shallow depths can cause serious injury or death.
Look out for signs warning of cliff erosion. Falling rocks are a hazard, particularly in the Algarve, and the authorities can fine those who ignore warning signs.
