This page reflects the UK government’s understanding of current rules for people travelling on a full ‘British Citizen’ passport from the UK, for the most common types of travel.
The authorities in Madagascar set and enforce entry rules.
All travellers
All travellers to Madagascar need to follow pre-departure PCR test, antigen test on arrival, and any relevant quarantine requirements, regardless of vaccination status.
These include:
negative PCR test result taken within 72hrs before departure
COVID-19 antigen test on arrival (at a cost of €15 / US$25 / 65,000 Ariary in cash)
If your arrival antigen test result is positive for COVID-19, you will be required to quarantine for a further 7 days at a designated hotel at your own cost, and may be referred to a local medical facility for treatment if you develop serious symptoms. You should check what your insurance covers in advance of travel.
Further details and forms for completion can be found on the Madagascar Tourism website (in French).
You will need a non-immigrant visa to enter or travel through Madagascar as a short term visitor, or an immigrant visa for stays over 90 days.
