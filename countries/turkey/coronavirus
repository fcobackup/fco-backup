Coronavirus travel health
Check the latest information on risk from COVID-19 for Turkey on the TravelHealthPro website.
See the TravelHealthPro website for further advice on travel abroad and reducing spread of respiratory viruses during the COVID-19 pandemic.
Entry and borders
See Entry requirements to find out what you will need to do when you arrive in Turkey.
Be prepared for your plans to change
No travel is risk-free during the COVID-19 pandemic. Countries may further restrict travel or bring in new rules at short notice, for example, due to a new COVID-19 variant. Check with your travel company or airline for any transport changes which may delay your journey home.
If you test positive for COVID-19, you will need to stay where you are for seven days. If you do not have a place to stay, government authorities will direct you to a designated hotel if you do not have a permanent residence. Your details will be taken so the authorities can monitor your isolation.
Plan ahead and make sure you:
can access money
understand what your insurance will cover
can make arrangements to extend your stay and be away for longer than planned
International travel
Air carriers are free to operate direct flights to the UK from their usual airports in Turkey. Check their websites for the latest flight schedules.

Public spaces and services
Face masks are no longer required outdoors or indoors if air circulation and social distancing are adequate.
Turkey will accept the UK’s proof of COVID-19 recovery and vaccination record. A COVID-19 recovery certificate must have been issued no more than 6 months before arrival. Your NHS appointment card from vaccination centres is not designed to be used as proof of vaccination and should not be used to demonstrate your vaccine status.
Healthcare in Turkey
You should ensure that you are prepared for any unplanned or extended stays due to changes in COVID-related restrictions or your travel arrangements. If you take regular medication, make sure you have adequate supplies to cover you in case you are required to quarantine as a result of a positive COVID test.
British-issued prescriptions are not accepted in pharmacies in Turkey, although some medicines may be available over the counter.
If your medical supplies do run out whilst in Turkey it may be possible, in some cases, to liaise with Turkish hospitals and your GP to arrange for a Turkish prescription for the equivalent medicine. For contact details for English speaking doctors visit our list of healthcare providers.
Your emotional and mental wellbeing is important. Read guidance on how to look after your mental wellbeing and mental health.
