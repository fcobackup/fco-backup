Volcanoes
El Salvador has a number of active volcanoes.
Seek local advice before climbing any volcanoes in El Salvador and monitor local media for any updates on increased volcanic activity. You can find volcano warnings on the website of the Directorate General of Civil Protection (in Spanish). When climbing volcanoes or walking in remote areas, it is safer do so in daylight hours and with a tour guide.
Rainy season
The rainy season normally runs from June to November, coinciding with the hurricane season in the Caribbean. During the rainy season you can expect frequent heavy rain, thunder storms and possible tropical depressions. Roads can be affected by landslides and flooding. Mountain areas are particularly vulnerable to landslides.
On 9 October, Tropical Storm Julia struck El Salvador causing widespread damage, 10 people lost their lives, and over 2000 people were evacuated. The Government of El Salvador called for a State of Emergency for 15 days to facilitate response to the consequences of the storm. Tropical Storm Julia was downgraded to a tropical depression, however, continuing rainfall on saturated land could cause further complications.
Monitor local and international weather updates from the Ministry of the Environment and Natural Resources (MARN), the World Meteorological Organisation and the US National Hurricane Centre. See our Tropical Cyclones page for advice about what to do if you are caught up in a hurricane.
Earthquakes
El Salvador is subject to frequent minor earth tremors and occasional earthquakes. Local information can be found (in Spanish) on the MARN website or their Twitter feed @MedioAmbienteSV
Make sure you know what action to take should an earthquake occur. If you are staying in a hotel read their earthquake instructions. The US Federal Emergency Management Agency website has advice about what to do before, during and after an earthquake or tsunami.
Fire
Fires can increase during the dry season; particularly in San Salvador. You can contact the fire brigade by calling 911.
