All scheduled commercial flights have been cancelled. The government of Mongolia has also suspended charter flights indefinitely, although there may be flights leaving Mongolia on 18 and 19 November. The UK government is working closely with the Mongolian authorities to understand when new charter flight options will become available.
Flights
The government of Mongolia has suspended charter flights indefinitely except for a flight to Seoul on 18 November and another to Frankfurt on 19 November, both of which are yet to be confirmed. If you’re interested in leaving Mongolia on either of these two flights you should contact Mongolian Airlines (MIAT).
As further information becomes available it will be shared on these pages and on the British Embassy Ulaanbaatar Twitter and Facebook sites. If you wish to leave Mongolia, please send contact details and a photo of the ID page of your passport to consular.mongolia@fcdo.gov.uk. We will add you to our list and keep you updated.
You will need to pay for your return travel to the UK. If departure options are available but you cannot afford the travel costs and have exhausted all other options for getting funds, you may be eligible to apply for an emergency loan from the government. This is a last resort option and you would need to repay the loan when you are back in the UK.
For more information, you should contact Corporate Travel Management (CTM). CTM are a commercial partner of the FCDO and are authorised to administer such loans on behalf of the FCDO.
Your journey home: re-entering the UK
When you return, you must follow the rules for entering the UK. You:
need to provide your journey and contact details up to 48 hours before you’re due to arrive in the UK
are not allowed to leave the place you’re staying for the first 14 days you’re in the UK except in very limited situations (known as ‘self-isolating’)
See also the list of people who are exempt from the border rules.
The National Travel Health Network and Centre (NaTHNaC) also provides advice on how to stay safe as you travel by air.
Future travel options
The UK government is working closely with airlines, the Mongolian authorities and other governments to make sure options are available for you to return to the UK as soon as possible. This travel advice will be updated when departure options become available.
