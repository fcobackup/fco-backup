Coronavirus
Due to partial border closure there is mandatory 14-day quarantine for passengers arriving from WHO declared risk or symptomatic countries (China, South Korea, Japan, Singapore, Iran, Spain, Italy, France and Germany) and those who have had contact with a coronavirus infected person.
Only Uruguayan nationals and legal residents are allowed to enter Uruguay under current coronavirus related restrictions. See Coronavirus.
The information on this page covers the most common types of travel and reflects the UK government’s understanding of the rules currently in place. Unless otherwise stated, this information is for travellers using a full ‘British Citizen’ passport.
The authorities in the country or territory you’re travelling to are responsible for setting and enforcing the rules for entry. If you’re unclear about any aspect of the entry requirements, or you need further reassurance, you’ll need to contact the embassy, high commission or consulate of the country or territory you’re travelling to.
You should also consider checking with your transport provider or travel company to make sure your passport and other travel documents meet their requirements.
Visas   
British passport holders visiting for up to 90 days don’t need a visa. For information on how to extend your stay or take up residency in Uruguay visit Dirección Nacional de Migración (in Spanish). For other information on entry regulations and living in Uruguay contact the nearest Uruguayan Embassy.
Passport validity
Your passport should be valid for at least the proposed duration of your stay. No additional period of validity beyond this is required.
UK Emergency Travel Documents
UK Emergency Travel Documents are accepted for entry, airside transit and exit from Uruguay. The validity requirements are the same as for full validity British passports. If you plan to travel to Argentina or the US you will need a visa in your ETD. You must contact the nearest Embassies of those countries in order to apply.
Customs controls
Strict customs controls prohibit visitors from importing animal and dairy products, fruit and vegetables. All baggage is x-rayed on arrival and may be searched.
Travelling with children
There are various requirements for travelling out of Uruguay with British or dual national children under the age of 18 who live in Uruguay. The Ministry of Interior’s website has more information, or you can contact a law firm with expertise in this subject.
