Romania is largely a cash economy. While an increasing number of businesses do accept credit cards, it may be safer to use cash due to the risk of credit card fraud. There is now a large network of ATMs that accept standard international credit and debit cards. Check with your card provider whether you will be able to use these machines.
US dollars and sterling are not always easy to exchange for local currency, especially outside Bucharest. Euros are widely accepted. You may have difficulties using travellersâ€™ cheques. Scottish and Northern Irish bank notes may not be accepted in banks and bureaux de change.
