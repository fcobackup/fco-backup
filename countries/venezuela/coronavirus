Travel in Venezuela
Authorities have announced social/community-wide quarantine and bans on inter-state travel with roadblocks in place. Inter-state travel requires a special permit or “salvoconducto” to be issued by the respective regional REDI or ZODI authorities.
Passengers located in the Caracas (Distrito Capital) area with confirmed travel itineraries are allowed to reach the airport in Maiquetia (La Guaira) without any special permit. Movement to the airport via land from other states require a “salvoconducto” in advance of travel. There are no domestic flights to Maiquetia operating until further notice.
The use of face covering is mandatory at all times, including when travelling via land in private vehicles.
Certain municipalities might be under stricter lockdown than others depending on the number of COVID-19 infections reported. Stay informed through local media reports and follow the advice of local authorities.
Accommodation
Most hotels are open and able to receive guests. Private accommodation rental remains possible, although with reduced availability.
Some hotels may require guests to be COVID-19 tested before allowing them to check-in into their premises, please confirm any specific requirements in advance.

Schools and universities remain closed until further notice.
Public gatherings are prohibited and people have been instructed to wear face covering at all times when outside.

COVID-19 testing is handled by the public health system through CDIs (centros de diagnóstico integral) and a designated network of public hospitals or “hospitales centinela” throughout the country. Testing usually takes from 24 to 48 hours, and during this time the patient with symptoms must remain in isolation on a designated health facility. If an individual tests positive, quarantine in a designated medical facility is mandatory.
