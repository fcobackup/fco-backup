There is a high risk of tribal fighting in Hela and Southern Highlands provinces. Enga province has also suffered significant unrest during national elections in July. If you’re planning to travel there, you should take greater care than usual and consider enhanced security precautions.
Outbreaks of tribal violence may occur anywhere with little warning and may escalate very quickly. The risk has been more acute since July 2022 following the national elections. You should avoid large crowds and public gatherings and any electoral related activities, including count centres, as they may turn violent. See Crime
