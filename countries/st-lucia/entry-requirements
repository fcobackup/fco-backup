This page has information on travelling to St Lucia.
This page reflects the UK government’s understanding of current rules for people travelling on a full ‘British Citizen’ passport from the UK, for the most common types of travel.
The authorities in St Lucia set and enforce entry rules. If you’re unsure how St Lucia’s entry requirements apply to you, contact its UK embassy, high commission or consulate.
All travellers
The Government of St Lucia removed all COVID-19 related entry requirements effective from 1 February 2023.
All travellers arriving should fill in the online immigration form within 72 hours before arrival. The form and information on the process can be found on the St Lucia Tourism Authority website. This replaces the written form and should speed up the arrival process. Anyone who does not travel with proof of the online form will be able to complete a paper form on arrival until they are phased out at the end of July 2023.
