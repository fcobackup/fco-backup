If you plan to pass through another country to return to the UK, check the travel advice for the country you’re transiting.
Be prepared for your plans to change
No travel is risk-free during COVID-19. Countries may further restrict travel or bring in new rules at short notice, for example due to a new COVID-19 variant. Check with your travel company or airline for any transport changes which may delay your journey home.
Plan ahead and make sure you:
can access money
understand what your insurance will cover
can make arrangements to extend your stay and be away for longer than planned
If you test positive for COVID-19 before returning to the UK
The Government of Seychelles does not routinely require travellers to take a PCR test before departure. Airlines or final destinations, however, may require it, and you should check the requirements if necessary. Visitors who develop symptoms of a possible respiratory infection will be referred to health services for further assessment and testing. You can expect to be contacted by the authorities in Seychelles if you test positive for COVID-19. If you display severe symptoms, particularly if you are in an at-risk category, then you may be cared for at a government-run facility.
Symptomatic Cases
All visitors arriving in Seychelles are advised to report any symptoms they develop, that may be associated with COVID-19 to their nearest health centre. They may be subject to testing, isolation, care and/or quarantine, as per national protocols in-effect.
Asymptomatic Cases
People who are asymptomatic/mildly symptomatic must undergo self-isolation at their accommodation establishment at their own cost. They can expect to self-isolate for 7 days. Guests may not change accommodation during a period of self-isolation without the permission of the Public Health Authority.
If parents are required to self-isolate, then minors will be expected to stay with them or with other family members. Unaccompanied minors (i.e. under 18 years of age) will normally be treated as adults.
If you are travelling with children, you should contact the Seychelles Ministry of Health before you travel to confirm you are satisfied with the procedures in place should you be required to self-isolate during your stay.
