Soufrière Hills volcano
The Soufrière Hills volcano has been active since 1995. However, there has been no major volcanic activity since February 2010. There are 5 exclusion zones around the volcano – A, B, C, F and V – and only one – zone V – is currently in force. See the hazard level system (HLS) map on the Montserrat Observatory website.
Zones A, B, C, and V include some of the waters immediately around the island and there are 2 additional maritime exclusion zones – E and W. Mariners can pick up maps showing the maritime zones along with their GPS co-ordinates at the Montserrat Port Authority at Port Little Bay.
Volcanic activity is monitored 24 hours a day from the Montserrat Volcano Observatory. The volcanic hazard level system specifies the current level of volcanic activity on a scale from 0 to 5, where 5 is the highest.
The current hazard level is 1, which allows unlimited access to zones A, B, C and F. Zone V is authorised access only, and you are not allowed to enter without permission from the authorities. Vessels are not permitted to enter the maritime exclusion zones without permission.
An island-wide siren system is used to warn of volcanic activity. The sirens are tested daily at midday. If the sirens sound at a non-test time, tune to Radio Montserrat (ZJB) immediately on FM 88.3 or 95.5 to get alerts. The radio station also gives regular scientific updates and advice.
Ash falls and flight cancellations
The 40% of the island that is not directly affected by volcanic activity is still prone to ash falls and volcanic gases if the wind is blowing from south to north. Ash falls can lead to flight cancellations.
