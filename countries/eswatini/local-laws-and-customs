Coronavirus guidance is being updated.
Read the Prime Ministerâ€™s statement for the latest information.

Possession and smuggling of narcotics are illegal. Foreign nationals have been imprisoned on drug offences. Punishments can be severe.
Same-sex relationships and acts are illegal in Eswatini. There is prevalent discrimination against LGBT people within society and many LGBT people are not open about their sexual orientation or gender identity. It is therefore advisable to refrain from overt displays of affection in public, such as holding hands or kissing. See our information and advice page for the LGBT community before you travel.
