(see Demonstrating your COVID-19 status below for definition of fully vaccinated).
All travellers into Brunei must;
be fully vaccinated with 2 doses unless they can show proof of a medical exemption from having the COVID-19 vaccination (under 18s travelling with a group of all vaccinated adults will follow the vaccinated protocols). Please see “Demonstrating your COVID-19 status” below for new definition after 31 October 2022.

If you’re fully-vaccinated
Fully-vaccinated travellers entering Brunei must take an ART at home after arriving in Brunei on Day 1, Day 2 and Day 3. The results must be uploaded onto the BruHealth App. Self-isolation is not longer required if the ART result performed at home on Day 1 is negative. You must pay $40 BND before travelling for the three ART kits given to you on arrival.
Demonstrating your COVID-19 status
To enter Brunei, a traveller is considered fully vaccinated if they have received two doses of a vaccine that has received WHO emergency use listing (or one dose for Johnson & Johnson). From 1 November 2022 a traveller will only be considered fully vaccinated if they have had a booster shot or received their second dose not more than three (3) months prior. Travellers who are not fully-vaccinated are only permitted to enter Brunei if they can verify that they are medically exempted from receiving a COVID-19 vaccination.
Brunei will accept the UK’s proof of COVID-19 recovery and vaccination record. Your NHS appointment card from vaccination centres is not designed to be used as proof of vaccination and should not be used to demonstrate your vaccine status.
If you’re not fully vaccinated
Travellers who are not fully-vaccinated are only permitted to enter Brunei if they can verify that they are medically exempted from receiving a COVID-19 vaccination. They are required to take an ART at home on the day of their arrival (Day 1) and a RT-PCR test on Day 3 at an accredited private clinic. They are also required to undergo self-isolation until a negative RT-PCR result is obtained. Travellers will be charged $100 BND before travelling for both ART and RT-PCR. COVID-19 recovered travellers are only required to perform the ART upon arrival and are exempted from the mandatory self-isolation.
Travellers who have recently had COVID
Travellers who have recovered from COVID-19 in the past 90 days do not have to take a pre-travel COVID-19 test and will only have to take one ART on arrival at home or their hotel. They must have a certificate as proof of recovery from COVID-19 in the past 90 days.
Travellers who have recovered from COVID-19 in the past 90 days will be exempted from undergoing mandatory self-isolation.
Data collection
On arrival in Brunei, it is mandatory to use the BruHealth app to record test results, record your health status on a daily basis and to enter public buildings and events where you need to scan a QR code. Failure to do so may result in financial penalties and legal repercussions, additionally you not being able to access public buildings.
Exemptions
Exceptions will be considered by the Prime Minister’s Office on a case-by-case basis. You should refer to the Prime Minister’s Office website for the latest information and their contact details.
Children and young people
Under 18s travelling with a group of all vaccinated adults will follow the vaccinated protocols. See ‘If you’re fully vaccinated’.
If you’re transiting through Brunei
Transiting is when you pass through one country on the way to your final destination.
Check with your airline before departing.
Exiting Brunei
Travellers exiting Brunei (to any destination) no longer require a travel permit. Citizens and residents who wish to travel are required to be fully vaccinated against COVID-19, with the second dose administered not more than 3 months prior to departure or have received a booster dose. From 15 May 2022 this will apply to 12 - 17 year olds too. Unvaccinated passengers will only be permitted to travel if they have a certificate of medical exemption from vaccination or of having recovered from COVID-19 in the past 90 days. Brunei citizens and permanent residents are required to obtain a Travel Medical Insurance with COVID-19 coverage (a minimum coverage of $50,000 BND) valid for the entire duration of their travel.
Land borders are still closed and crossing will require a special permit. You should refer to the Prime Minister’s Office website for the latest information.
Check your passport and travel documents before you travel
Visas
British Citizen passport holders may enter Brunei for up to 90 days without a visa. If you have another type of British nationality, check with Brunei immigration authorities about visa requirements.
Make sure the entry stamp in your passport indicates the validity of your stay. There are strict penalties for overstaying.
If you’re staying longer than 90 days and/or visiting for non-tourist purposes, you will need to get a visa from the nearest Brunei diplomatic mission before you travel.
Passport validity  
Your passport should be valid for a minimum period of 6 months from the date of entry into Brunei. 
Dual nationality
Brunei does not recognise dual nationality. You can be refused entry if you’re found to be holding two passports of different nationality. If you’re a dual national, it’s advisable to enter Brunei on the passport on which you exited your last country of departure. While in Brunei your nationality will be deemed to be that shown on the passport which you used to enter the country. This may affect the consular assistance that you receive in Brunei.
Yellow fever certificate requirements
Check whether you need a yellow fever certificate by visiting the National Travel Health Network and Centre’s TravelHealthPro website.
UK Emergency Travel Documents
UK Emergency travel documents (ETDs) are accepted for entry, airside transit and exit from Brunei. They should have at least 6 months validity. You’ll have to obtain an exit and entry visa from Brunei Immigration before you travel. Please be aware that same day ETDs are not available.
