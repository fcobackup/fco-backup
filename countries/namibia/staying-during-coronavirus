This page gives you guidance on how to stay safely in Namibia as a visitor, if you are unable to return to the UK.
Everyone should comply with the measures put in place in Namibia to limit the spread of coronavirus (COVID-19).
Registering with the British High Commission
If you have not already contacted the British High Commission to make them aware of your presence in Namibia, you should do so now by emailing general.windhoek@fco.gov.uk, providing your:
full name
passport number
date of birth
current location in Namibia
details of how to contact you
Remember to send a further email should your situation change.
Moving around in Namibia
For information on entering Namibia, see Entry requirements.
Stage 2 of restrictions is in force for 28 days from 5 May to 1 June. These restrictions include:
all members of the public required to wear facemasks in public spaces
no restrictions on travel domestically within Namibia
borders will remain closed
certain businesses and activities are permitted to reopen – these include shopping malls and retail outlets, restaurants on a take away basis only
buying and selling of alcohol is prohibited

Finance
There is a range of financial support from the government that you can access while you are unable to return due to coronavirus restrictions.
If you’re in Namibia, and have exhausted all other options to cover essential living costs while you wait to return home, you could apply for an emergency loan for your living costs from the UK government. You can only apply if you normally live in the UK and you cannot return home. This last-resort option is for those most in need, and you would need to repay the loan when you are back in the UK. Apply for an emergency loan.
For further UK government guidance on support you can access whilst abroad, visit our waiting to return guidance. This includes guidance on finance, health, and staying connected.
Help and support
If you need urgent consular assistance, contact your nearest British embassy, high commission or consulate. All telephone numbers are available 24/7.
