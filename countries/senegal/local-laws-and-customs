You can spread the virus even if you don’t have symptoms.

Local laws reflect the fact that Senegal is a predominantly Muslim country. You should respect local traditions, customs, laws and religions at all times and be aware of your actions so that they don’t offend others, especially during the holy month of Ramadan or if you intend to visit religious areas. In 2020, Ramadan is expected to begin on or around 23 April.
You should dress and behave modestly in public outside the main tourist areas. Bars and restaurants usually serve alcoholic drinks but drunkenness is considered offensive, and penalties for drink driving are severe. Kissing as a greeting is acceptable but kissing romantically in public is not.
Penalties for possession, use or trafficking of illegal drugs are severe. Convicted offenders can expect lengthy jail sentences and heavy fines.
Homosexual activity is illegal and not tolerated in Senegal’s conservative society. See our information and advice page for the LGBT community before you travel.
