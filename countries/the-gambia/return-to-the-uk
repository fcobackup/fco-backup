You will need to pay for your return travel to the UK. If departure options are available but you cannot afford the travel costs and you have exhausted all other options available to you for getting funds, you may be eligible to apply for an emergency loan to cover the cost of the ticket. This is a last resort option and you would need to repay the loan when you are back in the UK.
