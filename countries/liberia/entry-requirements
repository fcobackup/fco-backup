The information on this page covers the most common types of travel and reflects the UK government’s understanding of the rules currently in place. Unless otherwise stated, this information is for travellers using a full ‘British Citizen’ passport.
The authorities in the country or territory you’re travelling to are responsible for setting and enforcing the rules for entry. If you’re unclear about any aspect of the entry requirements, or you need further reassurance, you’ll need to contact the embassy, high commission or consulate of the country or territory you’re travelling to.
You should also consider checking with your transport provider or travel company to make sure your passport and other travel documents meet their requirements.
Entry rules in response to coronavirus (COVID-19)
Entry to Liberia
Roberts International Airport (RIA) has reopened for commercial flights as of 28 June. However, airlines will not resume normal scheduled services immediately. Brussels Airlines is operating a reduced flight schedule. Other airlines have not confirmed planned flights. If you wish to travel, you should contact your airline or travel agent for confirmation of flight schedules.
Currently all land borders (with Sierra Leone, Guinea and Côte d’Ivoire) are closed to travellers. Ports remain open.
Testing / screening on arrival
All travellers arriving in Liberia will be screened for the coronavirus. On arrival at entry points, staff will check your temperature and you must wash your hands with soap and water. If you display symptoms of coronavirus, public health officials may take you to a quarantine facility. In Roberts International Airport, you must stand in marked spaces within the terminal to allow for social distancing.
Passengers entering Liberia have two options for COVID-19 testing. Government of Liberia strongly encourages travellers to be tested before arrival in Liberia. You can have a COVID-19 PCR test at your point of departure within 72 hours before your arrival in Liberia. If you present a negative PCR test result on arrival in Liberia, you will be allowed entry with symptom monitoring via USSD or mobile app.
You should not use the NHS testing service to get a test in order to facilitate your travel to another country. You should arrange to take a private test.
If you do not do a pre-departure PCR test before your arrival in Liberia, you will be tested on arrival. You will have to do a Rapid Test, and a swab will be collected for PCR test processing. If your Rapid Test result is negative, you will be allowed entry with symptom monitoring via USSD or mobile app.
If your Rapid Test result is positive, you will be taken to a government quarantine facility pending your PCR test result. Sample processing could take several days. If your subsequent PCR result is positive you must remain in government quarantine. It is likely you will have to remain in quarantine until you have two consecutive negative PCR results. Quarantine may last 14 days or longer.
You should be prepared for travel restrictions, and changes to screening and precautionary observation requirements with no advance notice.
Quarantine
There is a high risk for British nationals of being put into 14 days of quarantine, either on arrival or during your trip to Liberia. Liberian Precautionary Observation Centre (POCs) are basic, and not guaranteed to meet Public Health England standards.
You are at risk of being put into quarantine or instructed to self-isolate for 14 days even after you have arrived in Liberia, if you develop symptoms (fever, cough or respiratory illness), or it is suspected you have been in contact with some who has tested positive for coronavirus. If you test positive for COVID-19, you may be transferred to a government treatment centre. You are strongly advised to familiarise yourself with these risks before travelling.
All foreign citizens in quarantine or self-isolation will have their passports removed and held by the National Public Health Institute of Liberia (NPHIL) for 14 days. You will be given a copy of your passport to retain whilst in quarantine.
If you are travelling on behalf of government, an international organisation/NGO or a company, you should check with your organisation whether they have pre-arranged a private POC, i.e. quarantine facility, authorised by NHPIL. The British Embassy cannot provide POC facilities. If you show symptoms, you may be transferred to quarantine or a government treatment centre
Visitors arriving on a laissez-passer (except UN or EU), may also be taken to quarantine for secondary screening. Any suspicion of illegal attempts to circumvent the process will result in 14 days of quarantine.
Data collection
On arrival in Liberia, you must register for symptom monitoring and contact tracing by providing a mobile phone number for USSD messaging or mobile app.
