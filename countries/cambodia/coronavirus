Travel in Cambodia
There are no travel restrictions within Cambodia and you can travel to the airport either from within Phnom Penh or from the provinces.
You are expected to wear a face covering when inside the airport and many airlines will ask for face coverings to be worn. While no penalties are currently being imposed by the Cambodian authorities for refusing to wear a face covering, our advice is to wear a face covering whenever requested to.
Accomodation
Hotel and private rental accommodation is available throughout Cambodia. Some hotels have closed and remain so, and we advise that you contact hotels directly when booking. The majority of hotels will ask to take your temperature on arrival and ask you to complete a declaration in relation to your recent travel history and whether you have any symptoms related to COVID-19.
Some services and facilities in hotels may not be available e.g. leisure facilities.
Public places and services
A large number of shops, restaurants and bars are now open but nightclubs remain closed.
Public beaches remain open.
Leisure facilities such as gyms are closed and the Cambodian authorities have asked that large scale events such as weddings be postponed.
