Warning
FCDO advises against all but essential travel to parts of Bangladesh.

This information is for people travelling on a full ‘British citizen’ passport from the UK. It is based on the UK government’s understanding of Bangladesh’s current rules for the most common types of travel.
The authorities in Bangladesh set and enforce entry rules. If you are not sure how these requirements apply to you, contact the Bangladeshi High Commission in the UK.
Passport validity requirements
To enter Bangladesh, your passport must have at least 2 blank pages and no damage.
See ‘Applying for a visa’ for passport validity requirements for visas.
Check with your travel provider that your passport and other travel documents meet the requirements. Renew your passport if you need to.
You will be denied entry if you do not have a valid travel document or try to use a passport that has been reported lost or stolen.
Make sure you get your passport stamped.
Make sure you get an entry stamp in your passport when you arrive. Immigration officers will check the date on your entry stamp when you leave Bangladesh. You could get a fine for overstaying.
At Bangladeshi border control, you may also need to show a return or onward ticket.
Visa requirements
You must have a visa to visit Bangladesh for up to 3 months, unless you have a ‘no visa required’ stamp in your UK passport.
Applying for a visa
Apply in advance for a visa from the Bangladeshi High Commission in the UK.
Your passport must have an ‘expiry date’ at least 6 months after the date your visa starts. The visa starts from the date of issue, not the date of travel. If you plan to use Bangladesh as a hub to visit other countries in the region, make sure you get a multiple-entry visa.
You may be able to apply for a visa on arrival at Dhaka airport. You must have a return ticket and proof of funds to apply for a visa on arrival. Visas on arrival are:
single entry
valid for 15 to 30 days
not guaranteed – Bangladeshi immigration officers issue them at their discretion
also available for business travel if you have a letter of introduction
If you want to stay longer, you can apply for a visa extension from the Department of Immigration and Passports.
Working in Bangladesh
If you are working in Bangladesh, you must get a work permit, and you’ll need an Income Tax Clearance Certificate or an Income Tax Exemption Certificate before leaving Bangladesh. You get application forms from the National Board of Revenue, Bangladesh.
‘No visa required’ stamp
British nationals of Bangladeshi origin may be eligible to apply for a ‘no visa required’ stamp from the Bangladeshi High Commission in the UK.
Vaccine requirements
To enter Bangladesh, you must have certificates to prove you’ve had: 
a yellow fever vaccination if you’re coming from a country listed as a transmission risk
a polio vaccine, in certain circumstances
For full details about medical entry requirements and recommended vaccinations, see TravelHealthPro’s Bangladesh guide.
Customs rules
There are strict rules about goods you can take into or out of Bangladesh. You must declare anything that may be prohibited or subject to tax or duty.
Taking money into or out of Bangladesh
You may need to declare foreign currency or Bangladeshi taka, depending on the amount you are travelling with.
You can cash travellers cheques at banks and airports. ATMs are available in most urban areas and accept UK cards. There are fewer ATMs in rural areas.
