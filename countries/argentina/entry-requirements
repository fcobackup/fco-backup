Visas
You don’t need a visa to enter or travel through Argentina as a visitor, unless you’re travelling on an Emergency Travel Document. To apply for this visa you must contact the Consulate of the Argentine Republic closest to you.
On presentation of a valid British passport you will be granted permission to stay in the country for a period of up to 90 days at the discretion of the Immigration Officer. You can obtain proof of your last entry or exit from Argentina from the Argentine Migration Office website. If you wish to extend your stay for another 90-day period, seek advice from the Argentine Migration Office before your current authorised stay runs out.
If you’re travelling to Argentina for any purpose other than tourism, contact the Consulate of the Argentine Republic in London.
UK Emergency Travel Documents

For entry into Argentina, your ETD should be valid for the proposed duration of your stay. No additional period of validity beyond this is required. Check with your travel provider to make sure your passport and other travel documents meet their requirements.
