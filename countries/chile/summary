October and November 2019 saw large-scale protests and violence across Chile. Major protests were widely expected to return in March 2020, but incidents were limited, likely owing to the health crisis. Starting in April there were occasional cases of violence and protest in Santiago and other cities. Since July protests and violence have increased in Santiago, with various incidents having occurred, including the use of projectiles against police, flaming barricades and arson attacks against the public transport network by small groups of protesters. The first anniversary of the start of the ‘social crisis’ (October 2020) saw renewed protest and violence ahead of Chile’s constitutional plebiscite held on 25 October. There remains a possibility of protest associated with the country’s two-year constitutional reform process initiated by the plebiscite. You should follow local guidance and avoid protests.
Other cities, including Concepción, Viña del Mar, Valparaíso, and Osorno have also seen sporadic incidents over the past few months. Some protests have seen isolated incidents of the use of small arms by members of the public. If protests take place, you should follow the instructions and advice of the local authorities, remain vigilant, monitor local media for updates and avoid protests and demonstrations. Under Chilean law, foreign nationals visiting or living in Chile could be deported for involvement in protests and demonstrations. See Local laws and customs
Opportunistic street crime can be a problem in towns and cities, and in areas popular with tourists including airports, bus stations and ports. Take care of your personal belongings at all times and be aware of your surroundings. Carry a photocopy of your passport and keep the original document in a safe place. See Crime.
Terrorist attacks in Chile can’t be ruled out. See Terrorism
