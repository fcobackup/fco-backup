This section has safety advice for regions of Liberia. It only covers regions where FCDO has specific advice.
You should also read FCDO’s overall travel advice and safety and security advice.
Liberia-Côte d’Ivoire border
There are sometimes clashes between armed groups from both sides of the Liberia-Côte d’Ivoire border in some of the more remote border areas of Grand Gedeh and River Gee counties. Use the main roads when travelling in these areas.
Sinoe rubber plantation and Sapo National Park
The Liberian authorities have limited ability to provide emergency help outside Monrovia. Check the security situation before travelling to any part of the country. Land disputes, illegal mining and occupation of rubber plantations can lead to violent incidents, particularly in rural areas.
There may be organised groups of former combatants in areas of the country where there is limited government security presence. Be especially wary in the Sinoe rubber plantation and Sapo National Park.
