FCDO advises against all but essential travel to New Caledonia
Your travel insurance could be invalidated if you travel against FCDO advice. Consular support is also severely limited where FCDO advises against travel.
Given ongoing tensions and the current closure of the international airport, we advise against all but essential travel to New Caledonia.
Further information is detailed in the Safety and security section.
Leaving New Caledonia
The international airport at Noum√©a-La Tontouta is closed to commercial flights until at least 2 June. You should check with your travel provider before travelling.
If you are a British National in New Caledonia in need of consular support, or support leaving New Caledonia, please contact the British Embassy in Paris which operates a 24/7 consular telephone service (telephone: +33 (0) 1 44 51 31 00). We cannot guarantee the availability of flights.

There is no British Embassy in New Caledonia and the British Embassy in Paris, France, supports British nationals who need emergency help from the UK government.
