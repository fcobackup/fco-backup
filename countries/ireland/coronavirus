Coronavirus
The Foreign and Commonwealth Office (FCO) is advising against all but essential international travel. This global advice does not apply to travel from Northern Ireland to Ireland, or intra-UK travel, but you should maintain social distancing. This is consistent with Irish Government advice.
Cases of coronavirus (COVID-19) have been confirmed in Ireland. The Irish authorities have introduced a number of measures to limit the spread of the virus.
Travel
The availability of transport from Ireland to Great Britain is subject to change. Flights and ferry services continue to operate between Ireland and Great Britain. Some flight operators have already announced that service will reduce in the coming days. If you’re visiting Ireland, you should closely monitor public announcements regarding the scheduling of flight and ferry services, and be prepared to adjust your travel plans accordingly.
On 16 March the Irish Government announced that all persons, including Irish residents, entering Ireland from overseas will be asked to make significant restrictions to their movements for 14 days on arrival. This does not apply to those entering Ireland from Northern Ireland at this time, nor to specified categories of essential supply chain workers such as aircrew, hauliers, maritime staff whether Irish-based or foreign-based.
Local measures
On 12 March the Irish Government announced the following measures to limit the spread of the virus, which will run from Friday 13 March until Sunday 29 March:
the closure of schools, colleges and childcare facilities
the instruction to cancel indoor mass gatherings of 100 people or more and outdoor mass gatherings of more than 500 people
the closure of all State-run cultural institutions.
The Irish Government advised that public transport would continue and shops would remain open.
On 15 March the Irish Government advised all pubs and bars to close until at least 29 March. They also advised people to avoid gathering in any parties in private houses or other venues. The Dublin St Patrick’s Day Parade on 17 March and many other related events across the country were cancelled.
The authorities are also advising all people in Ireland to:
