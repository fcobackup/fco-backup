The Foreign, Commonwealth & Development Office (FCDO) advises against all but essential travel to:
mainland Portugal, including the autonomous regions of Madeira and Azores, based on the current assessment of COVID-19 risks
Flights between the UK and mainland Portugal are currently suspended. UK nationals in Portugal who wish to return to the UK will have to travel via other airports. Check available routes online with travel companies or by contacting the airlines and the entry requirements of any country you may transit on Gov.uk.
If you are arriving in England from Portugal (including the autonomous regions of Madeira and Azores) on or after 4am on 19 March you will no longer be required to quarantine in a managed quarantine hotel. However, you will need to self-isolate on your arrival, unless you have a valid exemption. Check the latest guidance for Scotland, Wales and Northern Ireland.
Travel to Portugal is subject to entry restrictions
Travel to Portugal is limited to:
EU/EEA nationals and their family members;
UK and other non-EU/EEA nationals who are officially resident in Portugal or in another EU member state;
UK and other non-EU/EEA nationals who are travelling for essential purposes, see Entry requirements and Portuguese Immigration Service website
Transit through Spanish airports from the UK to Portugal is not permitted. See FCDO travel advice for Spain.
There are border controls at the land border with Spain. See Entry requirements for more information
You will be required to show a negative RT-PCR test result for SARS/COVID-19 taken within 72 hours of departure (not required for children aged 2 or under), see the Portuguese Immigration Service website. Your airline is likely to deny boarding if you cannot provide evidence of a negative RT-PCR test at check-in. Check with your airline before you travel.
If your journey to mainland Portugal originated in the UK, Brazil, South Africa or in an EU member state where the incidence rate exceeds 500 per 100,000 inhabitants, you must self-isolate for 14 days on arrival at home or in a place indicated by the Portuguese National Health Authority. You must complete this form before you travel.
If you arrive in Madeira or Porto Santo without an RT-PCR test, you will be required to take one at the airport and await the result in government provided accommodation.
See Entry requirements for more information before you plan to travel.

If your return journey to the UK transits another country, you should check whether it is subject to a travel ban or any other additional requirements. If so, contact your travel provider.
