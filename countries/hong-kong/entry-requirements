This information is for people travelling on a full ‘British citizen’ passport from the UK. It is based on the UK government’s understanding of Hong Kong’s current rules for the most common types of travel.
The authorities in Hong Kong set and enforce entry rules. If you’re not sure how these requirements apply to you, contact Hong Kong’s Economic and Trade Office in the UK.
Passport validity requirements
Your passport must be valid for at least one month after the date you plan to leave Hong Kong.
Check with your travel provider that your passport and other travel documents meet requirements. Renew your passport if you need to.
You will be denied entry if you do not have a valid travel document or try to use a passport that has been reported lost or stolen.
Visa requirements
Hong Kong is part of the People’s Republic of China, but it is a Special Administrative Region (SAR) with its own immigration controls.
You can visit Hong Kong for up to 6 months without a visa. For information on entry requirements see the Hong Kong SAR government website.
To stay longer, to work or study, for business travel or for other reasons, you must get a visa. For further information contact the nearest Chinese mission with visa issuing facilities or the Hong Kong Immigration Department.   
Vaccine requirements
To enter Hong Kong, you must have a certificate to prove you’ve had a yellow fever vaccination if you’re coming from a country listed as a transmission risk.
For full details about medical entry requirements and recommended vaccinations, see TravelHealthPro’s Hong Kong guide.
Customs rules
There are strict rules about goods you can take into or out of Hong Kong.  
You must declare anything that may be prohibited or subject to tax or duty. Children aged 3 and over must follow the same rules as adult travellers unless otherwise stated.
Bringing restricted items into Hong Kong
It’s illegal for visitors arriving in Hong Kong International Airport to carry items including:
stun guns
objects with sharp points or edges (for example, samurai swords)
martial arts equipment (for example, knuckledusters)
You could be fined or given a prison sentence. See further information from the Hong Kong Police Force.
E-cigarettes
It’s illegal to bring e-cigarettes or other smoking products, such as heated tobacco products and herbal cigarettes, into Hong Kong. If you are travelling through Hong Kong and do not pass immigration control, you’re exempt.
Powdered baby formula
There are restrictions on the amount of powdered baby formula you can take out of Hong Kong. If you do not follow the rules, you could face a fine or imprisonment for up to 2 years.
See more information, including exemptions, from the Hong Kong Customs and Excise Department.
