There remain extremely limited commercial options to return to the UK from Turkey and these may stop at short notice.
If you live in the UK and are currently visiting Turkey, you’re strongly advised to return now by commercial means. Don’t run the risk of getting stranded.
UK special charter flights will only operate for priority countries where commercial flights are not possible. You should not assume that these flights will become available in countries where commercial routes are operating. Please do not contact the contracted travel management company if no flight is advertised here.

Financial assistance
You will need to pay for your return travel to the UK. If departure options are available but you cannot afford the travel costs and have exhausted all other options for getting funds, you may be eligible to apply for an emergency loan from the government. This is a last resort option and you would need to repay the loan when you are back in the UK. For more information, you should contact Corporate Travel Management (CTM). CTM are a commercial partner of the FCO and are authorised to administer such loans on behalf of the FCO.
Travelling to your departure airport
Turkey has imposed restrictions on all internal travel between cities within Turkey. You will need a travel permit to travel from one city to another.
In addition, you will also need a travel permit if you are aged over 65 or under 20 and need to travel within the same city.
To request a travel permit, submit a request to the British Embassy Ankara. You should make clear in the subject box that you are enquiring about a permit to travel, and have proof of your onward journey out of Turkey.
Arrival in the UK
When you arrive back in the UK, follow the guidance for when you return to the UK on steps you should take to protect yourself and others.
