This page reflects the UK government’s understanding of current rules for people travelling on a full ‘British Citizen’ passport, for the most common types of travel.
The authorities in Turkey set and enforce entry rules. For further information contact the embassy, high commission or consulate of the country or territory you’re travelling to. You should also consider checking with your transport provider or travel company to make sure your passport and other travel documents meet their requirements.
Entry rules in response to coronavirus (COVID-19)
Entry to Turkey
All arrivals into Turkey aged 6 and over, including Turkish citizens and residence permit holders, must complete an online form (Form for Entry to Turkey) a maximum of 72 hours prior to travel. You do not need to do this if you’re transiting Turkey on the way to another country.
All arrivals (aged 12 and over) - including those arriving from the UK - into Turkey, from countries other than those mentioned below, must have proof of one of the following:
A full course of COVID-19 vaccinations (completed at least 14 days prior to arrival in Turkey)
recent recovery from COVID-19
a negative PCR test (less than 72 hours of arrival)
a rapid antigen test (less than 48 hours of arrival).
For children aged 11 and under, no PCR test or vaccination certificate is needed.
Further entry restrictions are currently in place for passengers arriving from, or who have visited in the previous 14 days, the following countries: Afghanistan, Bangladesh, Brazil, Egypt, India, Iran, Nepal, Pakistan, South Africa and Sri Lanka. For the latest information on these restrictions, refer to the IATA website, and select Turkey on the map.
COVID-19 entry requirements may change at short notice, and travellers to Turkey are strongly encouraged to check the specifics, including the time frames for undertaking pre-departure COVID-19 PCR tests, with their airline before they travel. Further details are available on Turkish Airlines or Pegasus websites including information about what these airlines accept as proof of a negative test.
All arrivals into Turkey will be subject to a medical evaluation for symptoms of coronavirus, including temperature checks. Arrivals may be subject to random PCR testing on arrival.
If you are transiting through Turkey to a country that requires a COVID-19 PCR test on arrival, then you must obtain a negative COVID-19 PCR test before travelling.
Demonstrating your COVID-19 status
Turkey will accept the UK’s proof of COVID-19 recovery and vaccination record. If you are travelling with a printed PDF proof of vaccination status, it must date from 1 November to ensure that the certificate can be scanned successfully. Your NHS appointment card from vaccination centres is not designed to be used as proof of vaccination and should not be used to demonstrate your vaccine status.
You should not use the NHS testing service to get a test in order to facilitate your travel to another country. You should arrange to take a private test.
Land and sea borders
Turkey’s international land and sea borders are open. However, short-notice changes, especially temporary closures of land borders, are possible and you should check access locally. International passengers wishing to transit through airports in Turkey on to a domestic Turkish flight will not be required to submit an HES code, unless the passenger is a Turkish citizen or resident of Turkey and the duration between the two flights exceeds 12 hours.
At the airport
You must wear a face mask at all times whilst in an airport, and for the duration of all flights, to and from Turkey.
Testing / screening on arrival
All arrivals into Turkey will be subject to a medical evaluation for symptoms of coronavirus, including temperature checks. Arrivals may be subject to random PCR testing on arrival.
Data collection
You will need to complete a passenger locator form prior to arriving in Turkey. Details will be provided by your airline.
You will be asked to provide the residential address of where you will stay, within the borders of Turkey, and your contact information.
You may be asked by your airline to provide personal information regarding COVID-19 that may be shared with Ministry of Health and third countries when necessary. Anyone who knowingly provides false information may be prevented from travelling.
Regular entry requirements
Visas
British Citizens travelling to Turkey for tourist or business purposes are able to travel without a visa for visits of up to 90 days in any 180-day period.
If you plan to remain in Turkey for a period of more than 90 days, you should either apply for a longer stay visa before you travel, or get a residence permit from the local authorities in Turkey before your 90 day stay has elapsed. If you intend to work in Turkey, ensure you have the correct permits. More information is available from the Turkish Ministry of the Interior. If you do not abide by the terms of your visa or permit, you may be fined, deported and banned from re-entering the country.
If you’re entering Turkey via a land border crossing, make sure your passport has a dated entry stamp before you leave the border crossing area.
If you hold a different type of British nationality (eg BN(O), British Overseas Citizen, British Protected Person or British Subject), check visa requirements with the Turkish Consulate General before you travel. These types of passport are classed as ‘UK Special Passports’ in the Turkish e-Visa system. You will need to apply for a visa from the Turkish Consulate General before you travel.
Passport validity
The Turkish government advise that your passport should be valid for at least 6 months from the date you enter Turkey and that there is a full blank page for the entry and exit stamps. You can find more detail about the requirements for entry into Turkey on the website of the Turkish Ministry of Foreign Affairs.
Travelling with children
If you are leaving Turkey with a child who is a dual British-Turkish national, you may be asked to show the Turkish immigration authorities evidence that the Turkish parent has given permission for the child to travel.
UK Emergency Travel Documents
UK Emergency Travel Documents (ETD) are accepted for entry, airside transit and exit from Turkey within the dates printed on the document. ETDs should be valid for a minimum period of 6 months from the date of entry into Turkey.
