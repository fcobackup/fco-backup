Entry and travel restrictions
We understand that the Pakistani authorities have closed land borders with Afghanistan, India and Iran. Despite this, there have been limited border openings for repatriation. Those crossing into Pakistan may have to comply with coronavirus testing and quarantine measures.
Screening and quarantine measures for international air arrivals
International air passengers travelling to Pakistan will be subject to thermal screening on arrival. The current Pakistan Civil Aviation Authority (CAA) guidelines include measures to quarantine all passengers on arrival for 48 hours, either in a free facility arranged by the Government of Pakistan, or in a facility which the passenger will pay for. Airlines are responsible for recording which facility passengers prefer. No meet and greet will be permitted at the airport.
Passengers will be tested after 48 hours. Those testing positive will likely be moved to a hospital isolation facility, while those testing negative will be released with instructions to self-isolate for a period of time determined by relevant authorities. Please call us on 051 201 2000 in the event that you are moved to a quarantine facility. Before travelling, you should ensure that you have a form of payment for food and water during this quarantine and testing period.
Passengers on flights to Pakistan may also be required to follow special measures before boarding, and while on board the aircraft, including the wearing of a surgical mask. Reinforcement of screening and administrative measures at all sea ports has been announced.
Domestic flights
Domestic flight operations are suspended until 30 April. Despite this, the Government of Pakistan has permitted some flights between Islamabad and Gilgit-Baltistan to continue. Cargo and special flights are also exempted from these restrictions.
Social measures
Pakistani authorities have introduced a number of measures to limit the spread of the virus, including school closures. There are strict restrictions on public gatherings, including religious congregations, events in wedding halls, and sports matches. Some provincial authorities are introducing additional measures, including requiring residents to stay at home, and closing shops, restaurants and other public places. Most public transport has been suspended, and in some places there are limits on the number of people allowed to be in one car. Measures are particularly strict in Sindh and Punjab. It is now a requirement in some provinces to wear a face mask in public places. There have been reports of patrols and check points to enforce these measures, and some provinces have reportedly introduced powers to fine or arrest anyone breaking the rules.
Some provinces are also imposing compulsory isolation or quarantine for people who have COVID-19 symptoms, or people who have come into contact with others with COVID-19 symptoms. In some cases, local authorities are quarantining specific areas.
You should follow the federal and relevant provincial guidance, and monitor local media for updates. Plan any movements accordingly.
If you are running out of medication or have medical needs, you should speak to your travel insurance company for advice and seek local medical assistance, including from pharmacies. Pharmacies remain open in Pakistan. If your usual medication is not available, speak to your travel insurer, ask a local doctor or request advice from your UK doctor. A list of doctors in Pakistan can be found here .

The Pakistani authorities have announced a helpline (on phone number 1166) for people who have COVID-19 symptoms like fever, cough and difficulty breathing. British nationals who are worried about the virus, or suspect they may have contracted it, should contact that number and follow the guidance given by the authorities.
