Crime
Most visits to Tonga are trouble free. The crime rate is low. However, petty crime and theft do take place. You should remain vigilant, especially at night.
Road travel
You can obtain a local visitor’s driving licence on production of a full UK driving licence. Roads are generally in good condition but can be narrow and are sometimes potholed. The low speed limits are strictly applied with on the spot fines. Take particular care when driving after dark and in poor weather. All drivers and front seat passengers must wear seatbelts. It is now an offence to drive and use a mobile phone. Please check with the Department of Transport for further details and updates.
Sea travel
Maritime safety, particularly of older vessels, is a concern in Tonga. In late 2009, 74 people lost their lives when the passenger ferry MV Princess Ashika sank. Safety regulations are not always adhered to when travelling by sea ferry and it is advisable to take your own lifejacket. Ferries are often overcrowded.
Air travel 
A list of recent incidents and accidents can be found on the website of the Aviation Safety network.
The FCDO can’t offer advice on the safety of individual airlines. However, the International Air Transport Association publishes a list of registered airlines that have been audited and found to meet a number of operational safety standards and recommended practices. This list is not exhaustive and the absence of an airline from this list does not necessarily mean that it is unsafe.
In 2010 an audit of Tonga’s Civil Aviation Authority by the International Civil Aviation Organisation found that the level of implementation of the critical elements of safety oversight in Tonga was well below the global average.
Internal flights are not always on schedule and can be subject to adverse weather conditions.
The MA60 aircraft is used for some internal flights. The MA60 is not certified for use in the European Union.
Political situation
The political situation is currently stable. Democratic elections were held most recently in November 2021.
