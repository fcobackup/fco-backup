The following advice within Georgia remains in place:
The Foreign, Commonwealth & Development Office (FCDO) advise against all travel to:
the breakaway regions of South Ossetia and Abkhazia
The British government does not recognise the unilateral declarations of independence made by the de facto authorities in the breakaway regions of Abkhazia and South Ossetia. Consular support is not available in parts of Georgia where the FCDO advise against all travel. See Local travel
Travel to Georgia is subject to entry restrictions
Most foreign citizens, including from the UK, are not currently allowed to enter Georgia. The ban also applies to foreigners with Georgian residence permits. There are exceptions for business travel and for those applying to work remotely from Georgia.
Most people arriving in Georgia will face compulsory 8-day quarantine and PCR tests.
See Entry requirements for more information before you plan to travel.

If you’re returning to the UK from overseas, you will need to:

check if you need to self-isolate on your return
Check our advice on foreign travel during the coronavirus (COVID-19) pandemic and sign up for email alerts for this travel advice.
If you’re planning travel to Georgia, find out what you need to know about coronavirus there in the Coronavirus section.
During the COVID-19 pandemic, it is more important than ever to get travel insurance and check it provides sufficient cover. See the FCDO’s guidance on foreign travel insurance.
The political situation in Georgia is generally calm, but demonstrations and opposition rallies are likely, particularly in the run-up to Parliamentary elections on 31 October. You should remain vigilant, stay away from any large gatherings and demonstrations and follow the advice of local authorities. See Political situation
Foreign nationals have been detained on arrival in Georgia for possession of medicines that would not normally be problematic in the UK or other countries. See Travelling with medicines
Take care when driving and if possible avoid driving at night. See Road travel
There is some risk from unexploded ordnance in areas along the Administrative Boundary Lines with South Ossetia and Abkhazia, and near the border with Azerbaijan (Red Bridge area in particular). Areas where unexploded ordnance might be present are not always marked. See Local travel
Terrorist attacks in Georgia can’t be ruled out. See Terrorism
You can contact the emergency services by calling 112.
If you’re abroad and you need emergency help from the UK government, contact the nearest British embassy, consulate or high commission.
