The information on this page covers the most common types of travel and reflects the UK government’s understanding of the rules currently in place. Unless otherwise stated, this information is for travellers using a full ‘British Citizen’ passport.
The authorities in the country or territory you’re travelling to are responsible for setting and enforcing the rules for entry. If you’re unclear about any aspect of the entry requirements, or you need further reassurance, you’ll need to contact the embassy, high commission or consulate of the country or territory you’re travelling to.
You should also consider checking with your transport provider or travel company to make sure your passport and other travel documents meet their requirements.

Regular entry requirements
Visas
British nationals don’t need a visa to enter Belize. On arrival, you’ll be allowed to enter for a limited period. Any extension to remain in the country will incur a fee of BZD$200 for each month’s extension.
Passport validity
Your passport should be valid for a minimum period of 6 months from the date of entry into Belize.
Yellow fever certificate requirements
Check whether you need a yellow fever certificate by visiting the National Travel Health Network and Centre’s TravelHealthPro website.
UK Emergency Travel Documents
UK Emergency Travel Documents are accepted for entry, airside transit and exit from Belize.
Travelling with children
Single parents or adults travelling with children under the age of 18 are required to provide notarised documentary evidence of parental responsibility, or consent to travel from those with parental responsibility. Such documentation is often required before being allowed to enter Belize and, in some cases, before permitting children to leave the country.
Departure tax
When leaving by air the departure tax is BZD$111 or US$50, though it’s often included in the air fare. Make sure you have enough cash with you, as it isn’t always possible to pay by card.
When leaving by land the departure tax is BZD$40 or US$20, which must be paid in cash.
