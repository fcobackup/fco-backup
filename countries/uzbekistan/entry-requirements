The information on this page covers the most common types of travel and reflects the UK government’s understanding of the rules currently in place. Unless otherwise stated, this information is for travellers using a full ‘British Citizen’ passport.
The authorities in the country or territory you’re travelling to are responsible for setting and enforcing the rules for entry. If you’re unclear about any aspect of the entry requirements, or you need further reassurance, you’ll need to contact the embassy, high commission or consulate of the country or territory you’re travelling to.
You should also consider checking with your transport provider or travel company to make sure your passport and other travel documents meet their requirements.
Visas
British nationals need a visa to enter Uzbekistan, which you should get before you arrive. If the purpose of your visit is tourism, no invitation letter is required to apply for a visa. However, if you intend to visit for any other reasons (eg to visit friends/family or as a business visitor), you’ll need to submit a letter of invitation with your application. Business visitors must get a letter from an Uzbek business partner.
Check your Uzbek visa once issued and carefully note the date of expiry and the number of entries permitted.
The Uzbek government have announced a trial of a new e-visa system for tourists from 15 July 2018. You can apply on the e-visa website. However, as this system is being trialled, the old visa system above will remain in place for use until further notice. For further information, contact the Embassy of the Republic of Uzbekistan in London or check the e-visa FAQ pages. The government have also announced the introduction of 5 days of visa free travel for transit passengers travelling via Uzbekistan to a third country. Transit passengers will need to confirm their travel itinerary to their final destination, departing within 5 days of arrival.
Don’t overstay your visa, even for a very short period. Any traveller found to have overstayed will face a large fine and possibly deportation. It is not always easy or possible to extend your visa if you wish to remain in the country for longer than you had originally intended. If you are travelling overland, make sure you arrive at your intended border crossing in good time before your visa expires.
For further information contact the Embassy of the Republic of Uzbekistan in London.
Registration
You must register within three days of arrival. Saturdays and Sundays count as part of the three day period. If you are staying in a hotel, you will be asked for your passport at check-in and it will be retained for a short period. Hotel staff will complete the registration paperwork and return your passport to you.
If staying in a private house, your host should register you with their local district OVIR (Department of Foreign Travel & Exit (they also deal with the registration of Foreign Citizens)). If you travel to another city and plan to stay for longer than three days, you will need to register again. You must follow this procedure, as a full record of your whereabouts whilst in Uzbekistan is required upon departure. Visitors who are unable to account for their whereabouts could be fined and possibly deported.
Passport validity
Your passport should be valid for at least three months after you’ve entered Uzbekistan.
Dual Nationality
Dual nationality is not recognised in Uzbekistan.
UK Emergency Travel Documents
UK Emergency Travel Documents are accepted for entry (with a valid Uzbek visa), direct airside transit and exit from Uzbekistan. If your ETD has been issued in Tashkent, you’ll need an exit visa from the OVIR (Department of Foreign Travel & Exit) before you can travel out of Uzbekistan. This process can take at least 5 working days.
Customs declarations
You should fill out two copies of the customs declaration form on arrival. Make sure that both copies are signed and stamped by Customs officials. You will need to present one to the customs authorities as you enter the country and produce the other on departure. Any currency or valuables found in your possession and not declared on your customs declaration form may be confiscated.
Travelling with medicines
If you enter Uzbekistan with medicines, whether prescription or non-prescription, you should check in advance the list of prohibited medicines and the legal quantities of medicines that are allowed to be imported. You can find information on the Uzbekistan Ministry of Foreign Affairs (in Russian only at present). If you’re in any doubt, check legal quantities of medicines with the Uzbek Embassy in London before you travel.
You should carry a doctor’s prescription if you intend to travel with prescription medicines and declare the items on your customs declaration form. Some non-prescription medicines in the UK cause problems on entry into Uzbekistan, including codeine. Possession of these items can lead to administrative or criminal proceedings if you don’t have a prescription, or if you’re carrying more than you need for the visit and don’t declare them on arrival. Issues have most frequently been reported at land borders.
Drones
Unauthorised import and use of drones in Uzbekistan will attract fines, detention and confiscation of equipment. Licenses to import drones must be obtained prior to arrival. The following link has more information on licensing requirements (only available in Russian).
