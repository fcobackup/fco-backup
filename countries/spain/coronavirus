Travel in Spain
You should follow the advice of the local authorities on how best to protect yourself and others, including any measures that they bring in to control the virus.
While the nationwide State of Emergency declared by the Spanish government on 25 October 2020 ended on 9 May 2021, some restrictions and curfews remain in force and may vary between regions. The obligatory use of face masks in public spaces, social distancing and hygiene and air ventilation rules must continue to be observed at all times. See Use of face masks and Public spaces and services for further information.
Regional governments retain legal powers to ease or tighten restrictions within their region if deemed necessary to control the spread of the virus (e.g. partial lockdowns; limiting the capacity and opening hours of retail, hospitality establishments and public events).
Local and regional restrictions may be introduced at short notice. You should consult regional incidence levels, refer to the advice of local authorities in your destination and ensure you are aware of the specific measures in place prior to travel.
The use of face coverings continues to be mandatory for anyone over the age of 6 years old on all forms of public transport in Spain and in many other indoor and outdoor public spaces. Specific rules on the use of face masks may vary by region. See Use of face masks for further details.
