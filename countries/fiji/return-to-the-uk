Flights
Air New Zealand has announced that it is assisting the Fijian government to repatriate its citizens and passport holders who are currently stranded in New Zealand. Air New Zealand’s website indicates these flights are expected to continue in the coming months. These may provide options for those looking to leave Fiji.
If you are interested in using these flights to transit via New Zealand to return to the UK, you should contact the British High Commission in Suva by email: SuvaCS@fco.gov.uk. Details of transiting rules via New Zealand are on the New Zealand Immigration website. You should also familiarise yourself with the current rules on transiting via Australia.
Fiji’s Department of Immigration have advised that Fiji’s border remains closed for now and only Fijian citizens are allowed to enter Fiji on repatriation flights.
Fiji Airways have indicated they will continue to operate ad hoc flights. Monitor this travel advice and announcements on the Fiji Airways Twitter page.
A UK-organised special flight left Nadi on 29 April. As this enabled all visitors to return home, we do not anticipate further UK charter flights at this time.
You will need to pay for your return travel to the UK. If departure options are available but you cannot afford the travel costs and have exhausted all other options for getting funds, you may be eligible to apply for an emergency loan from the government. This is a last resort option and you would need to repay the loan when you are back in the UK. For more information, you should contact Corporate Travel Management (CTM). CTM are a commercial partner of the FCO and are authorised to administer such loans on behalf of the FCO.
Your journey home: re-entering the UK
When you return, you must follow the rules for entering the UK. You:
need to provide your journey and contact details up to 48 hours before you’re due to arrive in the UK
are not allowed to leave the place you’re staying for the first 14 days you’re in the UK except in very limited situations (known as ‘self-isolating’)
See also the list of people who are exempt from the border rules.
The National Travel Health Network and Centre (NaTHNaC) also provides advice on how to stay safe as you travel by air.
