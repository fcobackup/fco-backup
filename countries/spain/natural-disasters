Flooding
Flash flooding can occur resulting in damage to property, infrastructure and travel disruption. Check weather warnings from Spain’s meteorological office (AEMET) before travel and follow the advice of the local authorities.
Forest fires
Forest fires occur frequently in Spain (including Spanish islands) during the summer months, when temperatures regularly reach over 40ºC. Take care when visiting or driving through woodland areas.
Causing a forest fire is considered a criminal offence in Spain even if unintentional. Make sure cigarette ends are properly extinguished, don’t light barbecues and don’t leave empty bottles behind. There are strict regulations across much of Spain against lighting outdoor barbecues in forest areas and penalties imposed include heavy fines. Some regions prohibit the use of outdoor barbecues in public picnic areas during the summer months.
Check on the outbreak of fires with the local civil protection authority and report any you see immediately to the emergency services on 112.
