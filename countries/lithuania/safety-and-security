On 24 February 2022, Lithuania announced a State of Emergency in response to Russian military action in Ukraine. Rules relating to the State of Emergency may change at short notice. On 16 September, the State of Emergency was reduced from nationwide, to only areas close (within 5km) to Lithuania’s borders with Belarus and Kaliningrad, ports, airports and Vilnius train station. The State of Emergency is due to end on 16 December 2022.
During the State of Emergency, British nationals in these areas must abide by the following restrictions:
You are required to carry photo identification at all times when travelling in Lithuania and must present your ID to law enforcement officers when requested.
You must not share social media content, articles, TV or radio programmes originating from entities directly or indirectly controlled by the governments of Russia or Belarus, within the territory of Lithuania. Journalists and media organisation seeking an exemption should contact the Lithuanian Radio and Television Commission.
You must not organise meetings or events for the purpose of supporting the actions of the governments of Russia and Belarus.
Additional spot checks may be in operation at border crossings, which may lead to some delays if you are travelling by road. You must follow the instructions of Lithuanian State Border Guard officials.
Crime
There have been reports of petty theft and robbery. Beware of pickpockets, avoid unlit streets and parks at night, and be extra vigilant if you’re walking alone. Take extra care of your belongings in busy locations and on public transport. Don’t leave coats and handbags unattended in bars, pubs and clubs.
A small number of tourists have reported incidents on public transport and around the train station area of Vilnius where they have been approached by small groups of people asking for money or help. Be vigilant in these areas.
Don’t leave drinks unattended and be wary of accepting food and drink from strangers in bars, nightclubs and restaurants.
Car theft is a problem in certain areas. Lock unattended vehicles and hide contents. Use guarded car parks in cities, especially overnight.
 
There have been a number of thefts of bicycles in Vilnius.
In an emergency or if you wish to report a crime, call the police on 112.
Local travel
Public transport
It is not always possible to buy tickets on local buses and or trolley-buses so it is advisable to purchase tickets in advance. More information on e-tickets and pre-charged travel cards is available at Getting around Vilnius.
Taxis are reasonably priced. Make sure the meter is used. It is cheaper and safer to use a recognised taxi app, or phone for a taxi from a recognised company than to hail one in the street. Ask your hotel reception to call one. Do not use unregistered taxis.
Klaipeda, Nida and Palanga
If you intend to walk along the Curonian Spit be aware that after a short distance the Spit forms part of Kaliningrad, which is a territory of the Russian Federation.
