Local coronavirus measures
The Government State of Emergency relating to coronavirus has now expired. However, new directives enforcing measures to help limit the spread of coronavirus are expected to be passed shortly. In the meantime, the existing measures are still likely to be enforced by the local authorities. Existing measures include:
all meetings of four or more people for religious, government, social or political purposes are prohibited
for gatherings of three or fewer people, individuals will be expected to ensure that they are 2 adult strides apart at all times. Exceptions for funerals and other essential functions to take place will be considered on a case-by-case basis
schools, bars, cinemas, theatres and nightclubs have been closed. Cafes and restaurants must have no more than three people at a table with tables at least two adult strides apart
wearing of face masks is mandatory in all public places
everyone must stand at least two strides apart
greetings by handshake are banned
all movements across land borders, except for the flow of cargo and essential goods, are suspended
public transport will reduce passenger loads on vehicles to ensure social distancing is possible
landlords are banned from evicting or increasing rents on private tenants residing in their properties for the duration of the State of Emergency
all commercial and private employers bound by the Labour proclamation will be prohibited from reducing their workforces or prematurely terminating employment contracts
students and teachers are banned from meeting and are only permitted to connect online or by other means that do not contravene social distancing measures
although lawyers will still be able to confer with their clients in correctional facilities with the necessary precautions in place, all other prison visits are prohibited
sporting activities at all levels are prohibited
children’s playgrounds and other such venues will be closed
Any person failing to comply with the measures could face up to three years imprisonment or a fine of between 1,000 and 200,000 Ethiopian Birr (£25 – £5,000). The security forces can enforce these measures where necessary. The requirement for mask-wearing is being enforced in all public spaces. You should comply with all such limitations, wear a mask in public, and monitor local media for further updates.
There may be local restrictions to public transport to help limit the spread of coronavirus. Tigray Regional State has instituted additional quarantine measures for those travelling from overseas and other parts of Ethiopia and curtailed movement between cities and rural areas in the region. You should follow the advice of the local authorities. For further information see Local Travel in Safety and Security

Health
What to do if you have symptoms
Residents and people already in Ethiopia who start to feel symptoms should self-isolate and call the Ethiopian coronavirus helplines on either 8335 or 952. You will be asked some questions and may need to be tested.
If you test positive but have mild or no symptoms, you will need to self-isolate at home where possible. The health authorities will make follow up checks by phone or in person. If you test positive and cannot self-isolate you will need to stay at a government designated isolation centre until you have recovered and tested negative with follow up tests. Visitors on holiday who are not staying with family and friends, cannot self-isolate at ‘home’ and will not be allowed to choose where to self-isolate.
Those experiencing more serious symptoms will be provided healthcare at a designated hospital.
Private healthcare facilities
Private healthcare facilities used by the international community with the capability to respond to coronavirus cases exist, but capacity is limited and a pre-existing healthcare agreement is required. If you or your organisation don’t have such an agreement, you will need to self-isolate, stay at a government designated isolation centre or at hospital as described above in what to do if you have symptoms.
Most private healthcare facilities continue to offer treatment for other illnesses or injuries. You should check with your insurance company which facilities they recommend and phone the healthcare facility before you visit.
