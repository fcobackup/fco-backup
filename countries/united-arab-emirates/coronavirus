Travel in the United Arab Emirates
Coronavirus cases continue to be recorded in the UAE and public health measures are in place in response to the outbreak. These can vary between Emirates and the ease of movement between regions is affected. The local rules may change, including at short notice. You should check them carefully before you travel and while you are here, and ensure you comply.
You should comply with any additional measures put in place by the local authorities. The UAE authorities have stated that any violation of instructions and procedures put in place to limit the spread of coronavirus (COVID-19) will be treated as a crime punishable by law.
Since 2 June movement to and from the Emirate of Abu Dhabi has been restricted although movement within the Emirate of Abu Dhabi is allowed.
Public spaces and services
While most shops, restaurants and supermarkets, and some cultural and leisure attractions and religious establishments are open, there are restrictions and requirements in place to help contain the disease.
Tourist and cultural sites have begun reopening with additional safety measures in place including social distancing and the wearing of face masks.
All schools in the UAE are now closed for the remainder of this academic year. Many events have been cancelled. If you are planning to attend a specific event in the UAE, check with the organisers.
