Ecuador is situated in an area of intense seismic activity. There is a high risk of earthquakes, volcanic eruptions and tsunamis. You should make sure you are aware of the risks and are familiar with the relevant safety and evacuation procedures.
In the event of a natural disaster, you should monitor official channels. The Ecuadorean National Geophysical Institute - IGEPN and the National Service for Risk and Emergency Management are the only official channels responsible for providing information and instructions. The ECU911 emergency services may also provide useful information. Follow the advice of the local authorities.
You may wish to activate a Google’s Android Earthquake Alert system for Ecuador.
For information on seismic-volcanic activity, follow “IGEPNecuador” on Facebook (in Spanish).
The National Service for Risk and Emergency Management is also responsible for issuing alerts related to natural disasters. You can check the current alerts in place (in Spanish).
Earthquakes
Given the high risk of earthquakes across Ecuador, you should familiarise yourself with safety procedures and particularly the instructions in your hotel. Further information on what to do before, during and after an earthquake is available from the US Federal Emergency Management Agency website.
Monitor the official sources above for accurate information and news. Aftershocks may occur, so remain calm, follow any instructions given locally, and keep your emergency backpack at hand.
Earthquakes and aftershocks can cause landslides, which can block roads.
Seismologists assess the risk of earthquakes in the province of Esmeraldas on the north-western coast as particularly high because of its proximity to the convergence of the Nazca and South American plates.
Tsunami
There is a high risk of tsunamis along the coast and in the Galapagos Archipelago. There is a network of sirens in Esmeraldas and Manabí provinces which will sound in case of a tsunami alert. You should familiarise yourself with evacuation routes maps and follow the advice of the local authorities.
Mountains and volcanoes
There are numerous active and potentially active volcanoes in the highlands of Ecuador and the Galapagos Archipelago, some of which are currently in a state of eruption. Ash fall from active volcanoes can disrupt national and international flights across the country and can also pose health hazards, especially for travellers with existing respiratory problems. Airports can close at short notice due to ash fall, check with your airline and the airport website before travelling to the airport.
There is a high risk of ‘lahars’ around glaciated volcanoes such as Cotopaxi. These are flows of water, mud, lava and debris which can be extremely destructive. The towns of Latacunga and Salcedo and low-lying areas in the valley to the east of Quito are particularly vulnerable (Los Chillos and Rumiñahui).
As a result of increased activity from Cotopaxi volcano, a yellow alert was issued on 22 October 2022, resulting in access restrictions to the Cotopaxi National Park.
As of 26 October 2022, Cotopaxi National Park has re-opened, except for high mountaineering activity, which remains restricted. You can monitor this issue via the Ecuadorean Ministry of Environment.
The Ministry of Tourism recommends travellers visiting Cotopaxi National Park to always carry a mask, sunglasses, a cap, clothing that covers the skin, enough water and food, as well as an emergency kit. Check the Ecuadorean Ministry of Tourism
Ecuadorean law stipulates that anyone wishing to climb a glaciated mountain must be accompanied by an officially accredited guide.
You can check the current alerts in place for volcanoes (in Spanish). You should follow instructions issued by the local authorities.
The Reventador volcano (Napo province) currently has access restrictions.
Rainy seasons
Rainy season usually runs from October to May. However, it may extend to June for various oceanic-atmospheric factors. In 2023, the province of Esmeraldas has been seriously affected by severe flooding in June due to heavy rains. The irregular ‘El Niño/La Niña’ climatic phenomenon occurs every few years and is due to begin in late 2023. It can cause unusually heavy rains, widespread flooding and a hotter climate across Ecuador. The risk of landslides is higher at times of heavy rainfall, which can cut off roads. Ecuador is currently under amber alert for the forthcoming El Niño, expected to begin in November 2023.
During heavy rainy seasons, you should monitor local media and discuss your itinerary with your tour operator to avoid disruption. You should also avoid river crossings due to potential strong currents, and take care in affected areas. If you are planning to undertake climbing and high mountaineering, seek official advice from local authorities and tour operators. Check weather forecasts and be aware that the weather can change quickly. In the coastal region you should seek local advice on tidal activity and take appropriate precautions.
Forest fires
Forest fires occur in many areas of Ecuador, but especially in Pichincha province. This is due to high temperatures, strong winds and little rain, but also people lighting fires. If you see a fire call 911.
