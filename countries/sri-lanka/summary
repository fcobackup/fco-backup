On 7 March, an “indefinite” police curfew was imposed in the Kandy administrative region, where there are continuing reports of violent incidents. Social media platforms have been blocked nationwide. It is expected that the curfew will continue while the State of Emergency is in place. While the curfew does not impose restrictions on tourist activities, we are aware of some reports of tourists being caught up in movement restrictions. You should exercise caution, avoid protests and rallies, and comply with local security requirements.
