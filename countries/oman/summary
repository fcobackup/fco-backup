We are aware that the Oman border authorities have recently been advising individuals of a change in their requirements for travellers wishing to cross the border into Yemen (against FCO advice), including requests for a letter from the British Embassy in Muscat. We are not currently providing such a letter and have sought clarification from the Omani authorities. We understand that, at present, there is no requirement for any letters for British nationals to enter or exit Yemen through Oman. However, the FCO advise against all travel to Yemen. If you’re planning to travel via Oman to Yemen against FCO advice, you should check requirements with your nearest Oman Embassy before finalising any travel plans.
The British Embassy has received reports that some travellers are being redirected to other border crossing points when trying to use the Hatta crossing to cross the UAE/Oman border. If you’re planning to travel by road across the UAE/Oman border, you may wish to consider taking an alternative route and allow extra time for your journey. For more information, contact Immigration directly on (Oman) +968 26849924.
