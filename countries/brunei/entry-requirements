Entry rules in response to coronavirus (COVID-19)
Entry to Brunei
Entry to Brunei is severely restricted. Anyone seeking to enter or exit Brunei must apply for a permit from Prime Minister’s Office.
Brunei has announced that travellers to Brunei will need to provide a negative COVID-19 test on arrival, obtained within 72 hours of travel.
Brunei continues to enforce an exit travel ban, including for permanent residents, and expatriate workers (green identity card holders), and their dependants. Exceptions will be considered by the Prime Minister’s Office on a case-by-case basis. Applicants must apply online at www.pmo.gov.bn, giving 14 days’ notice of the intention to travel. Full details are available on the Prime Minister’s Office website.
From 1 October, all travellers entering or leaving Brunei via a land border will be required to pay $3 BND per person on exit and $3 BND on return or entry.
Quarantine requirements
If the Government of Brunei permits you entry, you will be required to go into quarantine on arrival at a government booked facility (usually a local hotel). Currently quarantine is between 2 and 14 days. Travellers will be informed of the duration of quarantine on arrival and will need to cover the cost of their stay in their designated quarantine facility.
Testing/screening on arrival
Brunei has announced that travellers to Brunei will need to provide a negative COVID-19 test on arrival, obtained within 72 hours of travel.
All foreigners must pay $350 BND for a COVID-19 test upon arrival in Brunei.
You should ensure that you have the means to pay for your COVID-19 test and the duration of your quarantine period.
Immigration Control Posts at Brunei’s land borders are operating shortened hours from 6am to 8pm. There are health and temperature screening measures at borders. You should comply with any additional screening measures put in place by the local authorities.
Data collection
On arrival in Brunei, you will be encouraged to download the BruHealth app. Failure to use the app may result in you not being able to access a number of day-to-day facilities.
Regular entry requirements
Visas
British Citizen passport holders may enter Brunei for up to 90 days without a visa. If you have another type of British nationality, check with Brunei immigration authorities about visa requirements.
Make sure the entry stamp in your passport indicates the validity of your stay. There are strict penalties for overstaying.
If you’re staying longer than 90 days and/or visiting for non-tourist purposes, you will need to get a visa from the nearest Brunei diplomatic mission before you travel.
Passport validity  
Your passport should be valid for a minimum period of 6 months from the date of entry into Brunei. 
Dual nationality
Brunei does not recognise dual nationality. You can be refused entry if you’re found to be holding two passports of different nationality. If you’re a dual national, it’s advisable to enter Brunei on the passport on which you exited your last country of departure. While in Brunei your nationality will be deemed to be that shown on the passport which you used to enter the country. This may affect the consular assistance that you receive in Brunei.
Yellow fever certificate requirements
Check whether you need a yellow fever certificate by visiting the National Travel Health Network and Centre’s TravelHealthPro website.
UK Emergency Travel Documents
UK Emergency travel documents are accepted for entry, airside transit and exit from Brunei. They should have at least 6 months validity. You’ll have to obtain an exit and entry visa from Brunei Immigration before you travel.
