Testing for coronavirus in Uruguay
If you require a PCR or lateral flow test in Uruguay, there are companies who offer home visits or drive-through tests and normally return the results between 24-72 hours. You will have to pay for the test if it has not been ordered by a health professional. The British government does not endorse or recommend any of these services.
