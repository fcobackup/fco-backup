Entry rules in response to coronavirus (COVID-19)
Entry to Hong Kong
Travellers arriving in Hong Kong on flights from overseas countries/territories, who are not Hong Kong residents, will be denied entry to Hong Kong. Non-Hong Kong residents travelling to Hong Kong from mainland China, Macao or Taiwan will also be denied entry if they have been to any overseas country/territory in the past 14 days. Spouses and minor children of Hong Kong residents are exempt from the above restrictions.
All travellers entering Hong Kong, including Hong Kong residents, will have to take a mandatory medical test for coronavirus and will be required to undergo 14-day compulsory quarantine. Arrivals may be placed in a Hong Kong government quarantine centre. From 25 July, travellers who have visited high-risk destinations (i.e. Bangladesh, India, Indonesia, Nepal, Pakistan, the Philippines and South Africa) within the past 14 days, will be required to provide confirmation, in English or Chinese, of a room reservation in a hotel in Hong Kong for no less than 14 days, starting on the day of their arrival. Travellers from these destinations will also be required to provide a letter, certified by a laboratory or health institution, verifying that they have undergone, and received a negative test result for COVID-19 no more than 72 hours prior to their departure. The letter should bear the name and identity card or passport number of the traveller. Travellers will also be required to provide a letter, in English or Chinese, issued by the relevant authority of the government of the place in which the laboratory or healthcare institution is located, certifying that the laboratory or healthcare institution is recognised or approved by the government.
From 29 July, the United States and Kazakhstan will be included on the list of high risk countries. The entry requirements above will apply to all travellers who have visited either country within the past 14 days.
All passengers, including departing, arriving and transfer/transit passengers are required to wear face masks in all passenger accessible areas of Hong Kong International Airport.
For up-to-date advice on entry requirements and restrictions, visit the Hong Kong SAR Government coronavirus website.
Transiting Hong Kong
Transit services at Hong Kong International Airport resumed on 15 June for passengers who can be checked through from port of origin to final destination. Transiting between flights operated by different airlines is now allowed, although transiting to and from mainland China will still not be possible. You should check with your travel agent or airline before travelling and check the Hong Kong International Airport website.
There is a risk you will be placed into 14 days government quarantine. All passengers able to transit Hong Kong International Airport will be subject to advanced screening measures, including temperature checks. Those passengers not displaying a high temperature will be allowed to connect to their next flight. But passengers deemed to have a high temperature will undergo further checks by the Port Health Office at the airport. If you meet further risk criteria, you will be transferred to a Hong Kong public hospital for mandatory checks/treatment, where it is highly likely you will be asked to complete a mandatory COVID-19 test. If you successfully pass health screening you will be required to sit in designated areas at boarding gates and use designated queues in dining facilities and shops, in line with Hong Kong International Airport anti-virus measures.
Travel between Hong Kong, Macao and mainland China
All border crossings with mainland China remain closed indefinitely, with the exception of the Shenzhen Bay Checkpoint and the Hong Kong-Zhuhai-Macau Bridge. All passengers wanting to board a shuttle bus to cross the bridge departing from Hong Kong to Macau must present a certificate confirming that they have tested negative for COVID-19 within seven days of their departure. The special ferry service between Taipa Ferry Terminal in Macao and Hong Kong International Airport has now ceased operations. All ferry crossings between Hong Kong and mainland China are currently not in operation. Kai Tak Cruise and Ocean Terminals are also closed to passengers indefinitely.
Certain groups of people travelling from mainland China, Taiwan and Macao may be granted an exemption from quarantine requirements by applying in advance to the Chief Secretary of the Administration. These groups include people involved in receiving or providing education and those travelling for purposes relating to manufacturing operations, business activities or the provision of professional services in the interest of Hong Kong’s economic development.
Health Declaration form
All inbound travellers via Hong Kong International Airport are required to submit a health declaration form.
Testing / screening on arrival
All arrivals (including transit passengers) will be subject to advanced screening measures, including temperature checks. Those deemed to have a high temperature will undergo further checks by the Port Health Office at the airport. If they meet further risk criteria, they will be transferred to a Hong Kong public hospital for mandatory checks/treatment.
All asymptomatic arrivals ending their journey at Hong Kong International Airport will have to provide a saliva sample which will be tested for coronavirus. After collecting baggage, travellers will be taken by shuttle bus to the designated location. Travellers will have to wait for test results, before proceeding to their mandatory quarantine location.
Passengers arriving on morning flights will be taken to the AsiaWorld Expo centre and will receive test results on the same day. This could take 8 or more hours. Passengers arriving in the afternoon and evening will need to wait for test results overnight, and will be temporarily accommodated in the Department of Health Holding Centre for Test Results (HCTR) set up in the Regal Oriental Hotel win Kowloon.
If the sample tests positive, the Hong Kong authorities will notify you and arrange for admission to a public hospital. All arrivals, including those who test negative for coronavirus, are required to undergo 14-day compulsory quarantine. See “Quarantine requirements” below.
Quarantine requirements
Quarantine is usually spent at home or a residential address, but arrivals may be placed in a Hong Kong government quarantine centre. Family members of someone who tests positive, or those who have been in close contact, will also be required to go in to a government quarantine centre.

arrivals from other destinations may be issued with non-bluetooth wristbands
