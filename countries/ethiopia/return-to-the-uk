You can spread the virus even if you don’t have symptoms.

If you live in the UK and are currently travelling in Ethiopia, you are strongly advised to return now. Contact your travel operator to make arrangements to do so as soon as possible.
See more information and advice about staying where you are if you cannot return to the UK.
Flights
Commercial flights continue to operate from Addis Ababa Bole International Airport, though many operators have cancelled or reduced routes and all flights are subject to change or cancellation at short notice. Ethiopian Airlines continues to review the frequency of its flights to the UK and other countries in light of coronavirus.
You should check with your airline or travel company for the latest information if you are planning to leave Ethiopia.
You will need to pay for your return travel to the UK. If departure options are available but you cannot afford the travel costs and have exhausted all other options for getting funds, you may be eligible to apply for an emergency loan from the government. This is a last resort option and you would need to repay the loan when you are back in the UK. For more information, you should contact Corporate Travel Management (CTM). CTM are a commercial partner of the FCO and are authorised to administer such loans on behalf of the FCO.
Transit via Ethiopia
If you are planning to transit via Ethiopia to reach the UK, you should be aware that restrictions apply. A person “in transit” means that they:
arrive and depart from the same airport within a reasonable time frame. The maximum transit time is 72 hours.
do not formally enter Ethiopia and pick up their bags so they can take their next flight
do not take a domestic flight to get to another airport so they can catch their next international flight
remain on the air side or sterile area of the airport for stays of 8 hours or less
will be taken to a designated transit hotel for the duration of their stay for all stays over 8 hours. You should therefore minimise the duration of your transit in Addis Ababa.
Transit passengers are exempt from the current quarantine restrictions for coronavirus. If you have any further questions, you should contact your airline.
Land borders
On 23 March the Government of Ethiopia announced the closure of the country’s land borders.
Arrival in the UK
