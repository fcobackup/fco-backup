There are currently extremely limited commercial options available to return to the UK from Armenia. The UK government is working closely with airlines, the Armenian authorities and other governments to make sure options are available for you to return to the UK as soon as possible.
Future travel options
You will need to pay for your return travel to the UK. If departure options are available but you cannot afford the travel costs and have exhausted all other options for getting funds, you may be eligible to apply for an emergency loan from the government. This is a last resort option and you would need to repay the loan when you are back in the UK.
For more information, you should contact Corporate Travel Management (CTM). CTM are a commercial partner of the FCO and are authorised to administer such loans on behalf of the FCO.
Your journey home
The National Travel Health Network and Centre (NaTHNaC) provides advice on how to stay safe as you travel by air.
If youâ€™re returning home before 8 June, follow the guidance for when you return to the UK on steps you should take to protect yourself and others. From 8 June there will be new rules for entering the UK.
Help and support
If you need urgent consular assistance, you can contact the British Embassy on +374 10 264301 ext.4 (this number is available 24/7) or visit the website.
For any emergencies please also send an email to Enquiries.Yerevan@fco.gov.uk
