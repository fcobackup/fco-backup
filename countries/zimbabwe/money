Financial transactions are mainly conducted in US dollars. Zimbabwe is currently experiencing a severe shortage of cash. It’s not currently possible to make cash withdrawals with an international bank card. Credit and debit cards are increasingly being used for transactions, although a growing number of imported items such as fuel will require US dollars in cash.
You should check in advance if a restaurant or hotel will accept cards, especially outside Harare. Make sure you have sufficient funds in US dollar notes for your visit, or check with your tour operator that card payments will be accepted.
Zimbabwe introduced bond notes in November 2016 as legal tender alongside the US dollar and other currencies. The bond notes are officially at 1:1 parity with the US dollar, and are only legal tender within Zimbabwe. The bond notes are in $2 and $5 denominations and bond coins at $1, 50c, 25c, 10c, 5c, 1c denominations.
It’s illegal to leave Zimbabwe with more than $2,000 (or equivalent) in cash. It’s illegal to exchange foreign currency anywhere other than at officially licensed dealers (eg banks). Carry small denomination notes as change is rarely available in smaller businesses.
