You should check whether you need a negative COVID-19 test to travel to your destination or for countries you are transiting; this may be requested before your departure. You should comply with all local restrictions.
Health
What to do if you have symptoms
Residents and people already in Ethiopia who start to feel symptoms should wear a face mask, get self-tested or test at a health facility and follow general COVID-19 preventative measures.
If you test positive you should self-isolate at home or at a health facility according to the severity of the illness until declared recovered by a health professional.
Private healthcare facilities
Private healthcare facilities used by the international community with the capability to respond to coronavirus cases exist, but capacity is limited. Most private healthcare facilities continue to offer treatment for other illnesses or injuries. You should check with your insurance company which facilities they recommend and phone the healthcare facility before you visit.
