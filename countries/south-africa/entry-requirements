The information on this page covers the most common types of travel and reflects the UK government’s understanding of the rules currently in place. Unless otherwise stated, this information is for travellers using a full ‘British Citizen’ passport.
The authorities in the country or territory you’re travelling to are responsible for setting and enforcing the rules for entry. If you’re unclear about any aspect of the entry requirements, or you need further reassurance, you’ll need to contact the embassy, high commission or consulate of the country or territory you’re travelling to.
You should also consider checking with your transport provider or travel company to make sure your passport and other travel documents meet their requirements.
South Africa has introduced entry restrictions in response to the coronavirus (COVID-19) pandemic, see ‘visas’ section.
Entry rules in response to coronavirus (COVID-19)
Entry to South Africa
Lockdown restrictions restrict entry into South Africa, except for South African nationals and foreign nationals with valid residence permits.
South African airspace is closed to commercial airlines as part of efforts to contain the spread of COVID-19. Land Borders to neighbouring countries are closed except for essential trade.
You will need a visa to enter South Africa. Border restrictions have been strictly applied and the South African authorities have only been granting visas in exceptional circumstances. If you wish to enter South Africa, you should contact your local South African High Commission to request a visa in good time before you wish to travel. We strongly advise you to obtain a visa before booking your travel. We cannot provide assistance to UK nationals seeking to obtain a visa to enter South Africa. More information can be found in the following South African Department of Home Affairs document.
Transiting South Africa
If you wish to transit South African international airports on your way back to the UK, you can do so without a visa, providing you remain airside and have not been in the UK or another ‘high-risk’ country since 15 March 2020. However, you should be aware that international flights from South Africa are limited.
You cannot transit South African airports on your way to third countries, if travelling from the UK or another ‘high risk’ country.
Screening on arrival
Screening processes have been introduced at all major ports of entry, including airports, for arrivals, departures and transit passengers. You should comply with any additional screening measures put in place by the authorities. Screening may include temperature measurements and check on recent travel to affected areas.
Quarantine requirements
Upon entering in South Africa you will be quarantined for 14 days in a state appointed facility. These are normally hotels, but may sometimes be state facilities.
Data collection
The South African government requires you to complete a health form with your details on arrival, including your address and contact information.
Testing on departure
Screening processes have been introduced at all major ports of entry, including airports, for arrivals, departures and transit passengers. You should comply with any additional screening measures put in place by the authorities. Screening may include temperature measurements and check on recent travel to affected areas. If you feel unwell, you should not attempt to travel. Presenting at the airport with symptoms may result in you being sent to a government health facility for quarantine and further testing. You will need to fill out a health form from the South African government.
If you’re currently in South Africa
The South African government has indicated that if you are currently in South Africa on a work, study, or other long-term visa, you can stay, under the terms of that visa. If you leave South Africa, you will not be permitted to return on the same visa, and will need to apply for a new visa.
Since the introduction of restrictions to international flights, the South African authorities have announced that people who exceed their 90-day stay, or the validity of their temporary residence visas, as a result of travel restrictions linked to COVID-19 will not be penalised as over-stayers when they depart.
Regular entry requirements
Passport validity
Your passport should be valid for at least 30 days beyond your intended date of exit from South Africa, in line with South African immigration regulations. However, some immigration officials still request that a passport should have at least 6 months validity on the date of entry to South Africa. To avoid problems at the airport on arrival, you’re advised to ensure your passport meets this requirement.
Your passport should have at least 2 blank pages if you require a visa to enter the country. If you do not need a visa, one blank page will be sufficient.
Travelling with children
There are special requirements for travelling to South Africa with children under the age of 18. Parents wishing to apply for a visa for their child to enter South Africa will need to submit additional documentation. There are different requirements for unaccompanied children entering South Africa.
Check the advisory from the South African Department of Home Affairs for more details, and consult your nearest South African high commission or embassy if you have any questions about these requirements.
Residence permits
If you have Permanent Residency in South Africa, you can leave and re-enter South Africa but must carry valid documentation with you proving your permanent residency rights. If you enter South Africa you will be quarantined for 14 days.
Receipts issued by the Department of Home Affairs for applications to renew a permit will not be accepted by the immigration authorities. For more information, contact the South African High Commission or the South African Department of Home Affairs.
Dual citizenship
If you hold South African citizenship, you must enter and exit South Africa on your South African passport. It is an offence for a South African citizen aged 18 or over to enter or leave the country on a foreign passport.
UK Emergency Travel Documents
South African authorities advise that UK Emergency Travel Documents (ETDs) are usually accepted for entry, transit and exit from South Africa. British Nationals entering South Africa on an ETD will be subject to new visa requirements announced by South Africa in response to coronavirus. See coronavirus
If you are planning to enter South Africa using an ETD, you will need a visa. You should make sure you allow time before you travel to apply for a visa once you have received your ETD.
South Africa have not told us how they intend to treat travellers wishing to transit using ETDs. If you’re planning to enter or transit South Africa using an ETD, you should confirm requirements with the nearest South African Embassy, High Commission or Consulate before confirming your travel plans. ETDs should have a minimum of 6 months validity for entry, transit or exit.
Biometric capturing
South Africa has implemented biometric capturing at all ports of entry. This may result in some delays at land borders. You should allow additional time for border crossings.
