HES codes for intercity travel
Anyone wishing to undertake intercity travel using public transport must get an “HES” code (“Hayat Eve Sığar”). This can be done through the e-Devlet system, the ‘Hayat Eve Sığar’ smartphone application and by SMS.
Non-Turkish nationals with a domestic flight connecting to/from an international flight which is booked on the same ticket, do not currently require an HES code. Where a domestic flight is booked separately or with a different airline, an HES code is required.
For international travel, Turkish nationals are required to obtain an HES code, however this does not apply to non-Turkish nationals, including British visitors to Turkey.
For intercity travel, British nationals without a residence card can obtain a HES code by sending their passport details by SMS to 2023 in the following format: HES [space] Nationality (GBR) [space] passport number [space] year of birth [space] surname. Example: HES GBR 123456789 1980 SMITH. You will need to use the passport which you entered Turkey on, and the SMS message must be sent from a mobile phone registered on a Turkish mobile network.
If you are over 65, and a visitor to Turkey, you no longer require a permit to travel between cities. A permit is still required if you are a Turkish resident and you must remain at your destination for a minimum of 30 days unless travelling for an international flight. Individuals under 18 no longer require a permit to either travel within the same city, or undertake intercity travel. When travelling they must, however, be accompanied by a parent or guardian, aged below 65 years of age.

Curfews
As part of its efforts to limit the spread of coronavirus, the Turkish government has imposed curfews. These have been time-limited, or aimed at particular age groups. These can be imposed at short notice and you should stay in touch with local developments.
There remains an ongoing curfew for those who have a chronic medical condition. In addition:
Adults over 65 years old must stay inside between 8pm and 10am on a daily basis.
People under 18 years of age are allowed outside at any time but must be accompanied by a parent or guardian.
Beyond these exemptions, people in these categories must not leave their homes. See Travel in Turkey if you fall into one of these categories and need to travel.

Visa overstays due to COVID-19
Turkish authorities have confirmed that any foreign nationals who overstay their visa, due to COVID-19, will not face any fines or penalties, provided they depart Turkey within 1 month of flights resuming to their country of citizenship. British nationals in Turkey who have overstayed their visa should make arrangements to leave Turkey by 11:59pm Turkish time on 11 July.
If you have not left by then, you will be subject to penalties as follows:
Those departing from 12 July to 11 October will incur an administrative fine;
Those departing from 12 October onwards will be banned from Turkey for a period of time determined by the length of overstay.
If you have overstayed your visa, you should therefore make arrangements to leave Turkey by 11:59pm Turkish time on 11 July.
