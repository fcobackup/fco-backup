Earthquakes
Small tremors are recorded several times a month throughout the year without consequences. To learn more about what to do before, during and after an earthquake, visit the website of the US Federal Emergency Management Agency.
On Sunday 22 March 2020, a 5.3 magnitude earthquake hit Zagreb and the surrounding areas causing damage to buildings and infrastructure. An aftershock with a 5.1 magnitude followed. Recovery is ongoing.
Forest fires
Forest fires are very common during Croatia’s hot and dry summers. Take care when visiting or driving through woodland and forest areas. Make sure cigarette ends are properly extinguished, don’t light barbecues and don’t leave any rubbish, particularly empty bottles, behind.
Floods
Flash floods can occur with very little warning and can lead to dangerous water flows and disruption to transport and other networks. You should keep a close eye on weather forecasts and follow the advice of local authorities.
Monitor media reports and follow the advice of the local authorities if a forest fire, earthquake, floods or other natural disaster occurs in your area.
