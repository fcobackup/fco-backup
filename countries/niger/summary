For security reasons the FCDO advises against all travel to:
all areas of the country north of the city of Abalak, including the Aïr Massif region
the province of Agadez (including the road linking Assamakato Agadez and the city of Agadez)
areas of Tahoua province north of the city of Tahoua, including the city itself
the area of Tillabéri province north of Niamey, including the road from Niamey to Gao and the road from Niamey to Menaka
areas within 40km of the south-western border with Burkina Faso
areas within 40km of the border with Nigeria in Diffa, Zinder and Maradi provinces
the Parc du W, plus the contiguous Dosso and Tamou hunting zones
The FCDO advises against all but essential travel to the rest of Niger, including the capital city Niamey.
Before you travel, check the ‘Entry requirements’ section for Niger’s current entry restrictions and requirements. These may change with little warning. Monitor this advice for the latest updates and stay in contact with your travel provider.
If you plan to pass through another country to return to the UK, check the travel advice for the country you’re transiting.
It is more important than ever to get travel insurance and check it provides sufficient cover. See the FCDO’s guidance on foreign travel insurance.
Consular assistance and support to British people in Niger is provided in the first instance by the British Deputy High Commission in Lagos. See Consular Assistance.
Terrorists are very likely to try to carry out attacks in Niger, including kidnapping. There is particular instability in the Tillabéri region of Niger, near the country’s borders with Mali and Burkina Faso. There is also particular instability in Diffa, near the Lake Chad Basin. There is a threat of retaliatory attacks due to Niger’s participation in the French-led intervention in Mali and due to its involvement in the regional fight to counter violent extremist groups. See Terrorism
States of emergency are in place in several states across the country. See Local travel
Levels of crime, especially in the capital Niamey, are high. See Crime
You should carry some form of identification at all times. See Local laws and customs
There is currently a shortage of diesel fuel in Niger. Supplies are not reliable and you should be mindful of this when making travel arrangements, particularly outside of Niamey.
