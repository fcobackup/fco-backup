If you live in the UK and are currently visiting Hong Kong, you’re strongly advised to return now by commercial means. Don’t run the risk of getting stranded.
There remain commercial options to return to the UK from Hong Kong.
UK special charter flights will only operate for priority countries where commercial flights are not possible. You should not assume that these flights will become available in countries where commercial routes are operating. Please do not contact the contracted travel management company if no flight is advertised here.
If you cannot leave Hong Kong at this time, see advice on staying in Hong Kong during coronavirus.
Flights
Direct flights from Hong Kong to the UK are still available, though some have been suspended in recent weeks. Cathay Pacific are currently operating two flights a week to London. British Airways and Virgin Atlantic passenger services to and from Hong Kong are currently suspended, though we understand both plan to recommence on a reduced schedule in May 2020. You should check individual airline websites for the latest information, flight schedules and refund policies before purchasing a ticket.
Indirect flights are also increasingly limited. If you choose an indirect flight, you should check that the country in which you plan to transit allows you to do so.
You will need to pay for your return travel to the UK. If departure options are available but you cannot afford the travel costs and have exhausted all other options for getting funds, you may be eligible to apply for an emergency loan from the government. This is a last resort option and you would need to repay the loan when you are back in the UK. For more information, you should contact Corporate Travel Management (CTM). CTM are a commercial partner of the FCO and are authorised to administer such loans on behalf of the FCO.
