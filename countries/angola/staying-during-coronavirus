This page gives you guidance on how to stay safely in Angola as a visitor, if you are unable to return to the UK.
Everyone should comply with the measures put in place in Angola to limit the spread of coronavirus (COVID-19).
Moving around in Angola
The current State of Emergency has been extended until at least 25 May. This includes a series of measures to limit the spread of the virus, including:
Significant restrictions on movement throughout the country. All citizens are to remain at home, but specified exemptions for some workers, essential shopping and medical treatment.
Closure of most shops, other than those selling food or medicine which are operating reduced hours.
Reduced public transport and suspension of domestic flights via the capital.
The Angolan police are robustly enforcing these rules. You should continue to comply with any additional measures put in place by the local authorities.

Finance
There is a range of financial support from the government that you can access while you are unable to return due to coronavirus restrictions.
If you’re in Angola, and have exhausted all other options to cover essential living costs while you wait to return home, you could apply for an emergency loan for your living costs from the UK government. You can only apply if you normally live in the UK and you cannot return home. This last-resort option is for those most in need, and you would need to repay the loan when you are back in the UK. Apply for an emergency loan.
