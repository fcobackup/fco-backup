Terrorists are very likely to try to carry out attacks in Mali, including kidnaps. There is a heightened risk of attack in Bamako. Attacks could be indiscriminate, including in places visited by foreigners. You should be vigilant, especially in places such as hotels, restaurants, bars, nightclubs, shopping areas, markets, transport hubs, places of worship and businesses with western interests. Keep a low profile and follow the advice of local authorities. Avoid all large gatherings, including music festivals, sporting events and any public marches or demonstrations. See Terrorism
There have been recent changes in the security situation in parts of Segou province/region. See Local travel and Terrorism
During public holidays and festivals, including New Year celebrations, security measures in Mali can be heightened due to the ongoing threat posed by terrorist organisations. During such periods you should exercise increased vigilance, limit your movements and continue to avoid large gatherings. If you think a particular venue would present a good target for terrorist activities then you should consider whether you need to visit it.
A nationwide state of emergency in place since November 2015 has been extended several times, most recently in October 2019 by one year until 31 October 2020. You should expect a robust security presence including police patrols and possible police security checks on restaurants and hotels. There are likely to be more vehicle and personal security checks during this time and nobody will be exempt.
Mali held legislative elections in March and April 2020. Since 1 May, regular large and at times violent protests have taken place in Bamako and across the country following the Constitutional Court’s ruling on these elections. You should avoid large gatherings, remain vigilant and monitor local social media/news.
Starting on 10 July 2020, large-scale political protests have taken place in Bamako and some other regional towns. These have turned violent resulting in burning of tires, clashes with the police, blockage on the roads and bridges, the deployment of tear gas, and small arms fire. There have been reports of several deaths and injuries. See Political situation
Recent public demonstrations in and around Bamako have encountered a strong police and security force presence. You should stay away from all political demonstrations and any blockades set up by the police and security forces. Maintain several days’ stock of food and water in case disturbances take place. You can monitor daily developments in English through the BBC World Service (88.9 FM in Bamako).
If you’re abroad and you need emergency help from the UK government, contact the nearest British embassy, consulate or high commission.
Consular support is severely limited in parts of Mali, especially outside Bamako. If you’re in Bamako and need urgent help from the UK Government, please call the FCO on 020 7008 1500.
