Borders and travel
The Bulgarian Government has announced severe restrictions on international travel, forbidding entry to British nationals, except for those with permanent or long term residence in Bulgaria. These restrictions remain in place in spite of the recent relaxation of some domestic measures.
Commercial flights are operating at a reduced level. Most land borders are closed for passenger traffic. If you need to travel, plan ahead and before you travel check border information published by the Ministry of Interior (English and Bulgarian).
Local measures
The State of Emergency in Bulgaria ended on 13 May 2020, but this does not mean that all coronavirus measures and restrictions will end.
The travel ban preventing UK nationals entering Bulgaria unless they have a residence permit, remains in place until further notice.
Full information and details of the restrictions currently in place in Bulgaria is regularly reviewed and updated via the the Embassy Facebook page.
The police are strictly enforcing measures and failure to comply could result in a 300 to 1,000 lev (£135-£450) fine.
Further information
The Bulgarian Ministry of Health has published information (in Bulgarian) and has set up a hotline +359 2 807 87 57.
