Your travel insurance could be invalidated if you travel against FCDO advice.
Cabinda Province, except Cabinda city 
FCDO advises against all but essential travel to Cabinda Province, except to Cabinda city. This is due to separatist groups carrying out targeted attacks on foreigners and the risk of kidnap. 
Border areas in Lunda Norte Province 
FCDO advises against all but essential travel to within 1km of the border with the Democratic Republic of the Congo (DRC) in Lunda Norte province, except for official border crossings and their access roads. This is due to poor conditions, insecurity and banditry.
