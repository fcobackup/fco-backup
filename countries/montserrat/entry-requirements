Entry rules in response to coronavirus (COVID-19)
All travel to or from Montserrat is via Antigua. If you are travelling to Montserrat you must comply with Antiguan entry requirements, even when immediately transiting on to Montserrat. Check travel advice for Antigua before booking any flights to or from Montserrat.
Recreational Visitors are not allowed to enter Montserrat for less than two months. Resident permit holders, Montserratians (plus dependents) and a few limited other categories of people are allowed to enter Montserrat; this includes people who have a reservation confirmed by a real estate agent to stay in, what would otherwise be unoccupied property, for at least two months. All intended arrivals must submit an Access Declaration Form at least 72 hours prior to booking your travel, and have evidence of a negative COVID-19 test result. Upon submission of the form you will receive an email reply pre-clearing your entry. You must save this email. The airline might ask for it when you book your flight. The form, and other information, including a full list of categories of people who are allowed to enter Montserrat at this time, can be found on the Government of Montserrat website. You should not use the NHS testing service to get a test in order to facilitate your travel to another country. You should arrange to take a private test.
The Government of Montserrat has introduced enhanced health screening and all new arrivals will need to self-isolate. This can be for up to 14 days if isolating at home, or less if you choose to pay to enter a government quarantine centre and give a negative result to a subsequent COVID-19 test after a few days, after which you will be released. Individuals who exhibit signs of the virus may face quarantining at the discretion of the Medical Officer.
