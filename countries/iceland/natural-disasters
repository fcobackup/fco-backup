On 5 July 2023 Reykjanes Peninsula began experiencing intense seismic activity. A volcanic fissure eruption started 10 July in the Litli Hrutur area of Reykjanes. The area is dangerous and there are high levels of poisonous gases. Follow the instructions of the authorities at all times.Drivers should not stop on Reykjanesbraut (Route 41 between Reykjavik and Keflavik International Airport) unnecessarily in order to view the eruption. You may be fined by police for doing so. Those in the Rekjanes, Reykjavik and Snaefellsness peninsula should monitor the Ambient Air Quality updates on the Icelandic Environment Agency’s website for alerts.
A small volcanic fissure eruption occurred in Meradalir in the same area on the Reykjanes peninsula in August 2022.
A fissure eruption also occurred close by in March 2021 at Geldingadalur on the Reykjanes Peninsula. Larger volcanic eruptions also took place in the area around the Bárðarbunga volcano on the Vatnajökull glacier in the east of Iceland in August 2014, and Eyjafjallajokull volcano in the south of Iceland in 2010 and Grimsvötn volcanoes erupted in 2010 and 2011 respectively causing disruption to Icelandic and European airspace.
Further volcanic eruptions are possible and there is the potential for sulphur dioxide and other volcanic gases to be emitted during eruptions as well as causing glacial floods. You should monitor alerts from the Icelandic Met Office and monitor the Almannavenir Facebook page and Twitter: @almannavarnir for the latest updates.
There has been seismic activity in the South West and North of Iceland. Tremors can be numerous but usually don’t cause damage. However, they can cause rock falls and avalanches in the mountain areas. You should take care when driving and hiking in these areas. Follow the safety advice of the Icelandic authorities.
