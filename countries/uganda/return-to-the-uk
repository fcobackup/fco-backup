The British High Commission will continue to work with the Government of Uganda, other embassies and airlines on options for helping British nationals who wish to return home. However, no further UK Government-backed special charter flights are currently planned from Uganda. Entebbe International Airport remains closed and there are currently no commercial flights departing.
Your journey home: re-entering the UK
When you return, you must follow the rules for entering the UK. You:
need to provide your journey and contact details up to 48 hours before you’re due to arrive in the UK
are not allowed to leave the place you’re staying for the first 14 days you’re in the UK except in very limited situations (known as ‘self-isolating’)
See also the list of people who are exempt from the border rules.
The National Travel Health Network and Centre (NaTHNaC) also provides advice on how to stay safe as you travel by air.
Help and support
If you need urgent consular assistance, you can contact the British High Commission Kampala on 0312 312000 or +44 1908 516 666. The High Commission cannot provide further information or advice about departure options over the phone. This page will be updated when departure options become available.

Future travel options
You will need to pay for your return travel to the UK. Where departure options are available but you cannot afford the travel costs and have exhausted all other options for getting funds, you may be eligible to apply for an emergency loan from the government. This is a last resort option and you would need to repay the loan when you are back in the UK.
If you cannot leave Uganda at this time, see advice on staying in Uganda during coronavirus.
