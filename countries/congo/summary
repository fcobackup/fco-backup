If you plan to pass through another country to return to the UK, check the travel advice for the country you’re transiting.
It is more important than ever to get travel insurance and check it provides sufficient cover. See the FCDO’s guidance on foreign travel insurance.
Consular support is limited in the Republic of the Congo as there is no British Embassy. However, the British Embassy Kinshasa, in the Democratic Republic of Congo (DRC) can provide limited remote consular support to British nationals.
The state of public health emergency remains in force.
Although there’s no recent history of terrorism in the Republic of the Congo, attacks cannot be ruled out. See Terrorism. Take out comprehensive travel and medical insurance before you travel.
