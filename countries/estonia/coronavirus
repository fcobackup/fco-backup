Travel Restrictions and Borders
The Estonian authorities are advising against all travel in and out of Estonia. In addition, temporary border controls were introduced from 17 March limiting entry to Estonian nationals, those with an Estonian Residence Permit or foreign citizens with family members in Estonia. All those entering are required to complete a health declaration on arrival and self-quarantine for 14 days. There are some exceptions to this including diplomats, healthcare workers and those transporting goods and raw materials, provided they are asymptomatic.
The Estonian Police and Border Guard will carry out health checks at international border crossing points (land, ports and airports) to identify travellers’ country of departure and check for symptoms of coronavirus.
There are no restrictions for exiting the country.
From the 15 May, border-crossing restrictions between Estonia, Latvia and Lithuania will start to be lifted. For further information please refer to the Estonian government official crisis portal.
