Crime
Crime levels are low. However, you should take sensible precautions such as locking doors and windows at night and securing your car when you leave it. Avoid isolated areas, including beaches after dark. Do not carry large amounts of cash or jewellery. Valuables and travel documents should be left, where possible, in safety deposit boxes and hotel safes. Do not offer resistance if an armed robbery is attempted.
Road travel
There is no public transport except taxis but car rental is widely available. You will need to bring your driving licence if you plan to rent a car and obtain a local driving licence from the car rental company at a cost of US $6 and car hire costs approximately US$50 per day. Most rental cars are automatic. If you want a manual one it is best to order in advance. Driving is on the left, the same as in the UK. Take care when overtaking as most vehicles are left hand drive.  Observe speed limits and do not drink and drive.
Air travel
All airlines require early check-in times for passengers and luggage. Check-in times should be confirmed locally as inter-Caribbean flights do, on occasion, depart earlier than timetabled. All items of luggage are subject to search.
Emergency assistance
As Anguilla is a British Overseas Territory thereâ€™s no formal British diplomatic or consular representation. The local authorities deal with all requests for emergency assistance.
Following the impact of Hurricane Irma, the UK government is providing disaster relief and making an urgent assessment of the needs of communities in Anguilla.
In an emergency, dial 911 for a local emergency response.
