Be prepared for your plans to change
No travel is risk-free during COVID-19. Countries may further restrict travel or bring in new rules at short notice, for example due to a new COVID-19 variant. Check with your travel company or airline for any transport changes which may delay your journey home.
If you test positive for COVID-19, you may need to stay where you are until you test negative. You may also need to seek treatment there.
Plan ahead and make sure you:
can access money
understand what your insurance will cover
can make arrangements to extend your stay and be away for longer than planned
Coronavirus lockdown
Brunei has now lifted most pandemic restrictions in country. Masks will no longer be mandatory (indoors and outdoors) and will be optional. Masks are still compulsory in health facilities, and may be required by event organisers. Masks are still required for those who handle food preparation (e.g. at eateries). There are financial penalties for not adhering to mask guidelines.
Business premises, including restaurants, fitness facilities, markets and cinemas are open and there is no limitation on the capacity of mass gatherings (at home or in public). All sporting activities are allowed without limitations.
Childcare centres, kindergartens, primary and secondary schools, colleges and sixth form centres are open for in person classes. Students are no longer required to take an Antigen Rapid Test (ART) and are no longer required to wear a face mask.
All individuals, regardless of vaccination status are allowed to enter public premises and government offices and attend private and public events.
Temperature checks and scanning your BruHealth app before entering premises is no longer mandatory but private businesses may still require you to do so.
British people travelling should check the Brunei Ministry of Health and the Prime Ministers Office websites for up to date guidance, policy on travel to/from Brunei and details on how to download and use the BruHealth app.
