The information on this page covers the most common types of travel and reflects the UK government’s understanding of the rules currently in place. Unless otherwise stated, this information is for travellers using a full ‘British Citizen’ passport.
The authorities in the country or territory you’re travelling to are responsible for setting and enforcing the rules for entry. If you’re unclear about any aspect of the entry requirements, or you need further reassurance, you’ll need to contact the embassy, high commission or consulate of the country or territory you’re travelling to.
You will require a valid passport or other travel document to enter Switzerland.
Coronavirus
Entry in to Switzerland from all countries except Liechtenstein is only possible for Swiss citizens, Liechtenstein citizens, holders of Swiss resident permits, cross-border workers, those transiting with an onward ticket within the same day (not overnight) and those with “compelling reasons”. Goods traffic is also still permitted. Secondary customs posts are closed at all borders so that traffic can be channelled through the main border crossings.
You should also consider checking with your transport provider or travel company to make sure your passport and other travel documents meet their requirements.
Passport validity
Your passport should be valid for the proposed duration of your stay; you do not need any additional period of validity on your passport beyond this.
The rules on travel will stay the same until 31 December 2020.
Visas
If you hold a British Citizen passport, you don’t need a visa to enter Switzerland. If you’re planning to stay longer than 3 months, see our Living in Switzerland guide and contact the Swiss Embassy if you have further questions.
The rules on travel will stay the same until 31 December 2020.
