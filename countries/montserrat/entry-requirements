Proof of vaccination status
Montserrat will accept the UK’s proof of COVID-19 recovery and vaccination record and proof of COVID-19 vaccination issued in the Crown Dependencies. Your NHS appointment card from vaccination centres is not designed to be used as proof of vaccination and should not be used to demonstrate your vaccine status.
If you’re not fully vaccinated
If you are not fully vaccinated, or unable to prove you have been fully vaccinated, you will require a negative COVID-19 test. This can be either a PCR test or rapid antigen test, taken within three days of arrival. You will be tested on arrival, and will be required to quarantine for 10 days, adhering to the guidelines and further testing, as set out by the health officials.
