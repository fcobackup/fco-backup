Hurricanes
The hurricane season in Martinique normally runs from June to November. Monitor local and international weather updates from the US National Hurricane Centre website and check with local authorities or your tour operator for any changes to your onward travel plans.  
See our tropical cyclones page for advice about how to prepare effectively and what to do if you’re likely to be affected by a hurricane or tropical cyclone.
Volcanoes
The Montagne Pelée volcano is dormant; it is monitored by a local observatory and there would be warning well in advance from the local authorities of any imminent volcanic activity.
