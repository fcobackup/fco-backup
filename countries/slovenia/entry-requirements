The information on this page covers the most common types of travel and reflects the UK government’s understanding of the rules currently in place. Unless otherwise stated, this information is for travellers using a full ‘British Citizen’ passport.
The authorities in the country or territory you’re travelling to are responsible for setting and enforcing the rules for entry. If you’re unclear about any aspect of the entry requirements, or you need further reassurance, you’ll need to contact the embassy, high commission or consulate of the country or territory you’re travelling to.
You should also consider checking with your transport provider or travel company to make sure your passport and other travel documents meet their requirements.
Entry rules in response to coronavirus (COVID-19)
Entry to Slovenia
Airports in Slovenia remain open for passenger flights. You should consult airlines for details of flight options, to and from Slovenia.
International passenger train connections have re-started. You should visit the Deutsche Bahn website for the latest schedule.
The Slovene authorities have announced new border entry procedures. If your travel is deemed by the Slovenian authorities to be non-essential, then you may be denied entry by the Slovenian authorities.
If you are travelling to Slovenia indirectly, please refer to the Travel Advice for the countries which you will be transiting through.
Quarantine requirements
From 30 May 2021, the Slovenian authorities have implemented a Dark Red list, this is in addition to the Red list, to determine the requirements for people arriving into Slovenia from overseas. From 30 May 2021, the UK will be on the Dark Red list. The rules around entry are detailed, and subject to regular change. You should regularly consult this Travel Advice and the Slovenian Government websites listed below to ensure you have the latest information. Full details can be found on this Slovenian Government website.
Everyone entering Slovenia from a country on the Dark Red List or the Red List will be required to quarantine for 10 days. Quarantine can be ended after 5 days, with a negative PCR test. Quarantine can be avoided if travellers meet one of the specific exemptions that are listed by the Slovenian government (the list of exemptions can be found on the border crossing page of the Slovene website), or:
they are able to provide a negative PCR test result or a negative Rapid Antigen Test that is not more than 48 hours old and that has been administered in Australia, Canada, the EU, Israel, New Zealand, Russia, the Schengen Area, Serbia, the UK or the US; or
they have proof of a COVID-19 vaccination as follows:
A second dose of Pfizer/BioNTech at least 7 days before arrival;
A second dose of Moderna vaccine at least 14 days before arrival;
A first dose of Oxford/AstraZeneca vaccine at least 21 days before arrival;
A second dose of the Sputnik V vaccine at least 21 days before arrival;
The Johnson & Johnson Janssen vaccine at least 21 days before arrival;
The Serum Institute of India/AstraZeneca at least 21 days before arrival;
A second dose of the Sinovac Biotech at least 14 days before arrival;
A second dose of the Sinopharm at least 14 days before arrival;
One dose of any of the above vaccines within eight months of recovering; or
they have recovered from COVID-19 and hold immunity. Proof of immunity can be demonstrated by a written medical statement from a health professional showing they had the first symptoms of COVID-19 within 6 months prior to arrival; or evidence of a positive test conducted at a recognised institution (see paragraph below) older than 21 days but less than 6 months.
PCR tests and Rapid Antigen Tests conducted in the UK are accepted as a means to avoid quarantine on arrival in Slovenia from a Red List country.
If your travel is deemed by the Slovenian authorities to be non-essential, then you may be denied entry by the Slovenian authorities, even if you have a negative PCR test which was conducted in an EU/Schengen country.
Anyone required to enter into quarantine will need to provide an address (where they will be staying) to the Border authorities. Failure to do so may result in the Border authorities denying you entry into Slovenia. During self-isolation, you are required to stay in your accommodation and not socialise outside of your household. You can take short walks for exercise, but should maintain social distancing and not engage with people from outside your household. The local municipality can make arrangements for the delivery of essential supplies if friends or family cannot support you.
All arriving travellers will be given advice at the border regarding the steps they may need to take.
From 6 March 2021, internal checkpoints on the Schengen borders with Italy and Austria have been removed. Checkpoints remain at the internal Schengen borders with Hungary. Only the following crossing points are open to all categories of travellers:
Dolga vas, and Pince (highway) on the Hungarian border
The following crossing points are only open to travellers specifically referred to in the exemptions list:
Hodoš, Čepinci on the Hungarian border
If you are travelling to neighbouring countries you should check the travel advice for the latest information on entering those countries. See travel advice for Austria, Croatia, Hungary and Italy. If you remain in Slovenia, you should be aware that for stays longer than 90 days, you will be required to register as a Temporary Resident. Contact the Uprava Enota (the department that handles these applications) at +386 1 306 3034 or ue.ljubljana@gov.si. The department is open from Monday to Thursday from 8am-6pm and on Friday from 8am-2pm.
Demonstrating your COVID-19 vaccination status
If you live in England, Slovenia will accept the NHS app or your NHS letter to demonstrate your COVID-19 vaccination status. If you live in Scotland or Wales, Slovenia will accept your respective NHS letter to demonstrate your COVID-19 vaccination status. Your NHS appointment card from vaccination centres is not designed to be used as proof of vaccination and should not be used to demonstrate your vaccine status.
Regular entry requirements
Visas  
The rules for travelling or working in European countries changed on 1 January 2021:
you can travel to countries in the Schengen area for up to 90 days in any 180-day period without a visa. This applies if you travel as a tourist, to visit family or friends, to attend business meetings, cultural or sports events, or for short-term studies or training.
if you are travelling to Slovenia and other Schengen countries without a visa, make sure your whole visit is within the 90-day limit. Visits to Schengen countries within the previous 180 days before you travel count towards your 90 days.
to stay longer, to work or study, for business travel or for other reasons, you will need to meet the Slovenian government’s entry requirements. Check with the Slovene Embassy what type of visa and/or work permit, you may need
if you stay in Slovenia with a residence permit or long-stay visa, this does not count towards your 90-day visa-free limit
Any time you spent in Slovenia or other Schengen countries before 1 January 2021 does not count towards your 90-day visa-free limit.
At Slovenian border control, you may need to use separate lanes from EU, EEA and Swiss citizens when queueing. Your passport may be stamped on entry and exit. You may also need to:
show a return or onward ticket
show you have enough money for your stay
There are separate requirements for those who are resident in Slovenia. If you are resident in Slovenia, you should carry proof of residence as well as your valid passport when you travel. For further information on these requirements, see our Living in Slovenia guide.
Passport validity
Check your passport is valid for travel before you book your trip, and renew your passport if you do not have enough time left on it.
You must have at least 6 months left on an adult or child passport to travel to most countries in Europe (not including Ireland).
If you renewed your current passport before the previous one expired, extra months may have been added to its expiry date. Any extra months on your passport over 10 years may not count towards the 6 months needed.
UK Emergency Travel Documents
UK Emergency Travel Documents (ETDs) are accepted for entry, airside transit and exit from Slovenia.
