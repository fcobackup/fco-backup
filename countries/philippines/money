The currency of the Philippines is the Philippine peso (PHP).
Some ATMs accept international credit and debit cards. Shops in towns and cities usually accept international credit cards. If you are travelling outside major cities, take sufficient funds in local currency with you. There may not be ATMs or currency exchange facilities at your destination.
Cash in pounds sterling, euros or US dollars can be exchanged for Philippine pesos at the airport, in banks, hotels and some shops. Scottish and Northern Ireland bank notes aren’t generally accepted. Banks and foreign exchange outlets rarely accept travellers’ cheques. Buying foreign currency in the Philippines can be difficult.
You can bring up to PHP50,000 in cash into the Philippines without prior authorisation. If you plan to bring more than PHP50,000 into the country, you’ll need to get written authorisation from the Philippines Central Bank.
