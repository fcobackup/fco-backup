Cases of coronavirus (COVID-19) have been confirmed in Taiwan. The Taiwan authorities have introduced a number of measures to limit the spread of the virus.
The list below covers the main restrictions but is not exhaustive and entry procedures are being regularly reviewed so may change at short notice:
From the beginning of 24 March until 7 April no flight transits will be permitted through Taiwan. You should adjust your travel plans accordingly.
From Thursday 19 March (Taiwan Time) foreign nationals will no longer be permitted to enter Taiwan with the exception of holders of a valid Alien Resident Certificate (ARC) or Alien Permanent Resident Certificate(APRC). These measures apply to those people who are eligible for visa-free treatment, landing visas, and e-visas, as well as those carrying valid visas.
There are a very small number of exemptions where you can apply for special permission to enter at the Taipei Representative Office in the country you plan to travel from. If you are unsure if you are permitted to enter Taiwan, you should contact your local Taipei Representative Office, or your airline before you attempt to travel.
If you do meet the criteria for entry into Taiwan all travellers will be required to self-isolate for 14 days on arrival. Local authorities monitor self-isolation and there are legal penalties for breaching self-isolation. This rule applies retrospectively to all travellers into Taiwan. If you have entered Taiwan from 5 March onwards, you should contact the Taiwan Centers for Disease Control (CDC) helpline which is 1922. You will need to complete the designated self-isolation period in Taiwan even if you have a pre-booked flight to exit Taiwan. You should contact your airline to re-arrange your flight.If you do not have suitable accommodation, you may be taken to a facility run or supervised by local authorities.
The Taiwanese authorities announced on 21 March that anyone arriving on a visa waiver, visitor visa or landing visa before 21 March, and has not overstayed their entry conditions, will be granted an automatic 30-day extension. No application is required.
All airline passengers entering Taiwan are now required to fill in a health declaration which includes travel history for the preceding 14 days.
If you are granted permission to enter Taiwan, you may find it difficult to find a hotel who will accept travellers who need to self-isolate for 14 days. You should confirm with your hotel provider that they are able to offer accommodation to someone required to self-isolate for 14 days before you travel.
As a result of entry and travel restrictions, a number of flights out of Taiwan have been cancelled, and this may change without notice as the situation progresses. Contact your airline or tour operator for the latest information.
You should comply with any additional screening measures put in place by the Taiwanese authorities. Monitor the Taiwan Centers for Disease Control website for measures that Taiwan is taking to combat coronavirus.
If you are in Taiwan and believe, you may have been exposed to or may have contracted coronavirus, your first point of contact should be the Taiwan Centers for Disease Control (CDC) helpline which is 1922. If you are unable to speak to anyone at the CDC you can contact the British Office, Taipei for support.
As a response to coronavirus, a number of countries have placed entry restrictions on those who have travelled in or transited through China. Some countries may include Taiwan within these restrictions. If you’re travelling to or via other countries from Taiwan, check the travel advice for these destinations. If you need further information, contact the local immigration authorities or the embassy, high commission or consulate of the country you’re travelling to.
