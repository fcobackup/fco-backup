All travellers

If you’re fully vaccinated

The RAT has to be conducted less than 24 hours before your departure to Tonga and you will have to provide the original test result certificate, issued by the supervising pharmacist/medical professional, when you check in for the repatriation flight. On arrival in Tonga, you will need to complete a period (currently 5 days) in Managed Isolation and Quarantine (MIQ) during which two PCR COVID-19 tests will be conducted. MIQ can either be in private accommodation, which requires Ministry of Health approval prior to travel, or at a government run facility. For government run locations, you will be required to pay for your MIQ.
At least 14 days must have passed since your second dose of the vaccine and the vaccine must be approved by the Ministry of Health.
