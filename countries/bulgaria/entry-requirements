This page has information on travelling to Bulgaria. Check what you must do to return to the UK.
This page reflects the UK government’s understanding of current rules for people travelling on a full ‘British Citizen’ passport from the UK, for the most common types of travel.
The authorities in Bulgaria set and enforce entry rules.
All travellers
From 1 May 2022 all COVID-19 entry requirements for travellers to Bulgaria end, regardless of nationality and/or where travelled from.
Neighbouring countries may have health requirements for entry for those arriving from or transiting through Bulgaria, including declarations and COVID-19 tests. You should check the relevant FCDO Travel Advice.
If you need to travel, plan ahead and before you travel check border information published by the Ministry of Foreign Affairs before you travel.
Check your passport and travel documents before your travel
Passport validity
If you are planning to travel to an EU country (except Ireland), or Switzerland, Norway, Iceland, Liechtenstein, Andorra, Monaco, San Marino or Vatican City, you must meet the Schengen area rules.
Your passport must meet 2 requirements. It must be:
less than 10 years old on the day you enter (check the ‘date of issue’)
valid for at least 3 months after the day you plan to leave (check the ‘expiry date’)
We are asking the European Commission to clarify the 10-year rule. Their guidance for Schengen border guards may not be updated until the spring of 2022. Until then, for some Schengen countries your passport may need to be less than 10 years old during your whole visit, and the 3 months at the end of your visit may need to be within 10 years of your passport’s issue date.
Check both the issue date and the expiry date in your passport. If you renewed your passport early, extra months may have been added to its expiry date. This could affect the requirement for your passport to be less than 10 years old.
Contact your travel provider or embassy of the country you are visiting if you think that your passport does not meet both these requirements. Renew your passport if you need to.
Visas
Bulgaria is not part of the Schengen area, Visits to Bulgaria do not count towards your 90-day visa-free limit in the Schengen area.
Visits to other EU or Schengen countries do not count towards your 90-day visa-free limit in Bulgaria.
You can travel to Bulgaria for up to 90 days in any 180-day period without a visa. This applies if you travel as a tourist, to visit for family or friends, to attend business meetings, cultural or sports events, or for short-term studies or training.
To stay longer, to work or study, for business travel or for other reasons, you will need to meet the Bulgarian government’s entry requirements. Check with the Bulgarian Embassy what type of visa and/or work permit you may need.
If you are travelling to Bulgaria for work, read the guidance on visas and permits.
If you stay in Bulgaria with a Bulgarian residence permit or long-stay visa, this time does not count towards your 90-day visa-free limit for Bulgaria.
Passport stamping
As a visitor, your passport may be stamped when you enter and exit Bulgaria. Border guards will use passport stamps to check you’re complying with the 90-day visa-free limit for short stays in Bulgaria.
If you enter or exit the Schengen area through Bulgaria as a visitor, check that your passport is stamped. This will show border guards that you are complying with the 90-day visa-free limit for Bulgaria and the separate 90-day visa-free limit for the Schengen area.
If the relevant entry or exit stamp is not in your passport, border guards will presume that you have overstayed your visa-free limit. If you show evidence eg transport tickets to prove when you entered or exited Bulgaria, border guards should add this entry or exit date and the location in your passport.
You may also need to:
show a return or onward ticket
show you have enough money for your stay
If you have a Withdrawal Agreement residency document for another country, your passport might still be stamped if you are a visitor to Bulgaria.
If you are resident in Bulgaria, read our Living in Bulgaria guide for passport stamping information.
UK Emergency Travel Documents
UK Emergency Travel Documents (ETDs) are accepted for entry, airside transit and exit from Bulgaria.
