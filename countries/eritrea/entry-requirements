Warning
FCDO advises against all travel to parts of Eritrea.

This advice reflects the UK government’s understanding of current rules for people travelling on a full ‘British citizen’ passport from the UK, for the most common types of travel.
The authorities in Eritrea set and enforce entry rules. If you’re not sure how these requirements apply to you, contact the Eritrean Embassy in the UK.
Passport validity requirements
To enter Eritrea, your passport must have an ‘expiry date’ at least 6 months after the date you arrive and at least 2 blank consecutive pages for stamping.
Check with your travel provider that your passport and other travel documents meet requirements. Renew your passport if you need to.
You will be denied entry if you do not have a valid travel document or try to use a passport that has been reported lost or stolen.
Visa requirements
You must have a visa to enter Eritrea. For information about visas, contact the Eritrean Embassy in the UK or the nearest Eritrean embassy. Check with your airline or travel company for the latest information.   
British-Eritrean dual nationals
Dual nationals who enter Eritrea on an Eritrean identity card will need an exit permit from the Immigration Office in Asmara to leave the country.
Land border crossings
Eritrea’s land borders with Djibouti and Ethiopia are closed at the moment. It is unclear if and when the borders will reopen. Eritrea’s land border with Sudan is operational in response to the conflict in Sudan.    
Vaccination requirements
At least 8 weeks before your trip, check the vaccinations and certificates you need in TravelHealthPro’s Eritrea guide.
Depending on your circumstances, this may include a yellow fever vaccination certificate.
Customs rules 
There are strict rules about goods you can take into or out of Eritrea. You must declare anything that may be prohibited or subject to tax or duty.
Electronic items
You must declare all laptops, mobile phones, cameras and other electronic items. If you do not, they can be confiscated by customs officials when you leave.
Taking money into and out of Eritrea
Declare foreign cash or travellers cheques if the value is 10,000 US dollars or more. You will get a certificate, which you must keep to show when you leave.
When you leave Eritrea, you must be able to show that any foreign currency you have spent has been either:
exchanged at ‘Himbol’, the state foreign currency exchange
spent at an official hotel
If you cannot account for foreign money you’ve spent, you may be delayed or face prosecution, leading to a severe fine.
You are not allowed to take more than 1,000 Eritrean nafka out of Eritrea.
