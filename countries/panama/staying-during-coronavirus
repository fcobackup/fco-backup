Moving around in Panama
For information on entering Panama, see Entry Requirements
Panama is currently under a state of emergency, and a curfew is in place.
On 19 March 2020, the Panamanian Government began establishing sanitary cordons in different provinces of the country, including Panama City, with checkpoints in various locations. The Panamanian Government may change suddenly the provinces with sanitary cordons, and may introduce other restrictions on movement. These are posted on the Panamanian Ministry of Health Twitter feed.
You should avoid any unnecessary travel to and from any of the areas included in sanitary cordons. If you urgently need to travel, you will need to show ID and proof of your reason for needing to cross the checkpoint in order to pass, such as evidence of your flight out of Panama.
Local authorities may also impose similar restrictions on movement.
National Curfew
From 1 June 2020, you must remain in your homes/accommodation between 7 pm and 5 am unless you fall under one of the exemptions (eg to access emergency medical care, to travel to a flight or if you work in an exempted industry).
Places of worship, parks, sports facilities and social areas (including those of buildings and open air areas of private clubs, such as tennis courts, golf and other sporting activities that do not involve physical contact) will open with 25% capacity and social distancing of 2 metres. The Panamanian Ministry of Health has specified that the relaxation in measures does not include social activity in groups, cultural activities, celebrations, beach visits, contact sports or any activity that does not respect social distancing.
From 1 June 2020, children will only be able to leave their homes from 4 pm – 7 pm if accompanied by a parent or guardian.
Face masks
The wearing of masks outside of your accommodation is compulsory nationwide.
Alcohol
On 25 March 2020 the distribution, sale and consumption of alcoholic drinks was banned for the duration of the national state of emergency. The Panamanian government began relaxing this ban on 8 May 2020, with permission granted initially for domestic personal consumption only. Limits per person are imposed on the sale of alcohol. However, different local authorities across the country are maintaining the total ban.
Transport
Uber has resumed services in Panama. Yellow taxis have a reduced presence, and do not operate on Sundays.
The police and security forces are empowered to enforce restrictions on movements and events due to the current state of emergency. You should follow their instructions.
Business
Commercial businesses have been ordered to close, except for supermarkets, pharmacies, health clinics, fuel stations and other key businesses. Supermarkets can have no more than 50 people inside. The Panamanian government began relaxing these restrictions from 13 May 2020, and you should check the Panamanian Ministry of Health Twitter feed for the latest updates.
Health
The authorities have set up a hotline (169) to answer any questions or receive information regarding a suspected case of coronavirus. If you are concerned that you may be unwell as a result of the coronavirus, you should call the national hotline on 169, or use the Panamanian Government’s “R.O.S.A” (virtual clinic) using this link to send a WhatsApp message, and follow their advice.
You can access the Panamanian public healthcare system on the same terms as Panamanians. Coronavirus tests in the public system for those who meet the clinical requirement to be tested will be free of charge.
On 15 March 2020, Panamanian authorities announced new restrictions on access to medical services for routine care, as well as widespread closures of commercial and leisure establishments. Further restrictions were announced on 20 March 2020. Routine healthcare – including elective surgeries and consultations with doctors – in both hospitals and other clinics has been restricted to people with chronic illness, children and those who are pregnant. From 13 May 2020, private clinics can operate, provided they comply with the protocols established by the Panamanian Ministry of Health.

Finance
There is a range of financial support from the government that you can access while you are unable to return due to coronavirus restrictions.
If you’re in Panama, and have exhausted all other options to cover essential living costs while you wait to return home, you could apply for an emergency loan for your living costs from the UK government. You can only apply if you normally live in the UK and you cannot return home. This last-resort option is for those most in need, and you would need to repay the loan when you are back in the UK. Apply for an emergency loan.

Help and support
You should monitor the press and official announcements of the Panamanian government to ensure you are up-to-date with any changes to these restrictions.
The Panamanian Tourism Authority (ATP) has created the following helpline to provide assistance: +507 6330 2520 or via email to contact@atp.gob.pa.
