The information on this page covers the most common types of travel and reflects the UK government’s understanding of the rules currently in place. Unless otherwise stated, this information is for travellers using a full ‘British Citizen’ passport.
The authorities in the country or territory you’re travelling to are responsible for setting and enforcing the rules for entry. If you’re unclear about any aspect of the entry requirements, or you need further reassurance, you’ll need to contact the embassy, high commission or consulate of the country or territory you’re travelling to.
You should also consider checking with your transport provider or travel company to make sure your passport and other travel documents meet their requirements.
Entry rules in response to coronavirus (COVID-19)
For the purposes of setting travel rules, France has defined a European Area composed of EU countries, the UK, Andorra, Holy See, Iceland, Liechtenstein, Monaco, Norway, San Marino and Switzerland.
Entry to France
Travellers arriving in France from the UK, European Area, Australia, Canada, Georgia, Japan, New Zealand, Rwanda, South Korea, Thailand, Tunisia and Uruguay are no longer required to self-isolate, or to demonstrate their travel is essential. Arrivals by sea and air routes will need to complete a ‘sworn statement’ (déclaration sur l’honneur) form self-certifying they are not suffering from symptoms associated with Covid19 and have not been in contact with confirmed cases in the preceding fortnight. This is available in English on the site of the French Embassy London.
Arrivals from countries other than those specified above will still need to complete an international travel certificate, which certifies that your journey is essential and confirms that you have not been suffering from a set of listed symptoms associated with Covid-19 or in contact with confirmed cases in the 14 days prior to travel. This travel certificate is available on the French Ministry of the Interior’s website. You should also produce any supporting paperwork to substantiate the essential nature of your travel. If you are entering France via any port or airport from any country from which you are required to present an international travel certificate, or have spent time in these countries in the last 30 days, those over the age of 11 will be invited to provide a negative Covid19 RT-PCR test taken less than 72 hours before departure. Whether this test is recommended or obligatory depends on the category your country of departure falls in to:
Category 1 countries: Currently Bahrain, Panama, United Arab Emirates and United States. Boarding will be refused if a negative Covid19 test result is not presented. Those departing the US who have taken a test but do not yet have a result will be able to board with a consular ‘laissez-passer’ on condition they re-take a test on arrival.
Category 2 countries: Currently Algeria, Argentina, Armenia, Bolivia, Bosnia and Herzegovina, Brazil, Costa-Rica, Chile, Colombia, Dominican Republic, Equatorial Guinea, India , Israel, Kosovo, Kuwait, Kyrgyzstan, Lebanon, Madagascar, Maldives, Mexico, Moldova, Montenegro, Occupied Palestinian territories, Oman, Peru, Qatar, Serbia, South Africa and Turkey. Travellers are strongly recommended to take a test in the 72 hours prior to departure but can opt to take a test on arrival instead. Those refusing to take a test on arrival will be obliged to quarantine.
Arrivals from countries not named above will be invited to present negative test results taken 72 hours prior to departure or may opt to take a test on arrival. They will be invited to quarantine if they do not do so.
Quarantine requirements
There is no quarantine requirement for arrivals from the UK, from the wider European Area (as defined above) or from Australia, Canada, Georgia, Japan, New Zealand, Rwanda, Serbia, South Korea, Thailand, Tunisia and Uruguay. Arrivals from other countries will be subject to compulsory or voluntary quarantine/self-isolation for 14 days on arrival in mainland France unless arriving with a negative RT-PCT test taken in the 72 hours before arrival. Exemptions to self-quarantine in France are set out in a Ministry of Interior press statement (in French) and its translation (in English).
Travellers from any country showing signs of a COVID-19 infection upon arrival in mainland France will have to carry out a mandatory 14-day quarantine at home or in a dedicated location indicated by the French authorities if home quarantine is not feasible.
Travel between the EU and non-European countries
The French Government has suspended non-essential travel between France and countries outside the European Area (as defined above) except for Australia, Canada, Georgia, Japan, New Zealand, Rwanda, Serbia, South Korea, Thailand, Tunisia and Uruguay.
Some countries are imposing a compulsory period of quarantine for travellers from France. If you are travelling from or through France, check the situation at your destination before you travel.
Travel to French overseas territories
Regular flights between metropolitan France and its overseas territories resumed in late June. Travellers need to provide a negative RT-PCR test taken in the 72 hours preceding arrival, and complete a self-declaration of absence of Covid-19 symptoms and contact with confirmed cases in the 14 days preceding arrival for entry into all French overseas territories. This is available in English on the site of the French Embassy London.
For travel to French Guiana, French Polynesia, Mayotte, New Caledonia and Wallis and Futuna you must present an international travel certificate confirming that your journey is essential and that you have not been suffering from a set of listed symptoms associated with Covid-19 or in contact with confirmed cases in the 14 days prior to travel. It is available on the Ministry of Interior website. The certificate is to be presented to transportation companies before boarding, as well as to border control authorities.
International travel certificates are not required for travel to other French overseas territories.
See travel advice pages for the French overseas territory you are visiting.
