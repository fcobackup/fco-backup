This information is for people travelling on a full ‘British citizen’ passport from the UK. It is based on the UK government’s understanding of the current rules for the most common types of travel. 
The authorities in Australia set and enforce entry rules. If you’re not sure how these requirements apply to you, contact the Australian High Commission in the UK.
Passport validity requirements
To enter Australia, your passport must be valid for the length of your planned stay.
If you’re travelling through or transiting another country on your way to or from Australia, check the entry requirements for that country. Many countries require at least 6 months validity remaining on your passport, even if you’re just in transit and do not pass through immigration.
Dual nationals
If you’re a British-Australian dual national, you must leave and enter Australia on your Australian passport. You could face difficulties and delays if you do not. See Australian government advice for dual nationals.
Visa requirements
You must have a visa to visit Australia. 
Applying for a visa
British citizens can usually get the following types of electronic visitor visa:
eVisitor visa – there is no visa application charge or service fee
Electronic Travel Authority (ETA) through the iOS app or Android app – there is no visa application charge, but there may be a service fee
The Department of Home Affairs has information on all other types of visas.
Vaccine requirements
To enter Australia, you must have a certificate to prove you’ve had a yellow fever vaccination if you’re coming from a country listed as a transmission risk. See the Australian Department of Health’s information on yellow fever for travellers.
For full details about medical entry requirements and recommended vaccinations, see TravelHealthPro’s Australia guide.
Customs requirements
There are strict rules about goods you can take into or out of Australia. You must declare anything that may be prohibited or subject to tax or duty. 
Quarantine rules
Australia has strict quarantine rules to keep out pests and diseases that could affect plant, animal or human health.
You must fill in an Incoming Passenger Card and either:
declare goods considered to be a risk, such as food, animal products and plant material (including wooden articles)
dispose of goods in bins at the airport or seaport
You must also declare if you have ‘been in contact with farms, farm animals, wilderness areas or freshwater streams/lakes etc in the past 30 days’.
The Australian authorities X-ray luggage. They inspect, treat and, if necessary, confiscate and destroy items of concern. You can get a heavy fine if you break quarantine.
The Department of Agriculture has more information on quarantine rules.
