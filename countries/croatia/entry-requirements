This page has information on travelling to Croatia.
This page reflects the UK government’s understanding of current rules for people travelling on a full ‘British Citizen’ passport from the UK, for the most common types of travel.
The authorities in Croatia set and enforce entry rules. If you’re unsure how Croatia’s entry requirements apply to you, contact its UK embassy, high commission or consulate.
All travellers
All travellers should familiarise themselves with the entry rules for Croatia before travel.
Travellers are no longer required to complete an online entry form before arriving in Croatia. However, all third country nationals (including British citizens) must register their arrival in Croatia via their accommodation provider within 1 day, or with the police within 48 hours of arrival. This can be done at a police station using the form obrazac 16 a.
Third country nationals are also responsible for registering any change in their accommodation during their stay, unless they are staying at a hotel/hostel/private accommodation that would register this for them.
Travellers are not required to show a COVID-19 vaccine certificate, proof of a negative test, or a certificate of recovery to enter Croatia.

Check your passport and travel documents before you travel
Passport validity
If you are planning to travel to an EU country (except Ireland), or Switzerland, Norway, Iceland, Liechtenstein, Andorra, Monaco, San Marino or Vatican City, you must follow the Schengen area passport requirements.
Your passport must be:
Issued less than 10 years before the date you enter the country (check the ‘date of issue’)
valid for at least 3 months after the day you plan to leave (check the ‘expiry date’)
You must check your passport meets these requirements before you travel. If your passport was issued before 1 October 2018, extra months may have been added to its expiry date.
Contact the embassy of the country you are visiting if you think that your passport does not meet both these requirements. Renew your passport if you need to.
Visas
As of 01 January 2023 Croatia is part of the Schengen area.
You can travel to countries in the Schengen area for up to 90 days in any 180-day period without a visa. This applies if you travel as a tourist, to visit family or friends, to attend business meetings, cultural or sports events, or for short-term studies or training.
If you are travelling to Croatia and other Schengen countries without a visa, make sure your whole visit is within the 90-day limit. Visits to Schengen countries within the previous 180 days before you travel count towards your 90 days.
To stay longer, to work or study, for business travel or for other reasons, you will need to meet the Croatian government’s entry requirements. Check with the Croatian Embassy in London as to what type of visa and/or work permit you may need.
If you are travelling to Croatia for work, read the guidance on visas and permits.
If you stay in Croatia with a Croatia residence permit or long-stay visa, this line does not count towards your 90-day visa-free limit for Croatia.
Passport stamping
Check your passport is stamped if you enter or exit the Schengen area through Croatia as a visitor. Border guards will use passport stamps to check you’re complying with the 90-day visa-free limit for short stays in the Schengen area. If relevant entry or exit stamps are not in your passport, border guards will presume that you have overstayed your visa-free limit.
You can show evidence of when and where you entered or exited the Schengen area, and ask the border guards to add this date and location in your passport. Examples of acceptable evidence include boarding passes and tickets.
You may also need to:
show a return or onward ticket
show proof of accommodation
show you have enough money for your stay
If you have a Withdrawal Agreement residency document for another country, your passport might still be stamped if you are a visitor to Croatia.
If you are resident in Croatia, read our Living in Croatia guide for passport stamping information.
UK Emergency Travel Documents
UK ETDs are accepted for entry, transit and exit from Croatia.
