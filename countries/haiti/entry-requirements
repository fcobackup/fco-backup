Warning
FCDO advises against all travel to Haiti.

This advice reflects the UK government’s understanding of current rules for people travelling on a full ‘British citizen’ passport from the UK, for the most common types of travel.
The authorities in Haiti set and enforce entry rules. If you’re not sure how these requirements apply to you, contact the Haitian Embassy in the UK. 
COVID-19 rules
There are no COVID-19 testing or vaccination requirements for travellers entering Haiti.    
Travel to Haiti
You must fill in a health declaration form on your flight and give it to immigration authorities when you arrive. The form will include your contact and location information while in Haiti.
Entry requirements may change at short notice. For more information check with your airline.
Passport validity requirements
Your passport must have an ‘expiry date’ at least 6 months after the date you arrive.
Check with your travel provider that your passport and other travel documents meet requirements. Renew your passport if you need to.
You will be denied entry if you do not have a valid travel document or try to use a passport that has been reported lost or stolen.
Visa requirements
You do not need a visa to visit Haiti for up to 90 days. 
To stay longer (or to work or study, for business travel or for other reasons), you must meet the Haitian government’s entry requirements.
Applying for a visa
For more information about how to apply for a visa, call the Haitian Embassy in London: 0203 771 1427.
Entry tax
Tourists must pay an entry fee of 10 US dollars in cash on arrival.
Departure tax
Tourists must pay a departure tax of 55 US dollars. For most international flights, this is included in the price of the ticket. Check this with your airline or tour operator before you travel. If the departure tax is not included in your air fare, make sure you have enough US dollars or local currency on departure. 
Vaccination requirements
At least 8 weeks before your trip, check the vaccinations and certificates you need in TravelHealthPro’s Haiti guide.
Depending on your circumstances, these may include a yellow fever certificate.
Customs rules
There are strict rules about goods you can take into or out of Haiti. You must declare anything that may be prohibited or subject to tax or duty.
