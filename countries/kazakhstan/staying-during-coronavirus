This page gives you guidance on how to stay safely in Kazakhstan as a visitor, if you are unable to return to the UK.
Everyone should comply with the measures put in place in Kazakhstan to limit the spread of coronavirus (COVID-19).
Moving around in Kazakhstan
Residents of Kazakhstan are currently restricted from travelling within the country as several major cities, including Nur-Sultan and Almaty, are in lock-down due to coronavirus restrictions.
Travel to any closed area requires advance permission from the Kazakh government. Some military/restricted areas are not clearly marked. Take care when travelling away from normal routes. The borders between Kazakhstan and its neighbours are currently closed to traffic, due to coronavirus restrictions. See Local travel
