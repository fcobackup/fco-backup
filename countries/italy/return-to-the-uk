There are commercial options to return to the UK from Italy.
UK special charter flights will only operate for priority countries where commercial flights are not possible. You should not assume that these flights will become available in countries where commercial routes are operating. Do not contact the contracted travel management company if no flight is advertised here.
Flights
Alitalia currently operates the only daily flights between Italy and the UK, from Rome Fiumicino to London Heathrow. Other airlines will resume flights during June and July. Check airline webpages for the latest information.
Passengers on Alitalia flights are required to wear a face mask (one will be provided if you do not bring your own). More information is on Alitalia’s ‘Flying Safely’ page.
Many airports in Italy have resumed domestic service, but may not be operating to their usual schedule. Some remain closed. You are strongly advised to check the airport’s website for the latest information on available flights.
Travel via neighbouring countries
You should check travel advice for any countries you plan to travel through ahead of your journey.
Financial assistance for travel
You will need to pay for your return travel to the UK. If departure options are available but you cannot afford the travel costs and have exhausted all other options for getting funds, you may be eligible to apply for an emergency loan from the government. This is a last resort option and you would need to repay the loan when you are back in the UK. For more information, you should contact Corporate Travel Management (CTM). CTM are a commercial partner of the FCO and are authorised to administer such loans on behalf of the FCO.
Your journey home: re-entering the UK
When you return, you must follow the rules for entering the UK. You:
need to provide your journey and contact details up to 48 hours before you’re due to arrive in the UK
are not allowed to leave the place you’re staying for the first 14 days you’re in the UK except in very limited situations (known as ‘self-isolating’)
See also the list of people who are exempt from the border rules.
The National Travel Health Network and Centre (NaTHNaC) also provides advice on how to stay safe as you travel by air.
