Tropical cyclones
Current projections suggest that Typhoon Khanun could reach Taiwan on 2 and 3 August, creating hazardous sea and weather conditions and potential travel disruptions. You should monitor alerts issued by the Taiwan Central Weather Bureau to get the latest information and follow the advice of the local authorities.
The tropical cyclone (typhoon) season in Taiwan normally runs from May to November. There’s a risk of road blockages and landslides following typhoons, especially in central and southern Taiwan.
Listen to Typhoon Alerts on ICRT, BCC and PRS radio stations, or alternatively monitor the websites of the Taiwan Central Weather Bureau, Japan Meteorological Agency, ICRT and DGPA (Announcement of Office and School Closures in Taiwan).
See our tropical cyclones page for advice about how to prepare effectively and what to do if you’re likely to be affected by a hurricane or tropical cyclone.
Check the Central Weather Bureau website and the Directorate General of Highways website before travelling.
Earthquakes
Earthquakes do occur in Taiwan. The US Federal Emergency Management Agency website has advice about what to do before, during and after an earthquake.
