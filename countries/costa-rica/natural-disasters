Flooding
The rainy season in Costa Rica normally runs from May to November, coinciding with the hurricane season in the Caribbean. Flooding can occur and heavy rains or hurricanes can cause landslides.
Monitor local and international weather updates from the World Meteorological Organisation and the National Hurricane Centre.
Earthquakes and volcanic eruptions
Costa Rica experiences regular seismic activity and earthquakes in excess of strength 6 occur periodically. Local infrastructure is well-prepared and earthquakes of this strength seldom have widespread effects. The US Federal Emergency Management Agency website has advice about what to do before, during and after an earthquake or tsunami.
Costa Rica has 16 volcanoes, several of which are considered active. The possibility of eruptions always exists.
