Warning
FCDO advises against all travel to parts of Algeria.

This information is for people travelling on a full ‘British citizen’ passport from the UK. It is based on the UK government’s understanding of Algeria’s current rules for the most common types of travel. 
The authorities in Algeria set and enforce entry rules. If you’re not sure how these requirements apply to you, contact the Algerian Consulate in the UK.
Passport validity requirements  
To enter Algeria, your passport must have an ‘expiry date’ at least 6 months after the date you arrive. 
Check with your travel provider that your passport and other travel documents meet requirements. Renew your passport if you need to.  
You will be denied entry if you do not have a valid travel document or try to use a passport that has been reported lost or stolen. 
If your passport is lost or stolen in Algeria 
If your passport is lost or stolen during your stay, the Algerian authorities will ask for a police report when you leave the country. 
Visa requirements 
You must have a visa to visit Algeria. 
Check your visa details, including validity dates, before you travel. If you overstay, it is likely Algerian immigration police will detain you at the airport on departure. You may face criminal prosecution and up to 3 months in prison. 
If you want to extend your stay in Algeria, apply at the town hall (‘la wilaya’) nearest to you. 
Applying for a visa 
Before you travel, apply for a visa through the Algerian Consulate in the UK.  
You may be able to get a tourist visa on arrival at some airports in Algeria if the majority of your travel is in the south of the country. You should have a confirmed reservation with an approved local travel agency. Contact the Algerian Consulate in the UK for more information and for details of approved travel agencies. 
Vaccine requirements 
To enter Algeria, you must have a certificate to prove you’ve had a yellow fever vaccination if you’re coming from a country listed as a transmission risk.
For full details about medical entry requirements and recommended vaccinations, see TravelHealthPro’s Algeria guide. 
Customs rules 
There are strict rules about goods you can take into and out of Algeria. You must declare anything that may be prohibited or subject to tax or duty. 
You can get a prison sentence for smuggling antiquities in Algeria. If you buy souvenirs, get proof of authenticity for anything that looks old or antique. Otherwise, the Algerian authorities may detain you on departure at the airport and confiscate the souvenirs. 
Travelling with children 
In Algeria, a child is:  
someone under the age of 19 years and one day  
considered to be an Algerian citizen if one of their parents is Algerian
If an Algerian citizen or a British-Algerian dual national child travels with one parent, the parent (whether mother or father) must prove their parental link through a ‘Livret de famille’ (original or certified copy).  
Algerian children travelling alone must have a letter (‘Autorisation Parentale’) from their parent or legal guardian giving them permission to leave the country. Children not from Algeria travelling alone need to show proof of permanent residence in the country they are travelling to. 
For further information, check the website of the Algerian Ministry of Interior or contact the Algerian Consulate in London.
