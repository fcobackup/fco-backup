This page reflects the UK government’s understanding of current rules for people travelling on a full ‘British Citizen’ passport, for the most common types of travel.
The authorities in Ukraine set and enforce entry rules. For further information contact the embassy, high commission or consulate of the country or territory you’re travelling to. You should also consider checking with your transport provider or travel company to make sure your passport and other travel documents meet their requirements.
Restrictions in response to coronavirus
Entry requirements
Upon arrival, all non-exempt foreign nationals are required to provide proof of health insurance that covers COVID-19 observation and treatment for the duration of their stay. Insurance must be purchased from a company registered in Ukraine or a foreign company that has a representative office or an insurance partner in Ukraine.
All non-exempt foreign nationals, in addition to their health insurance policy, must have:
a document confirming receipt of at least one dose of COVID-19 vaccination with WHO-approved vaccines – which Ukraine lists as Pfizer, AstraZeneca (Vaxzevria, Covishield and SKBio), Janssen, Moderna, Sinopharm and CoronaVac, or one of:
a negative Rapid Antigen Test taken no more than 72 hours before entry, or;
a negative PCR test taken no more than 72 hours before entry.
The requirement for proof of vaccination or a negative test does not apply to children under 12. (See ‘Demonstrating your COVID-19 status’)
Non-exempt foreign nationals without proof of vaccination (ie one or both doses) will be required on arrival to install the “Vdoma” app, which monitors self-isolation. The State Border Service will refuse entry to anyone who is unable, or refuses, to install the “Vdoma” app. See the official Visit Ukraine site and click “more details” for further information.
During the first 72 hours after arrival (unless travelling from Russia), you can take a PCR or Rapid Antigen test. If you test negative for COVID-19, you will not need to self-isolate. If you do not take a test in those 72 hours, you must begin self-isolating at the address you register on the Vdoma app, for 10 days. You can end self-isolation early if you receive a negative PCR or Rapid Antigen test result
Unvaccinated travellers (with certain exceptions listed on Visit Ukraine) who travel from Russia (including for transit through Ukraine) and have spent 7 or more days of the previous 14 days in those countries, will have to self-isolate for 14 days and will not be able to take a test in Ukraine to avoid or reduce self-isolation.
As of 3 December 2021, foreigners without a residence permit or other exemption (see Visit Ukraine for details) who have spent more than 7 of the last 14 days in South Africa, Botswana, Zimbabwe, Namibia, Lesotho, Eswatini, Mozambique or Malawi, are not permitted to enter Ukraine. Those with a residence permit or exemption may enter, but must undergo a mandatory 14-day self-isolation and will not be able to take a test to reduce the period of self-isolation.
Exemptions for foreign nationals
According to the resolution 1236 (9 December 2020) of the Ukrainian Government (Cabinet of Ministers), as updated on 25 October 2021, certain categories of foreign nationals are exempt from the insurance, PCR/RAT/express testing or vaccination requirements, and do not have to install the “Vdoma” app.
These categories include foreign nationals who are:
recognised as refugees;
accredited diplomats in Ukraine, or members of accredited diplomats’ families;
air, sea, and land transport crews, or;
military personnel from NATO or “Partnership for Peace” countries taking part in exercises with the Ukrainian military.
The full list of exemptions is available on Visit Ukraine (click “more details” and scroll to the bottom).
Foreign nationals who are permanent residents of Ukraine are exempt from the insurance and PCR/RAT testing requirement, though they must provide a document confirming receipt of one or more doses of a recognised COVID-19 vaccine or install the Vdoma mobile app and self-isolate for 10 days. Self-isolation is no longer required if you undergo PCR testing or a rapid antigen test within 72 hours of entry and get a negative result; except for permanent residents of Ukraine on arrival from Russia, who are subject to self-isolation for 14 days without the possibility of early termination.
The final decision on a person’s eligibility to enter Ukraine rests with the Ukrainian State Border Service. The entry requirement policies of foreign governments are imposed and enforced at their discretion.
Demonstrating your COVID-19 status
Ukraine will accept the UK’s proof of COVID-19 recovery and vaccination record and proof of COVID-19 vaccination issued in the Crown Dependencies. If you are travelling with a printed PDF proof of vaccination status, it must date from 1 November 2021 to ensure that the certificate can be scanned successfully. Your NHS appointment card from vaccination centres is not designed to be used as proof of vaccination and should not be used to demonstrate your vaccine status.
Transiting Ukraine
Foreign nationals transiting Ukraine are required to provide documents confirming their departure from the country within 48 hours and proof of health insurance that covers COVID-19 observation and treatment for the duration of their stay. Insurance must be purchased from a company registered in Ukraine or a foreign company that has a representative office or an insurance partner in Ukraine. Transiting travellers are exempt from self-isolation, installing the Vdoma application, and undergoing testing in Ukraine.
Travellers arriving in Ukraine or crossing the administrative points from non-government-controlled parts of Donetsk and Luhansk oblasts and Crimea will be subject to health monitoring on arrival. You should comply with any additional screening measures put in place by the authorities.
Further information about visiting Ukraine during the quarantine period can be found at the Ukrainian authorities’ Visit Ukraine webpage.
Regular entry requirements
Visas
British Citizen passport holders can enter Ukraine without a visa for visits of up to 90 days within a 180-day period. Ukraine has confirmed that this policy will continue to apply to British citizens until 30 January 2023.
Although there are no penalties for British citizens overstaying under the visa-free regime during quarantine (providing they leave within 30 days of quarantine ending), anyone who has overstayed will not be able to return to Ukraine for 90 days after leaving the country.
If you’re planning to stay in Ukraine for longer than 90 days in a 180 day period, you need to get a visa. For more advice on entry requirements contact the Ukrainian Embassy in London or Consulate General in Edinburgh.
You don’t need to complete an immigration card. Immigration officials may require you to scan your fingerprints as part of biometric data collection at border crossing points. For more details, visit the website of the State Border Guard Service of Ukraine
Proof of financial means
You may be asked to provide evidence that you have sufficient funds to support you during your stay. The Ukrainian authorities accept the following as a proof of sufficient funds: cash, bank cards along with bank statements, accommodation bookings, tourist vouchers, a letter from the person or company you’re visiting stating that they will cover your expenses, a return ticket or onward travel ticket. You can find more information on the websites of the Ukrainian Embassy in the UK and State Border Service of Ukraine.
Passport validity
If you’re travelling without a visa, your passport should be valid for the proposed duration of your stay. No additional period of validity beyond this is required.
If you’re applying for a visa, your passport may need to have an additional period of validity. Check with the Ukrainian Embassy in London for further details.
Borders
It’s illegal under Ukrainian law to enter internationally recognised Ukrainian territory through a border point that isn’t currently controlled by the Ukrainian authorities. If you do so, you risk arrest or a fine, and you may be subject to a travel ban.
International border crossings that aren’t currently under the control of the Ukrainian authorities include all land border crossings into Donetsk oblast, many of the land border crossings into Luhansk oblast, all air and sea ports in Crimea and the Kerch Bridge road and rail crossing into Crimea.
If you intend to visit any of the areas not controlled by the Ukrainian authorities, you should apply to the State Migration Service of Ukraine for a special entry permit. Information on border crossing procedure, entry/exit regulations and checkpoints are provided at the State Border Guard Service of Ukraine website.
Travelling between Ukraine and Belarus
On 2 July 2021, the Belarusian authorities announced the imminent closure of the land border between Ukraine and Belarus. British nationals should check with the Belarusian State Border Committee, or call their 24- hour hotline (+375 17 365 26 12), for the latest information on the situation at the land crossings, before planning any overland travel. Air travel is currently also not permitted. If you have any existing train, flight or tour tickets, you should contact the travel operator seeking advice.
UK Emergency Travel Documents
UK Emergency Travel Documents are accepted for entry, airside transit and exit from Ukraine.
Customs regulations
You can find general information about importing and exporting items on the website of the State Fiscal Service of Ukraine (in Ukrainian).
There are strict customs regulations governing the export from Ukraine of antiques and items of historical interest. If in doubt seek prior permission from the customs authorities: telephone: (+38 044) 454 16 13, e-mail: idd@sfs.gov.ua
