You should also read FCDO’s overall travel advice and safety and security advice. 
Northern Armenia Flooding
In the early hours of Sunday 26 May, due to heavy rain in several northern provinces of Armenia, there are reports of heavy flooding and road closures. The M6 highway, the main route from Armenia to Georgia is reported to be blocked due to stranded vehicles and unsafe stretches of road. Approximately 200 people have been evacuated from their homes as authorities conduct search and rescue operations and assess the situation. You are advised not to travel on this road unless absolutely necessary. If you must travel by road, please take advice from local authorities and police in the area and allow longer for journeys. In line with existing travel advice, driving in rural areas at night should be avoided.
Armenia-Azerbaijan border 
FCDO advises against all travel to within 5km of the border between Armenia and Azerbaijan. This is because of Armenia’s dispute with Azerbaijan over the Nagorno-Karabakh region. 
M16/H26 road between Ijevan and Noyemberyan 
FCDO advises against all travel along the M16/H26 road between the towns of Ijevan and Noyemberyan. This is because of Armenia’s dispute with Azerbaijan over the Nagorno-Karabakh region. 
Armenia-Turkey border 
The land border with Turkey is closed, although there are scheduled direct flights between Yerevan and Istanbul. 
South Caucasus
