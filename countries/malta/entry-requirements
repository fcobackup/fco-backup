This page has information on travelling to Malta. Check what you must do to return to the UK.
This page reflects the UK government’s understanding of current rules for people travelling on a full ‘British Citizen’ passport from the UK, for the most common types of travel.
The authorities in Malta set and enforce entry rules.
All travellers
Travellers are not required to complete a Passenger Locator Form for entry to Malta.
All passengers are required to present on arrival in Malta either a valid vaccination certificate, a negative PCR test taken within the last 72 hours, or a negative rapid antigen test taken within the last 24 hours.
You should not use the NHS testing service to get a test in order to facilitate your travel to another country. You should arrange to take a private test.
For further information about entry requirements visit the Maltese Government website.
Scheduled flights may be subject to short notice cancellation. Check the Malta Airport website or contact your airline to check the status of flights.
If you’re fully vaccinated
All passengers will be permitted to enter Malta with either a vaccination certificate or a negative PCR taken no longer than 72 hours before arrival, or a rapid antigen test taken no longer than 24 hours before arrival.
If you have received a booster, you are considered fully vaccinated for entry into Malta. There is currently no expiry date for booster jabs. If you have not received a booster, but have received two doses of a vaccine approved for use by Malta, then at least 14 and no more than 270 days must have passed since your second dose, to qualify as fully vaccinated.
For further information about entry requirements visit the Maltese Government website.
If you live in England, Scotland, Northern Ireland or Wales, Malta will accept the UK’s COVID vaccine certification (both the digital and letter versions) as proof of your vaccination status. Digital certificates must include a verifiable 2D barcode (QR code). Your NHS appointment card from vaccination centres is not designed to be used as proof of vaccination and should not be used to demonstrate your vaccine status.
If you received your vaccinations in the EU, then as of 1 July 2021 the EU digital COVID Certificates will be accepted.
If you received your vaccinations in a country that administers only one dose after recovery from COVID-19, and the vaccination certificate is accepted by the Maltese authorities, you may enter Malta if your certificate shows recovery from COVID at least six months before you arrive and one dose of an EMA-approved vaccine.
Find out if you qualify as fully vaccinated in Malta by checking the guidance issued by the Maltese authorities.
Proof of vaccination status
You can use the UK COVID Pass to demonstrate your vaccination record when entering Malta.
If you’re not fully vaccinated
You may enter Malta without being fully vaccinated. Travellers will need to provide a negative PCR taken no longer than 72 hours before arrival or a rapid antigen test taken no longer than 24 hours before arrival.
If you’ve had COVID-19 in the past year
If you’re travelling to Malta, you cannot use the UK proof of COVID-19 recovery record certifying that you have recovered from COVID-19 in the last 6 months.
Children and young people
There are no requirements for children under the age of 12 to present a vaccination certificate or a PCR or Rapid Antigen test to enter Malta. Children aged 12 to 18 will be permitted to enter Malta if they have either a valid vaccination certificate, a negative PCR test taken within the last 72 hours or a negative rapid antigen test taken within the last 24 hours.
For children under the age of 18, vaccination certificates with a full primary schedule have no expiry date.
For further information about entry requirements for children, visit the Maltese Government website.

Entry requirements if you have not been in the UK for the previous 14 days

Check your passport and travel documents before you travel
Passport validity
If you are planning to travel to an EU country (except Ireland), or Switzerland, Norway, Iceland, Liechtenstein, Andorra, Monaco, San Marino or Vatican City, you must follow the Schengen area passport requirements.
Your passport must be:
Issued less than 10 years before the date you enter the country (check the ‘date of issue’)
valid for at least 3 months after the day you plan to leave (check the ‘expiry date’)
You must check your passport meets these requirements before you travel. If your passport was issued before 1 October 2018, extra months may have been added to its expiry date.
Contact the embassy of the country you are visiting if you think that your passport does not meet both these requirements. Renew your passport if you need to.
Visas
You can travel to countries in the Schengen area for up to 90 days in any 180-day period without a visa. This applies if you travel as a tourist, to visit family or friends, to attend business meetings, cultural or sports events, or for short-term studies or training.
If you are travelling to Malta and other Schengen countries without a visa, make sure your whole visit is within the 90-day limit. Visits to Schengen countries within the previous 180 days before you travel count towards your 90 days.
To stay longer, to work or study, for business travel or for other reasons, you will need to meet the Maltese government’s entry requirements. Check with the Maltese High Commission what type of visa and/or work permit you may need.
If you are travelling to Malta for work, read the guidance on visas and permits.
If you stay in Malta with a residence permit or long-stay visa, this does not count towards your 90-day visa-free limit.
Passport stamping
Check your passport is stamped if you enter or exit the Schengen area through Malta as a visitor. Border guards will use passport stamps to check you’re complying with the 90-day visa-free limit for short stays in the Schengen area. If relevant entry or exit stamps are not in your passport, border guards will presume that you have overstayed your visa-free limit.
You can show evidence of when and where you entered or exited the Schengen area, and ask the border guards to add this date and location in your passport. Examples of acceptable evidence include boarding passes and tickets.
You may also need to:
show a return or onward ticket
show you have enough money for your stay
If you are resident in Malta, read our Living in Malta guide for passport stamping information.

Check whether you need a yellow fever certificate by visiting the National Travel Health Network and Centre’s TravelHealthPro website.
UK Emergency Travel Documents
UK Emergency Travel Documents are accepted for entry, airside transit and exit from Malta.
