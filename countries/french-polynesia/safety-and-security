Diving
Diving is popular but you should be aware that the only decompression facility is located in Papeete and that in the event of an accident it might take some time to reach there.
Road travel
From 28 March 2019, you will need to have a 1968 International Driving Permit (IDP) to drive in French Polynesia. 1949 IDPs previously issued by the UK may no longer be accepted in French Polynesia after this date. You will not be able to buy an IDP outside the UK, so get one before you travel.
