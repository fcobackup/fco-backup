The information on this page covers the most common types of travel and reflects the UK government’s understanding of the rules currently in place. Unless otherwise stated, this information is for travellers using a full ‘British Citizen’ passport.
The authorities in the country or territory you’re travelling to are responsible for setting and enforcing the rules for entry. If you’re unclear about any aspect of the entry requirements, or you need further reassurance, you’ll need to contact the embassy, high commission or consulate of the country or territory you’re travelling to.
You should also consider checking with your transport provider or travel company to make sure your passport and other travel documents meet their requirements.
Restrictions in response to coronavirus
Norwegian borders have been partially closed since Monday 16 March. Non-residents are not allowed to enter the country. The website of the Norwegian Ministry of Foreign Affairs has details of the limited number of exemptions to these restrictions.
All British nationals legally resident in Norway will be allowed to enter the country, but are required to enter self-quarantine for 14 days. Exemptions for workers crossing the Swedish and Finnish borders will apply; please see the Ministry of Foreign Affairs website for the details. Those with symptoms will be isolated. You should travel with evidence of residency.
For more information, contact the Norwegian Embassy in London. Detailed guidance is available on the UDI website.
Rules on how long you need to remain in quarantine have been clarified to allow those not showing symptoms to leave the country without needing to complete the full 14 days.
Transit travel
Non-residents are still able to transit via Norwegian airports as long as the final destination is not within Norway, but please check with your airline before departing.
Cruises
The Chief Medical Officer advises British nationals aged 70 and over and those with pre-existing health condition against cruise ship travel at this time. A number of Norwegian ports are restricting passenger embarkation and disembarkation. The situation can change rapidly so check with your cruise provider before travelling.
Visas
The Norwegian authorities have confirmed that if your visa has expired or is at risk of expiring, you will be not punished if you overstay. You are not required to notify UDI or the police, but are asked to try to leave as quickly as possible.
