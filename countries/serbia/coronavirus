If you plan to pass through another country to return to the UK, check the travel advice for the country you’re transiting.
Be prepared for your plans to change
No travel is risk-free during COVID. Countries may further restrict travel or bring in new rules at short notice, for example due to a new COVID-19 variant. Check with your travel company or airline for any transport changes which may delay your journey home.
If you test positive for coronavirus while in Serbia, you will be required to self-isolate at an address of your choosing for at least 7 days, likely a hotel or private residence, at your own cost. You may be contacted by the authorities and be hospitalised if deemed medically necessary. Minors will be subject to the same regulations as adults.
Plan ahead and make sure you:
can access money
understand what your insurance will cover
can make arrangements to extend your stay and be away for longer than planned
Public spaces and services
There are nationwide rules in place restricting movement and limiting activity. Protective face masks are mandatory in medical facilities and recommended in all public spaces indoors, and, outdoors when the area is crowded. Failure to wear a mask when required will incur a fine. Self-isolation, when required, will be enforced.
Additional rules and penalties vary in different towns and cities, and rules can change rapidly. You should follow the latest local guidance and check news outlets regularly for up to date information.
Further restrictions may be introduced, both nationwide and locally, including at short notice. Infringements of these procedures may result in fines and/or a prison sentence.
Healthcare in Serbia
The Serbian healthcare system is under increased pressure across the country due to COVID-19. It may be more difficult than usual to access satisfactory healthcare for any medical issue, including COVID-19.
The Serbian Ministry of Health website gives up to date information on the number of coronavirus cases confirmed and tests carried out in Serbia. It includes regional data maps. This website also includes helpline telephone numbers.

COVID-19 vaccines if you live in Serbia
We will update this page when the Government of Serbia announces new information on the national vaccination programme. You can sign up to get email notifications when this page is updated.
The Serbian national vaccination programme started in January 2021 and is using the Sinopharm, Astra Zeneca, Pfizer-BioNTech and Sputnik V vaccines. The Government of Serbia has stated that British nationals resident in Serbia are eligible for vaccination if they choose to join the programme. The Serbian authorities have created an e-portal to register for a vaccine in Serbia (only available in Serbian). Serbian and foreign nationals are able to register on this portal.
Find out more, including about vaccines that are authorised in the UK or approved by the World Health Organisation, on the COVID-19 vaccines if you live abroad.
If you’re a British national living in Serbia, you should seek medical advice from your local healthcare provider. Information about COVID-19 vaccines used in the national programme where you live, including regulatory status, should be available from local authorities.
