Transnistria
FCDO advises against all travel to Transnistria.
Transnistria is outside the control of the Moldovan government. There is widespread military activity in Ukraine, including close to some Moldovan borders. There were explosions in the region in 2022.     
All border crossings between Ukraine and Transnistria are temporarily closed.
The self-declared Transnistrian parliament has increased powers for prosecutions and pre-trial detentions against people regarded as extremists. They interpret extremism as including many activities that British nationals would consider legitimate, including moderate protest or freedom of expression.
