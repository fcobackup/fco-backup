Crime
Crime rates are low, but increasing. Burglaries are often accompanied by violence. Make sure you lock doors and windows at night. Street crime is also increasing and you should avoid making yourself an easy target, especially at night. There have been a number of attacks on tourists at nightclubs and bars in Port Vila. Check with the Vanuatu Tourist Office or your hotel on places where extra caution is required.
There have been several serious attacks on foreigners, including lone women, in isolated locations. Avoid visiting remote tourist sites or beaches alone. Where possible, travel as part of a larger group. 
Before you travel, make copies of your passport and travel documents. Keep one copy with you in a separate place to the original and leave another copy with someone at home.
Road travel
You can drive in Vanuatu on your UK driving licence. General driving standards are below those of the UK.  Many vehicles, including public transport, are in a poor state of repair and may not be insured. Numerous roads are not properly surfaced, and driving can also be dangerous due to a lack of street lighting, and the presence of pedestrians. Extra care should be taken when driving, particularly at night, in heavy rain or after a prolonged dry period.
Air travel
Inter-island travel by the domestic airline (Air Vanuatu) is expensive and often subject to delays. Vanuatuâ€™s outer island routes are serviced by small aircrafts, and airports and airstrips have quite basic facilities. 
Sea travel
Boat services between the islands are infrequent and can be unreliable. Inter-island boats should have a current sea-worthiness certificate, but many do not.
Swimming
Take care if swimming in the sea as rip currents can be strong. Coral reefs can easily cause cuts and scrapes. There are reports of water quality issues in some of the lagoons and sharks have been known to be present in the waters off Vanuatu.
Water sports
Many visitors to Vanuatu take part in water sports, including scuba diving and snorkelling without incident. However, deaths and serious accidents have occurred because of the lack of basic safety measures. Safety precautions and emergency responses may be less than those expected in the UK.
Vanuatu has two hyperbaric recompression chambers to provide medical assistance for dive-related injuries, both located in Port Vila.
Make sure your travel and medical insurance policy covers you for the activities you take part in.
Mobile phone services
There is a GSM mobile phone service in Vanuatu and you should contact your service provider to establish whether your phone will work in Vanuatu. Alternatively, SIM cards may be purchased from the local telephone companies Vodafone or Digicel, including at the main airport in Port Vila.
