This page reflects the UK government’s understanding of current rules for people travelling on a full ‘British Citizen’ passport, for the most common types of travel.
The Danish government sets and enforces its entry rules. For further information check the Danish coronavirus website. Check with your transport provider or travel company to make sure your passport and travel documents meet entry requirements.
If you are travelling to Denmark for work, read the guidance on visas and permits as the rules have changed since 1 January 2021.
Entry rules in response to coronavirus (COVID-19)
If you are planning a trip to Denmark check the latest travel rules before you travel. You should check with your airline for any additional testing requirements.
Whether you are required to test and/or self-isolate upon your arrival in Denmark depends on the country you arrive from and whether you are fully vaccinated or have previously recovered from COVID-19. The same rules apply to visitors and those resident in Denmark.
For arrivals to Denmark from the UK:
If you have recovered from COVID-19
If you have previously recovered from COVID-19 you can enter Denmark without a COVID-19 test or self-isolation. You will need:
Evidence of a positive PCR-test taken more than 14 days but less than 12 months ago.
If you are fully vaccinated
If you are travelling from the UK to Denmark and have been fully vaccinated you can enter Denmark without a COVID-19 test or self-isolation. You will need:
Proof of being fully vaccinated at least 14 days prior to arrival. See ‘Demonstrating your COVID-19 status’
If you are not fully vaccinated or previously infected
If you are travelling to Denmark from the UK and have not been fully vaccinated or recovered from COVID-19 you will need to:
take a COVID-19 test within 24 hours of arrival in Denmark
self-isolate for 10 days after arriving in Denmark. You can end self-isolation with a negative PCR-test taken at least 4 days after arrival.
Requirements for children travelling to Denmark
Children under the age of 16 are exempt from the testing and self-isolation requirement.
Children aged 16 and 17 are exempted from the testing and self-isolation requirement if they are travelling with a parent who:
has been fully vaccinated, or was
previously infected
Demonstrating your COVID-19 status
Denmark will accept the UK’s proof of COVID-19 recovery and vaccination record. If you are travelling with a printed PDF proof of vaccination status, it must date from 1 November to ensure that the certificate can be scanned successfully. Your NHS appointment card from vaccination centres is not designed to be used as proof of vaccination and should not be used to demonstrate your vaccine status.
Further help
UK Nationals resident in Denmark should travel with relevant documents - a valid passport, health insurance card, residence permit, residence card, EU registration certificate or personal identification document with proof of address.
You can check with the Danish authorities on their helpline (+45 7020 6044) for advice on the conditions of entry for foreign nationals.
For details of exemptions for eligible travellers, see the Danish authorities’ coronavirus website.

Travel to the Faroe Islands
All UK resident travellers to the Faroe Islands must have a worthy purpose to enter in line with the Danish government’s requirements.
You must:

Travel to Greenland
You can only enter Greenland, if you are fully vaccinated or have previously been infected with COVID-19. Residents and children 15 and under are exempt from the vaccination requirement.
All travellers (2 years of age and older, that have not previously been infected with COVID-19) must show a negative PCR-test result (from a test taken a maximum of 72 hours prior to departure to Greenland), taken in a Nordic country (Denmark, Finland, Iceland, Norway or Sweden).
Travellers that have previously been infected with COVID-19 are exempt from the pre-test rule. Persons that have previously been infected with COVID-19 must be able to show proof of a positive PCR test result that is at least 14 days old, but no more than 12 weeks old, at the time of travel.
You also need to complete a Personal Location form before departing for Greenland.
If you are fully vaccinated or have been previously infected with COVID-19, you do not need to quarantine on arrival.
Be aware that restrictions on entry to Greenland may be reinstated at any time depending on the national and global spread of COVID-19. There may also be limited flight capacity.
You can keep up to date at Visit Greenland’s travel advice.

Regular entry requirements
The Danish authorities have border controls at the land border with Germany. There are also border controls for travellers from Rønne, Helsingør, Frederikshavn, Grenaa and those using the Øresund Bridge, including all train traffic from Sweden.
If you’re arriving in Denmark using the land border, or by rail, road, or ferry you should carry your passport with you. Allow additional time for crossing the border, and follow the instructions of local authorities.
Check with local media, your carrier, ferry operator or Danish State Railways (DSB) for more information.
If you’re travelling from Denmark to Sweden various forms of ID are accepted. These must include a photograph, the holder’s full name, social security number or date of birth, holders signature, a stated validity and information on the issuing authority. Children under 18 accompanied by an adult with the appropriate ID are not required to carry ID themselves.
Visas for Denmark
The rules for travelling or working in European countries changed on 1 January 2021:
you can travel to countries in the Schengen area for up to 90 days in any 180-day period without a visa. This applies if you travel as a tourist, to visit family or friends, to attend business meetings, cultural or sports events, or for short-term studies or training
if you are travelling to Denmark and other Schengen countries without a visa, make sure your whole visit is within the 90-day limit. Visits to Schengen countries within the previous 180 days before you travel count towards your 90 days
to stay longer, to work or study, for business travel or for other reasons, you will need to meet the Danish government’s entry requirements. Check with the Danish Embassy what type of visa, if any, you will need
if you stay in Denmark with a residence permit or long-stay visa, this does not count towards your 90-day visa-free limit
Any time you spent in Denmark or other Schengen countries before 1 January 2021 does not count towards your 90-day visa-free limit.
At Danish border control, you may need to queue in separate lanes from EU, EEA and Swiss citizens.
Check your passport is stamped if you enter or exit the Schengen area through Denmark as a visitor. Border guards will use passport stamps to check you’re complying with the 90-day visa-free limit for short stays in the Schengen area. If relevant entry or exit stamps are not in your passport, border guards will presume that you have overstayed your visa-free limit.
You can show evidence of when and where you entered or exited the Schengen area, and ask the border guards to add this date and location in your passport. Examples of acceptable evidence include boarding passes and tickets.
You may also need to:
show a return or onward ticket
show you have enough money for your stay
If you are resident in the Denmark your passport should not be stamped. You should proactively show your proof of residence as well as your valid passport at Danish border control. For further information see our Living in Denmark guide.
Visas for Greenland and Faroe Islands
Greenland and the Faroe Islands are not members of the European Union. You don’t need a visa to enter for tourism, but you should get a work and residence permit before entry if you intend to live and work there.
Passport validity
Check your passport is valid for travel before you book your trip, and renew your passport if you do not have enough time left on it.
Make sure your passport is:
valid for at least 3 months after the day you plan to leave Denmark, or any other Schengen country
less than 10 years old
The 3 months you need when leaving a country must be within 10 years of the passport issue date.
If you renewed your current passport before the previous one expired, extra months may have been added to its expiry date. Any extra months on your passport over 10 years may not count towards the minimum 3 months needed.
UK Emergency Travel Documents
If you have lost your passport UK Emergency Travel Documents (ETDs) are accepted for entry, airside transit and exit from Denmark. Your ETD must be valid for the proposed duration of your stay.
