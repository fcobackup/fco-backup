You should also read FCDOâ€™s overall travel advice and safety and security advice.
Xaisomboun Province
FCDO advises against all but essential travel to Xaisomboun Province. There were reports in 2021 of attacks on infrastructure and armed clashes with anti-government groups in the province. There could be more skirmishes.
Borders with Thailand and Myanmar (Golden Triangle)
There have been small-scale clashes between anti-government groups and government troops in isolated areas along the Laos-Thailand border. The local law enforcement agencies have limited capability to counter these threats.
Be extremely cautious in Bokeo Province, particularly near the borders with Myanmar and Thailand, and around the Golden Triangle Special Economic Zone. Armed groups carry out employment scams and drug trafficking in this area.
Northern and eastern Laos, border with Vietnam
The risk of unexploded landmines and other weapons is particularly high in Xieng Khouang Province (Plain of Jars), Luang Prabang Province and areas of the Lao-Vietnamese border, formerly the Ho Chi Minh Trail. Mined areas are often unmarked.
