This advice reflects the UK government’s understanding of current rules for people travelling on a full ‘British citizen’ passport from the UK, for the most common types of travel.
The authorities in Belgium set and enforce entry rules. If you’re not sure how these requirements apply to you, contact the Belgian Embassy in the UK.
COVID-19 rules
There are no COVID-19 testing or vaccination requirements for travellers entering Belgium.
If a country is classified as very high risk for COVID-19, the Belgian government may restrict travel. See COVID-19 measures from the Belgian government for further information. There are currently no very high risk zones.
Children aged 17 and under
Adults travelling to or from Belgium with children aged 17 and under may be asked to provide proof of their relationship to the children they are accompanying at border control. This applies to:
parents
guardians
anyone exercising parental authority
Carry documents with you as proof, for example a birth certificate or court order, particularly if you have a different surname to the children.
If you’re resident in Belgium, see living in Belgium for recommendations on documents to carry if travelling with a child.
Travelling through Calais
If you’re travelling through Calais, check the travel advice for France.
Passport validity requirements
To travel to Belgium, you must follow the Schengen area passport requirements.
To enter Belgium (and all Schengen countries) your passport must:
have a ‘date of issue’ less than 10 years before the date you arrive. Passports issued after 1 October 2018 are now valid for only 10 years, but for passports issued before 1 October 2018, extra months may have been added if you renewed a passport early
have an ‘expiry date’ at least 3 months after the day you plan to leave
Check with your travel provider that your passport and other travel documents meet requirements. Renew your passport if you need to.
You will be denied entry if you do not have a valid travel document or try to use a passport that has been reported lost or stolen.
Checks at border control
Make sure you get your passport stamped.
If you’re a visitor, your passport must be stamped when you enter or leave the Schengen area (which includes Belgium). Border guards will use passport stamps to check you have not overstayed the 90-day visa-free limit for stays in the Schengen area. If your passport was not stamped, border guards will presume you have overstayed the visa-free limit.
If your passport was not stamped, show evidence of when and where you entered or left the Schengen area (for example, boarding passes or tickets) and ask the border guards to add the date and location in your passport.
Read about passport stamping if you live in Belgium.
At Belgian border control, you may also need to:
show a return or onward ticket
show you have enough money for your stay
Visa requirements
You can travel without a visa to the Schengen area (including Belgium) for up to 90 days in any 180-day period. This applies if you travel:
as a tourist
to visit family or friends
to attend business meetings, cultural or sports events
for short-term studies or training
If you’re travelling to Belgium and other Schengen countries without a visa, make sure your whole visit is within the 90-day limit. Visits to Schengen countries in the 180 days before you travel count towards your 90 days.
To stay longer (to work or study, for business travel or for other reasons), you must meet the Belgian government’s entry requirements. Check which type of visa or work permit you need with the Belgian Embassy.
If you stay in Belgium with a residence permit or long-stay visa, this does not count towards your 90-day visa-free limit.
Vaccination requirements (other than COVID-19)
At least 8 weeks before your trip, check the vaccinations and certificates you need in TravelHealthPro’s Belgium guide.
Customs rules
There are strict rules about goods that can be brought into and taken out of Belgium. You must declare anything that may be prohibited or subject to tax or duty.
Taking food into Belgium
You cannot take meat, milk or products containing them into EU countries. There are some exceptions such as powdered baby milk, baby food and special foods or pet feed required for medical reasons.
