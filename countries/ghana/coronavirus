See the TravelHealthPro website for further advice on travel abroad and reducing spread of respiratory viruses during the COVID-19 pandemic.

Kotoka International Airport is open. Commercial flights are operating to and from Ghana. Check with your travel company for the latest information. Land and sea borders have now re-opened. COVID-19 protocols at the airport may be subject to change as the new screening process evolves.
Entry and borders
See Entry requirements to find out what you will need to do when you arrive in Ghana, including COVID-19 requirements.
Returning to the UK
Travelling from and returning to the UK
Check what you must do to travel abroad and return to England, Scotland, Wales or Northern Ireland.
If you plan to pass through another country to return to the UK, check the travel advice for the country you’re transiting.
Prior to March 2022 Ghana required evidence of a pre departure Polymerise Chain Reaction (PCR) COVID test for passengers to be able to leave Ghana by air. This requirement has now been lifted and a test is no required to leave the country. You should continue to check the travel advice for any country you are travelling to or transiting from Ghana.
Departing passengers will undergo temperature screening at the entrance of the airport. If the UK is your final destination, check-in staff will confirm you have everything in place as set out on GOV.UK before allowing you to check in.
Be prepared for your plans to change
No travel is risk-free during COVID. Countries may further restrict travel or bring in new rules at short notice, for example due to a new COVID-19 variant. Check with your travel company or airline for any transport changes which may delay your journey home.
Plan ahead and make sure you:
can access money
understand what your insurance will cover
can make arrangements to extend your stay and be away for longer than planned
Testing positive for COVID-19 whilst in Ghana
Those who test positive and are asymptomatic or have mild symptoms are required to self-isolate at their usual residence in Ghana. This can be private accommodation or at their hotel. Those testing positive with underlying health conditions and/or symptoms will need to go to a government COVID-19 facility or a private health facility accredited by the government for treatment. The self-isolation period is 14 days or until you receive a PCR negative test result.
Entry into a government isolation facility can be arranged in exceptional circumstances although there will likely be a fee.
Travel in Ghana
Domestic flights and public transport systems are operating normally.
Accommodation
All hotels and other rented accommodation are now open and implementing COVID-19 health and safety measures. Contact your chosen accommodation direct to confirm details.
Public spaces and services
The Government of Ghana has eased COVID-19 social restrictions but these can change at short notice. All in-person activities, such as those that take place in churches, mosques, conferences, workshops, private parties, events, cinemas and theatres may operate at full capacity, provided the audience/participants are fully vaccinated.
The Government of Ghana continues to advise that people wash their hands, use hand sanitiser and avoid over-crowded gatherings.
Healthcare in Ghana
The Ghana Ministry of Health advises that if you develop fever, cough or difficulty breathing and recently returned from a COVID-19 affected area or have come into contact with a person confirmed to have COVID-19, you should call any of the following toll-free numbers: 112, +233 50 949 7700 and +233 558 439 868.
Unlike in the UK, you will need to go to a pharmacy to obtain most over-the-counter medicines. Only a very limited selection are available at supermarkets or other stores and you may be offered another brand or a similar generic medicine as an alternative. Where possible, purchase known brands or medicines with a Ghana Food and Drug Administration registration number stamped on the packet. Pharmacies are widely available and are usually identified by a green cross. They will accept prescriptions from the UK.
