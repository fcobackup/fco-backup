Earthquakes
Lebanon is in an earthquake zone, but there have been no damaging tremors in recent years. The US Federal Emergency Management Agency has advice about what to do before, during and after an earthquake.
Forest fires
There is a heightened risk of forest fires in Lebanon, particularly during the summer months. Forest fires are highly dangerous and unpredictable. Take care when visiting or driving through woodland areas. The authorities may evacuate areas and close roads for safety reasons.
If you are travelling in Lebanon, you should familiarise yourself with local safety and emergency procedures, remain vigilant, and follow the advice of the local authorities.
For information on the risk of forest fires, visit the Disaster Risk Management website, Facebook page and Twitter account.
If you see a forest fire, call the emergency services on 125 (for the Fire Brigade, call 175).
