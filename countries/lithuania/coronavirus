Healthcare in Lithuania
If you have symptoms of COVID-19 or have been in contact with a confirmed case within the previous 14 days, call the Lithuanian COVID-19 hotline on +370 37367 963 to request a COVID-19 PCR test. The hotline is open daily between 8am and 11pm. In case of an emergency, call 112.
If you do not have access to a private vehicle, you will need to travel to the testing centre by taxi. You are advised to check at the time of booking whether the taxi company is able to take you to a testing centre, as some taxis may not have the precautions in place to provide this service.
You must self-isolate for 14 days if you have tested positive for COVID-19 or; are known to have had contact with a confirmed COVID-19 case in the previous 14 days. If you are awaiting COVID-19 PCR test results, you must self-isolate until you receive your results, even if you are asymptomatic.
Separate isolation requirements will apply to those arriving in Lithuania from overseas. More information on isolation for arrivals to Lithuania can be found on the Entry requirements page.
While in isolation, you must:
not leave your place of isolation without the permission of a healthcare professional;
not attend public gatherings, shops or public services;
not have guests/visitors;
organise for essential provisions to be delivered by friends, family or delivery services;
consult with a GP by phone/email to arrange extensions to prescriptions;
call the Lithuanian COVID-19 hotline on +370 37367 963 if you display COVID-19 symptoms; and
call the Emergency Response Centre on 112 if your symptoms become severe.
The Lithuanian Government advises against isolating in properties with those who are not isolating. If this is not possible, you should stay in separate, well-ventilated rooms, restrict your movement within the home and minimise use of common spaces.
If you have a pet, but are unable to arrange alternative pet care, you may leave your place of isolation for up to 15 minutes at a time to walk your pet. This exception only applies to individuals who have no COVID-19 symptoms.
Please note that some guidance/restrictions for self-isolation differs for those isolating following arrival from a country deemed high risk, who are not known to have had contact with a confirmed COVID-19 case and have no COVID-19 symptoms. Further information on isolation requirements when arriving from overseas can be found on the Entry Requirements page.
Failure to comply with self-isolation requirements could result in a fine of between 60€ and 1,500€.
British nationals needing to temporarily break isolation may request an exemption from the Lithuanian National Public Health Centre (NVSC). Request should be submitted at least 7 days in advance. Individuals registering for a COVID-19 PCR test through the COVID-19 hotline do not require separate permission to attend the test from the NVSC.
British nationals needing to leave Lithuania before the end of your isolation period in order to return to the UK/your country of residence for medical treatment must inform the NVSC at least 24 hours before departure.
