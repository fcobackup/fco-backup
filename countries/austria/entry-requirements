This page reflects the UK government’s understanding of current rules for people travelling on a full ‘British Citizen’ passport, for the most common types of travel.
The authorities in Austria set and enforce entry rules. For further information contact their embassy, high commission or consulate. You may also check with your transport provider or travel company to make sure your passport and travel documents meet their requirements.
If you are travelling to Austria for work, read the guidance on visas and permits as the rules have changed since 1 January 2021.
Restrictions in response to coronavirus (COVID-19)
Entry to Austria
Entry to Austria from the United Kingdom is currently prohibited by Austrian law.
There are exceptions to this rule, which are explained on the website of the Austrian Embassy in London.
People permitted to enter must:
fill out the Pre Travel Clearance form
take a PCR test not more than 72 hours before departure (an antigen test is not sufficient) and carry proof of the negative test result with them
quarantine for 10 days, with the option of ending quarantine early with another negative PCR test taken no earlier than on day 5 of quarantine. The day of entry counts as day 0
The following individuals are exempt from the quarantine requirement (but must present a negative PCR test and fill out the pre-travel clearance form):
those entering Austria for the purpose of visiting an international organisation based in Austria (eg. United Nations, OSCE)
holders of a Legitimationskarte (i.e. diplomats and their dependents)
those entering for unforeseen urgent family matters (e.g. severe illnesses, death, funerals, births, emergency support for vulnerable people – documentary proof can be required such as a death certificate or hospital letter).
Further details on exemptions (including those for transit passengers, cross-border commuters, and persons who facilitate the transport of goods and passengers) are available (in English) from the Austrian Federal Ministry for Social Affairs, Health, Care and Consumer Protection
Transit Austria
If you are transiting through Austria without a stopover, you do not need a medical certificate or Pre-Travel Clearance form if you can prove you are transiting.
Neighbouring countries may be restricting movement across borders, including for transit, and conducting health checks. Check the travel advice for any country you need to travel through.
Regular entry requirements
Visas
The rules for travelling or working in European countries changed on 1 January 2021:
you can to travel to countries in the Schengen area for up to 90 days in any 180-day period without a visa. This applies if you travel as a tourist, to visit family or friends, to attend business meetings, cultural or sports events, or for short-term studies or training
if you are travelling to Austria and other Schengen countries without a visa, make sure your whole visit is within the 90-day limit. Visits to Schengen countries within the previous 180 days before you travel count towards your 90 days
to stay longer, to work or study, for business or for other reasons, you will need to meet the Austrian government’s entry requirements. Check with the Austrian Embassy what type of visa and/or work permit you may need
if you stay in Austria with a residence permit or long-stay visa, this does not count towards your 90-day visa-free limit
Any time you spent in Austria or other Schengen countries before 1 January 2021 does not count towards your 90-day visa-free limit.
At Austrian border control, you may need to use separate lanes from EU, EEA and Swiss citizens when queueing. Your passport may be stamped on entry and exit. You may also need to:
show a return or onward ticket
show you have enough money for your stay
There are separate requirements for those who are resident in Austria. If you are resident in Austria, you should carry proof of residence as well as your valid passport when you travel. For further information on these requirements, see our Living in Austria guide.
Passport validity
Check your passport is valid for travel before you book your trip, and renew your passport if you do not have enough time left on it.
Make sure your passport is:
valid for at least 3 months after the day you plan to leave Austria, or any other Schengen country
less than 10 years old
The 3 months you need when leaving a country must be within 10 years of the passport issue date.
If you renewed your current passport before the previous one expired, extra months may have been added to its expiry date. Any extra months on your passport over 10 years may not count towards the minimum 3 months needed.
Travelling with children
If you are a single parent, or travelling with a child who is not your own, you will need documentary evidence of parental responsibility and a letter of consent. For further information on exactly what will be required at immigration contact the Austrian Embassy in London.
UK Emergency Travel Documents
UK Emergency Travel Documents are accepted for entry, airside transit and exit from Austria.
