Warning
FCDO advises against all travel to parts of Congo.

Before you travel check that:
your destination can provide the healthcare you may need
you have appropriate travel insurance for local treatment or unexpected medical evacuation
This is particularly important if you have a health condition or are pregnant.
Emergency medical number
There’s no central number for emergency services. Check for local medical facilities and carry contact details with you.
Contact your insurance company quickly if you’re referred to a medical facility for treatment.
Health risks and recommended vaccines
Check TravelHealthPro’s current advice on the Republic of Congo to find out how to reduce the health risks you’ll face there.
TravelHealthPro also lists the recommended vaccines that could apply to you. At least 8 weeks before you travel, check how to get vaccines and whether you have to pay on the NHS travel vaccinations page.
Medication
The legal status and regulation of some medicines prescribed or bought in the UK can be different in other countries.
If you take medication, bring enough for your time in the Republic of Congo and make sure it is clearly labelled. Bring a copy of any prescription.
Read best practice when travelling with medicines on TravelHealthPro.
The NHS has information on whether you can take your medicine abroad.
Healthcare facilities in the Republic of Congo  
Medical facilities in the country are limited, particularly in rural areas. Medical evacuation is likely to be necessary for all but the most basic treatments. If you become ill while in the Republic of Congo or straight after leaving the country, get immediate medical advice.
Make sure you have adequate travel and medical insurance to cover the cost of any medical treatment abroad and repatriation; this should specifically include the very high costs of evacuation by air ambulance.
FCDO has a list of medical providers in the Republic of Congo where some staff will speak English.
Travel and mental health
Read FCDO guidance on travel and mental health. There is also mental health guidance on TravelHealthPro.
