Financial assistance
You will need to pay for your return travel to the UK. If departure options are available but you cannot afford the travel costs and have exhausted all other options for getting funds, you may be eligible to apply for an emergency loan from the government. This is a last resort option and you would need to repay the loan when you are back in the UK. For more information, you should contact Corporate Travel Management (CTM). CTM are a commercial partner of the FCO and are authorised to administer such loans on behalf of the FCO.
Travelling to the airport
There are no restrictions on travelling to the airport either from within Phnom Penh or from the provinces.
Your journey home: re-entering the UK
When you return, you must follow the rules for entering the UK. You:

are not allowed to leave the place you’re staying for the first 14 days you’re in the UK except in very limited situations (known as ‘self-isolating’)

The National Travel Health Network and Centre (NaTHNaC) also provides advice on how to stay safe as you travel by air.
