This section has safety advice for regions of Kyrgyzstan. It only covers regions where FCDO has specific advice.
You should also read FCDO’s overall travel advice and safety and security advice.
Osh and Jalal-Abad provinces
Stay aware of your surroundings if you travel to the provinces (‘oblasts’) of Osh and Jalal-Abad. While there has been no widespread violence since 2010, there are still underlying tensions.
Tajikistan-Kyrgyzstan border, including Batken Province
There is a risk of conflict over recognition of Kyrgyzstan’s border with Tajikistan. There are regular security incidents along the border with exchanges of gunfire.
In September 2022,  armed conflict between the Kyrgyz and Tajik militaries resulted in over 100 deaths, including civilians. There was significant destruction of civilian property and infrastructure. Around 140,000 civilians were displaced. There is a risk of further violence and border closures at any time.
Uzbekistan-Kyrgyzstan border 
There are occasional violent incidents on Kyrgyzstan’s border with Uzbekistan. There is a risk of landmines in uncontrolled Uzbekistan-Kyrgyzstan border areas.
Border crossings
Check local media reports before you travel to see which border posts are open. Only use officially recognised border crossings. Borders can close at short notice, particularly the Tajikistan-Kyrgyzstan border near the Vorukh enclave.
