Travelling to the airport
You can travel from your accommodation to the airport if you have a valid plane ticket and are not showing any symptoms of coronavirus.
You need to complete an electronic ‘sworn statement’ form within 48 hours of leaving, self-certifying that you are not suffering from symptoms associated with coronavirus and that you have not been in contact with confirmed cases in the preceding fortnight.
You are only allowed to arrive at the airport within 5 hours of your flight departing.
On 15 October the government of Argentina announced the resumption of limited domestic commercial flights, long distance trains and buses. The use of these means of transport is restricted to essential workers, those in need of medical treatment, to reunite with family and, to travel to an international airport if you have a valid plane ticket to leave Argentina. You will need a valid permit to circulate, known as a “Certificado Único de Circulación”. Non-resident foreign nationals will have to fill in the form confirming you are not an Argentine ID (DNI) holder, the reason for travel “Traslado hacia pasos fronterizos terrestres, puertos, y aeropuertos habilitados (egresos) and fill in the “Observation” box with full details of your confirmed international flight. Once the form has been fully completed you will have to allow approximately 2 hours before entering the site again to download or print you permit which you must carry with you at all times. Each province might have additional requirements to enter or transit.
You no longer require any further documentation issued by the British Embassy in order to leave Argentina.
