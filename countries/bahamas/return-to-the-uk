Air
There are currently extremely limited commercial options available to return to the UK from The Bahamas. Due to the travel restrictions there are no direct flights to the UK or Europe. Severely limited options may be possible via other destinations such as the US, but you should refer to those countries’ restrictions before travelling to ensure that you will be allowed to enter the country for onward connection. Travellers should contact their airlines, travel agents and tour operators for advice. British Airways have advised that they do not plan to resume flights to Nassau until 1 June. Affected BA customers will be notified of their flight cancellations with status update messages and can call the BA Contact Centre on: 1 877 767 7970 to rebook; or go to www.ba.com
The US Embassy provide regular updates on limited flight services to the US where transit to the UK may be possible. They are advising that the flight departures to the US are not guaranteed and subject to cancellation at short notice. See travel advice for the USA for details of eligibility to transit the US and other restrictions.
Sea
The restrictions on movement also apply to maritime travel. Inter-island travel is banned. Foreign pleasure craft currently anchored or moored in The Bahamas are only allowed to travel to leave Bahamian waters and the Bahamian government is encouraging boats to depart. For those wishing to leave the Bahamas the Association of Bahamas Marinas can provide further advice and a list of marinas helping boaters. You should visit their Facebook page for more information. Other providers may be also available. For those wishing to remain on board their vessels, the Bahamian government has produced guidance on resupply and refuelling by remote means and that disembarking vessels is not allowed. Conditions may vary across the islands on The Bahamas. For exemptions or further advice the Bahamian government have designated the following contacts:

Future options
The UK operated a special flight from Nassau on Tuesday 7 April for British tourists, short term visitors and their direct dependants to return to the UK.
Further special flights of this kind are not planned. The British High Commission Nassau is in contact with airlines, the Bahamian authorities and other governments to make sure commercial options for returning to the UK are available as soon as possible.
You will need to pay for your return travel to the UK. If departure options are available but you cannot afford the travel costs and have exhausted all other options for getting funds, you may be eligible to apply for an emergency loan from the government. This is a last resort option and you would need to repay the loan when you are back in the UK. For more information, you should contact Corporate Travel Management (CTM). CTM are a commercial partner of the FCO and are authorised to administer such loans on behalf of the FCO.
If you cannot leave The Bahamas at this time, you should:
follow the advice of local authorities, including local measures to help minimise your risk of exposure to coronavirus
find accommodation that’s suitable for your needs
keep in regular contact with family and friends at home, so they know you are safe and well
See more information and advice about staying where you are if you cannot return to the UK.
Arrival in the UK
When you arrive back in the UK, follow the guidance for when you return to the UK on steps you should take to protect yourself and others.
