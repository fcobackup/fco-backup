For the purposes of entry into the Solomon Islands, the proof of vaccination is required to be in the form of:
A vaccine card (yellow card) or other documentation that lists the measles vaccine as having been administered at any date prior to the 15 days stipulated, or in childhood. The proof of vaccination also includes a medical certificate from a recognised medical practitioner or hospital that states the traveller is protected from measles due to a past infection or immunisation with measles vaccine;
A medical certificate from a recognised medical practitioner/hospital that states a travellers blood test confirms the presence of measles antibodies or that the test is reactive for measles.
These requirements are not applicable for infants under 6 months of age, pregnant women and persons where there is evidence of contraindications for vaccine administration such as immune deficiency and allergies.
