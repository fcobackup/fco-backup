There is an ongoing outbreak of coronavirus in China and elsewhere in the region, including Hong Kong. The Hong Kong SAR Government has announced a series of measures designed to prevent the spread of the virus. These measures include the suspension or scaling back of flights, trains, ferries and buses between Hong Kong and mainland China, and the closure of most border crossings.
Expect increased health screening measures, including temperature checks, on entry to and departure from Hong Kong. All passengers arriving in Hong Kong will be required to complete and submit a health declaration form.
There are a number of restrictions in place depending on your travel in the 14 days prior to entering Hong Kong. These are:
A 14-day mandatory home quarantine period for anyone who has been to mainland China in the previous 14 days. Non-Hong Kong residents who have been in South Korea in the previous 14 days will be denied entry.
From 14 March, anyone who has travelled to France (Bourgogne-Franche-Comte and Grand Est), Germany (North Rhine-Westphalia), Japan (Hokkaido) or Spain (La Rioja, Madrid, Pais Vasco) in the past 14 days will have to stay in a Hong Kong quarantine centre.
Anyone who has been to Iran, or the Emilia-Romagna, Lombardy or Veneto regions of Italy in the past 14 days, will be required to stay in a Hong Kong quarantine centre. These measures will be extended to the whole of Italy from 14 March. See Health

Since June 2019, large-scale political demonstrations have taken place throughout the Hong Kong Special Administrative Region (SAR), including in areas popular with tourists. While a number of peaceful activities have taken place, many other protests have led to clashes between police and protesters involving significant violence.
The situation around protests and public gatherings can change quickly, with the potential for violence, especially during unauthorised protests. If you’re in an area where demonstrations are taking place, you should remain vigilant, follow the advice of local authorities and move away quickly to a safe place. Previous demonstrations have led to sections of the city being closed off and temporary suspension of public transport without warning. For further safety and security information surrounding protests, see Political situation
Some Mass Transit Railway (MTR) metro stations, including in major tourist areas, have been closed due to damage caused by protests. You should check the MTR and Hong Kong Transport Department websites when planning travel around Hong Kong.
