This page reflects the UK government’s understanding of current rules for people travelling on a full ‘British Citizen’ passport from the UK, for the most common types of travel.
The authorities in Qatar set and enforce entry rules.
All travellers
A list of countries subject to ‘COVID-19 Red Health Measures’ can be found on the Ministry of Public Health website. The UK is not currently subject to these measures.
Before travelling to Qatar, visitors must have registered via the Ministry of Public Health’s pre-registration platform. Visitors who hold either the NHS UK COVID Pass app or the EU COVPass app (the EU digital COVID Certificate) are exempt from the requirement to pre-register.
Visitors should also download the Ehteraz app and activate this on arrival, through the use of either a local or international sim card. You will also be asked to complete and sign an ‘undertaking and acknowledgement form’ prior to arrival. This form is available on the Ministry of Public Health website, pre-registration platform, and airline online booking form.
British nationals holding a Qatar residence permit no longer require prior approval to return to Qatar. However, it is recommended that all residents complete pre-registration for return to Qatar using the pre-registration platform ahead of travel.
The Ministry of Public Health reserves the right to conduct random tests on travellers to Qatar through its air, land or sea ports. Thermal screening and temperature checks will take place on arrival.
Downloading Qatar’s track and trace app, Ehteraz, is mandatory for everyone in Qatar. You will be asked to show the app upon arrival.
