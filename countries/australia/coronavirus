Travel in Australia
There are currently relatively few flights between States and Territories. If you need to travel, book in advance.
Travel between most States and Territories within Australia is currently restricted, though some restrictions are easing. You should check individual States and Territories websites for the latest information, including on whether you need to apply for an exemption to cross borders.
Exemptions are not needed for air transit if the flight originated elsewhere in Australia (for example flying from one State to another domestically to connect to an international flight back to the UK).
Some States and Territories still have restrictions on intrastate travel to areas within their jurisdiction. You should check the individual State and Territory websites for further information.
Travelling to your international airport
If you are already in Australia, you may travel by air to another Australian State to transit to an international flight as long as you hold a confirmed booking for that flight. You do not need to seek an exemption. You will be required to stay within the airport for the duration of your transit, or if transiting overnight, you will need to self-isolate in a hotel. In Western Australia, your transit time must be no more than 24 hours.
Some States require you to apply for an exemption to cross their borders. Given the fast changing situation, you should check State and Territory websites for the latest information. Links can be found on the Australian Government Coronavirus website.
Public spaces and services
Social distancing restrictions and other local measures are still in place across Australia with a number of variations. These are liable to change at short notice. You should monitor State and Territory websites for the latest information where you are and comply with these measures and other advice from local authorities.
Measures currently include:
restrictions on numbers of people at most non-work gatherings, in shops, cafes, restaurants and other places of public gathering, and on visitors to private residences
all members of the public are to keep at least 1.5 meters distance from others
restrictions on entering aged care homes
limits on local travel and advice to avoid public transport at peak hours

While you are in Australia, you can access essential and urgent medical care through the UK-Australia Reciprocal Healthcare Agreement. Guidance of what is covered can be found on the NHS website.
Essential and urgent hospital treatment is free. There is a charge to visit GPs and receive prescriptions. Some of these costs can be recovered through Medicare – Australia’s universal health insurance scheme. To enrol with Medicare visit the Services Australia website.
You should also check your travel insurance, which may cover the full sum of your treatment or prescriptions.
If you are concerned about seeking medical treatment in person, many clinics offer distance or online services to avoid face-to-face contact. A directory of clinics/GP’s that offer this service can be found on the Online Doctors Directory. Please note this is not an official government directory as there is no Federal level directory for Australia.
