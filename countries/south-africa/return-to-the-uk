South African airspace is closed to commercial airlines as part of efforts to contain the spread of coronavirus (COVID-19). International commercial passenger flights are unlikely to resume for some time.
Land borders to neighbouring countries are closed except for trade.
Between 23 May and 4 June, the UK government in partnership with British Airways operated repatriation charter flights for British travellers in South Africa to return to the UK. We are not planning any further UK government repatriation flights from South Africa.
Future options
Some other countries are still organising repatriation flights, which British nationals may use to get connecting flights to the UK. This travel advice will be updated when departure options become available. We will share details on our social media channels @UkinSouthAfrica for such flights where British nationals are eligible to travel and there are onward connections to the UK. Sign up for travel advice email alerts and follow the British High Commission on Twitter.
If you have a flight ticket to go to the UK, the South African authorities have said you will need a letter from the British High Commission to enable you to travel to the assembly point for your flight. If you need such a letter, please email your name, passport number and flight ticket details to SouthAfricaBritishNationalReturns@fco.gov.uk.
You will also need the permission of the South African authorities if you want to return to the UK by private plane or boat. You should make your request via the British High Commission. Email details of your planned journey and your passenger details to SouthAfricaBritishNationalReturns@fco.gov.uk at least 10 working days prior to your date of travel.
You will need to pay for your return travel to the UK. If departure options are available but you cannot afford the travel costs and have exhausted all other options for getting funds, you may be eligible to apply for an emergency loan from the government. This is a last resort option.
Whilst still in South Africa, you should continue to follow any regulations set out by the South African government during the lockdown.
Your journey home: re-entering the UK
When you return, you must follow the rules for entering the UK. You:
need to provide your journey and contact details up to 48 hours before you’re due to arrive in the UK
are not allowed to leave the place you’re staying for the first 14 days you’re in the UK except in very limited situations (known as ‘self-isolating’)
See also the list of people who are exempt from the border rules.
The National Travel Health Network and Centre (NaTHNaC) also provides advice on how to stay safe as you travel by air.
