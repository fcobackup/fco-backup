This page has information on travelling to Namibia. Check what you must do to return to the UK.
This page reflects the UK government’s understanding of current rules for people travelling on a full ‘British Citizen’ passport from the UK, for the most common types of travel.
The authorities in Namibia set and enforce entry rules. You should check with your airline if they have any regulations that must be followed which may differ from the Namibian requirements, particularly with regards to proof of vaccination status and PCR test requirements.
All travellers
All travellers should familiarise themselves with the entry rules for Namibia before travel.
If you’re fully vaccinated
Fully vaccinated travellers are not required to produce a negative PCR test result on arrival.
Proof of vaccination status
You must present an authentic valid vaccination card at the point of entry.
Residents of Namibia
Fully vaccinated Namibians and permanent residence permit holders must show a valid and authentic vaccination certificate on arrival. Unvaccinated Namibians and permanent residence holders must produce a negative PCR test result – not older than 72 hours calculated from the time that the sample was taken – to enter Namibia. You should check with your airline for any regulations they might have for a negative test result in order to travel.
If you’re not fully vaccinated
You must show a negative PCR test result, not older than 72 hours calculated from the time the sample was taken, in order to enter Namibia.
If you’ve had COVID-19 in the past year
Any person who was previously infected with COVID-19 who cannot produce a valid vaccination certificate, and who isolated but is still testing positive, must present a valid de-isolation certificate. The certificate must be no older than 3 months from the date of discharge of isolation, and must have been issued by the health authority in the country of departure.
Children and young people
Children, aged 11 and under, do not need to show a valid vaccination certificate in order to enter Namibia. See Travelling with children (under 18) section below for more information.
If you’re transiting through Namibia
Transiting is when you pass through one country on the way to your final destination.
The rules for transiting Namibia are the same as for entry into Namibia.
Exemptions
There are no exemptions to Namibia’s entry requirements.
HGV drivers
HGV drivers from the UK entering Namibia must present a valid vaccination certificate.
Check your passport and travel documents before you travel
Passport validity
Your passport should be valid for a minimum period of 6 months from the date of entry into Namibia and have at least 1 completely blank page for Namibian immigration to use. If you are also going to travel in South Africa, you should be aware that although South African authorities state they require 1 blank passport page for entry, some officials insist on 2 blank pages. If you plan to take this route, make sure you have a total of 3 blank pages.
Check with your travel provider to make sure your passport and other travel documents meet their requirements.
Visas
Although British nationals can enter Namibia for a holiday or private visit of up to 90 days without a visa, there have been cases where visitors have only been given permission to stay for periods much shorter than 90 days, sometimes as short as only 7 or 10 days. Before leaving the immigration desk in the airport arrivals hall, check that you have been given permission to stay in Namibia for the duration of your intended visit up to the maximum allowable of 90 days and that you have been given a correctly dated entry stamp by Namibian Immigration officials, as this will be checked on departure. Overstaying the time granted or an incorrect or missing entry stamp could lead to detention, arrest and a fine. If you intend to work (which includes volunteering) or stay in Namibia for a period of more than 90 days, you must get a visa from the Namibian High Commission in London before you travel.
Travelling with children (under 18)
Namibia introduced new immigration rules in 2016 relating to travel with children. In addition to valid passports, parents travelling with children (under 18) should at all times carry the original or certified copy of the unabridged birth certificate. The full unabridged birth certificate should list the child’s details and both parents’ details. The abridged (short) birth certificate which only lists the child’s particulars won’t be accepted by the Namibian Ministry of Home Affairs and Immigration.
Adults travelling with children where they are not the biological or legal guardians of those children, should be in possession of an affidavit statement from the child’s parents giving consent for their travel. If a child is travelling with only one parent, the other parent should give consent for travel in the form of an affidavit.
Unaccompanied children may be required to provide in addition to a valid passport:
proof of consent from one or both parents/legal guardians in the form of an affidavit
a letter from the person receiving the child including their residential address where the child will be staying
Contact your nearest Namibian High Commission if you have any specific questions about your trip.
If your child was born in the UK, you can order a full unabridged birth certificate online via GOV.UK.
Travelling with children via a South African airport
If you’re transiting through a South African airport with children, see our South Africa travel advice page for information and advice about the documents you’ll need to carry.
Yellow fever certificate requirements
Check whether you need a yellow fever certificate by visiting the National Travel Health Network and Centre’s TravelHealthPro website.
UK Emergency Travel Documents
UK Emergency Travel Documents (ETDs) are valid for entry into, transit and exit from Namibia. Your ETD should be valid for a period of at least 6 months from the date of entry into Namibia.
