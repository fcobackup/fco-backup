Travel in Hong Kong
There are local travel restrictions in place upon arrival in Hong Kong including mandatory quarantine. Hong Kong residents are being asked to work from home where possible and avoid social gatherings.
It is possible that you may be mandatorily tested and/or placed in a government quarantine centre, if you are identified as a close contact of someone who has tested positive for coronavirus. In some cases, all residents of a building where a positive case has been detected have been sent to quarantine centres for 21 days.
For all quarantine arrangements in Hong Kong:
you are not permitted to leave your designated quarantine location for 21 days. This means you are also unable to leave Hong Kong for the duration of the quarantine
if you are sent to a government quarantine centre, you may be asked to contribute around HK$200 (£20) per night towards the cost
items that can be taken in to government quarantine are restricted. There is no smoking allowed and no alcohol. Depending on your centre, facilities may be basic: there may be no fridge and no air-conditioning
Public spaces and services
Public gatherings have been restricted to a maximum of 4 people (members of the same household are exempt). The operations of various businesses, including restaurants and bars, have been limited.
The government has also introduced a mandatory requirement to wear face masks in all public spaces, including on public transport. Failure to comply may result in a fine of up to 5000 HKD.
For up to date information, you should follow the guidance from the Hong Kong authorities.

The Hong Kong SAR Government’s national vaccination programme began on 26 February. British Nationals resident in Hong Kong are eligible to take part. You should visit the national vaccination programme website for further details and information on how to book an appointment.
The Medicines and Healthcare Products Regulatory Agency (MHRA) is the UK authority responsible for assessing the safety, quality and efficacy of vaccines.
