This information is for people travelling on a full ‘British citizen’ passport from the UK. It is based on the UK government’s understanding of the current rules for the most common types of travel.
The authorities in Singapore set and enforce entry rules. If you’re not sure how these requirements apply to you, contact the Singapore High Commission in the UK.
COVID-19 rules
There are no COVID-19 testing or vaccination requirements for travellers entering Singapore. 
Passport validity requirements
To enter Singapore, your passport must have an ‘expiry date’ 6 months after the date you arrive.
Check with your travel provider that your passport and other travel documents meet requirements. Renew your passport if you need to.
You will be denied entry if you do not have a valid travel document or try to use a passport that has been reported lost or stolen.
If you are resident in Singapore, there is no minimum passport validity required. Apply for a renewal before your passport expires.
Dual nationality
Singapore does not recognise dual nationality beyond the age of 21. A citizen of Singapore is required by Singapore law to renounce any other nationalities before the age of 22 in order to retain their Singaporean citizenship.
Visa requirements
You can visit Singapore without a visa for tourism or business. The Immigration and Checkpoints Authority decides who can enter Singapore and how long they can stay. The period of stay permitted is at the discretion of the immigration officer. It is normally between 14 and 30 days for British citizens.
Penalties for overstaying
Penalties for overstaying the time allowed include fines, imprisonment, caning and deportation depending on how long you have overstayed. When you leave Singapore, officials can take your fingerprints if they suspect you are involved in any crime.
Checks at border control
You must complete an electronic SG Arrival Card in the 3 days before you arrive in Singapore. This online form asks for travel details and a health declaration. It is illegal to submit a false declaration. Biometric information is also recorded and scanned when you enter and depart Singapore (iris, face and fingerprints).
Screening for drugs
You can be screened for drugs in your system on arrival in Singapore, including if you’re in transit. You can be charged with drug consumption even if the drugs were taken in another country, including countries where the use of that particular drug is legal.
You could be detained without trial and, if convicted, you could be imprisoned, caned or executed.
Ship’s crew
There are different entry requirements if you are crew working on ships, small vessels, or pleasure crafts arriving at one of Singapore’s ports or marinas.
Vaccine requirements
To enter Singapore, you must have a certificate to prove you’ve had a yellow fever vaccination if you’re coming from a country listed as a transmission risk. If you arrive from one of these countries without a certificate, the authorities may put you in mandatory quarantine or refuse you entry to Singapore.
For full details about medical entry requirements and recommended vaccinations, see TravelHealthPro’s Singapore guide.
Accommodation
There are strict laws that prevent accommodation being used for short-term rental, including for tourists.
Customs rules
There are strict rules about goods you can take into or out of Singapore. You must declare anything that may be prohibited or subject to tax or duty.
It’s illegal to import controlled drugs. If convicted, you could be imprisoned, caned or executed.
The following items are also illegal to bring into Singapore:
vaporisers and e-cigarettes
tobacco products that are chewed or injected
chewing gum to sell
weapons and ammunition (including empty cartridge cases and air guns)
replica guns, including lighters shaped like a pistol or revolver
radio communications equipment
See the complete list of prohibited items on the Singapore Customs website.
