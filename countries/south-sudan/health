Visit your health professional at least 4 to 6 weeks before your trip to check whether you need any vaccinations or other preventive measures. Country specific information and advice is published by the National Travel Health Network and Centre on the TravelHealthPro website and by NHS (Scotland) on the fitfortravel website. Useful information and advice about healthcare abroad is also available on the NHS Choices website.
There have been outbreaks of cholera in Juba and other parts of South Sudan, including the Protection of Civilians camp in the capital. For more information and advice see the website of the National Travel Health Network and Centre and contact your GP if you need further advice. If youâ€™re in South Sudan, you can call 777 to seek emergency help and you can report suspected cases of the disease to 0955 66 81 48.
Health facilities are extremely limited - especially outside Juba. Serious medical problems require medical evacuation to Nairobi or Kampala. During the rainy season flights are often forced to remain on the ground for hours.
Make sure you have adequate travel health insurance and accessible funds to cover the cost of any treatment abroad, medical evacuation and repatriation.
