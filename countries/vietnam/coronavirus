The Vietnamese authorities have issued information on testing facilities and procedures (only available in Vietnamese). The testing facilities can be contacted directly.
International travel
Commercial flights to and from Vietnam remain limited, but from 1 January 2022 Vietnam has resumed some international commercial flights on selected routes. A number of airline websites allow online booking from Vietnam. However, check carefully in advance whether these flights are guaranteed to fly, whether they are passenger flights and whether you are able to book the return journey to Vietnam.
Flights and transit arrangements are still prone to changes and cancellation with little notice.
You should check with your travel agent or airline before travelling for any last minute change and/or additional travel requirements.
There are some restrictions on airside transit at airports you may transit when travelling to and from Vietnam. You should check in advance to ensure you will be able to transit, particularly transit times, visa and transit visa requirements and whether your baggage can be transferred airside at transit points.
Entry and borders
See Entry requirements to find out what you will need to do when you arrive in Vietnam.
Returning to the UK
Travelling from and returning to the UK
Check what you must do to travel abroad and return to England, Scotland, Wales or Northern Ireland.
If you plan to pass through another country to return to the UK, check the travel advice for the country you’re transiting.
Be prepared for your plans to change
No travel is risk-free during COVID-19. Countries may further restrict travel or bring in new rules at short notice, for example due to a new COVID-19 variant. Check with your travel company or airline for any transport and/or rule changes which may delay your journey home.
If you test positive for COVID-19, you may need to stay where you are until you test negative. You may also need to seek treatment there.
Plan ahead and make sure you:
can access money
understand what your insurance will cover
can make arrangements to extend your stay and be away for longer than planned
Domestic travel
Air Travel
COVID-19 prevention measures vary depending on where you start your journey and your destination. You should check with your travel provider on the status of your flight and prevention measures in place at your destination and/or on return, before travelling.
Passengers who reside in level 4 areas (Red zones) or lockdown areas must present a negative COVID-test (quick test or RTPCR) taken no longer than 72 hours before boarding.
Inter-province public transport
Transport services may be cancelled or suspended at short notice. You should check with your travel provider on travel restrictions and any COVID-19 prevention measures in place at your destination and/or on return.
Public spaces and services
The measures to combat COVID-19 vary from province to province and can change at short notice. Vietnam has introduced a colour-coded categorisation to identify high risk COVID areas across Vietnam. These categories can vary between provinces and within cities. The categories are: Red (very high risk), Orange (high risk), Yellow (medium risk) and Green (normal). The Vietnamese authorities regularly review the categorisations. Restrictions will differ depending on the categorisation of particular districts within cities. You should be ready to comply with local authorities.
You should also ensure that you have your ID/passport with you. Before travelling to another province you should check with your travel provider and/or accommodation what requirements are in place, both where you are travelling to and on return. Some provinces may require negative COVID-19 tests to be obtained before and/or after entry and some may impose periods of self-isolation. Social distancing rules remain in place in many places across Vietnam and you should follow these strictly. Mask wearing is compulsory in public settings. Those not wearing masks may be liable to spot fines.
Hanoi
Restrictions within Hanoi can vary between districts depending on colour-coded categorisations designated by the local authorities. The Hanoi local authorities review these categorisations weekly. You should be alert to changes and be ready to comply with restrictions put in place.
Ho Chi Minh City
You should install on your phone the PC-Covid App and register your travel. You should also carry other proof of your vaccinations.
There may be local variations so you should talk to your landlord or local ward authorities or resident group (tổ dân phố) for details as to what restrictions are in place in your area.
Residents should ensure they have their medical declaration QR code with them at all times. If you experience COVID-19 symptoms you should report to your local Ward Response Team or call 115
Healthcare in Vietnam
If you think you have COVID-19 symptoms, you should go immediately to a local doctor or hospital.
For contact details for English speaking doctors, visit our lists of healthcare providers for Hanoi and northern provinces of Vietnam or Ho Chi Minh City and southern provinces of Vietnam.

Testing and self-isolation/quarantine
If you are asked to undertake testing, you should comply. Failure to comply can be an offence with significant punishments.
Self-isolation periods and testing requirements can change at short notice and may vary between locations.
If you test positive with COVID-19 you will have to self-isolate for 7 days. Most provinces permit self-isolation at your place of residence if it meets the requirements of local authorities, but you may be required to self-isolate in a designated quarantine centre or hotel.
If you become a close contact of someone with COVID-19 and you are fully vaccinated, you will have to self-isolate for 5 days, at your place of residence.
COVID-19 vaccines if you live in Vietnam
We will update this page when the Government of Vietnam announces new information on the national vaccination programme. You can sign up to get email notifications when this page is updated.
The Vietnamese vaccination programme started in March 2021. Currently approved by the Vietnamese Government for use in Vietnam are the AstraZeneca, Pfizer-BioNTech, Moderna, Janssen (Johnson & Johnson), Sinopharm, Sputnik V, Hayat-Vax and Abdala vaccines.
Depending on vaccine availability Vietnam has approved the combination of vaccines:
First dose Second dose Third dose
AstraZeneca AstraZeneca / Pfizer / Moderna AstraZeneca / Pfizer / Moderna
Pfizer Pfizer / Moderna Pfizer / Moderna
Moderna Moderna / Pfizer Pfizer / Moderna
Sinopharm Sinopharm Sinopharm / Pfizer / Moderna / AstraZeneca
Sputnik V Sputnik V Sputnik V / Pfizer / Moderna
The Vietnamese authorities have confirmed that foreign residents will be offered vaccines as part of the national vaccination programme, in line with Vietnam’s priority groups, if they choose to join the programme. You should also check if your employer has their own vaccination programme and check our social media for updates on vaccination availability.
If you are over 18, you can register for vaccination in Vietnam (website in English and Vietnamese) on the Vietnamese National Vaccine Registration Portal or download the e-health app (in Vietnamese only), after which you will receive instructions on how to register for vaccination. Additionally, you can register offline through your local residence group (Tổ dân phố) who will be involved in organising local vaccinations. Please talk to your landlord, local ward authorities, or local residence group for details, as these may differ according to your ward.
If you are aged above 65 or with underlying health conditions, you may be required to be vaccinated in hospital rather than a non-hospital setting.
