Coronavirus travel health
Check the latest information on risk from COVID-19 for Serbia on the TravelHealthPro website.
See the TravelHealthPro website for further advice on travel abroad and reducing spread of respiratory viruses during the COVID-19 pandemic.

See Entry requirements to find out what you will need to do when you arrive in Serbia.
Be prepared for your plans to change
No travel is risk-free during COVID-19. Countries may further restrict travel or bring in new rules at short notice, for example due to a new COVID-19 variant. Check with your travel company or airline for any transport changes which may delay your journey home.
If you test positive for coronavirus while in Serbia, you will be required to self-isolate at an address of your choosing for at least 7 days, likely a hotel or private residence, at your own cost. You may be contacted by the authorities and be hospitalised if deemed medically necessary. Minors will be subject to the same regulations as adults.
Plan ahead and make sure you:
can access money
understand what your insurance will cover
can make arrangements to extend your stay and be away for longer than planned
Public spaces and services
Protective face masks are mandatory in medical facilities. Failure to wear a mask when required will incur a fine.
Additional rules and penalties vary in different towns and cities, and rules can change rapidly. You should follow the latest local guidance and check news outlets regularly for up to date information.
Further restrictions may be introduced, both nationwide and locally, including at short notice. Infringements of these procedures may result in fines and/or a prison sentence.
Healthcare in Serbia
The Serbian healthcare system is under increased pressure across the country due to COVID-19. It may be more difficult than usual to access satisfactory healthcare for any medical issue, including COVID-19.
The Serbian Ministry of Health website gives up to date information on the number of coronavirus cases confirmed and tests carried out in Serbia. It includes regional data maps. This website also includes helpline telephone numbers.
