Terrorists are very likely to try to carry out attacks in Chad. Attacks could be indiscriminate, including in places visited by foreigners. There’s a threat of retaliatory attacks following the French intervention in Mali and due to Chad’s involvement in the regional fight to counter Boko Haram. There is a heightened threat of kidnap in Chad. See Terrorism
