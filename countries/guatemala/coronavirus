International travel
You must keep to the social distancing rules and wear a mask at all times, in all public spaces, including the airport.
Guatemala does not permit the entry of travellers who have been in the United Kingdom, Brazil or South Africa in the 14 days prior to their arrival. This measure does not apply to Guatemalan nationals, diplomats or foreign nationals legally resident in the country who instead must self-isolate for a period of 10 days at their place of residence upon return.
All persons aged 10 or over arriving in Guatemala must present a negative COVID-19 PCR or Antigen test, dated no more than 72 hours prior to check in at the airport, or arrival at land border. Airlines will request proof of a negative test prior to boarding. Health protocols are in effect at ports of entry for the screening of arriving and departing passengers. Non-resident foreigners presenting symptoms of COVID-19 upon arrival may be denied entry into Guatemala. Please see Entry Requirements for more information
You should stay informed before making any travel plans by confirming with your airlines and checking the Guatemalan Government website [in Spanish].
Entry and borders
See Entry requirements to find out what you will need to do when you arrive in Guatemala.
Returning to the UK
When you return, you must follow the rules for entering the UK.
You are responsible for organising your own COVID-19 test, in line with UK government testing requirements. You should contact local authorities for information on testing facilities (only available in Spanish).
Be prepared for your plans to change
No travel is risk-free during COVID-19. Countries may further restrict travel or bring in new rules at short notice, for example due to a new COVID-19 variant. Check with your travel company or airline for any transport changes which may delay your journey home.
If you test positive for COVID-19, you may need to stay where you are until you test negative. You may also need to seek treatment there.
Plan ahead and make sure you:
can access money
understand what your insurance will cover
can make arrangements to extend your stay and be away for longer than planned
