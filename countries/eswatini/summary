The FCDO advises against all but essential travel to:
the whole of Eswatini based on the current assessment of COVID-19 risks.
Travel is subject to entry restrictions.
Visitors from the United Kingdom are allowed to travel to Eswatini under specific conditions:
A COVID-19 test must be performed no more than 72 hours before departure and you must be able to demonstrate a negative test result on entry.
Upon arriving in Eswatini, you will be screened for COVID-19 symptoms and asked about your country of origin and any transit stops.
If you do not present a negative COVID-19 result on entry, or if you display COVID-19 symptoms, you will be required to take a COVID-19 test on arrival at your own cost.
You may be required to undergo a quarantine period not exceeding 14 days or isolation as advised by the port health officers.
See Entry requirements for more information before you plan to travel.

Most visits are trouble-free. Crime levels are relatively low for the southern Africa region, but you should take sensible precautions as there is often an increase in criminal activity during the festive season. See Crime
You should avoid rallies, demonstrations and gatherings as these can be dispersed forcefully by the police.
Although there’s no recent history of terrorism in Eswatini, attacks can’t be ruled out. See Terrorism
