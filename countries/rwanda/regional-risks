Rwanda-DRC border
See advice for the Rwanda-DRC border on the Warnings and insurance page.
Rwanda-Burundi border
Burundi closed the border to Rwanda in January 2024. There might be some tension near the border, as both sides have accused the other of cross-border raids targeting local inhabitants.
Rwanda-Uganda border
Border crossings Uganda have temporarily closed at short notice in recent years. Be aware of the impact that short-notice border closures could have on any travel plans in the region.
Cross-border additional risks
If you’re travelling near the DRC or Burundi borders, be aware of the risk of cross-border attacks and government security operations given the ongoing conflict in eastern DRC.
In recent years, armed incursions have occurred into south-west Rwanda:
on 18 June 2023, 2 people were killed and 6 were injured when suspected militants opened fire on a public passenger bus on Nyamagabe-Rusizi road, in Nyungwe Forest, Nyamgabe District
on 17 June 2023, a Congolese soldier crossed into Rwanda at Gisenyi and fired on civilians and Rwandan security personnel near the border, injuring 2 Rwandan police officers – the soldier was shot dead
in 2022, artillery fire from the DRC hit Rwandan territory, close to the border in Kinigi sector of Musanze District in the north-west
