The New Zealand Government has announced temporary restrictions on travellers in response to coronavirus (COVID-19).
There remain commercial options to return to the UK from New Zealand.
If you live in the UK and are currently visiting New Zealand, you are strongly advised to return now by commercial means. Don’t run the risk of getting stranded.
UK special charter flights will only operate for priority countries where commercial flights are not possible. You should not assume that these flights will become available in countries where commercial routes are operating. Please do not contact the contracted travel management company if no flight is advertised here.
Flights
Airlines that are currently flying to the UK include:
Malaysia Airlines (via Kuala Lumpur)
Qatar Airways (via Doha)
Air New Zealand/Virgin Atlantic (via Los Angeles)
Note that there may be restrictions on transit at these hubs (Los Angeles in particular). You should check travel advice for these countries before booking flights to make sure you are able to transit.
A number of airline operators have announced that international flights to/from New Zealand have been suspended or will be suspended shortly. If you want to return to the UK, take account of the fast moving situation and plan accordingly. However, flight availability is extremely limited. If you have, or can find, somewhere to stay in New Zealand you may wish to consider staying put for the period of New Zealand’s lockdown.
You will need to pay for your return travel to the UK. If you cannot afford travel costs and have exhausted all other options for getting funds, you may be eligible to apply for an emergency loan from the government. This is a last resort option and you would need to repay the loan when you are back in the UK. For more information, you should email CTM at nz.ctm@travelctm.com or call: Tel - 0800 801 818 or 09 529 0888. CTM is authorised to administer such loans on behalf of the FCO.
Travelling to the airport
On 2 April, the New Zealand government announced that foreign nationals in New Zealand can now use public or private transport to travel to the airport, in order to connect with international flights to their home country. Domestic travel must only be undertaken for the purpose of reaching the airport, and you must have a ticket for an outbound international flight before leaving your location.
There are several criteria that apply. See the NZ government’s COVID-19 website for full details. Check details of public transport in Auckland and Christchurch.
Arrival in the UK
When you arrive back in the UK, follow the guidance for when you return to the UK on steps you should take to protect yourself and others.
Visas
If you are unable to leave New Zealand and your visa is nearing expiry, you should contact the New Zealand authorities as soon as possible. See New Zealand Government and New Zealand Immigration websites for the latest information
