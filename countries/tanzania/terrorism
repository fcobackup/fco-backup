Terrorists are likely to try to carry out attacks in Tanzania. Although Tanzania has not suffered a major terrorist incident since the bombing of the United States embassy in 1998, there have been a number of smaller scale incidents. Most attacks target the local security forces, although attacks against western interests are also possible.
Attacks could be indiscriminate, including in places visited by foreigners. Be vigilant at all times, especially in crowded areas and public places like places of worship, transport hubs, hotels, restaurants and bars, and during major gatherings like sporting or religious events. Previous terrorist attacks in the region have targeted places where football matches are being viewed.
Extremists linked to the Islamic terrorist group Al-Shabaab based in Somalia pose a threat across the East Africa region, and are thought to be active in Tanzania. There is also thought to be some support for Daesh (formerly referred to as ISIL). However, many incidents in Tanzania are of unclear origin and may be conducted by criminal gangs.
Although there have been no significant terrorist attacks in Tanzania in recent years, the authorities in Tanzania successfully made a number of arrests in connection to terrorism.
There is a heightened threat of terrorist attack globally against UK interests and British nationals, from groups or individuals motivated by the conflict in Iraq and Syria. You should be vigilant at this time.
