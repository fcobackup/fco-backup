Before you travel check that:
your destination can provide the healthcare you may need
you have appropriate travel insurance for local treatment or unexpected medical evacuation
This is particularly important if you have a health condition or are pregnant.
Emergency medical number
Dial 119 and ask for an ambulance.
Contact your insurance company quickly if you’re referred to a medical facility for treatment.
Vaccine recommendations and health risks
At least 8 weeks before your trip:
check the latest vaccine recommendations for Japan
see where to get vaccines and whether you have to pay on the NHS travel vaccinations page
See what health risks you’ll face in Japan including:
dengue
biting insects and ticks
pertussis (‘whooping cough’)
Altitude sickness is a risk in parts of Japan. Read more about altitude sickness on TravelHealthPro.
Medication
The legal status and regulation of some medicines prescribed or bought in the UK can be different in other countries.
Read best practice when travelling with medicines on TravelHealthPro.
It is illegal to carry some common prescription and over-the-counter medicines under Japan’s strictly enforced law on anti-stimulant drugs. This includes:
Vicks inhalers
medicines for allergies and sinus problems
cold and flu medication containing pseudoephedrine
some over-the-counter painkillers containing codeine
Foreign nationals have been detained and deported for these offences. If you’re travelling with medication, check its status with the Japanese Embassy in the UK.
Healthcare in Japan
Medical facilities in Japan are of a high quality, but treatment is expensive. Expect to pay the whole cost of any treatment you receive.
Medical facilities may check your insurance, which could delay your treatment.
FCDO has a list of medical providers in Japan where some staff will speak English.
There is also guidance on healthcare if you’re living in Japan.
