Travel
The number of domestic flights has been reduced, visitors should confirm with airlines the latest schedule. No visitor may enter PNG except for health workers, flight crew, military personnel or those with a special written exemption. All visitors must self-isolate on arrival for 14 days. If you have travelled to mainland China, a country in the European Union, Iran, South Korea, the United Kingdom or the United States of America, you must complete a 14 day quarantine outside the country before being allowed into Papua New Guinea. There is also a ban on cruise ships and leisure yachts with more than fifteen people on board, on land border crossings between Indonesia and Papua New Guinea, and on sea crossings between the Solomon Islands and Bougainville. The situation may change rapidly. Follow local guidance at all times.
