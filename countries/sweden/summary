In addition, those who need to transit through Denmark in order to return to their place of residence will be able to. However tourists and those the Danish authorities say cannot demonstrate a recognised purpose (residence, work, delivery of goods, transit) to enter Denmark will not be allowed to cross the border. Other countries neighbouring Sweden (Norway and Finland) have also introduced restrictions. Check country-specific FCO Travel Advice for details.
