Restrictions in response to coronavirus
Entry and borders
Starting 15 July, British Nationals living in Morocco, as well as their families, will be allowed to enter Morocco, but the borders will not be open for tourism. Entry to Morocco will be under the following conditions:
Passengers will be required to present (negative) results of a PCR as well as a serologic test for COVID-19 before being permitted to travel to Morocco, with the results dated no earlier than 48 hours prior to departure. Upon arrival in Morocco, passengers will be required to self-isolate at home for 14 days, sign a statement on oath, and download the tracking app ‘Wiqaytna’. British Nationals resident in Morocco will need to present proof of their residency in the form of a ‘carte de séjour’ (residency card).
Ferries carrying passengers will come exclusively from Sete (France) and Genoa (Italy). The same PCR and serologic test requirements, as well as additional sanitary measures, will apply to ferry passengers.
All passengers will be required to make their own arrangements, including for tests, using private clinics as necessary.
British Nationals currently in Morocco will be able to leave Morocco using the same maritime and aerial routes. National airlines will be scheduling for these flights as necessary, please check announcements made by Royal Air Maroc (RAM) and Air Arabia for further information on bookings.
