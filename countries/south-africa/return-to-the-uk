Registering with the British High Commission
The British High Commission is currently gathering information on British nationals who were planning to return to the UK after 1 May. Register your details with the British High Commission.
UK special flights
A programme of ten UK Government-backed special charter flights operated between 9 and 17 April, based on demand from British travellers wanting to return to the UK. No further UK Government-backed special charter flights are currently planned from South Africa.
Embassy of Qatar special flights
The Embassy of Qatar in South Africa in conjunction with Qatar Airways are arranging and offering limited special charter repatriation flights from Johannesburg OR Tambo Airport to Qatar, from where there are currently onward connections to the UK as well as other destinations.
Planning travel on these flights
If you would face a very long road journey to reach Johannesburg, for example from Cape Town, the British High Commission does not recommend you book tickets for these flights. This is because of the difficulties you may have in reaching the designated Assembly Point in time, particularly with a national curfew in effect between 8pm and 5am.
The Qatari Embassy is still working through the process of securing South African government clearance for the flights. You may want to consider booking on to flights scheduled to depart at least 72 hours in the future, so as to allow the Qatari embassy time to secure clearance.
In line with the requirements of the Qatar authorities, you will need to have an onward flight booked to the UK for the same day you arrive in Qatar, and remain at the airport prior to that flight. For further information on travel to or via Qatar, check FCO travel advice for Qatar or ask Qatar Airways directly.
How to book
You will need to book tickets directly, via the Qatar Airways website or by calling +27 11 267 7700.
If you need any more information about the flight, contact Qatar Airways or the Embassy of Qatar in South Africa.
Preparing to travel
You will need to meet at an Assembly Point designated by the Qatari Embassy. You should confirm timings and locations with Qatar Airways
Before you travel to your Assembly Point, contact Qatar Airways directly to check that the flight will depart as stated on your ticket. Qatar Airways are responsible for all bookings
You will need a laissez-passer letter to be allowed to travel to the Assembly Point. The British High Commission will contact you directly to issue you with this letter, after receiving confirmation from Qatar Airways of British passengers booked on these flights
You should wear a mask for your journey home
If you need any more information about arrangements for the flight, contact Qatar Airways or the Embassy of Qatar in South Africa.
Your journey home
The National Travel Health Network and Centre (NaTHNaC) provides advice on how to stay safe as you travel by air.
When you arrive back in the UK, follow the guidance for when you return to the UK on steps you should take to protect yourself and others.
Future options
It is not yet clear when the South African authorities will permit normal commercial flights to operate again. This travel advice will be updated with any information on resumption of commercial flights. In the meantime, you should continue to follow any regulations set out by the South African government during the lockdown.
You will need to pay for your return travel to the UK. If departure options are available but you cannot afford the travel costs and have exhausted all other options for getting funds, you may be eligible to apply for an emergency loan from the government. This is a last resort option only available to British nationals and you would need to repay the loan when you are back in the UK.
Accommodation
Those hotels which still have international guests should remain open until their guests are able to leave South Africa. You should ensure you have accommodation for the duration of the lock down, or until you have a confirmed ticket on a special charter flight.
We have published a list of hotels that have told us they can accept British people. We will keep this list up to date.
You can also ring a national hotline: +27 (0)800 029 999 to speak to a professional who will assess your individual need and advise on next steps.
If you are staying in the Western Cape, you can contact the Western Cape provincial government who may be able to assist in identifying new accommodation, using the following numbers:
