Warning
FCDO advises against all travel to Belarus.

This advice reflects the UK government’s understanding of current rules for people travelling on a ‘British Citizen’ passport from the UK, for the most common types of travel.
The authorities in Belarus set and enforce entry rules. If you’re not sure how Belarus’s entry requirements apply to you, contact the Embassy of Belarus in the UK.
Travel from and to Ukraine
FCDO advises against all travel to Ukraine, including from Belarus.
British nationals cannot currently cross the Belarus-Ukraine border. If you travelled to Belarus from Ukraine and need assistance, contact the British Embassy Minsk on +375 17 229 8200 or send an enquiry using the web contact form.
Travel from and to Russia
FCDO advises against all travel to Russia, including from Belarus.
If you travelled to Belarus from Russia and need assistance, contact the British Embassy Minsk on +375 17 229 8200.
The Russian government states that there are no legal grounds for foreigners (including British nationals) to cross the Russia-Belarus state land border including by road, bus or rail. If you try to do this, you will be refused boarding or stopped at the border.
Events involving Russia are fast-moving. You are strongly advised to check FCDO’s Russia travel advice, which advises against all travel to Russia.
Air travel to Russia
FCDO is not aware of any difficulties for British nationals travelling by air between Belarus and Russia. However, make sure you get an exit stamp in your passport when you leave Belarus. If you don’t, you will not be allowed back in on your next visit.
Make sure you have the correct visas for your entire visit to Russia. You can find more information on the website of the Embassy of the Russian Federation in London.
COVID-19 rules
There are no COVID-19 related travel restrictions for Belarus.
Countries may restrict travel or bring in rules at short notice. Check with your travel provider for changes.
If you test positive for COVID-19, you may need to stay where you are until you test negative. You may also need to seek treatment there.

Passport validity requirements
Check with your travel provider to make sure your passport and other travel documents meet their requirements.
To visit Belarus, your passport must be valid for at least 3 months from the date you arrive.
Children of Belarusian passport holders
Under-16s who do not have a Belarusian passport but have a parent who does, must have a Belarusian embassy or consulate-issued travel certificate to enter Belarus. This applies wherever they were born and whatever other nationality they may have. Parents of children entering on this document should liaise with the Belarusian authorities (State Border Committee, Ministry of Interior and Ministry of Foreign Affairs) to make sure their children also have the relevant documentation to exit Belarus.
Visa requirements
All British nationals (except those entering on a diplomatic or official passport) arriving by air can enter Belarus for up to 30 days without a visa.
The 30-day visa free rules are allowed for British nationals arriving and departing from the following international airports:
Minsk National Airport
Brest
Gomel
Grodno
Mogilev
Vitebsk
If you want to stay longer than 30 days you’ll need a visa.
If you are travelling from the EU to Belarus by car or bus over a land border, the visa-free arrangement does not apply and you’ll need a visa. You can find more information on the website of the Embassy of Belarus in the UK.
If you’re travelling directly from or to Russia, the visa-free arrangement does not apply and you’ll need a visa. You can find more information on the website of the Embassy of Belarus in the UK.
Visas for travelling through Belarus
You don’t need a visa to transit Belarus by air, but the maximum period you can remain airside (in the airport without going through border control) is 24 hours. You must get a transit visa in all other circumstances, including if you are travelling on any regional rail routes.
If you try to transit Belarus in other circumstances without a visa, the border authorities will send you to Minsk to get the appropriate visa. You could also be deported or fined up to 300 US dollars.
Visa-free visits to the Brest and Grodno regions
You can visit some regions of Belarus for short periods without a visa via a land border, including:
Augustouski Canal
Belovezhskaya Pushcha
Brest
Grodno
However, you must arrange your visit and itinerary through a registered tour operator and travel through specific border checkpoints. To do this, you must check information on the Grodno Visa-Free website.
Insurance requirements
When you apply for your visa or when you arrive at the airport or travel into Belarus via a land border, you will need to show documentary evidence of medical insurance to the value of 10,000 euros and funds equivalent to 25 euros per day. This can be in the form of cash, credit card or travellers cheques in any currency. Contact the Embassy of Belarus for full details.
Journalists
If you plan to work as a journalist in Belarus, you must get accreditation from the Ministry of Foreign Affairs of Belarus before you travel.
Registering accommodation
It is a legal requirement for accommodation providers to register any foreign guest staying for more than 10 days in Belarus. Registration will normally be arranged by your hotel. If you’re staying with someone, check that they’re doing this. You can register online (this page may not be accessible from all countries) or with the local police office (OVIR) in the district in which you’re staying. There are fines for not registering in time. Further information can be found on the Ministry of Foreign Affairs website.
Customs rules
If you are carrying more than 10,000 US dollars in cash or travellers cheques, you must complete a currency and goods declaration form. You must do this both when you enter and leave Belarus. The form must be stamped by a customs officer.
You are not allowed to take more currency out of Belarus than you declared when you arrived. Keep your entry declaration forms for the duration of your visit. When you leave Belarus, you will complete a new form, but you must also show the entry form. If you do not, you could be delayed and fined.
