International travel
Flights between the UK and South Africa have largely returned to normal following the Coronavirus pandemic. Be aware that third countries may change their transit requirements at short notice. You should check with your airline to understand their requirements for travel.
PCR (polymerase chain reaction) COVID-19 tests are widely available from private medical facilities and some chemists in South Africa. If you need help finding a COVID-19 PCR test provider you should call The National Institute for Communicable Diseases helpline of (+27) 0800 029 999 for advice on possible testing facilities.
Entry and borders
You no longer need to present a PCR test or vaccine certificate on arrival in South Africa. However, other entry requirements still apply. See Entry requirements to find out what you will need to do before you arrive in South Africa.
If you plan to pass through another country to return to the UK, check the travel advice for the country you’re transiting.
Be prepared for your plans to change
No travel is risk-free during COVID-19. Countries may further restrict travel or bring in new rules at short notice, for example due to a new COVID-19 variant. Check with your travel company or airline for any transport changes which may delay your journey home.
Plan ahead and make sure you:
can access money
understand what your insurance will cover
can make arrangements to extend your stay and be away for longer than planned
