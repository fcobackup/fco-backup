The Iraqi Civil Aviation Authority reopened airports across federal Iraq from 23 July 2020 for all international flights. A suspension of commercial flights remains in force in the Kurdistan Region of Iraq until 1 August 2020. Check with your airline for flight schedules and updated information regarding the requirement for COVID-19 testing for all inbound/outbound flights to Iraq.
A lockdown will be in effect across federal Iraq (excluding the Kurdistan Region of Iraq) from 30 July to 9 August. The British Embassy is awaiting further news on whether the lockdown will have any impact on the airports’ ability to operate international flights.

You will need to pay for your return travel to the UK. If departure options are available but you cannot afford the travel costs and have exhausted all other options for getting funds, you may be eligible to apply for an emergency loan from the government. This is a last resort option and you would need to repay the loan when you are back in the UK.
Your journey home: re-entering the UK
When you return, you must follow the rules for entering the UK. You:
need to provide your journey and contact details up to 48 hours before you’re due to arrive in the UK
are not allowed to leave the place you’re staying for the first 14 days you’re in the UK except in very limited situations (known as ‘self-isolating’)
See also the list of people who are exempt from the border rules.
The National Travel Health Network and Centre (NaTHNaC) also provides advice on how to stay safe as you travel by air.
