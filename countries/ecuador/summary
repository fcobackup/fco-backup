A national transport strike was called on 3 October. The Government of Ecuador has declared a state of emergency, with police and military deployed to maintain order and reopen roads. You should avoid any further demonstrations, which may turn violent, and keep up to date with developments via local media and this travel advice.
Transport remains disrupted across Ecuador following the strike, with most buses and taxis out of operation. Allow extra time to reach your destination and check your routes before leaving. Some access roads to Quito International Airport are still blocked, and a number of domestic and international flights have been cancelled. If you’re due to travel from the airport, you should also check the status of your flight before travelling to the airport. For live updates on all flights, monitor the Quito International Airport and Guayaquil International Airport websites (in Spanish). Live updates on public transport disruption are being published on the ECU911 emergency services website and via their Twitter account (in Spanish). For Quito district, check the Municipality Transport Agency.
