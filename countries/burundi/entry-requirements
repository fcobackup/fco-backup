Warning
FCDO advises against all travel to parts of Burundi.

This information is for people travelling on a full ‘British citizen’ passport from the UK. It is based on the UK government’s understanding of Burundi’s current rules for the most common types of travel.
The authorities in Burundi set and enforce entry rules. If you’re not sure how these requirements apply to you, contact the Burundi Embassy in the UK.
Passport validity requirements
To enter Burundi, your passport must have an ‘expiry date’ at least 6 months after the date you arrive and have one blank page.
   
Check with your travel provider that your passport and other travel documents meet requirements. Renew your passport if you need to.
You will be denied entry if you do not have a valid travel document or try to use a passport that has been reported lost or stolen.
Visa requirements
You must have a visa to visit Burundi.
Applying for a visa
You should apply for a visa online ahead of travelling. Visas are issued on arrival in Burundi. A one-month visa costs $90 which can be paid online or in cash on arrival and is valid for single and multiple entries.
Vaccine recommendations
To enter Burundi, you must have a certificate to prove you’ve had a yellow fever vaccination, due to a risk of yellow fever transmission.
For more details about health entry requirements and recommended vaccinations, see TravelHealthPro’s Burundi guide.
Customs rules
There are strict rules about goods you can take into or out of Burundi. You must declare anything that may be prohibited or subject to tax or duty.
