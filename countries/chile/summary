Around 80,000 British nationals visit Chile each year. Most visits to Chile are trouble-free. Opportunistic street crime can be a problem in towns and cities, and in areas popular with tourists.
On 11 September 2019, in commemoration of the 1973 military coup, marches and demonstrations are likely to take place throughout Santiago. While these are generally peaceful, the local authorities have advised the public to remain vigilant and avoid the following areas if possible, especially after 6pm: Villa Francia (Estación Central); Pudahuel Sur; Lo Hermida; Avenida Macul (in the university district); Jose Pedro Alessandri; El Molino en Puente Alto; La Pincoya; Peñalolén, Grecia, Oriental and El Valle; Población La Victoria; Lo Espejo; Villa Conchalí de Huechuraba; Recoleta (El Salto); La Pintana (El Castillo); and Cerro Navia.
Take care of your personal belongings at all times and be aware of your surroundings. Carry a photocopy of your passport and keep the original document in a safe place. See Crime
