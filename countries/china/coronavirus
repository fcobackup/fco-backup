There is an ongoing outbreak of coronavirus (COVID-19). The virus originated in Wuhan City, Hubei Province, but cases have been confirmed in all provinces of China.
Medical facilities across the country may come under significant pressure. Some are not accepting patients and others have long queues.
The Chinese authorities continue to impose various control and quarantine measures across the country. On 13 March, China issued a new order to ensure compliance with health and quarantine regulations at borders in order to prevent potential outbreaks from imported COVID-19 cases. Refusal to comply with procedures or testing put in place or any attempts to deliberately conceal health conditions can result in being sentenced to up to three years in prison. This applies to both Chinese and foreign nationals.
Travel to Beijing
From 23 March, all international passenger flights to Beijing will be diverted to 12 designated airports in Tianjin, Shijiazhuang, Taiyuan, Hohhot, Shanghai Pudong, Jinan, Qingdao, Nanjing, Shenyang, Dalian, Zhengzhou and Xi’an.
Passengers will be subject to health checks before onward travel to Beijing. Those failing health checks, and those seated close to those who fail health checks may be required to undergo 14 days quarantine where they first landed, before being allowed to travel to Beijing. Please check with you airline before travelling.
Centralised observation
As of 16 March, all people arriving into Beijing from overseas (including those without symptoms of coronavirus) must undertake 14 days of centralised observation (quarantine) at places designated by the Beijing authorities. Those undergoing observation will be asked to cover the fees for their period of quarantine. This announcement will affect all British Nationals irrespective of their departure point.
As of 16 March, local authorities in a number of other cities and provinces, including Shanghai and Guangdong, have also announced 14 days of mandatory centralised observation (quarantine) for people who have visited or transited the UK, France, Germany, Spain, the United States, Italy, Iran, Japan, the Republic of Korea and multiple other countries over the preceding 14 days before arriving in China.
Regulations for arrivals from overseas have changed repeatedly and the number of provinces and cities implementing such restrictions is likely to increase and apply to arrivals from further countries.
There have been multiple reports of British and other foreign nationals being put under centralised observation or under home isolation, including following arrival from other destinations beyond those specified above, for example when travelling on the same flights as arrivals who had recently spent time in the listed countries.
Before you travel, check with your travel operator or hotel for any changes or restrictions.
Other measures
Temperature checks are in place at transport hubs, hotels, commercial buildings including restaurants, and other locations. There is extensive screening of arrivals at airports, with processes in some cases taking many hours, including planes being held on the tarmac for lengthy periods before passengers are allowed to disembark.
Some restrictions are in place on entering and leaving residential compounds, including temperature checks and restrictions on access for non-residents.
There are quarantine arrangements for travel between different parts of the country. Beijing requires those returning to the municipality to undergo 14 days of isolation in their place of residence or in centralised observation. Quarantine is enforced at the neighbourhood level, and procedures vary across neighbourhoods.
The possibility that local authorities impose mandatory quarantine in response to fresh outbreaks is high. You should keep up to date with the latest developments and this travel advice.
There are tight controls on entry and exit to villages and townships across the country, and varying degrees of restriction on movement within every province, and individual cities and municipalities.
Some businesses and many tourist attractions have closed. The Ministry of Culture and Tourism has suspended all tour group companies’ activities to prevent further virus spread.
On 23 January the Wuhan authorities closed all transport hubs including airports, railway and bus stations. Some shops and amenities are closed; public events have been cancelled and Chinese authorities have advised the public to avoid crowds. Travel restrictions are in place across Hubei Province. Due to the severity of travel restrictions and difficulty accessing medical assistance, the FCO assisted the departure of British nationals and dependents via charter flights on 31 January and 9 February.
