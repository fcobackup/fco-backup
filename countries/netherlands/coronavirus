If you plan to pass through another country to return to the UK, check the travel advice for the country you’re transiting.
Be prepared for your plans to change
No travel is risk-free during COVID. Countries may further restrict travel or bring in new rules at short notice, for example due to a new COVID-19 variant. Check with your travel company or airline for any transport changes which may delay your journey home.
If you test positive for COVID-19, you may need to stay where you are until you test negative. You may also need to seek treatment there.
Plan ahead and make sure you:
can access money
understand what your insurance will cover
can make arrangements to extend your stay and be away for longer than planned
Travel in the Netherlands
The latest information on Dutch domestic coronavirus measures can be found on the Dutch government website (in English).
Face masks must be worn on public transport, in stations and on platforms by those aged 13 and over. If you do not wear a face mask as directed, you may be fined €95.
If you’re travelling in a car or other private vehicle, you are advised to wear face masks if there are two or more people in the vehicle who belong to different households.
Children under the age of 13 are not required to wear a face mask.
People are now advised to wear a disposable face mask. The Dutch government advises against wearing fabric masks and homemade masks.
Schiphol, Eindhoven and Rotterdam Airports
All passengers and staff aged 13+ must wear face masks in all areas of these airports.
Ferries
DFDS
All travellers must wear face coverings at check-in, whilst boarding, and during disembarkation. This applies for both foot- and car passengers, as well as freight drivers. On the Amsterdam - Newcastle route, passengers must wear face coverings whilst moving around the ship. Face coverings do not need to be worn when travellers are in their cabins, seated in a socially distanced manner or whilst social distancing on outside decks.

All travellers must wear a face mask during their journey.
Eurostar
All passengers must wear a face mask on board trains, in stations and on platforms. If you don’t have a mask you may be refused travel on Eurostar services.
Public spaces and services
The Dutch Government has announced further reopening of all sectors. A full overview of measures is available on the Dutch Government’s website. As of 25 February, two public restrictions continue to apply. First, wearing facemasks on public transport including at stations and stops, at airports and on commercial passenger transport such as coaches and taxis. Not wearing a facemask as directed may result in a fine. Second, attendance at a large-scale event requires a negative test result. This applies to indoor locations with more than 500 visitors per event and without assigned seating e.g. a nightclub or a live music venue. More information on pre-admission tests is available on the Dutch government’s website.
In addition, the following advice applies:
if you are visiting someone or are planning to go to a busy place: take a self-test beforehand;
if you experience any COVID-19 symptoms, stay home and take a self-test;
if you test positive for COVID-19 you must self-isolate. Anyone who lives with, or is travelling with someone who tests positive must self-isolate, unless they received their booster vaccination at least 1 week ago, they tested positive less than 8 weeks ago, or their employer shows that they are needed at work and meet the conditions of employees in essential business processes. This only applies if they do not have any COVID-19 symptoms. If you are unsure whether you need to self-quarantine, do the Quarantine Check.

COVID-19 vaccines if you live in the Netherlands
Wherever possible British nationals should aim to be vaccinated in the country where they live. We will update this page when the Government of The Netherlands announces new information on the national vaccination programme. You can sign up to get email notifications when this page is updated.
The Netherlands’ national vaccination programme started in January 2021 and is currently using Pfizer-BioNTech and Moderna vaccines. Janssen (Johnson and Johnson) may also be available. British nationals resident in The Netherlands are eligible for vaccination including children over the age of 5. If you are considering a vaccination for somebody in this age group, you should seek medical advice from their local healthcare provider. British Nationals aged 18-65 without a Citizen Services Number (BSN) can also be vaccinated. The Dutch government has issued information on the vaccination programme. If you are resident in the Netherlands, you should receive an invitation by letter or email when it is your turn to get the vaccination.
Find out more, including about vaccines that are authorised in the UK or approved by the World Health Organisation, on the COVID-19 vaccines if you live abroad.
If you’re a British national living in The Netherlands, you should seek medical advice from your local healthcare provider. Information about COVID-19 vaccines used in the national programme where you live, including regulatory status, should be available from local authorities.
If you receive your COVID-19 vaccination in the Netherlands, you can get an EU Digital COVID Certificate from the national authorities. The Certificate proves that you have been vaccinated against COVID-19, received a negative test result, or recovered from COVID-19. It will help facilitate your travel within the EU and, in some countries, you can use it to demonstrate your COVID-19 status to businesses and other organisations.
