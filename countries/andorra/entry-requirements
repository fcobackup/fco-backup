Entry rules in response to coronavirus (COVID-19)

a diagnostic certificate indicating a negative SARS-CoV-2 test result in the 72 hours before arriving in the Principality of Andorra or a negative rapid-antigen test certificate from the 48 hours before arriving at the accommodation
a recovery certificate certifying that the holder has recovered from COVID-19. The certificate must be the original, written in Catalan, Spanish, French or English, in printed or digital format, and must be shown when checking in to accommodation
Tourists aged over 6 who are residents of France, Spain and Portugal and residents of so-called green countries continue to be exempt from having to present any of the three certificates, as per the Recommendation (UE) 2020/1475, as well as those from countries with a test ratio equal to or over 5,000 tests per week per 100,000 inhabitants and a positivity rate of less than 5%.
