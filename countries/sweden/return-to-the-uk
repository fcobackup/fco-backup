British nationals visiting Sweden should be aware that travel options to and from the country are now limited due to coronavirus related restrictions.
The Foreign and Commonwealth Office (FCO) recommends that British nationals that wish to leave Sweden contact their travel operator to make arrangements to do so as soon as possible.
There are limited commercial means to return to the UK from Sweden by air. Airlines are cancelling or reducing significantly their international flights to and from Stockholm and Gothenburg. Contact your airline directly for more information on how your travel plans may be affected and the steps you should take.
