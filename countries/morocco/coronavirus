COVID-19 vaccines if you live in Morocco
Wherever possible British nationals should aim to be vaccinated in the country where they live. As further information is available about the national vaccination programme, this page will be updated. Sign up to get email notifications.
Morocco began rollout of a national COVID-19 vaccination programme on 28 January 2021 and has set a target of 80% of the population to receive their vaccination before the end of May 2021. The Moroccan authorities have issued guidance on how to get a vaccine in Morocco (only available in French or Arabic). The guidance includes information on how you can register if you live in Morocco.
If you do not speak French or Arabic and need support accessing the vaccination campaign, you can call “Allo Liqah Corona” on: +212 (0)8 0000 0147 where English-speaking operators are also available.
You must possess a Moroccan residence card to access the vaccine programme. If you are resident in Morocco but have not formalised this with the Moroccan authorities, you can find advice on our living in Morocco page.
The Medicines and Healthcare Products Regulatory Agency (MHRA) is the UK authority responsible for assessing the safety, quality and efficacy of vaccines. It has authorised the Pfizer/BioNTech, Oxford/AstraZeneca and Moderna vaccines for temporary supply and use in the UK. Find out more about MHRA approval for these vaccines.
British nationals living overseas should seek medical advice from their local healthcare provider in the country where they reside. Information about vaccines used in other national programmes, including regulatory status, should be available from the local authorities. This list of Stringent Regulatory Authorities recognised by the World Health Organisation may also be a useful source of additional information. Find out more about COVID-19 vaccines on the World Health Organisation COVID-19 vaccines page.
