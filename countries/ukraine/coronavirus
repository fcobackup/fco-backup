Entry and borders
With effect from 15 March, foreign citizens who are not residents of Ukraine will not be allowed to enter the country. People returning to Ukraine, via all border points and all means of transport, are currently subject to 14 days isolation under observation – this takes place in specialist centres that have been designated by the authorities.
Foreign citizens already in Ukraine are permitted to leave. However since 17 March, many of Ukraine’s land borders are closed.
No flights are scheduled to operate to or from Ukraine until 24 April. Train and bus services to and from Ukraine are also suspended.
Visa expiry
Where the restrictions on travel and availability of government services mean that foreigners stay in Ukraine beyond the period permitted by their visa-free limit or visa validity, or that they are unable to extend residence permits, there will be no penalties imposed.
Health monitoring
Travellers arriving in Ukraine or crossing the administrative points from non-government controlled parts of Donetsk and Luhansk oblasts and Crimea will be subject to health monitoring on arrival. You should comply with any additional screening measures put in place by the authorities.
Local measures
The Government of Ukraine announced several restrictive measures that came into effect from 12 March, and will last until at least 24 April.

Use of public transportation in Kyiv is limited to critical sector workers. Special routes will be operated and travellers will need to prove that they work in such sectors to board. Kyiv City Council requires passengers on public transport to wear a face mask.
Local buses and trams continue to operate in other regions but may only carry 10 passengers at a time.
From 24 March, Kyiv State Administration requires all staff and customers to wear face masks in all shops, including supermarkets, grocery stores and pharmacies.
