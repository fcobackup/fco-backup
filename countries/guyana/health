Healthcare in Guyana
Medical facilities are very limited, even in Georgetown. There are none in remote areas. Standards of medical practice are low and you should arrange an evacuation for any serious or invasive treatment if possible. Make sure you have adequate travel health insurance and accessible funds to cover the cost of any medical treatment abroad and repatriation.
