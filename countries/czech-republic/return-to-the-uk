There are currently extremely limited commercial options available to return to the UK from the Czech Republic.
If you live in the UK and are currently visiting the Czech Republic, you’re strongly advised to return now. Don’t risk getting stranded.
If you’re trying to get back to the UK and need financial help, see the FCO’s guide on financial assistance.
Flights
International air travel is now limited to Prague Airport, which remains open, but few flights are operating. There are currently no direct flights between Prague and the UK, and indirect flights are limited, may be expensive, and subject to last-minute cancellations. You should check with your carrier before travelling to Prague Airport to see if your flight is affected.
If you are currently in the Czech Republic and want to leave the country, you should make arrangements to do so as soon as possible to ensure departure. A list of flights currently operating, or soon to operate, from Prague airport can be found on the Prague Airport website.
UK special charter flights will only operate for priority countries where commercial flights are not possible. You should not assume that these flights will become available in the Czech Republic because some commercial routes are operating.
You will need to pay for your return travel to the UK. If departure options are available but you cannot afford the travel costs and have exhausted all other options for getting funds, you may be eligible to apply for an emergency loan from the government. This is a last resort option and you would need to repay the loan when you are back in the UK.
For more information, you should contact Corporate Travel Management (CTM). CTM are a commercial partner of the FCO and are authorised to administer such loans on behalf of the FCO.
Road
Starting on 14 May, Regiojet will be operating a commercial service between Prague and London. If you want a seat on this service, you should book it directly with the company.
You are able to drive back to the UK from the Czech Republic. Road travel into neighbouring countries is currently restricted to the 11 designated border crossings listed on the Ministry of Interior’s website. Please check the travel advice in other countries along your route before you make the journey; many countries are asking to see proof of onward travel such a ferry ticket, or a certificate proving you are healthy.
The government has confirmed that foreign tourists already in the Czech Republic will be able to return home.

The National Travel Health Network and Centre (NaTHNaC) provides advice on how to stay safe as you travel by air.
